00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:03.969
 to pointing 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.259
 I understood 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.259
 welcome a chapter more clickair wanted 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.269
 the biologist teach that very casual put 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.510
 park in the best way possible 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.970
 to this I am referring to the design 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.840
 who can see me pri has different icons quotes between backgrounds different dock 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.400
 and this was possible is an application 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.670
 which would seek recovery 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.540
 for this we do not occupy this Wednesday degree 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.690
 Once fulfilled with this requirement we do like this 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.520
 Once inside Syria, we anticipate there will be the Iul lulín in NATO. 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.360
 I stuck very important and what you have to mention is that the application 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.700
 next let's go is darling duke panic sun 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.930
 that is to say that their dome edited by they preferred the aek 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.330
 because very well 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.470
 once you have done in the 20 yo that in the eu this will not be the section of 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.580
 Chile 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.530
 and horses and up to the top of the window 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.530
 and let's say the following 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.160
 one is who described next 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.450
 let's move on the lakers that look like the right side 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.730
 As you can see, a kind of stage appears in the part on the right 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.730
 let's move to the letter tournament 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.320
 and here to the oscar alludes via twitter by 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.710
 one is that we have already found leamos h 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.600
 and once we have already accessed this window I do not know until the part 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.659
 top right on the button that says is 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.129
 we spin 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.539
 in this case it seems very effective because you do not like the prostate prisoner of eta 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.539
 well crystal and they come out of yes 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.059
 the application that gives them seems to be the following 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.059
 because in this case we are going to access it 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:33.299
 koke m 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.009
 the ironic this application is very simple 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:37.279
 as you can see 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.629
 in application to the ceoe to perish 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.759
 for this, long after and if the lines 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.629
 each row is the different configuration 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.359
 the concello installed a good time for the first time not to appear one next 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.399
 day 7 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.069
 configurations 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.709
 which is a finished ballast or very basic configuration 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.080
 that seems like some account all acs ohl sat percent 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.219
 xavi among others 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.679
 but a fence to install more as time goes by 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.139
 as qq women in arms confederations abuin fear very simple 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.769
 It can be done in two ways 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.939
 installing them through the epoc commits the computer 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.029
 by hypothermia installing them by means of syria there yes 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:23.919
 or state of s 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:29.479
 and by the computer through are checked today in st says and so on 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.159
 by kelly the truth is very simple 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.689
 because it is true nowadays it has a quite broad catalog of topics 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.929
 functions and checks for winterthur 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.789
 that the truth is cultures in 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.649
 a very good month is the truth 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.649
 immob completed me 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:52.249
 now like I was going to face with flowers in these is very simple 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.760
 we're just going to click on any kent we want 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.789
 and how can you see it appear a tab that a person or popcorn to 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:03.669
 side of each line that 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:04.850
 let's activate 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.999
 in that way active antros 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.129
 how many options little creations that bouquets 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.760
 and he burned me we did not leave the app the tomato that mind bassols 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.760
 bridge to activate the conferación that we have chosen 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.989
 very simple way to consider current gillette 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.340
 the later is not to accuse the issues through 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.690
 for blind and st 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.979
 or the jumbo acs 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.499
 for you to know 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:34.479
 therefore the most varied circumstances issues walls the bridge 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.270
 has exposed the way they like it most 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.610
 In turn, governing some pages allows us to create the same themes 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.069
 well beforehand that's all any doubt or comment that your 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.279
 coherence not well own in the channel do not forget to subscribe and do not forget 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:52.930
 comment 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.800
 well we do not see in the next
