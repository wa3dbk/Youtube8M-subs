that's very nice with the you know Mac

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.730 
that's very nice with the you know Mac
computers<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.030> experience<00:01:51.740> overall

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
computers is that experience overall

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.010 
computers is that experience overall
even<00:01:53.220> though<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.549> CPU<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.570> stuff<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:54.869> that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
even though the CPU and stuff like that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.200 
even though the CPU and stuff like that
it's<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.320> little<00:01:55.470> bit<00:01:55.649> changed<00:01:56.040> most<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
