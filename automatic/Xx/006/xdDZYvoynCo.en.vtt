 above the banknote a second one 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.970

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.030
 so inserted above the marmot into what 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.430
 this challenge consists of both bar and bar 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.520
 is this you have to bet with yours 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.180
 friends to be able to pull out the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.630
 staple from the banknote and fit it 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.210
 with another staple in such a way 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.880
 to create this, collect the two 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.980
 staples between them and remove them from the 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.620
 machine from all this in less than 60 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.719
 seconds from 60 seconds I have a little bit 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.790
 dragon must be able to do this in 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:05.800

 this is a bet you must succeed at 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.220
 removing the staples is chaining them between 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.000
 of them in this way in less than 10 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.030
 seconds less than 5 seconds less than 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.330
 four three in less than 2 menu 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.000
 less than a second 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.750
 the clips come off and in less than one 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.490
 second they fit each other magic 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.490
 magical bari challenges 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.000
 this is the explanation of the challenge from 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.830
 bar with miss and game staples 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.600
 really very simple to do 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.850
 put the first paper clip in this way 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.180
 and then we have the bill, the thing we have 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:02.660
 3d the well-known here the second staple 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:04.400
 it must be put exactly like this therefore not 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.690
 takes all three layers look 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.710
 see exactly we put the 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.680
 first ok at this point only here 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:18.230
 put the paper clip once put the 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.690
 paper clip is almost automatic 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.880
 simply once ne se 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.400
 correctly the quantities are enough 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.540
 simply pull the staples out 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.850
 they fit together 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.360
 we want to shoot here is some way that 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.960
 they got stuck like this between 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.340
 they have the space of the bar challenge 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.340
 graphite banknotes 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.459
