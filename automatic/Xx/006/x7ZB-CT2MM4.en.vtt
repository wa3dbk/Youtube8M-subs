00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
and the in-camera processing ability

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.560 
and the in-camera processing ability
basically<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.040> can<00:00:11.580> process<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:12.059> picture<00:00:12.450> from

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
basically you can process a picture from

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.450 
basically you can process a picture from
within<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.929> camera<00:00:13.380> using<00:00:13.920> just<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> menu

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460

building with a wide-angle lens and
you'll<00:01:36.840> notice<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.290> goes<00:01:37.470> toward<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.009> it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
you'll notice as it goes toward it it

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.149 
you'll notice as it goes toward it it
gets<00:01:38.250> thinner<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.650> actually<00:01:40.950> cope

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
gets thinner so you can actually cope

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.100 
gets thinner so you can actually cope
and<00:01:41.939> actually<00:01:42.270> adjust<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:43.020> bit

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
and actually adjust that a little bit

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.179 
and actually adjust that a little bit
there<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.320> that's<00:01:43.500> quite<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> clever<00:01:43.860> feature

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
there so that's quite a clever feature

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.010 
there so that's quite a clever feature
to<00:01:44.460> miniature<00:01:44.880> effect<00:01:45.240> you've<00:01:45.659> seen<00:01:45.840> these

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
to miniature effect you've seen these

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.480 
to miniature effect you've seen these
pictures<00:01:46.380> where<00:01:46.530> they've<00:01:46.649> taken<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:47.159> high

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
pictures where they've taken a high

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.639 
pictures where they've taken a high
vantage<00:01:47.790> point<00:01:48.299> looking<00:01:48.540> down<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.500> what

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
vantage point looking down and what

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.139 
vantage point looking down and what
happens<00:01:49.950> there's<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> thin<00:01:50.430> strip<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
happens there's a thin strip in the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.190 
happens there's a thin strip in the

middle that's in focus and the other

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.260 
middle that's in focus and the other
just<00:01:52.530> bleeds<00:01:52.799> off<00:01:52.979> into<00:01:53.220> softness<00:01:53.640> that's<00:01:54.119> an

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
just bleeds off into softness that's an

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.899 
just bleeds off into softness that's an
automatic<00:01:54.390> function<00:01:55.250> before<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.399> after<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
automatic function before and after so

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.429 
automatic function before and after so
you<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.270> bits<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.570> pieces<00:01:57.750> there<00:01:58.049> now

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you can see bits and pieces there now

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.569

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
be able to see those effects there but I

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.870 
be able to see those effects there but I
quite<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> standard<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:19.830> click<00:02:20.099> OK

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.089 
quite like the standard so I click OK
and<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.510> processes<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.050> picture<00:02:22.500> now<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
and it processes the picture now the

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.490 
and it processes the picture now the
thing<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.370> remember<00:02:23.489> is<00:02:23.849> that<00:02:23.940> picture<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.870> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
thing to remember is that picture is a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.020 
thing to remember is that picture is a
new<00:02:25.920> image<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.580> what's<00:02:26.819> called

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
new image it's what's called

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.360 
new image it's what's called
non-destructive<00:02:27.330> editing<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.769> leaves<00:02:29.099> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
non-destructive editing so it leaves the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.070 
non-destructive editing so it leaves the
picture<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.849> you<00:02:29.970> took<00:02:30.239> in<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.450> first<00:02:30.720> place

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
picture that you took in the first place

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.350 
picture that you took in the first place
and<00:02:31.319> creates<00:02:31.890> another<00:02:32.250> one<00:02:32.459> at<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> end<00:02:32.819> so

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
and creates another one at the end so

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.030 
and creates another one at the end so
now<00:02:33.450> another<00:02:34.019> effect<00:02:34.349> some<00:02:34.650> people<00:02:34.890> might

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
now another effect some people might

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.320 
now another effect some people might
find<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> bit<00:02:35.430> cheesy<00:02:35.730> but<00:02:35.910> let<00:02:36.090> me<00:02:36.150> just

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
find it a bit cheesy but let me just

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.620 
find it a bit cheesy but let me just
find<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.630> picture<00:02:36.780> here<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:39.239> works<00:02:39.420> better

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
find a picture here is it works better

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.780 
find a picture here is it works better
on<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> spoons<00:02:40.349> picture<00:02:40.680> I've<00:02:40.799> got<00:02:40.830> now<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.610> click

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
on a spoons picture I've got now I click

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.660 
on a spoons picture I've got now I click

on OK again to go into the menu and I go

on OK again to go into the menu and I go
in<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.540> what's<00:02:46.019> called<00:02:46.290> cross<00:02:46.680> screen<00:02:46.980> which

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
in to what's called cross screen which

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.970 
in to what's called cross screen which
in<00:02:48.450> actual<00:02:48.780> fact<00:02:48.930> isn't<00:02:49.140> representative<00:02:49.860> or

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
in actual fact isn't representative or

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.170 
in actual fact isn't representative or
certainly<00:02:50.280> from<00:02:50.400> my<00:02:50.549> point<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.849> view<00:02:50.910> didn't

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
certainly from my point of view didn't

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.370 
certainly from my point of view didn't
think<00:02:51.299> it<00:02:51.390> was<00:02:51.480> representative<00:02:52.049> of<00:02:52.200> the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
think it was representative of the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.320 
think it was representative of the
effect<00:02:52.709> itself<00:02:53.069> but<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.519> puts<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.819> little<00:02:53.910> start

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
effect itself but it puts a little start

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.780 
effect itself but it puts a little start
this<00:02:54.650> actually<00:02:55.650> all<00:02:55.830> over<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.250> highlights<00:02:56.610> of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
this actually all over the highlights of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.339 
this actually all over the highlights of
the<00:02:56.880> picture<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:57.660> need<00:02:57.810> an<00:02:57.900> image<00:02:58.140> that's

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
the picture so you need an image that's

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.220 
the picture so you need an image that's
got<00:02:58.620> some<00:02:58.829> decent<00:02:59.299> highlights<00:03:00.299> for<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.110> do

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
got some decent highlights for it to do

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.330 
got some decent highlights for it to do
and<00:03:01.380> what<00:03:01.739> I've<00:03:01.829> done<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.010> just<00:03:02.160> put

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
and what I've done is just put

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.009 
and what I've done is just put
everything<00:03:02.549> at<00:03:02.760> complete<00:03:03.090> maximum<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:03.900> it's

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
everything at complete maximum so it's

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.050 
everything at complete maximum so it's
there's<00:03:04.799> eight<00:03:05.010> stars<00:03:05.400> in<00:03:05.610> there<00:03:05.849> there's

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
there's eight stars in there there's

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.030 
there's eight stars in there there's
lots<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.329> starbursts<00:03:06.810> maximum<00:03:07.410> angle<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:07.890> all

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
lots of starbursts maximum angle and all

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.770 
lots of starbursts maximum angle and all
I<00:03:08.099> do<00:03:08.250> again<00:03:08.610> exactly<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.299> same<00:03:09.450> as<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.660> other

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
I do again exactly the same as the other

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.009 
I do again exactly the same as the other
one<00:03:09.989> click<00:03:10.560> on<00:03:10.709> save<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.180> creates<00:03:12.569> a<00:03:12.690> whole

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
one click on save and it creates a whole

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.050 
one click on save and it creates a whole
new<00:03:13.230> image<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.400> should<00:03:14.579> be<00:03:14.730> able<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.880> pick

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
new image and you should be able to pick

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.390 
new image and you should be able to pick
out<00:03:15.180> all<00:03:15.239> these<00:03:15.569> little<00:03:15.900> starbursts<00:03:16.829> yeah

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
out all these little starbursts yeah

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.550 
out all these little starbursts yeah
it's<00:03:17.760> cheesy<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:18.329> it's<00:03:18.600> great<00:03:18.900> fun<00:03:19.140> just<00:03:19.410> have

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
it's cheesy but it's great fun just have

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.870 
it's cheesy but it's great fun just have
a<00:03:19.590> little<00:03:19.799> play<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.130> find<00:03:20.400> out<00:03:20.549> what<00:03:20.700> new

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
a little play and find out what new

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.660 
a little play and find out what new
creative<00:03:21.630> abilities<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:23.040> camera<00:03:23.310> can<00:03:23.459> give

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
creative abilities the camera can give

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.280 
creative abilities the camera can give
you<00:03:23.850> now<00:03:24.359> one<00:03:24.780> other<00:03:24.930> thing<00:03:25.049> that's

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
you now one other thing that's

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.069 
you now one other thing that's
interesting<00:03:25.530> here<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.420> Nikon's<00:03:27.420> very<00:03:27.840> very

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
interesting here is Nikon's very very

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.160 
interesting here is Nikon's very very
clever<00:03:28.290> way<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.620> actually<00:03:29.130> show<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.459> the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
clever way to actually show you the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.300 
clever way to actually show you the
representation<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.530> aperture<00:03:31.950> now<00:03:32.160> if<00:03:32.250> I

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
representation of the aperture now if I

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.340 
representation of the aperture now if I
put<00:03:32.519> this<00:03:32.609> into<00:03:32.790> after<00:03:33.600> priority<00:03:33.989> mode<00:03:34.200> you

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
put this into after priority mode you

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.740 
put this into after priority mode you
can<00:03:34.470> see<00:03:34.709> there<00:03:34.950> if<00:03:35.069> I<00:03:35.160> change<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:35.639> dial<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
can see there if I change that dial the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.629 
can see there if I change that dial the
actual<00:03:37.139> representation<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:38.160> this<00:03:38.310> top

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
actual representation of this top

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.970 
actual representation of this top
control<00:03:39.389> dial<00:03:39.720> actually<00:03:40.410> comes<00:03:40.650> up<00:03:40.799> on<00:03:40.950> the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
control dial actually comes up on the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.580 
control dial actually comes up on the
back<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.430> screen<00:03:42.170> you<00:03:43.170> can<00:03:43.260> see<00:03:43.500> I'm

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
back of the screen you can see I'm

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.629 
back of the screen you can see I'm
flicking<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:43.980> around<00:03:44.190> there<00:03:44.340> now<00:03:44.430> what<00:03:44.549> I'm

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
flicking it around there now what I'm

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.069 
flicking it around there now what I'm
going<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.819> do<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.030> show<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.239> how<00:03:45.900> it

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
going to do is show you how it

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.720 
going to do is show you how it
represents<00:03:46.319> aperture<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.190> can<00:03:47.220> see<00:03:47.549> this

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
represents aperture you can see this

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.670 
represents aperture you can see this
graphic<00:03:48.209> here<00:03:48.569> now<00:03:48.989> what<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.200> do<00:03:49.319> is<00:03:49.500> if<00:03:49.620> I

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
graphic here now what I do is if I

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.870 
graphic here now what I do is if I
change<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.160> aperture<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.760> go<00:03:51.079> and<00:03:52.280> make<00:03:53.280> the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
change the aperture and go and make the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.610 
change the aperture and go and make the
larger<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.840> number<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.200> smaller<00:03:55.230> the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
larger the number the smaller the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.539 
larger the number the smaller the
aperture<00:03:55.769> remember

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
aperture remember

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.390 
aperture remember
if<00:03:56.910> I'm<00:03:57.150> going<00:03:57.630> down<00:03:57.660> now<00:03:58.109> and<00:03:58.319> can<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:58.950> see<00:03:59.190> as

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
if I'm going down now and can you see as

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.599 
if I'm going down now and can you see as
the<00:04:00.120> number<00:04:00.540> goes<00:04:00.870> up<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.709> representation

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
the number goes up the representation

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.879 
the number goes up the representation
