00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.220
 very good everyone I'm secret and today 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.550
 I'm with the frivolity of jmr that is going 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.870
 to do where it's going to help a little to 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.330
 show you a book that has the game 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.269
 It's good, I do not know, it's not like it's on another bus 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.740
 there then saving luminaire 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.890
 The first thing I want to teach is my 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.390
 pokemon team 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.430
 you see that I have a little more weakened 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.500
 several paralyzed are thus several 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.230
 current headdress 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.890
 so well you'll see for the title 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.480
 of the video 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.190
 what we will do to this ship 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.930
 leave to be able to cure me without using 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.170
 objects nor go to any pokemon center 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.809
 we are going to arrest when going to a combat we 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.489
 It would be worth anybody's worth 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.210
 it's also worth matching gator yo 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.210
 any combat 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.899
 It is normal does not matter 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.899
 for combat 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.780
 now you will come challenging a fight to 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.780
 valid tommy 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.409
 I 'm not going to do combat, it's worth the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.700
 that teach the mechanics of 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.700
 of how this bus works 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.170
 with the tone please wait 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:30.560
 so start the fight 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.560
 let's choose to fight 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.590
 cardio base of the touring team 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.400
 You can also go only with one and I 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.870
 first time you play for wifi 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.580
 I selected only one because you have to 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.280
 just come select the first one to 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.030

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.030
 of water 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.860

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.860

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.500
 ahead boom and well then what I'm going to 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.500
 to do because there is no need to fight 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.010
 I will go and be called 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.000
 I liked very much to see this video does not 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.000
 I do not want I do not want 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.180
 what happened a week marked a 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.180
 defeat counter was interrupted the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.180
 communication that gives me equal value 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.860
 and now I'm going to teach you no no I do not want 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:50.790
 that when we have finished for today 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:52.560
 goodbye and tachán have been cured of all 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.940
 the states and they were weakened have been 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.040
 returned to fully recover the health 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.780
 if they were touched by something hurt everything 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.270
 everything cured everything but of blows I've 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.330
 been the pokemon center this because it's 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.820
 because as such and as hundreds pokémons 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.120
 to fight against someone but to 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.500
 cure the game does not return you to the 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.570
 pokemon to how they were but to chop 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.520
 totally cured so you already know if 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.470
 you are in the middle of nowhere with the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.270
 Super weakened pokemon you do not have 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.370
 objects or anything and you do not want to use good 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.410
 Well here is a swimming location 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.880
 or whatever 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.880
 up 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.540
 in the combat area I think it's 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.120
 and here you can challenge a friend 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.740
 whatever it is and as I say it is dark 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.819
 you will do without need of the center 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.590
 pokemon and use objects 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.810
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.959
 served mostly crisis and give like 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.740
 for the league channel if you want and 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.340

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.340
