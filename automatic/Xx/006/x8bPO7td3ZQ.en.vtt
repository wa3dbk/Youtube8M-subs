00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
for a tighter fit so there's no give as

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039 
for a tighter fit so there's no give as
you're<00:01:29.520> working<00:01:29.670> out<00:01:30.060> some<00:01:30.689> people<00:01:30.930> get

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
you're working out some people get

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.899 
you're working out some people get
bothered<00:01:31.380> by<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> actual<00:01:32.280> cable<00:01:32.520> hitting

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
bothered by the actual cable hitting

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.609 
bothered by the actual cable hitting
their<00:01:33.030> neck<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.960> kind<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.200> limits<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
their neck and it kind of limits the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.700 
their neck and it kind of limits the
range<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.950> motion<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.610> me<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.900> actually<00:01:37.259> like

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
range of motion for me I actually like

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.859 
range of motion for me I actually like
them<00:01:37.950> hanging<00:01:38.939> hanging<00:01:39.299> around<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.689> think

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
them hanging hanging around I think

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.270 
them hanging hanging around I think
gives<00:01:40.079> me<00:01:40.170> more<00:01:40.320> flexibility<00:01:40.950> as<00:01:41.040> far<00:01:41.070> as

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
gives me more flexibility as far as

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.889 
gives me more flexibility as far as
movement<00:01:41.579> without<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.180> headphones<00:01:42.329> falling

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
movement without the headphones falling

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.999 
movement without the headphones falling
off<00:01:43.340> now<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.790> far<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:45.000> fit<00:01:45.479> finish<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.350> build

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
off now as far as fit finish and build
