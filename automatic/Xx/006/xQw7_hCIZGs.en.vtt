00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.769 
what I've seen especially Fargo that's
an<00:00:22.920> excellent<00:00:23.519> film<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.300> think<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
an excellent film I think it's one of

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.689 
an excellent film I think it's one of
their<00:00:24.869> best<00:00:25.230> films<00:00:25.769> now<00:00:26.010> what<00:00:26.220> should<00:00:26.490> be

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
their best films now what should be

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.939 
their best films now what should be
noted<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.330> really<00:00:27.869> besides<00:00:28.199> name<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
besides where the TV series actually

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.440 
besides where the TV series actually
takes<00:00:31.740> place<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.579> really<00:00:32.880> has<00:00:33.030> nothing<00:00:33.210> to

that's the case for the show because in

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.850 
that's the case for the show because in
the<00:01:02.370> show<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:03.000> least<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> pilot<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.199> lot

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the show at least from the pilot a lot

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.160 
the show at least from the pilot a lot
of<00:01:05.100> stuff<00:01:05.339> goes<00:01:05.580> down<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.390> mean<00:01:06.630> stuff<00:01:06.990> that

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
of stuff goes down and I mean stuff that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.480 
of stuff goes down and I mean stuff that
just<00:01:07.200> kind<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.130> seems<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:09.090> little<00:01:10.490> stretching

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
just kind of seems a little stretching

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.250 
just kind of seems a little stretching
if<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.240> I'm<00:01:12.330> saying<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.960> honestly

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
if you know what I'm saying but honestly

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.840 
if you know what I'm saying but honestly
I<00:01:13.350> think<00:01:13.500> regarding<00:01:13.979> health<00:01:14.220> factual<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
I think regarding health factual the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.010 
I think regarding health factual the
show<00:01:15.000> actually<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.509> i<00:01:15.600> think<00:01:15.750> that's<00:01:15.900> actually

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
show actually is i think that's actually

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230 
show actually is i think that's actually
quite<00:01:16.320> relevant<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> end

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
quite relevant because really at the end

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.810 
quite relevant because really at the end

need<00:03:31.209> to<00:03:31.239> say<00:03:31.419> is<00:03:31.479> that<00:03:31.540> although<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.930> TV

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
need to say is that although the TV

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.319 
need to say is that although the TV
series<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.829> bit<00:03:33.129> more<00:03:33.310> animated<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:34.000> bit<00:03:34.150> more

series is a bit more animated a bit more

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.689 
series is a bit more animated a bit more
caricature<00:03:34.959> like<00:03:35.139> than<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.919> film<00:03:36.159> I<00:03:36.340> will<00:03:36.549> say

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
caricature like than the film I will say

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.250 
caricature like than the film I will say
that<00:03:36.729> the<00:03:37.000> TV<00:03:37.150> series<00:03:37.359> where<00:03:37.629> that<00:03:37.720> does<00:03:37.870> do<00:03:38.049> an

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
that the TV series where that does do an

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.379 
that the TV series where that does do an
excellent<00:03:38.799> job<00:03:38.949> of<00:03:39.129> capturing<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:39.909> spirit<00:03:39.939> of

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
excellent job of capturing the spirit of

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.170 
excellent job of capturing the spirit of
the<00:03:41.139> film<00:03:41.409> so<00:03:41.799> therefore<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.579> know<00:03:42.729> if<00:03:42.939> you're
