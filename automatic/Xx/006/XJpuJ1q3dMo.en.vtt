00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.570
 to change your car wheel 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.220
 whether it is flat or failing you 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.990
 must first find the 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.269
 emergency route is in the trunk 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.609
 you will also find the jack as well as 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.210
 the key for high schools the nuts of the 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:23.480
 wheel to start with davies is 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.300
 slightly each shot 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.599
 if your wheel is composed of four 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.939
 teams 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.090
 do it diagonally or bolts 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.250
 diagonal 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.300
 here we do not have this problem we 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.300
 have only three teams 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.950
 once you get davis is 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.680
 slightly each spouse bring you and the 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.739
 jack and spot under your car 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.489
 a location indicated by two slats 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:54.550
 who places both crypt then or 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.580
 mill and so lift the 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.580
 car 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.700
 before this action make sure you have 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.070
 well put the handbrake and be on 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:11.130
 a hard surface and flat the tire a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.890
 When you are up, you can finish 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.290
 unscrew each nut if this is too much 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.630
 hard do you get the key to finish 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.600
 unscrewing if that's easy 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.430
 finish it by hand then you can 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:31.590
 removed art or just percent 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.040
 well or and take the news for 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.040
 install 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.000
 it is positioned correctly in lan 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.900
 clench years when the screw 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.900
 put the nuts back 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.410
 if you're on a four-car 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.750
 nuts you will not do as I wanted 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.440
 said earlier it's diagonal and that's 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.440
 offering data 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.930
 revis first went to 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.819
 hand then you will tighten slightly with 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.980
 the key 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.620
 will not force you 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.470
 it will then 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.269
 once this action is taken down 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.269
 the car of the jack 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.849
 once the car is on the ground 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.739
 you can then finish tightening 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:39.299
 bolts would not hesitate at that moment 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:43.470
 to use your foot to squeeze 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.470
 firmly each longer 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:01.090
 and here it is only left to you 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.090
 wish a good road
