00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:50.170 
too much of a mess let's open it up here
and<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.230> looks<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.530> inside<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.750> case<00:00:46.910> okay

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.880 

so<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.449> see<00:00:51.750> rinkie

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
so as you see rinkie

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.389 
so as you see rinkie
I<00:00:52.920> think<00:00:53.219> RI<00:00:53.550> ng<00:00:53.910> ke<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.860> says<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
I think RI ng ke and it says the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.119 
I think RI ng ke and it says the
ultimate<00:00:56.640> experience<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.500> says<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:59.010> an

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
ultimate experience and it says it's an

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.740 
ultimate experience and it says it's an
eco<00:00:59.460> package<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.059> that's<00:01:00.210> why<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.570> not<00:01:00.629> in

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
eco package so that's why it's not in

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.619 
eco package so that's why it's not in
any<00:01:00.960> cardboard<00:01:01.440> or<00:01:01.710> anything<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.070> that

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
any cardboard or anything like that

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.479 
any cardboard or anything like that
let's<00:01:03.629> toss<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.110> off<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> side<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.159> then

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
let's toss this off to the side and then

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.300 
let's toss this off to the side and then
we<00:01:05.640> will<00:01:05.670> take<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> closer<00:01:06.630> look<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.070> case

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
we will take a closer look at the case

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.000 
we will take a closer look at the case
so<00:01:08.549> let's<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.850> unbox<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.479> right<00:01:09.720> here
