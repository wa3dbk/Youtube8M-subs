00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.320

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.640
 V: Dinosaurs. . . 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.748
 Assassin's Creed! 

00:00:22.748 --> 00:00:23.928
 R: But I can't even see what they are. 

00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:24.808
 V: What is this? 

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:26.288
 R: It is a video game, yeah~ 

00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:27.998
 V: What kind of video game? 

00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:29.912
 R: You have to climb up after sitting in the building. 

00:00:29.912 --> 00:00:32.805
 Assassinate people. . That's almost the case. 

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:35.005
 R: God! This costs $140 (US$) 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.840
 R: This is $800! ! ! 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.113
 R: I don't even know who they are, but they are beautiful. 

00:00:39.113 --> 00:00:41.413
 R: This kind of store decoration is full of fun. 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.540

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.900

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:50.385
 R: God! Look at this giant alien! 

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:53.465
 R: There are such cool aliens, but there are Christmas lights in them. 

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:54.740
 J: Really! ? 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.420
 R: It’s flashing. 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.160
 J: It is flashing. 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.780
 R: This is really cool! Someone makes this more special 

00:01:00.272 --> 00:01:02.672
 R: Look at the technology used in this skull! 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.460

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.860

00:01:06.513 --> 00:01:07.793
 R: This is cool! 

00:01:07.793 --> 00:01:10.175
 R: God! Look at the backpack of the Ninja Turtles! 

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:12.793
 R: It is a tortoise shell with turtles on it. 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.420
 R: I know this sign everywhere! 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.095
 J: What is it? 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.960
 R: Star Wars. 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.840
 J: Oh, Star Wars? 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.860
 R: I don't look like a ninja turtle? 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.014
 J: What is this? 

00:01:23.014 --> 00:01:24.214
 R: Teenage Mutant Ninja. 

00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:25.693
 S: Do you want a pizza brother? 

00:01:25.693 --> 00:01:26.793
 Ok, brother! 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.220
 S: I really want to eat pizza now, brother. 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.380
 R: God, this is so cool! 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.133
 R: You can be the protagonist of a show! 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.960
 R: This is really cute. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080
 R: I want to see you wearing a school uniform. 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.580
 J: What! ? 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.340
 R: It will be very cute. 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.740
 R: This is really cute! 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.760
 J: I prefer the more professional one there. 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.673
 J: Do you like these things? 

00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:52.446
 R: Yes, I want my mother to check out our photos. 

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:55.611
 R: See if she will find a very awkward Goethe-style Rachel. 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.900
 R: I tried to see the Evangelion, but I only watched a few episodes. 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.400
 R: But whenever I see these cute models, I want to see more. 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.893
 R: Look, she is a ballerina! Is it right tomorrow? 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.840
 J: Yes, it is Asuka. 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.960
 R: I want her to be a ballet dancer, but I haven't finished reading it yet. 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.515
 J: Is it because she is also red hair? 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.240
 R: I think it should be! 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.080
 J: So I feel connected? 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.840
 R: I am a bit prejudiced. 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.073
 S: An expensive watch. 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.960
 R: Why are there so many watch shops here? 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.710
 R: Jun, do you want to see those watches? 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.650
 S: This is only $39,000. 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.650
 R: (Jun likes the table!!) 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.760
 R: A table for $40,000! 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.120
 R: Victor went running and chatting with the clerk. 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.000
 R: It's a big ice tray! 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.534
 R: What do you want to do with such a big ice? 

00:02:33.534 --> 00:02:36.194
 R: There is an old model for collection, which is above the card. 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.560
 R: Actually, my family has a large collection of retro toys. 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.500
 J: I watched a few movies. 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.360
 J: Yoda seems to be the master of what? 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.370
 I forgot the knife thing 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.940
 J: Lightsaber! 

00:02:55.994 --> 00:02:58.374
 J: Ok, I don't care about the names of those girls. 

00:02:58.374 --> 00:02:59.894
 J: Can you tell me the names of those cats? 

00:02:59.894 --> 00:03:00.714
 R: Luna and Artemis 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.220
 J:哗

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.960
 R: Ok, actually in the US 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.280
 R: When the animation starts on TV 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.353
 R: Most of them are broadcast on the cartoon network "Toonami". 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.000
 R: Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball are like the first two sets of joy 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.586
 R: I broadcast it on that station, and I have all watched it. 

00:03:18.586 --> 00:03:19.924
 J: DBZ. . Oh, Dragon Ball? 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.300
 R: For DBZ, Dragon Ball Z. 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.800
 J:Z 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.080
 R: Not Dragon Ball 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.020
 R: Look at Squal! He is really cool! 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.520
 R: We are now trying to find out the way to go. 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.860
 R: I still have to find Victor, who is very easy to distract and lose. 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.354
 S: Very distracting, often. 

00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:37.394
 R: We are going to stare at him. 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.400
 S: We are going to stare at him. 

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:42.493
 R: Thank you for participating in our Nakano Broadway. 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.920
