00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
other out and I thought something

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.800 
other out and I thought something
interesting<00:01:31.990> might<00:01:32.200> happen<00:01:32.470> I<00:01:33.119> mounted<00:01:34.119> a<00:01:34.210> 600

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
interesting might happen I mounted a 600

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.880 
interesting might happen I mounted a 600
millimeter<00:01:34.960> Nick<00:01:35.560> art<00:01:35.800> on<00:01:36.009> my<00:01:36.149> camera

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
millimeter Nick art on my camera

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.680 
millimeter Nick art on my camera
stabilized<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.070> camera<00:01:39.580> with<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.090> beam<00:01:40.390> back

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
stabilized the camera with a beam back

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.430 
stabilized the camera with a beam back
on<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.410> windowsill<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.460> then<00:01:43.360> I<00:01:43.690> noticed

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
on the windowsill and then I noticed

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.469 
on the windowsill and then I noticed
that<00:01:44.830> they<00:01:45.009> were<00:01:45.070> beginning<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.580> spar<00:01:46.030> and

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
that they were beginning to spar and

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.749 
that they were beginning to spar and
then<00:01:47.350> they<00:01:47.500> were<00:01:47.590> going<00:01:48.009> up<00:01:48.160> on<00:01:48.310> their<00:01:48.490> hind

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
then they were going up on their hind

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.449 
then they were going up on their hind
legs<00:01:49.210> I<00:01:49.709> realized<00:01:50.709> that<00:01:51.009> something<00:01:51.429> very

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
legs I realized that something very

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.790 
legs I realized that something very
unusual<00:01:51.970> was<00:01:52.539> taking<00:01:52.929> place<00:01:53.110> they<00:01:53.500> go<00:01:53.679> on

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
unusual was taking place they go on

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.559 
unusual was taking place they go on
their<00:01:53.950> hind<00:01:54.160> legs<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:54.789> that<00:01:54.970> they<00:01:55.119> can<00:01:55.330> push

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
their hind legs so that they can push

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.050 
their hind legs so that they can push
each<00:01:55.810> other<00:01:56.050> over<00:01:56.560> we<00:01:57.340> call<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.700> image

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
each other over we call the image

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.870 
each other over we call the image
dancing<00:01:58.810> bears<00:01:59.110> it<00:02:00.009> looks<00:02:00.399> like<00:02:00.670> they're

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
dancing bears it looks like they're

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.850 
dancing bears it looks like they're
dancing<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.479> course<00:02:01.509> but<00:02:02.050> that<00:02:02.080> is<00:02:02.229> just<00:02:02.590> what

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
dancing of course but that is just what

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.630 
dancing of course but that is just what
we<00:02:02.890> see<00:02:03.849> we<00:02:04.330> tend<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.810> anthropomorphize

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
we see we tend to anthropomorphize

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.100 
we see we tend to anthropomorphize
animals<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.910> I<00:02:07.450> don't<00:02:07.690> think<00:02:07.929> there<00:02:08.080> is

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
animals and I don't think there is

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.490 
animals and I don't think there is
anything<00:02:08.470> wrong<00:02:08.649> with<00:02:09.130> that<00:02:09.160> because<00:02:09.580> it<00:02:09.970> just

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
anything wrong with that because it just

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.740 
anything wrong with that because it just
confirms<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:12.400> deep<00:02:12.670> bond<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.239> exists

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
confirms the deep bond that exists

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.160 
confirms the deep bond that exists
between<00:02:13.810> humans<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.770> animals<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:16.239> it's<00:02:17.020> a

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
between humans and animals so it's a

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.520 
between humans and animals so it's a
priceless<00:02:17.500> moment<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.550> deliberately<00:02:19.530> composed

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
priceless moment I deliberately composed

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.160 
priceless moment I deliberately composed
the<00:02:21.310> image<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.090> bears<00:02:22.450> would<00:02:22.810> not<00:02:23.020> be

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
the image so that the bears would not be

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.670 
the image so that the bears would not be
in<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.470> center<00:02:24.360> instead<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.630> elected<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.500> have

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
in the center instead I elected to have

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.670 
in the center instead I elected to have
a<00:02:26.709> lot<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.060> empty<00:02:28.060> space<00:02:28.150> on<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.200> right<00:02:29.349> hand

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
a lot of empty space on the right hand

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.699 
a lot of empty space on the right hand
side<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.819> look<00:02:31.030> at<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.300> image<00:02:31.480> now<00:02:31.959> I<00:02:32.319> don't

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
side and I look at the image now I don't

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.010 
side and I look at the image now I don't
just<00:02:33.160> remember<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.819> priceless<00:02:34.090> moment<00:02:34.840> I

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
just remember the priceless moment I

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.910 
just remember the priceless moment I
also<00:02:35.500> remember<00:02:36.160> how<00:02:36.190> cold<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.879> was
