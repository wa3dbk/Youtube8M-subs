00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.510
 I will not go back up shooters I know that 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.730

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:24.100
 Seventh to re-upload shooters but 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:27.400

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.400
 that area 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.820

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.610
 you're very calm, you can 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.660
 There are some triples you can upload 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.360
 here to dance on the balls 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.350
 balls move if we step on them it seems 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.520
 be not 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.520

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.299

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.659
 I want to do with all of you that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.869
 You are the ones, part of that 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.869

 everything will have a reward who gets 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.689

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.700
 your channel will appear if you have a channel in the 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.170
 description 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.110
 and everything you want to put the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.360
 description and why why 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.650
 of what series the series that will be treated 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.120
 Well, he's going to try different 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.400
 videogames that tell me that 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.310
 video games if it can be also with 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.270
 photos and with and with videos that are 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.640
 your to upload them 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.710
 this video game has had in some 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.149
 basketball themed moment in some 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.340
 map or as far as I know in some piece 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.229
 of the campaign there is a basket out there 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.880
 thrown 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.399
 I think there are some fifa football games 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.450
 street there is some basket that also 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.910
 would be worth any video game that has 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.080
 some basketball basket or track 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.580
 Basketball or basketballs 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.870
 even if a player of 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.790
 basketball 2 there has always been 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.700
 videogames of some player 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.459
 basketball so there may be some 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.060
 Any video game that has 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.459
 had a basketball theme then to 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.440
 see if you can tell me that the 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.720
 video game of the same thing many years ago 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.569
 some game that you remember about the crisis 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.489
 they are one of knowing when I am 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.800
 you can also say if you want me 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.380
 You can send photos of video games 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.670
 basketball but that's another series that 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.560
 I want to do many as well as a kind 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.990
 to teach it in the changes that it has 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.750
 had in the basketball games 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.310
 but I want this series that interests me 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.390
 this series I think it can be 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.430
 interesting among all of them, so see what 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.650
 video games have had at some time 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.300
 a piece of basketball in your life and 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.790
 well you know both balls clues 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.710
 baskets or there may even be some 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.490
 game that already had a mini game that is 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.730
 a game inside a game 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.200
 that is me that is the mythical of the 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.780
 parties throw the balls to a 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.540
 basket that moves things like that so 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.310
 you know if you have a video game 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.520
 you know of some tell me for the 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:38.180
 comments or by private message and already 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.830
 look for information and if I find myself 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.360
 you pass a video photo 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.940
 I'll make a video about it and I'll put 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.830
 your channel in the description so 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.010
 I hope that together we will get a 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.380
 lots of places where they have put this 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.630
 themed basketball and nothing else like 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.370
 favorites and if you want more basketball
