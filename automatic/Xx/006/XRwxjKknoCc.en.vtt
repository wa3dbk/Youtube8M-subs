reference images to help you to create a

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.190 
reference images to help you to create a
3d<00:00:06.359> model<00:00:07.309> ok<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.540> preparation<00:00:10.080> to

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
3d model ok this of the preparation to

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.110 
3d model ok this of the preparation to
set<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.620> reference<00:00:11.040> images<00:00:11.580> was<00:00:11.790> done<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.059> the

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
set the reference images was done in the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.890 
set the reference images was done in the
previous<00:00:12.269> tutorial<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.940> now<00:00:14.940> we<00:00:15.000> just<00:00:15.540> create

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
previous tutorial so now we just create

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.670 
previous tutorial so now we just create
a<00:00:16.440> box<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.480> top<00:00:18.480> view<00:00:21.500> okay

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
a box in the top view okay

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.939 
a box in the top view okay
the<00:00:23.369> length<00:00:24.150> segment<00:00:24.900> will<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.050> three<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.800> we

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
the length segment will be three that we

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.650 
the length segment will be three that we
set<00:00:26.130> mine<00:00:26.279> will<00:00:26.400> be<00:00:26.430> five<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.760> hi<00:00:27.150> Simon<00:00:27.359> will

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
set mine will be five and hi Simon will

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.430

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.789 

like<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:56.290> sir<00:02:57.319> so<00:02:58.250> these<00:02:58.549> vertices<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.560> move

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
like this sir so these vertices and move

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.369 
like this sir so these vertices and move
them<00:03:01.010> up<00:03:01.159> to<00:03:01.670> fit<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.690> reference<00:03:03.110> image
