the<00:00:07.680> style<00:00:08.400> tile<00:00:08.730> which<00:00:09.690> will<00:00:09.960> have<00:00:10.110> all<00:00:10.349> the

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
the style tile which will have all the

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.860 
the style tile which will have all the
typography<00:00:11.010> all<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.730> input<00:00:12.150> forms<00:00:12.570> what

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
typography all the input forms what

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.160 
typography all the input forms what
essentially<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.620> elements<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.780> website

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
essentially the elements of the website

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.750 
essentially the elements of the website
will<00:00:16.320> look<00:00:16.500> like<00:00:16.680> I'm<00:00:17.039> making<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.460> input

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
will look like I'm making the input

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.660 
will look like I'm making the input
forms<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.660> submit<00:00:19.380> button<00:00:19.410> wait<00:00:20.400> some

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
forms and the submit button wait some

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.060

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
placeholders defining all the textiles

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.000 
placeholders defining all the textiles
so<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.580> use<00:00:23.760> them<00:00:23.939> easily<00:00:24.090> later<00:00:24.800> now<00:00:25.800> I'm

sign up to my newsletter it's now I'm

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.920 
sign up to my newsletter it's now I'm
cutting<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.350> front<00:01:37.829> end<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> site

cutting up the front end of the site
which<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.110> what<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.680> find<00:01:41.070> development

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
which is what I do I do find development

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.300 
which is what I do I do find development
and<00:01:41.790> sign<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.990> doing<00:01:43.259> some<00:01:43.409> basic<00:01:43.710> HTML

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310

now this is the easiest part of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.139 
now this is the easiest part of
development<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.979> you're<00:01:47.579> literally<00:01:48.030> just

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
development just you're literally just

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.590 
development just you're literally just
coding<00:01:48.689> what<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:50.450> coding<00:01:51.450> it

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
coding what you see and then coding it

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.289 
coding what you see and then coding it
up<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.380> CSS<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:53.070> actually<00:01:53.280> use<00:01:53.610> sass<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.210> in

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
up the CSS I actually use sass and in

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.170 
up the CSS I actually use sass and in
that<00:01:54.530> compiles<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.649> code<00:01:55.890> kit<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.280> gives<00:01:57.060> me

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
that compiles in code kit and gives me

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.219 
that compiles in code kit and gives me
the<00:01:57.329> final<00:01:57.600> CSS<00:01:58.020> file<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:59.820> love<00:02:00.750> using<00:02:00.899> sauce

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the final CSS file I love using sauce

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.429 
the final CSS file I love using sauce
because<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.829> literally<00:02:02.460> lightning<00:02:03.060> fast<00:02:03.439> it's

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
because it literally lightning fast it's

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.089 
because it literally lightning fast it's
better<00:02:04.710> at<00:02:04.799> my<00:02:04.950> workflow<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.000> much<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:06.689> I

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
better at my workflow so much and then I

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.780 
better at my workflow so much and then I
love<00:02:08.099> using<00:02:08.509> colors<00:02:09.509> as<00:02:09.810> variables<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.790> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
love using colors as variables so the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.400 
love using colors as variables so the
red<00:02:12.000> will<00:02:12.239> be<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> certain<00:02:12.720> shade<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.050> red<00:02:13.200> that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
red will be a certain shade of red that

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.850 
red will be a certain shade of red that
I<00:02:13.440> use
