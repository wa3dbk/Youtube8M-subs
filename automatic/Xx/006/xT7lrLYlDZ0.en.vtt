00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
boot it a lower voltage but he just

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.179 
boot it a lower voltage but he just
wouldn't<00:01:18.720> they<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.320> kept<00:01:19.500> erroring<00:01:19.830> on

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
wouldn't they just kept erroring on

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.050 
wouldn't they just kept erroring on

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.560 

yeah<00:01:40.170> 54<00:01:40.590> degrees<00:01:40.860> which<00:01:41.549> isn't<00:01:41.700> too<00:01:41.880> bad<00:01:42.030> they

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
yeah 54 degrees which isn't too bad they

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.240 
yeah 54 degrees which isn't too bad they
say<00:01:42.780> stay<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.200> there<00:01:43.500> about<00:01:43.680> 62<00:01:45.439> you<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.560> do

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
say stay on there about 62 you know do

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.889 
say stay on there about 62 you know do
what<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.399> think's<00:01:47.700> right<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.540> might<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
what you think's right you might have to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.510 
what you think's right you might have to
mess<00:01:49.020> about<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.590> voyage<00:01:49.860> yourself<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
mess about with the voyage yourself and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.859 
mess about with the voyage yourself and
see<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:51.540> yeah<00:01:51.750> I'm

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
see what you can get but yeah I'm
