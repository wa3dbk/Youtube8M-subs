00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.690
 found on the reef there in the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.699
 that door where it usually gets 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.270
 when he comes here on the reef and see 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.189

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.130

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.540
 guys portete 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.620
 good wood does not bring anything from the new dlc 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.750
 but good brings the south regime or a lot 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.730
 I was preventing it and well we have the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.339
 titan glove no plans 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.600
 auxiliaries with 103 strength and 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.280
 we would have increases the duration of 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 force barrier increases speed 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.979
 of melee attacks and increases 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.739
 the recharge speed of the weapons 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.750
 special titan gloves for 13 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.420
 coins we would have the hunter's helmet 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.640
 radar of that penco 13 coins too and 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.350
 106 of force in the impacts of 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.000
 grenades restore the body energy to 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.130
 body more energy for the overcomes the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.050
 kill non-guardian enemies and the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.440
 radar does not disappear when aiming with 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.619
 main weapons this would be the helmet 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.360
 from the hunter 13 coins too 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.149
 we would go through the sorcerer's glove 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.350
 claws will start for 13 coins and 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.670
 we would have discipline 58 and strength 68 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.250
 get gets an additional charge 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.110
 for all the melee charges of 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.700
 sorcerers increases the speed of 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.200
 recharge of special weapons and 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.210
 increases the speed of attacks 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.310
 melee this would be the glove of the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.530
 claws sorcerer will start for 13 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.810
 coins too and we would go through the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.759
 south regime or the automatic rifle by 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.770
 three coins since main vale 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.420
 twenty-three coins and we have half 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.430
 end of each charger causes damage 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.070
 additional and will have a probability of 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.470
 recover health by causing harm and by using 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.049
 zoom this gun shoots slower but 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.850
 cause more damage these would be the two 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.780
 skills that this weapon has this 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.670
 automatic rifle and we see here your design 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.700
 here we have hard bars regimes 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.860
 perfect hard 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.900
 well we would also have around here the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.840
 Exceptional fragment for seven coins 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.819
 strange and we would have the grass of 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.819
 helmet again you are seeing the specks 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.099
 of light that I have to the noise again of 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.930
 helmet does not bring anything else 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.980
 apparently and good if you want to leave in 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.860
 comments if you want me to make a 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.560
 last attempt to get the ram 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.150
 since this man does not bring it and good 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.099
 some motilla so I could 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.319
 get some extra and good to leave the 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.019
 comments if you want if not if as 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.540
 you see no good let's go with the 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.580
 curiosities the telemetries and everything and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.549
 all this to see what you've attracted in 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.160
 this week we would have telemetries of 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.079
 pulse rifles rifle telemetry 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.900
 of explorer and telemetry of 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.849
 perfect sniper hummingbirds 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.310
 would be plasma engine that is blue and 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.079
 bovine emerald that is green too 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.780
 we would have the synthetic refills 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.519
 heavy we get five refills for one 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.340
 strange currency and the exchange of 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.500
 materials as always the subject of 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.350
 the specks of light give us a speck of light 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.690
 for two strange coins perfect here 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.480
 we would have the exchange good and we would not 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.970
 nothing of this new dlc but good brings 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.680
 the hard regime and others that I was 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.090
 writing and well let's see the 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.250
 personal recommendations like all 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.960
 on Fridays we would have the gloves of 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.610
 titan there are no auxiliary plans increases 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.750
 the duration of the force barrier increases 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.310
 the speed of the crows attacks 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.290
 bodies and increases the speed of 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.300
 recharge the special weapons if you go 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.550
 just currency you can let it go 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.760
 now if you want me at least not what 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.470
 I consider these gloves essential 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.120
 considered better is another and other 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.280
 pieces of plan equipment so good 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.380
 three coins that if you go short you can 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.420
 you can save if you want we would have the 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.550
 hunter's helmet by 13 ways too 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.930
 radar once open with the impacts of 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.460
 grenades restore the body energy to 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.040
 body more energy to overcome to kill 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.450
 to non-guardian enemies and the radar does not 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.580
 disappears when aiming with weapons 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.350
 main is a good helmet in pvp 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.440
 comes well for the issue of entering what 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.590
 you will have active and good in tve in the 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.350
 tv mode in raid campaign mode and all that 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.049
 you'll have the super faster so if 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.300
 you can buy them the subject of this case 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.430
 I at least consider that good is 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.420
 advisable to have it we would have it also 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.490
 the claws 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.320
 ankara in sorcerer's gloves by 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.790
 13 coins earns an additional charge for 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.620
 all loads melee 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.940
 zeros increases the recharge speed of 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.670
 special weapons and increases the 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.960
 velocity of melee attacks 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.760
 save if you want if you do not have many 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.900
 coins you can let it pass me so 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.910
 least I do not consider it essential 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.070
 these gloves just like those of the titan 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.890
 considered that there are better gloves and 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.260
 better pieces of equipment so good 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.000
 I at least have it there, not what 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.430
 I use so I do not consider it 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.470
 essential these claw gloves 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.960
 leave face as a weapon we would have the 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.790
 south regime or the automatic rifle for 23 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.640
 strange coins since it is soul 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.080
 main is worth 23 coins in half 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.610
 end of each charger causes damage 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.310
 additional and you'll have more chances 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.290
 recover in health by causing harm and 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.260
 use zoom shot more slowly but 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.720
 will cause more damage to the best rifles 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.730
 automatic so if you can live in 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.020
 possibility bought yes or yes and now 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.690
 with the improvement they will make to the 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.300
 automatic rifles and so on 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.210
 better worth a weapon that you have to have 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.470
 obligated of this southern regime so 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.260
 nothing guys this is what has made us laugh 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.320
 dzul in this week of July 31 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.340
 last day of July the team and the soul 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.640
 that has brought us on this occasion 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.320
 we return with the engrams of helmets nothing 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.270
 good as I said before if you want 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.120
 that last one last attempt 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.800
 video in search of the ram this one that not 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.810
 they finish giving it to me to leave it in 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.030
 comments and if you want good some 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.710
 some specks of light and that could 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.750
 get and we could see to see if 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.580
 we are lucky we are going to throw the house 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.950
 through the window we're going to spend all of 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.350
 the fragments that we have in the specks 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.060
 and nothing, guys, I do not have 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.410
 nothing more to add I hope that I have 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.700
 liked the video that can serve 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.890
 also a little bit of help and 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.020
 orientation the recommendations and we 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.020
 we see in the next video see you later
