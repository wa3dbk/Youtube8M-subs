00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
as I said this is one way where the

as I said this is one way where the
intrud<00:03:20.870> industry<00:03:21.260> might<00:03:21.410> not<00:03:21.620> be<00:03:21.709> going<00:03:21.829> and

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
intrud industry might not be going and

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.539 
intrud industry might not be going and

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
when the when the rain just is dropping

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.630 
when the when the rain just is dropping
when<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.560> bandwidth<00:04:32.920> isn't<00:04:33.070> what<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.490> want

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
basic idea here is that you get a nice

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
the L version this year was actually

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:57.719 
the L version this year was actually
pretty<00:06:42.339> difficult<00:06:42.580> to<00:06:45.119> already<00:06:56.279> and<00:06:57.279> would

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:57.729 
pretty difficult to already and would

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:00.629

to keep using their M and love this
device<00:07:14.649> anyway<00:07:14.979> so<00:07:15.039> we<00:07:15.430> thought<00:07:15.839> what<00:07:16.839> the

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:16.959 
device anyway so we thought what the

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:20.009 
device anyway so we thought what the
hell<00:07:17.139> let's<00:07:17.999> for<00:07:18.999> resurrecting<00:07:19.389> them<00:07:19.749> that's

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:20.019 
hell let's for resurrecting them that's

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:21.689 
hell let's for resurrecting them that's
let's<00:07:20.349> give<00:07:20.529> em<00:07:20.649> what<00:07:20.889> they<00:07:20.919> want<00:07:21.249> so<00:07:21.429> this

let's give em what they want so this

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.179 
let's give em what they want so this
device<00:07:22.300> also<00:07:22.449> has<00:07:22.599> a<00:07:22.899> high<00:07:23.110> level<00:07:23.289> input<00:07:24.009> so<00:07:24.159> we

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:24.189 
device also has a high level input so we

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:26.159 
device also has a high level input so we
can<00:07:24.369> connect<00:07:24.669> authority<00:07:25.179> two<00:07:25.330> together

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:26.169 
can connect authority two together

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:30.509 
can connect authority two together
oh<00:07:26.199> you<00:07:26.319> like<00:07:26.469> that<00:07:26.709> oh<00:07:26.800> yes<00:07:29.129> and<00:07:30.129> other<00:07:30.339> than
