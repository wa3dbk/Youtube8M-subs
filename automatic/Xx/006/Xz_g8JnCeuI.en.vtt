00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.270
 how about friends here I bring you now no 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.960
 a figure but a video of the 5 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.600
 curiosities of vintage figures 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.940
 in fact there are more but I 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.300
 Now I'm going to tell you five of them 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.330
 alright then we start with the first 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.650
 curiosity 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 number 1 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.060
 Sea dragon hate can be 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.060
 place in two different ways 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.240
 in fact the two are dragon of the sea 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.790
 but it has its differences in the photo 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.120
 we see on the left side the dragon of 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.060
 real sea on the right side to the dragon of 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.420
 fantastic sea because I call them from this 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.590
 way well let's go first with the dragon 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.870
 of real sea 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.930
 which is based on the animal of 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.550
 same name that is from the family of 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.000
 native people 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.190
 there we have the sea dragon that 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.739
 they exist in our world 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.010
 now we 're going for the sea dragon at 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.740
 I call it fancy because it does not exist 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.680
 the chrome master designed it from this 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.310
 shape looks like a plesiosaurus 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.310
 all right 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.990
 and even in the box you paint 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.990
 we have in the image 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.200
 to the real sea dragon and not and do not put 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.300
 fantasy hand dragon he designed 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.930
 human kurt 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.300
 that's what what is also 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.500
 interesting 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.300
 is sea dragon is the only one 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.340
 Sea dragon odiel is the only one 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.620
 that can be placed in two ways not 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.000
 there is another or vintage diet 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.000
 who has this option 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.259
 number 2 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.390
 okay now we go with the figure of the 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.420
 patriarch in the back of the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.820
 boxes of leo virgo and scorpio we see a 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.810
 patriarch very different from the figure 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.180
 I present that we know 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.790
 we also see that that patriarch is more 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.239
 faithful to what we saw in the anime you have a 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.400
 tunic shoulder pads are larger 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.099
 has those spikes on the shoulder pads that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.380
 they are longer their helmet that is well 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.300
 done next to the mask and even in 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.580
 one of the photos we see in the part 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.640
 back of the neck that comes out as a 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.830
 kind of hair 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.200
 well band I use only this 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.900
 prototype of the patriarch for photos and 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.730
 nothing else 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.060
 although I would have liked that this 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.250
 patriarch come to light 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.230
 we also have another prototype of 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.170
 patriarch who appeared in the box of the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.390
 golden and in the promotional catalogs 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.790
 this was more like the product 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.190
 final as we see has painted the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.500
 white skewers 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.260
 the final product has them red and I do not know 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.390
 why they changed since the white or 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.390
 would have been better since more like 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.060
 since similar to anime 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.750
 and they also changed the red tunic 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.950
 you will never say we saw the patriarch like this 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.380
 but this red robe is based on the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.569
 tunic that we saw in the manga there I have 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.760
 the image of the patriarch using that 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.720
 tunica 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.970
 in conclusion in the present figure of the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.519
 Patriarch is a combination of 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.549
 manga and anime but it's a very figure 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.110
 quoted and highly sought after by all 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.220
 vintage collectors 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.480
 number 3 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.300
 for those who have the gods 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.790
 warriors in the back of the box 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.180
 we see only the vintage figure at a 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.430
 side and the background to the audouin statue 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.060
 it's not like for example in the saints of 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.730
 gold in that we see pictures action scene 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.260
 with the vintage figures now 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.470
 they will ask why the warrior gods 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.200
 do not have this is that those photos that 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.480
 we see there are based on manga by 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.910
 what do I say this for example we go to the 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.820
 sorrento box and we see in the part of 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.370
 back the photos where it looks when 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.820
 fight with raise or when you are 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.210
 with will raise 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.060
 this does not come out in the anime only what 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.830
 we see in the manga 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.810
 I remember that the child when I 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.389
 They gave a figure of sorrento vi 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.000
 these pictures and I said this when it appeared 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.490
 on TV I never saw it there I had a 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.370
 confusion but already after years I 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.340
 I found out is these these scenes 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.590
 appear only from the manga and as the saga 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.169
 de Ã©dgar only has anime does not have 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.610
 manga is why not that I do not 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.789
 they placed the photos 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.139
 the action scenes of the gods 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:57.870
 warriors next to the bronze saints 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.640
 number 4 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.100
 the figure of the pegasus have two 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.350
 versions this is something that very few 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.950
 they know the first one is the so-called version 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.270
 blue and the second the regular version 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.850
 they have many differences as is the 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.590
 molding of the head that the chest does not 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.710
 It fits well with the shoulder pads the 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.740
 tonality of the plastic parts well 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.030
 there are also differences in the boxes 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.160
 first we will not see the box of the 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.070
 blue version on the side of these she 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.660
 we see the tone of the armor is blue in 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.270
 change in the regular version 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.570
 we see the tone of the armor and the ies 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.600
 white now we do not observe the object of 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.600
 pegaso b2 in the blue version we see that 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.880
 the pegasus head is cut out in 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.830
 change in the regular version 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.950
 we see that the pegasus head is 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.380
 whole as it is how it should be 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.590
 these are the differences we see in 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.020
 box 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.070
 the one of smaller tiraje was the one of the version 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:00.139
 blue and which one you hit or have 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.259
 number 5 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.990
 generally the figures we had 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.790
 they were different from the figures that 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.780
 they appeared 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.780
 in the boxes 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.419
 the photos they showed us in the boxes 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:19.169
 were the prototypes for example there 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.810
 we have virgo 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.960
 making a comparison with the video 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:27.240
 that shows us in the box we see the 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.129
 difference in shoulder pads and in the 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.309
 helmet antenna 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:34.889
 there are also differences in the audio 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:38.590
 we see there that they show us in the box 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:41.590
 his legs are a little more open 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:45.150
 the night of pound also the one that we 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:48.460
 sample in the box has as a base 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:51.950
 there they realize instead in the 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.140
 final product we see that it does not have 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.780
 I think that all the truth does not happen 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:00.170
 I'm sure I do not have the whole collection 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.590
 to go and comparing but if it happens in the 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.590
 most 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.790
 and here the video of the 5 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.960
 curiosities of vintage figures 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.610
 I hope you liked it is the 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.370
 first time I make a video of this 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.550
 kind little by little I will be improving like this is 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.170
 that the future I do other videos 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.330
 similarly good if you liked the age 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.480
 thumb up and share it with your 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.830
 friends and that will help me a lot if 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.350
 you want me to do a topic in 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.960
 specific they tell me in the part of 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.990
 down if you do not like the video do not give me 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.550
 like but never go back to my channel 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.880
 well I say goodbye I'm every will and up 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.880
 the next
