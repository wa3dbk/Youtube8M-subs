00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:10.590
 gps chip face then let's see how 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.460
 By the way, this is the prototype for us 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.460
 not yet final 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.720
 We will see the handlebars if I have time 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.720
 right behind you 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.650
 and if I have her then of course now 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.650
 stayed off 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.850
 reverse lay which makes the 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.680
 brake lights 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.040
 we have 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.040
 dollar 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.660
 si 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.090
 he does not fly people like you see 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.430
 100 good because the whole course 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.950
 is still a prototype and not yet 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.120
 But it's not that bad 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:01.510
 are a few values â€‹â€‹which is really cool 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.790
 Of course that is so many things 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.340
 I do not know have been improved 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.980
 not where to start, for example 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.950
 had a battery holder here the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.780
 battery holds for this is a hold battery yes 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.700
 there too 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.200
 then he has the camera connection of the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.250
 always been knocked off the battery 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:25.980
 here is the connection not even short 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.720
 purely then you have 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.130
 He was here before and was there like that 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.840
 unfavorable then you have here in water 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.980
 who read our article that it 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.370
 this acts the beep and now he is 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.799
 of course very much here on the board 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.660
 cool are the lights and if I am 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.670
 brake then go to that's sooner 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.510
 no matter if they are front or back 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.390
 the lights on 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.959
 and if I fly to the side or crave 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.650
 then they indicate the direction and that 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.650
 when I go to the side 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.980
 then they shine and when I go to the side 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.630
 then if it flash then it has this 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.810
 works antennas but there already 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:15.730
 by the way showed cool video but 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:19.150
 his size and he has now 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.400
 as standard this gps thing works 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.570
 in the prototype not quite so 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.320
 that's why I do not have it now 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.680
 shown what he still has it of course 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.090
 this cool 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:37.680
 Willys jeep face and other propellers 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.080
 they are completely different now 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.910
 otherwise completely made of plastic that 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.710
 means they have at least the times here 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.690
 they have no no metal mother here 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.970
 above but are probably completely off 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.630
 Plastic means that the threads go 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.630
 not broken so fast 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.620
 What else is new? 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:02.039
 the entire motherboard is definite 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.509
 new and very important and that works now 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.919
 already at the prototype of actually 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.880
 not even properly it is sowed 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.849
 I'm still a bit 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.720
 he does not have this flip of the thing 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.130
 that means if i have the gas 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.660
 set to zero 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.560
 then he does not fall out of the sky 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:24.139
 I did this he does not sing 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.150
 just like normal x3 50 per or so 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.099
 what is still necessarily of walter 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.169
 must be made in the whole gps 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.729
 things are not finished yet 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.780
 maybe we can get it a 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.169
 walk a bit 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.150
 yes and the camera will of course be new 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.919
 that is still the old one has 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.139
 any other objective here now 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:48.000
 but the new camera is probably a 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.000
 have sd card slot and one 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.810
 recording function times look still is 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.760
 that does not quite fly so cool 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.780
 new feature has so small here 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.550
 rubber foam rubber girl on the slopes 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:09.080
 altmann Stillich shows that times of 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.080
 do not slip off the shelf so much 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.130
 otherwise much is the same and 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.540
 Of course, the motherboard died 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.640
 that you have here then various 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.590
 connections for these things and here is 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.450
 Also a cutter in the arms 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.070
 so that you can get in there but 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.590
 most can exchange the 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:35.330
 rule let equal the engines are up 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:38.090
 on the color like 2500 kv how to 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:42.580
 example, I rather praise that you 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.580
 Success of their fans have recourse 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:51.050
 people that's just the short preview then 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.610
 let's go right now and join us 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.030
 the flight control from the inside other 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.030
 computer
