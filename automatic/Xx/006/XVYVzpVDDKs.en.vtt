00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.080
 qatar war gamers as they are welcome 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.389
 to this new video where I'm going to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.940
 present unam boxing of the playstation3 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.530
 ultra slim and the comparison with your 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.630
 previous version so let's go with the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.670
 video and I hope you enjoy it so 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.279
 Well, welcome to this unboxing 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.199
 of the ultra slim playstation3 so 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.140
 let's start to open it take advantage 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.699
 that while we remove this plastic from 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.920
 tell him again that if we buy it 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.220
 only because we were spoiled 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.350
 reader that we were using in 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.589
 the other videos so really a shame 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.300
 that from one day to the next this would fail very 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:43.370
 regrettable as that console had 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.370
 some years already or a year approximately 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.740
 and good 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.570
 I was quite advanced so I'm going to 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.730
 have to overcome data and all that in the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.149
 problem 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.720
 for this practical and how can you see the 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:05.320
 console comes as a gift with a workshop 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.750
 three extra so very cool titles and 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.550
 we have 4 hours 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.060
 and it also comes with the god of war 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.280
 collection very well because I did not have it 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.590
 so it's very general so let's go 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.150
 spend these francisco that francisco 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:25.950
 the same help in some things is not 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:33.190
 simply leisure is simply there 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:35.280
 have in 3,250 days we are going to open here 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.280
 above 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.540
 18 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.680
 and well let's show them what it brings 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.560
 first we find the usb cable 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.960
 to load your 8-3 control I'm going to 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.479
 load your hearing aids push rates 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.140
 or halo and while now we have here the 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.140
 mayor of power 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.630
 we also have the video cable that 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.530
 can use the compound a cable the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.530
 yellow 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.930
 and here the control that comes with hooks 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.470
 3 that comes with the console to pass this on 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.470
 to francisco 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.710
 and proceed to take out the console 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.720
 and get the guitar culture out of 65 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.390
 with everything 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.420
 do not forget that brings with nintendo sixty 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.420
 four 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.500
 egg boxes 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.000
 this wrapper that protects your console 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.709
 so you're going on weird stuff though 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.830
 the same will be the line of this here is eternal and 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.810
 now you this part is very easy and that 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.980
 it's a pity that they have returned this 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.230
 material that also had a 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.280
 restriction the first the first 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.750
 Farc version 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.120
 she has on playstation 3 after what 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.120
 yes it's pretty ultra slim it 's pretty 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.519
 much smaller 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.210
 and you can see the console is pretty 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.090
 pretty actually 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.730
 and then see the collections back well 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.980
 it's good now that we have already taken the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.440
 We invite you to your home console 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.050
 compare this version with the version 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.000
 slim good that you have the 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.340
 comparison of both consoles here 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.020
 we have the fair of cilic and the slim the 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.490
 difference is already noticeable enough when 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.430
 you see it at first sight of the design 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.250
 here we have a smooth texture and that 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.230
 It has brightness as if we see it here but 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.060
 has a disadvantage that is scratched 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.910
 pretty easy as if the 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.190
 playstation3 fat the first one too 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.250
 we have this other texture where the 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.620
 part of the blu-ray insertion the 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.440
 which opens by pressing this button as 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.340
 come is a 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.900
 stage that opens horizontally and I 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.750
 gives the feeling that if you can enter 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.760
 dust easier than in this console that 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.130
 it's the negative that I see in this system 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.780
 to insert our game here 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.930
 only you put the game of the 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.040
 part of forward and going to enter 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.620
 automatically with respect to 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.970
 connections are exactly the same 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.780
 we have hdmi network connections 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.940
 optics we have the bird multi out and 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.220
 we have the current cable 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.430
 finally what I have left to compare is 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.430
 how good the ultra slim really is a 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.950
 trans link that is going to occupy much less 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.540
 space they will not notice from that 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.300
 perspective but I must tell you that the 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.550
 ultra slim is a little lower and also 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.800
 takes much less space here they are 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.930
 aligned and as you see the slim reaches up 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.050
 here and it reaches here if it occupies 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.790
 much less space so good that 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.620
 would be the physical comparison of both 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.830
 consoles with respect to the system 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.020
 it works exactly the same but if we go 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.610
 to do an analysis of the console to 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.980
 background so you can see it 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.200
 running in your operating system of 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.540
 playstation so good in conclusion 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.030
 I must say that I like it a lot because 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.460
 it becomes very easy to transport it is much 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.170
 lighter than this but the negative 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.820
 It would be that good as I mentioned 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.400
 previously the tray did not 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.860
 decompensated I feel that it can be damaged 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.740
 much more easily so you have to 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.300
 be very careful when using it in the 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.710
 moment that we are going to insert a game if 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.530
 you have for example nephews 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.849
 little little brothers have to 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.349
 hopefully take care 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.229
 that they put the game that they are going to play 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.520
 since they can unknowingly put 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.770
 the fingers around here and they 're going to hurt 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.509
 superstar so good we 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.089
 we would be seeing in a next chapter 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:54.709
 of world games in a future review of 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:57.020
