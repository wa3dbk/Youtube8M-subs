okay<00:00:09.550> we've<00:00:09.760> been<00:00:09.790> discussing<00:00:10.740> cartridge

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
okay we've been discussing cartridge

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.459 
okay we've been discussing cartridge
fuses

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
fuses

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.100 
fuses
this<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.190> just<00:00:14.580> another<00:00:14.940> form

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
this is just another form

Church<00:00:16.290> fumes<00:00:16.970> now<00:00:17.970> cartridge<00:00:18.480> fuse<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:19.140> come

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
Church fumes now cartridge fuse can come

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.400 
Church fumes now cartridge fuse can come
as<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:20.520> standard<00:00:21.270> fuse<00:00:21.660> we've<00:00:21.960> talked<00:00:22.260> about

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
as a standard fuse we've talked about

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.530 
as a standard fuse we've talked about
that<00:00:22.710> before<00:00:22.770> it's<00:00:23.490> just<00:00:23.610> a<00:00:24.000> single<00:00:24.360> element

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
that before it's just a single element

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.850 
that before it's just a single element
fuse<00:00:25.080> if<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.530> over<00:00:25.770> draws<00:00:26.100> it<00:00:26.430> blows<00:00:27.680> they<00:00:28.680> can

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
fuse if it over draws it blows they can

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.970 
fuse if it over draws it blows they can
be<00:00:29.010> done<00:00:29.190> with<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.490> dual<00:00:29.790> element<00:00:30.300> fuse<00:00:30.980> that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
be done with a dual element fuse that

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.490 
be done with a dual element fuse that
will<00:00:32.370> blow<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.210> there's<00:00:33.510> very<00:00:33.840> excessive

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
will blow if there's very excessive

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.330 
will blow if there's very excessive
current<00:00:36.050> however<00:00:37.050> if<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.470> current<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:37.980> only

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
current however if the current is only

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.369 
current however if the current is only
two<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.000> five<00:00:39.210> times<00:00:39.720> what<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:41.010> rated<00:00:41.430> load<00:00:41.460> is

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
two to five times what the rated load is

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.400 
two to five times what the rated load is
then<00:00:43.379> they<00:00:43.710> will<00:00:43.890> not<00:00:44.129> blow<00:00:44.520> unless<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:46.200> load

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
then they will not blow unless the load

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.850 
then they will not blow unless the load
is<00:00:46.650> on<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:48.020> period<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.079> time<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.410> don't<00:00:49.740> know

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
is on for a period of time I don't know

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.440 
is on for a period of time I don't know
what<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> times<00:00:50.430> are<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.030> they're<00:00:51.180> motor

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
what the times are but they're motor

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.800 
what the times are but they're motor
load<00:00:53.090> fuses<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:55.140> motorboat<00:00:55.920> fuels<00:00:56.510> has<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
load fuses and motorboat fuels has to

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.370 
load fuses and motorboat fuels has to
operate<00:00:58.610> with<00:00:59.610> a<00:00:59.640> dual<00:00:59.940> element<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.810> put<00:01:01.200> a

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
operate with a dual element if you put a

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.860 
operate with a dual element if you put a
single<00:01:01.680> element<00:01:02.010> fuse<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.610> there<00:01:02.790> it<00:01:03.660> will

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
single element fuse in there it will

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.170 
single element fuse in there it will
probably<00:01:04.259> nuisance<00:01:05.100> trip<00:01:05.810> or<00:01:06.810> nuisance<00:01:07.200> blow

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
probably nuisance trip or nuisance blow

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.990 
probably nuisance trip or nuisance blow
and<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.570> use<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> dual<00:01:10.080> element<00:01:10.410> fuse<00:01:11.000> now

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and so you use the dual element fuse now

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.410 
and so you use the dual element fuse now
one<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> problems<00:01:13.050> with<00:01:13.170> these<00:01:14.240> any<00:01:15.240> of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
one of the problems with these any of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.900 
one of the problems with these any of
the<00:01:15.479> cartridge<00:01:15.899> fuses<00:01:16.350> dual<00:01:16.920> element<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.520> not

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
the cartridge fuses dual element or not

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.790 
the cartridge fuses dual element or not
dual<00:01:18.330> element<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:19.050> telling<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.590> they're

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
dual element is telling if they're

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.700 
dual element is telling if they're
broken<00:01:21.080> well<00:01:22.080> think<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.280> window<00:01:24.560> now<00:01:25.560> I'm

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
broken well think out a window now I'm

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:36.320 
broken well think out a window now I'm
gonna<00:01:25.860> show<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.190> this<00:01:26.430> window<00:01:26.820> close<00:01:27.510> up<00:01:35.330> now

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
gonna show you this window close up now

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.580 
gonna show you this window close up now
you<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.960> through<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.710> little<00:01:37.890> window

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
you can see through that little window

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.640 
you can see through that little window
now<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.040> FL<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.299> our<00:01:42.659> 60<00:01:43.500> ID<00:01:45.260> which<00:01:46.260> means

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
now this is FL and our 60 ID which means

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.490 
now this is FL and our 60 ID which means
it's<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.100> time<00:01:47.400> delay<00:01:47.760> fuse<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.840> dual<00:01:49.140> element

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
it's a time delay fuse or dual element

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.800 
it's a time delay fuse or dual element
fuse<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.750> has<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> window<00:01:53.330> now<00:01:54.330> how<00:01:54.750> you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
fuse and it has a window now how you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.260 
fuse and it has a window now how you
tell<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.439> blown<00:01:55.830> is<00:01:56.220> that<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.820> can't<00:01:57.060> see

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
tell if it's blown is that you can't see

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.109 
tell if it's blown is that you can't see
anything<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> window<00:01:58.460> if<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.820> plastic

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
anything to the window if the plastic

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.410 
anything to the window if the plastic
window<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.140> completely<00:02:01.860> obscured<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.909> that's

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
window is completely obscured and that's

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.570 
window is completely obscured and that's
usually<00:02:03.689> by<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.080> spark<00:02:04.590> inside<00:02:04.830> then<00:02:05.400> it's

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
usually by a spark inside then it's

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.109 
usually by a spark inside then it's
blown<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.080> have<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.409> throw<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.680> away

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
blown and you have to throw it away

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.210 
blown and you have to throw it away
there<00:02:09.509> are<00:02:09.720> fuses<00:02:10.350> that<00:02:12.620> actually<00:02:13.620> will<00:02:13.860> show

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
there are fuses that actually will show

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.490 
there are fuses that actually will show
you<00:02:14.280> what's<00:02:14.760> wrong<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.510> mean<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.079> little<00:02:16.200> glass

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
you what's wrong I mean the little glass

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.530 
you what's wrong I mean the little glass
fuses<00:02:17.100> do<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.459> but<00:02:19.489> these<00:02:20.489> cartridge<00:02:21.030> fuses

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
fuses do it but these cartridge fuses

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.830 
fuses do it but these cartridge fuses
have<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:22.019> well<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.350> one<00:02:22.650> does<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:26.599> without<00:02:27.599> a

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
have it well this one does so without a

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.370 
have it well this one does so without a
meter<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.709> can<00:02:28.739> tell

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:40.720 

and<00:02:32.380> that's<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.860> window<00:02:33.160> fuse

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.790 

you
