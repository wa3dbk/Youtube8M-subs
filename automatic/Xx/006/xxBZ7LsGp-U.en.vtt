00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.650
 hello friend today i will tell you about 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.490
 such a pet as a kitty 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:34.000
 kitty can sleep 18 hours a day 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.790
 This means that a nine year old cat is not 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.250
 slept only three years and my life 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.300
 cats surprisingly 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.220
 better than the dogs have a developed sense of smell in 14 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.830
 it's better to hear smells 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.460
 than a man during the first world 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:54.790
 war was even created by a cat detachment 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.730
 Cats that served there much earlier 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.900
 humans could smell toxic gases and 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.470
 save people everybody knows that cats love 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:09.100
 purr did you know that cats can 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.659
 purr very loud almost as loud 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.479
 as a car engine in a special seals 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.360
 illumination for example they are not so good 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.950
 distinguish colors like man and grass 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:27.400
 it seems to them red but cats are very 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.030
 see well in the dark 6 times better than 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:36.690
 man for example like this and dark 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:39.090
 see a man and so cat 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.600
 cats can publish up to 100 different 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.240
 sounds while dogs only 10 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.570
 cats use their feature to 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.250
 hunt they imitate the sound which 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 other animals publish 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.450
 cats have very developed jumping ability 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.220
 can jump to a height of five times 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.940
 taller when cats meow 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.550
 they are trying to talk with you 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.310
 amazing but meowing cats use 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.490
 only to communicate with the person between 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.050
 themselves they do not communicate and when you 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.290
 talk on the phone 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.410
 the code does not see your interlocutor and thinking 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.060
 What you say precisely with him and starts 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.410

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.080
 unique pattern on the nose 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.410
 he is as individual as that 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.750
 human fingerprints 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.270
 seals lick packages and all new for 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.950
 them because it feels new 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.050
 smell and try to taste it 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.350
 cats helped people commit none 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.930
 discovery for example in medicine 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.840
 accidentally knocking over flasks with different 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.470
 substances and mixed them 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.230
 Get it now it is widely used 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.830

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.540
 which mother rubs your wound 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.269
 cats are able to overcome very 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.570
 long distance was known case 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.959
 when, when moving, the owners forgot their 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.350
 the cat and he covered a distance of 3 seconds 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.930
 half a thousand kilometers just went 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.090
 into the house and curled up in his 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.030
 favorite chair 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.510

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.550
 pension benefits 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.020
 For example in Austria cat which 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.350
 guards a grain warehouse 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.560
