00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
here so you guys can kind of see the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.410 
here so you guys can kind of see the
shape<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.570> taking<00:01:55.020> place<00:01:55.200> already<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:57.000> this

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
shape is taking place already and this

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.459 
shape is taking place already and this
is<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.810> create<00:01:58.049> our<00:01:58.110> first<00:01:58.290> set<00:01:58.979> of

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
is going to create our first set of

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.310 
is going to create our first set of
loops<00:02:01.469> for<00:02:01.799> our<00:02:01.950> heart<00:02:02.299> now<00:02:03.299> let's<00:02:03.930> say<00:02:04.110> you're

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
loops for our heart now let's say you're

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.690 
loops for our heart now let's say you're
somebody<00:02:04.710> where<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.340> don't<00:02:05.549> really

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
somebody where you know you don't really

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.160 
somebody where you know you don't really
want<00:02:06.000> something<00:02:06.180> extravagant<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.930> could

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
want something extravagant you could

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.969 
want something extravagant you could
just<00:02:07.439> stop<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:09.259> don't<00:02:10.259> think<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.830> has

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
just stop here I don't think that it has

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.280 
just stop here I don't think that it has
the<00:02:11.190> same<00:02:11.459> type<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.849> appeal<00:02:12.450> if

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
the same type of appeal if

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.679 
the same type of appeal if
you<00:02:13.349> stop<00:02:13.620> there<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.310> I'm<00:02:14.909> going<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.420> keep

all right where we it here we are so I'm
going<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.629> take<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.170> turn<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.950> ties<00:02:41.220> to

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
going to take it and turn that ties to

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.690 
going to take it and turn that ties to
smooth<00:02:41.760> sides<00:02:42.030> facing<00:02:42.329> out<00:02:43.400> bring<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.519> up

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
smooth sides facing out bring it up

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:52.690 
smooth sides facing out bring it up
around<00:02:45.659> and<00:02:45.959> through<00:02:46.879> up<00:02:47.879> around<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:49.049> through

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.629 

and<00:02:53.700> when<00:02:54.540> we<00:02:54.689> do<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:55.079> portion<00:02:55.500> here<00:02:55.919> I'm

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
and when we do this portion here I'm

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.839 
and when we do this portion here I'm
going<00:02:56.909> to<00:02:57.030> actually<00:02:57.209> take<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:58.220> bit<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.250> my<00:02:59.579> tie

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
going to actually take a bit of my tie

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.809 
going to actually take a bit of my tie
and<00:03:00.980> pull<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.069> down<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.400> create<00:03:02.549> like<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
and pull it down and create like a

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.360 
and pull it down and create like a
little<00:03:02.909> loop<00:03:03.329> back<00:03:03.599> here<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:05.040> what<00:03:05.189> I'm<00:03:05.340> going

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
little loop back here and what I'm going

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.539 
little loop back here and what I'm going
to<00:03:05.700> do<00:03:05.849> is<00:03:06.090> actually<00:03:06.389> pull<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:08.010> right<00:03:08.400> on

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
to do is actually pull that right on

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.490 
to do is actually pull that right on
through<00:03:08.939> this<00:03:09.150> piece<00:03:09.450> here<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.019> just<00:03:10.200> pulled

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
through this piece here so I just pulled

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.300 
through this piece here so I just pulled
this<00:03:10.680> bottom<00:03:11.250> loop<00:03:11.430> down<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:13.470> place<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:14.010> on<00:03:14.129> in

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
this bottom loop down and place it on in

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.449 
this bottom loop down and place it on in
there<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:15.290> know<00:03:16.290> for<00:03:16.739> some<00:03:16.889> of<00:03:16.919> you<00:03:17.099> may<00:03:17.430> be

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
there I know for some of you may be

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.339 
there I know for some of you may be
wondering<00:03:17.699> why<00:03:18.150> exactly<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.720> did<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.199> and

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
wondering why exactly I did that and

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.780 
wondering why exactly I did that and
you'll<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:19.799> just<00:03:20.099> a<00:03:20.220> moment<00:03:20.549> because<00:03:20.609> it

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
you'll see in just a moment because it

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.640 
you'll see in just a moment because it
really<00:03:21.090> helps<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.569> reshape<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.019> look<00:03:22.379> of<00:03:22.530> your

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
really helps to reshape the look of your

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.649 
really helps to reshape the look of your
tie<00:03:22.889> so<00:03:23.639> I'm<00:03:23.790> doing<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.120> I'm<00:03:24.299> just<00:03:24.479> going<00:03:24.569> to

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
tie so I'm doing that I'm just going to

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.490 
tie so I'm doing that I'm just going to
lightly<00:03:24.810> pinch<00:03:25.260> off<00:03:25.470> down<00:03:25.769> here<00:03:27.049> and<00:03:28.049> bring<00:03:28.319> my

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
lightly pinch off down here and bring my

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:40.130 
lightly pinch off down here and bring my
collar<00:03:28.799> down<00:03:29.129> with<00:03:29.400> some

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.300 

all<00:03:40.800> righty<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.700> we've<00:03:41.850> got<00:03:42.590> our<00:03:43.590> two<00:03:43.620> sets

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
all righty so we've got our two sets

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.950 
all righty so we've got our two sets
there<00:03:46.130> just<00:03:47.130> like<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.820> in<00:03:48.090> here<00:03:48.480> we're

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
there just like so and in here we're

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.840 
there just like so and in here we're
just<00:03:48.990> going<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> take<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.710> shape<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.310> just<00:03:50.670> a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
just going to take and shape that just a

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.510 
just going to take and shape that just a
bit<00:03:51.020> right<00:03:52.020> around<00:03:52.290> we<00:03:52.590> tucked<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.040> in<00:03:53.430> the

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
bit right around we tucked that in the

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.760 
bit right around we tucked that in the
back<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:55.910> so<00:03:56.910> when<00:03:57.090> we<00:03:57.240> finish<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:58.500> should

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
back and so when we finish it should

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.890 
back and so when we finish it should
have<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.920> very<00:03:59.070> nice<00:03:59.460> Hart<00:03:59.940> leg<00:04:00.240> shape<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.870> it
