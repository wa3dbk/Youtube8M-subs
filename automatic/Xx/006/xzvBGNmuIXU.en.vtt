the current r8 the new chassis out is

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.170 
the current r8 the new chassis out is
also<00:03:11.260> hope<00:03:11.740> it<00:03:11.920> increased<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.580> torsional

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
also hope it increased the torsional

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.990 
also hope it increased the torsional
rigidity<00:03:13.390> by<00:03:14.230> 30%<00:03:14.680> which<00:03:15.190> would<00:03:15.340> put<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.640> car

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
rigidity by 30% which would put the car

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.090 
rigidity by 30% which would put the car
into<00:03:16.330> Ferrari<00:03:16.810> for<00:03:17.110> five-eighths<00:03:17.560> territory
