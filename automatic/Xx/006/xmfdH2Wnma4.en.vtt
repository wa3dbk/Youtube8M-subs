00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
now gaming notebooks which I can use on

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.539 
now gaming notebooks which I can use on
conventions<00:01:57.750> also<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.200> um<00:01:58.469> actually<00:01:59.070> those

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
conventions also but um actually those

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.730 
conventions also but um actually those
are<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.790> places<00:01:59.909> where<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.600> will<00:02:01.110> probably<00:02:01.560> do

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
are the places where I will probably do

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.600 
are the places where I will probably do
just<00:02:02.250> videos<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.270> even<00:02:04.340> more<00:02:05.340> or

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
just videos like this and even more or

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.910 
just videos like this and even more or
still<00:02:05.939> because<00:02:06.299> I'm<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:07.049> man<00:02:07.259> or<00:02:07.500> two<00:02:07.530> men

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
still because I'm a one man or two men

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.229 
still because I'm a one man or two men
so<00:02:08.099> depending<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.489> if<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> colleague

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
so depending on if I have a colleague

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.839 
so depending on if I have a colleague
with<00:02:09.539> me<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.709> helps<00:02:11.069> out<00:02:11.250> for

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
with me and there that helps out for

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.650 
with me and there that helps out for
german<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.270> english<00:02:12.300> videos<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:13.050> that's

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
german and english videos but that's

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.920 
german and english videos but that's
definitely<00:02:14.290> not<00:02:14.440> enough<00:02:14.560> time<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.690> also<00:02:16.690> cut

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
definitely not enough time to also cut

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.020 
definitely not enough time to also cut
