00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 to kill 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.079
 a little bit 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.329
 but 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.740
 and 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.670
 hi my name is andreas nightmare i 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.680
 lead level designer lm studios our 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.620
 the game is connected at once with all the movies about 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.630
 mad max it is based on this 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.870
 the universe but the story in the game is in no way 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.340
 connected with none of the films we had 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.710
 freedom to tell our 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.230
 own story create new 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.150
 characters max of course the main character 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.920
 the universe and its we could not change but 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.740
 everything else is created by forces 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.390
 avalanche studios we are huge fans 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.940
 this universe and we are working on this 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.770
 the game is already a lot of time it's not our 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.960
 first game and in this case we can 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.380
 based on an existing universe 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.880
 to complement it with something of our own but we also 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.480
 must be sure that the fans 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.860
 Mad Max this game will like 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.510
 power its elements can be said 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.610
 branded chips don't have to 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.590
 harpoon rather it is something that you can 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.690
 connect with something else and how to affect 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.459
 physically we use physical 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.720
 engine 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.670
 remembering the previous games of our studio 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.830
 we couldn't just hook here with 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.930
 winch he would not have worked in this world but 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.600
 the harpoon came in handy 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.190
 and it is not necessary to use it 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.860
 as a weapon in battle with others 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.900
 machines also with it you can 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.030
 clearing our way in our game is 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.010
 some mission structure is enough 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.850
 a large number of side quests 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.190
 like convoys 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.410
 but they are optional for 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.760
 passing is not the mission itself 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.890
 present side quests 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.560
 you saw something interesting in the game world 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.620
 go and do the job or not 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.630
 it all depends on your desire but we have 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.060
 there are story missions as well 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.730
 deeper it's not easy to go there bring 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.530
 then they are called to tell a story about 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.530
 max about the game world and the car 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.910
 we are working now in country house in the fireplace 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.400
 trophies game is on stage 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.050
 pre-alpha version but we avalanche studios 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.880
 she always try to do cool 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.290
 achievements for us achivki is good 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.570
 way to reward the player on 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.040
 exploration of the game world and for the player 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.600
 trying to get the most out of this game 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.640
 as far as I know Russian people are very and 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.830
 are very fond of their cars especially 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.200
 oil cars 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.060
 I think that the game will enjoy both and up 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.140
 machines it seems to me that they 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.140
 enjoy the most
