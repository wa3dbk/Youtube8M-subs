00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.900
 will hang on your computer two

 minutes 29 seconds 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.210
 I noticed who should be praised for so much 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.469
 innovative idea i don't know but rather 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.899
 total someone with absolute 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.590
 the unpronounceable name of the jack types for 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.590

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.420
 I decided with him and that images 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.460
 human society damage therefore 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.059

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.670
 some kind 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.550
 And drawn policy here is Catherine did 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.920
 about the threat of infection almost unheard of 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.870
 playing in the background as mournful 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.420
 creativity of the music stud group which 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.220
 will play throughout the game in 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.770
 difference from racers against garena though 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.170
 would not pressure on the nerves dacha show 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.200
 wooden carcass lying on the ground 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.420
 pants and game titles in between us 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.240
 get acquainted with the main character of this game 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.040
 bred after being tattooed 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.439
 Good Friday at the garages 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.540
 hands like an article computer itself 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.630
 zadrota and facial animation done with 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.210

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.799
 a little explanation he's reasonable zones 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.990
 which is currently looking at 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.100

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.890
 Nikasa Safronov 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.930
 although if you watch the heroes of all games 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.170
 of this release were reasonable zombies 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.810
 even racing against gai but here though 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.659
 would the authors honestly make it clear what to play 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.860
 we will have a man without a brain 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.540
 the screensaver is over and the first thing we 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.520
 see it twisted like a bush 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.100
 prolonged sitting at the computer and the fingers 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.009
 what did not try I could not bend 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.780
 we see them because I wanted to bottom 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.240
 bring along a portrait of your loved ones 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.040
 instead our hero for the pack you his 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.380
 dirt from under their nails which are not 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.300
 cleaned for a very long time though what 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.280
 influence zadrotu lineup after all computer 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.190
 it has not been cleaned for so long that of it 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.380
 frescoes 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.690
 dust flies out we continue our journey 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.180
 strength we go into the dining room to have on 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.270
 which someone nableval I gai The decoration 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.040
 similar to the ward madhouse though what else 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.900
 expect from the apartment in which even 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.690
 the fridge won't open or it would 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.490
 nice to nip a beer before going to and from 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.590
 idyllic picture of the city visible 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.810
 built by tajiks here to hold 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.240
 books but apparently hidden behind them 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.040
 stash of booze since they don't take me 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.990
 I do not understand here I will be the whole gameplay 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.910
 consist of wanderings on coarsely 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.770
 painted corridors glass in the door 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.930
 which says that we need a key 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.850
 the owner of the house to the cries of our character 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.220
 as if he is trying to invoke the spirit of em 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.740
 Winehouse though I do not know what can help 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.870
 finally found the office owners what 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.790
 noted jumping with you acquaintance 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.300
 Rabbi had letters to him chief 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.590
 character and pass through the nations 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.800
 than for workers can not give 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.230
 door textures are tight while happening 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.810
 the fact that their brain and their report are special 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.880
 density should be and I think this 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.709
 the game deserves the highest marks 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.930
 so how is the first in the world 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.790
 simulator walking zombies monotonous 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.650
 like songs selena gomez corridors with 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.110
 rare exits to the stairwell 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.850
 which is not enough familiar w inscriptions 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.260
 Spartak Champions Zhigan Loch and Ass 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.290
 though what can sit for this game 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.360
 more than 30 minutes muffling here and groove 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.890
 shoals of selected polish plan then you 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.600
 can admire wonderful 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.760
 cut-scene patrol giving degenerate 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.709
 commando animated transfer style 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.500
 the dolls then stand in the middle of the yard and 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.000
 pop-eyed closed door if you 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.950
 We thought that our character can 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.080
 jump about them and tear to shreds 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.600
 then you are deeply mistaken like this embryo 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.700
 Necromorphs can do nothing but 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.510
 how to fall off the balcony in order to go to 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.580
 the next 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.580
 although he should have done so 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.129
 and finally after the furious 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.879
 our first level need 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:15.249
 We meet the first enemy another camera 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.130
 although it is as hidden as 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:19.840
 camera in the ear chinese 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.519
 but meanwhile she could betray me and 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.039
 eventually exploded like it was beginning 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.840
 explosives are actually the first 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.000
 we have a serious enemy later 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.099
 literally ten meters when us 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.380

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.610
 two cuff drops again and so on 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.340
 throughout the minutes after which our hero 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.500
 the wildest tube begins to he grabs 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.780
 the gun and states it doesn't understand how 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.669
 He works though any what boats 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.840
 who played counter-strike knows how 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.940
 to fire a gun 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.340
 shy about the room trying to understand 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.780
 where to go kicks green green 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.000

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.710
 finds a way out of the same place 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.009
 the doors of someone who has the whole pipe nothing 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.289
 next we have the most impressive 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.770
 cutscene whole game rage frenzied 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.770
 hamster 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.320
 I am in short the situation around the corner waiting for us 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.990
 commando one of which is similar to 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.630
 soloist of group bis and the second on hank from 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.940

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.380
 automaton mp5 and our ward and 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.750
 so many crooked sticks with 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.310
 gnawed nails and I think not 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.590
 explain that this moment of the stage is not 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.200
 passed first tried to run on 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.960
 Sharunu killed me and then tried 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.820
 open the door david throw a box at them 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.260
 note on our character for some reason can not 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.750
 simplify and further two meters so 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.250
 I was convinced why our special forces 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.780
 so pickle they can't even 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.090
 run out of this zakutka 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.770
 about unity we are one for them rushed for 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.230
 fed me lead my ass 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.880
 why did I die safely in all 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.620
 otherwise, they only do what 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.960
 dance around the corner periodically 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.670
 squat down to shit they already 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.220
 it was impossible to do so that my hero 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.180
 could kill them with one blow 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.460
 the result is a gun like that 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.730
 first enemy and order a workaround 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.210
 up to get around them and tried to get around like but 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:22.070
 it's not stuck in the bugs behind the tape to the door 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.470
 towards the end and hearth us just tried 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.210
 creep past them pretending to be a box 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.660
 but since my hero arrived at 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.310
 literally and figuratively, I died 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.610
 on this my patience so far i have removed 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.750
 the game 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.750
 next perhaps
