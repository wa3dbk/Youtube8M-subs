00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi my fellow hobbyists to youtube 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.740
 viewers today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.480
 you make this flower very simple you have 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.630
 only need very little 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.730
 a super nice hair clips 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.440
 what do you need i have a piece here 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.260
 felt 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.800
 have week and I have you six laps 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.410
 from 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.970
 pieces of rest of money do not look good 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.010
 so it's a sticker on that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.560
 not that bad 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.699
 You did n't get raf sitting properly 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.679
 they fall 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.480
 you need more that is called glue gun 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.130
 can also use your technique just what 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.640
 you like 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.960
 ow yes after the flower is about like that 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.300
 great if you cut around you 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.719
 so you have to take that into account 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.309
 my piece of felt more which is approximately 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.760
 roughly small guest rounds 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.850
 who need this school 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.460
 grab a little glue I put in my wall 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:03.390
 from my I stop and then I fold it 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:07.710
 once double and then I can do them again 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.500
 points square under the blood and the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.939
 falcons mark double 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.590
 but you have to give it is sit there 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:19.409
 just push the nice herb well and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.860
 a box a little bit of glue and it 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.860
 being able 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:32.020
 push this way well and later on 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.710
 to dry 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:42.550
 so we do the smaller if you do 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:45.930
 in the middle that gave birth in the wrong direction 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:51.030
 is not doing your job this way 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.030
 this way and they make photo 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.510
 of course and that I was a kick 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.729
 three times fall in total pushing 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.450
 this way 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:23.700
 well now how so six of these plants and 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.200
 record huck season and be pierre 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.780
 look because f what I like best is glue 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.400
 take that course in this way 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.870
 knows aside glues martin dekkers today 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.709
 I'll just do a hefty one 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:43.079
 blob of my left 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:45.439
 then I push him professionally with the women 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.439
 upwards 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.120
 hammer ironwork so as the first team 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.450
 well put to the board actually one 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.450
 goods 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.200
 2 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.719
 is especially important for this technique 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.840
 makes you go all women in lace 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:14.760
 so if you now because you have then I have 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.280
 the roon someone you 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.280
 so half my biggest act so see you 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.280
 a 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.860
 then again the same way not after that 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.050
 point I can do that too but I find myself 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.849
 set up nice trunks in lace 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:35.419
 You will love it more and it will just be very bad 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.419
 heredity 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.009
 no I have them very fast very easy 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.180
 her head is made 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.330
 especially when you start the geyter and 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.199
 economic good sheep moment the chicken 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.470
 not as good as your good dust scissors 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.860
 Apr may have layers in layers 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.860
 adjust a little 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.660
 music is the animal skin then can 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.940
 little bit of lines in between 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.230
 and by product or that way you would 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.870
 do a second layer of inca but me 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.910
 actually like it very much 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.590
 but then another cake and paste this is 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.690
 a few on my clothes that I own 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.450

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.560

 WMO gluing the field badge 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.430
 that I am always new is another 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.660
 extra piece of felt about the game they are in 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.490
 to stick 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.670
 I think I only have the moment 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.950

 packaging I have this one 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.960
 not named clicks with which is increased 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.120
 but normally I stick when I flatten it 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.120
 we pin piece of fabric over one 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:14.180
 this way to push through something on it 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:18.260
