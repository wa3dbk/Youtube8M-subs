00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.050 
the millimeter Nova now the next stage
we're<00:01:16.020> taking<00:01:16.350> all<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.860> Chatham's<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
we're taking all the Chatham's and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
we're taking all the Chatham's and
component<00:01:18.570> parts<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> material<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.560> bit<00:01:19.710> cuts

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
component parts of material a bit cuts

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.920 
component parts of material a bit cuts
and<00:01:20.729> we're<00:01:20.850> tacking<00:01:21.180> them<00:01:21.299> together<00:01:21.420> in

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and we're tacking them together in

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.980 
and we're tacking them together in
advance<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:23.189> being<00:01:23.630> adhered<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
advance of being adhered to the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.620 
advance of being adhered to the
mandrills<00:01:25.380> which<00:01:25.740> form<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.759> shape<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
mandrills which form the shape of the

mandrills which form the shape of the
rod<00:01:27.780> section<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:29.820> we're<00:01:29.970> doing<00:01:30.000> now<00:01:30.240> is

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
rod section so what we're doing now is

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.380 
rod section so what we're doing now is
actually<00:01:30.900> attacking<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.210> assembled<00:01:33.210> parts

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
actually attacking the assembled parts

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.410 
actually attacking the assembled parts
to<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> mandrel<00:01:34.560> using<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> small<00:01:35.490> hot<00:01:35.880> iron

to the mandrel using the small hot iron

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.800 
to the mandrel using the small hot iron
to<00:01:36.630> activate<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> seam<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.860> resin<00:01:38.659> allowing<00:01:39.659> us

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to activate a seam of resin allowing us

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.530 
to activate a seam of resin allowing us
to<00:01:39.840> Alain<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.759> carbon<00:01:41.759> pattern<00:01:42.180> onto<00:01:42.360> the
