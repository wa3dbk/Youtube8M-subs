00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.410
 ah 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.739
 good to marinate the meat in a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.920
 glass container I put the juice of a 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.070
 orange together with the sauce barbeque the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.120

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.020
 Season with a little salt of garlic salt and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.020

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.410
 plus 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.789
 I'm going to mix everything well 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.770
 and then I'm going to add a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.770
 teaspoon of English sauce 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.729
 we mix again and finally I'll 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.759
 to add 3 teaspoons of vinegar 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.759
 apple and mix once more 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.270
 and then let's add the meat we're going 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.950
 to mix again we are going to cover with 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.950
 a plastic and we will reserve it 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.080
 ah 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.490
 good to cook the meat then the 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.380
 can put on the spit or if you prefer 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.710
 can put it in the oven in the option 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.649
 of chicken at high temperature I left it 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.009
 in the oven for about 40 to 50 more minutes 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.009
 or less 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.610
 do not 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.590
 good and that the potatoes we have them 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.360
 we are going to cut them into squares 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.510
 to make it faster to cook 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.820
 let's put the water to boil 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.620
 let's leave with about 10 to 15 minutes or 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.620
 until the potatoes are already tender 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.049
 then we're going to drain them and we're going 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.840
 to return to the pan with the flame low 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:44.489
 let's start to flatten I'm going to add 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.489
 2 butter spoons 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.280
 well then we are going to add the 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.819
 milk let's continue to flatten and for 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.520
 last let's add the garlic salt yo 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.099
 I put a teaspoon and a third more 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.519
 or less and I also put a 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.440
 teaspoon dried thyme last 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.140
 we're going to put a little bit of 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.849
 ground pepper to taste we try it 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.800
 salt if you need we can put a 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.780
 little bit 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.650
 and so we would have the mashed potatoes 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.650
 ready to serve 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.900
 good and that's how we got the meat 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.659
 I accompanied it with the mashed potatoes with vegetables 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.360
 steam and the onion that was left aside 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.099
 when we did when marÃ­n amos the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.170
 meat is also serving together with 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.760
 this with the meat I put it aside 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.470
 but if you prefer, you can 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.989
 put on the meat and they will be left 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.640
 very well so I hope you like it
