00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.720 
five hundred eighty bucks so take that
for<00:02:18.430> what<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:19.060> worth<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.860> pretty<00:02:21.580> much

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
for what it's worth it pretty much

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.390 
for what it's worth it pretty much
mimics<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.510> size<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.110> shield<00:02:23.410> which<00:02:24.040> is

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
mimics the size of the shield which is

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.850 
mimics the size of the shield which is
probably<00:02:24.940> no<00:02:25.390> coincidence<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:26.320> it's<00:02:26.620> three

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
probably no coincidence but it's three

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.610 
probably no coincidence but it's three
ounces<00:02:27.190> lighter<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.630> is<00:02:28.930> awesome<00:02:29.290> you

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
ounces lighter so that is awesome you

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.560 
ounces lighter so that is awesome you
can<00:02:29.860> see<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.130> rainfall<00:02:30.550> on<00:02:30.730> right<00:02:31.060> now<00:02:31.090> so

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
can see the rainfall on right now so

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.320 
can see the rainfall on right now so
we're<00:02:31.720> trying<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:32.020> finish<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.500> up<00:02:32.710> but<00:02:32.920> a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
we're trying to finish this up but a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.820 
we're trying to finish this up but a
three<00:02:34.330> ounces<00:02:34.600> lighter<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:35.050> shield<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.590> think

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
three ounces lighter the shield I think

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.410 
three ounces lighter the shield I think
that's<00:02:35.950> going<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.130> be<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.280> cool<00:02:36.490> thing<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:37.030> heard

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
that's going to be a cool thing I heard

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.390 
that's going to be a cool thing I heard
that<00:02:37.690> they<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.530> reason<00:02:38.890> they<00:02:39.010> put<00:02:39.190> out<00:02:39.280> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
that they the reason they put out the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.220 
that they the reason they put out the
picture<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.790> spring<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.240> they<00:02:40.360> redesigned

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
picture of the spring is they redesigned

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.940 
picture of the spring is they redesigned
it<00:02:41.880> for<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.500> extra<00:02:44.500> pressure<00:02:44.739> of<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
it for the extra pressure of the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.810 
it for the extra pressure of the
9-millimeter<00:02:45.989> apparently<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.380> g43<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.489> built

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
9-millimeter apparently the g43 is built

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.930 
9-millimeter apparently the g43 is built
on<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.120> 42<00:02:49.930> frame<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.890> just<00:02:51.370> beefed<00:02:51.580> up<00:02:51.790> a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
on a 42 frame and just beefed up a

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.790 
on a 42 frame and just beefed up a
little<00:02:52.180> bit<00:02:52.300> for<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.600> 9-millimeter<00:02:53.290> caliber

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
little bit for the 9-millimeter caliber

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.390 
little bit for the 9-millimeter caliber
