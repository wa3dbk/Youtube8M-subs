on<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> inside<00:00:19.880> that's<00:00:20.880> why<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:21.270> called<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
on the inside that's why it's called the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.120

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
at all um this is the best belt I think

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.730 
at all um this is the best belt I think
on<00:06:24.610> the<00:06:24.700> market<00:06:25.090> especially<00:06:25.960> in<00:06:26.470> the<00:06:26.530> price

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
on the market especially in the price

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.310 
on the market especially in the price
range<00:06:26.770> it's<00:06:27.280> in<00:06:27.460> and<00:06:27.760> hsgi<00:06:28.660> really<00:06:28.990> hit<00:06:29.140> home

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
range it's in and hsgi really hit home

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.650 
range it's in and hsgi really hit home
run<00:06:29.590> with<00:06:29.800> this<00:06:29.979> in<00:06:30.220> my<00:06:30.550> opinion<00:06:31.000> because<00:06:31.450> of

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
run with this in my opinion because of

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.390 
run with this in my opinion because of
different<00:06:31.930> colors<00:06:32.320> you're<00:06:33.070> not<00:06:33.160> looking<00:06:33.370> for

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
different colors you're not looking for

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.860 
different colors you're not looking for
the<00:06:33.550> multi<00:06:33.880> can

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
the multi can

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.950 
the multi can
other<00:06:35.230> colors<00:06:35.560> available<00:06:36.510> pretty<00:06:37.510> much<00:06:37.600> to

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
other colors available pretty much to

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.990 
other colors available pretty much to
round<00:06:38.680> out<00:06:38.830> what<00:06:38.980> their<00:06:39.130> lineup<00:06:39.520> is<00:06:39.670> on<00:06:39.910> the

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
round out what their lineup is on the

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.580 
round out what their lineup is on the
pouches<00:06:40.210> they<00:06:40.450> have<00:06:40.690> the<00:06:40.750> same<00:06:40.900> colors<00:06:41.290> for

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
pouches they have the same colors for

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.480 
pouches they have the same colors for
the<00:06:41.740> the<00:06:42.070> belt<00:06:42.280> I<00:06:42.550> think<00:06:43.270> for<00:06:43.630> the<00:06:43.690> most<00:06:43.810> part

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
the the belt I think for the most part

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.160 
the the belt I think for the most part
but<00:06:45.490> it<00:06:45.880> gets<00:06:46.210> the<00:06:46.360> job<00:06:46.570> done<00:06:46.630> they<00:06:47.080> have

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.170 
but it gets the job done they have

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.260 
but it gets the job done they have
different<00:06:47.500> sizes<00:06:47.710> obviously<00:06:48.100> to<00:06:48.820> accommodate

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
different sizes obviously to accommodate

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.250 
different sizes obviously to accommodate
different<00:06:49.300> people<00:06:49.960> and<00:06:50.430> sizes<00:06:51.430> people<00:06:51.760> are

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
different people and sizes people are

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.650 
different people and sizes people are
but<00:06:53.260> they're<00:06:53.560> made<00:06:53.680> very<00:06:53.920> well<00:06:53.980> and<00:06:54.600> you<00:06:55.600> know

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660
