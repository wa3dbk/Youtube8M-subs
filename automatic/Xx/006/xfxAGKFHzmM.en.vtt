00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.500
 sad 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.600
 not only will it help to give you a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.970
 longer way but it's going to 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.979
 raise my eye my look the next 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.350
 shadow is this adhara is a tone 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.659
 purple grape slightly satiny is not 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.340
 shimmer is not very bright with much 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.340
 Frost this serial is batch 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.850
 is applying it with a flat brush and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.340
 I'm going to put it here on my eyelid 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.590
 mobile paying attention here in the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.659
 lacrimal seeing everything here in the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.759
 birth of lashes that is not left 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.350
 no space without shadow when the 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.340
 same brush I will start to blur 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.830
 the edge 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.730
 just giving it the form 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.320
 angled informs d &amp; b and again with the 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.770
 brush long ago I will start to 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.770
 blur 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.150
 I like this brush because as it 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.550
 can account is thin is not 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.260
 too wide 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.140
 and depending on how I do it 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.180
 place in my eye is the precision that goes 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.510
 to have obviously if I put it 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.000
 in this vertical way 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.709
 will extend the shadow much more and not 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.709
 is what I want on this occasion because of that 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.269
 I keep it horizontal for 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.470
 that the color is well concentrated here 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.870
 in the basin 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.360
 now I'm going to use a pigment between 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.850
 the lille and pink is this mix has 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.780
 a pretty nice reflection is the number 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.000
 06 gods looks like this and to apply it I'm going to 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.370
 use the English dollar line I'm going to 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.390
 place a droplet on the lid of the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.340
 pigment and with a brush for concealer 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.680
 I will make the bristles and I will take a 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.810
 little of the pigment and what it should be 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.810
 apply it in the center of my eyelid 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.340
 make a thin stroke I do not want to cover 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.930
 too much the shadow of adhara 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.670
 I'm going to clean the brush a little 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.349
 just so it's not so wet 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.069
 I'm going to take it dry pigment 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:10.030
 very little what you want to seal it 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.469
 and start blurring the edges 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.400
 dragging the color towards the shadow 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:17.280
 dwelling 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.349
 both on the left and the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.439
 right if you notice that they covered a lot 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.209
 shadow will give you can replicate again or 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.579
 just to help yourself to a better 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.500
 blurred and you do not see so many cuts 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.659
 now I'm going to take this eyeliner in 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.310
 skin tone and he wants it will illuminate here 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.849
 the arch of my eyebrows is going to be a piece 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.849
 thin 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.120
 and I'm going to blur it quickly with my 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.480
 finger because these eyeliners have 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.700
 a lot of fixing 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.260
 and now with the vanilla shadow of visu and 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.629
 a brush to blend thin 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.689
 I'm going to take a little and I'm going to dream here 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.230
 the eyeliner and finish illuminating the 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.599
 arch of my eyebrows 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.970
 now with this urbani delineator that 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.720
 it's a purple tone I'm going to delineate the root 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.720
 in my lower lashes 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.340
 in our area 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.530
 or I charge that I want the tone to be 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.560
 purple and with a brush of short bristles 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.240
 and I'm going to take a little more of the 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.790
 shadow of adhara and with it I will close 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.130
 my eyeliner and I will also take advantage 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.350
 to blur I'm going to tilt 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.630
 slightly the brush so it is not 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.830
 so thin if you can give an account and it's 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.379
 very thin 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.539
 will be the same width as from 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.750
 line of the stroke because what you want is 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.580
 lower it a little bit more 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.080
 Now let's continue with the outline 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.720
 here the color is optional 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.790
 I'm going to use this electric blue 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.800
 nix is ​​a liquid eyeliner if you 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.110
 complicated to get knicks I can 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.820
 replace with this same visu plugin 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.530

 of line and the upper water line and 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.840
 the lower one I also went ahead 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.310
