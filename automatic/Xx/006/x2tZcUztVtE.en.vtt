00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.710
 so merry christmas in advance 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.120
 and then so here are these holidays of 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.040
 christmas a lot of people at risk of having 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.120
 fifa and so challenge the ultimate mode 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.860
 team why not so I'll try 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.320
 to teach you how well started 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.079
 in this game mode so here is for 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.070
 understand this game mode to be able to 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.960
 well started in this game mode you have to 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.579
 already have understood well have well 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.570
 including the collective so I have it 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.860
 that's why I do not have you 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.600
 show so at first it was going to have 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.850
 an animation it'll be a real hervÃ© 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.469
 mathoux who will explain to you how that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.180
 is going a little bit wrong chementi 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.100
 so you're going to have to choose a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.020
 captain but that's really not good 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.910
 serve you very much it's going to be 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.979
 your first game and look there he goes 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.590
 you learn how to manage the collective so 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.619
 you know maybe he go there the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.960
 orange links blue links link to 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.549
 sorry link to flank and links 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.670
 red so he a red brings 02 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.369
 collective the orange links brings a 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.729
 collective the links to brings two 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.470
 collective and strong links matters 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.790
 3-2 collective here is where you are 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.890
 go play the game I pass it 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.090
 because here is this year in 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.710
 this one can pass the match and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.720
 still have 500 water credits to do 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.150
 which was not possible in the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.500
 other fifa so here we go to see our 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.790
 pack 2 the first starter pack 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.950
 offered so this year there is going to be 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.420
 three gold players offered what was 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.040
 not present in other ifa so this 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.479
 who is really going to have you at the beginning 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.280
 especially that his gold players before had 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.020
 seven contracts this year they have 45 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.240
 so you want to see that could do 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.460
 45 games with a team off finally 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.500
 with these three kinds or etc of your 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.119
 bronze player to see well ride a 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.920
 good level of credits you're going 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.270
 see that I will arrange for the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.799
 collective so of course I'm going to inserted 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.360
 Marouane Chamakh the old Bordeaux the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.160
 teeth in this team who's going who's going 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.479
 will try to ride the maximum the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.400
 collective because you see that I have 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.560
 started with 42 collective there we are 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.360
 already gone up to 47 so I'm going to look 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.770
 if there are no other players 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.300
 could place so the gemmi I 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.459
 chose to put william big players 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.840
 that I knew before that is who is 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.220
 a very good player what a beautiful stadium 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.920
 for a good player so right I want 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.989
 put this tower defender is so 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.720
 shifted them or not licher how they say 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.950
 so he has the collective so you 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.340
 see that in one move 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.140
 collective rose to 56 now 58 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.340
 by putting a left defender so you 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.900
 look like that looks at you and the 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.180
 nationalities nationality that you have 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.220
 the most bullish to put them the most 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.440
 on the ground is of course at the right position 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.640
 1 you see good the MC that is not a 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.230
 mc it's not very serious it will take away 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.459
 only one point of collective but not 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.489
 do not put for example a middle left 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.470
 scorer or middle midfielder 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.569
 central and a right defender in scorer 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.590
 otherwise the collective will be very very 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.060
 weak so where do you see that I have 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.879
 still reaches a rating more than 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.800
 correct a collective of 77 for a 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.540
 startup team it's really very 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.629
 very well so these are these parties 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.970
 now we're going to name our club 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.379
 to start this thing because he 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.909
 knows automatically note that I have 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.640
 past nantas so it's me I'm 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:20.760
 crazy I'm going to change that name I put like 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.260
 well started name so that's okay 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.030
 serve to make the first step of 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.470
 manager tasks who will know i'm going to you 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.680
 explain such manager in the second 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.950
 episode of this series of this new 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.950
 series 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.080
 it will happen soon why not the 25 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.569
 probably today 23 so the 25 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.220
 january i think i will put the 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.129
 second episode so here is the pack 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.650
 bronze that he and we offer after having 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.879
 we have offered 500 credits so we 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.799
 offers a small step the bronze we go 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.989
 open we'll see what we're going to see 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.599
 so you saw that we did not 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.220
 a lot of good players despite that we 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.450
 go get the little nugget why 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.799
 not to maybe I do not have a chance 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.870
 in this pack but maybe you 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.340
 I have a book signing and a falcon 9 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.290
 who had a nice throw in this pack he has 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.780
 sold 35 miles so it's possible 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.340
 to have the chance and look there is a 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.239
 new feature on the market 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.010
 on the market 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.659
 Now is when one begins to list 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.819
 a player on sale there is the possibility 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.900
 to compare prices so that's 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.410
 really a very, very good thing 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.810
 installed paris and this year so 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.100
 so be careful alsa you compare 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.620
 prices why not some players 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.120
 sell them maybe even expensive ago 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.400
 some players good what they are worth 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.350
 very expensive or even a little see finally 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.000
 very very expensive see some genres 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.740
 bronze jorick and to the paras who goes the 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.210
 worthy and 15000 and boost players 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.980
 extremely expensive equivalent so the one 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.060
 there I took the choice to put it 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.860
 why not on the list of transfers 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.540
 he still has nice stats for mc 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.300
 who plays in series has in addition so 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.680
 why not I tried it here after 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.510
 meredith right defender case also 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.880
 beautiful stadium so I compared his 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.650
 price in vrd this is good he joy that is worth 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.030
 nothing so I 'll still try to 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.950
 put it on sale we never know 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.020
 once he goes to 2 to 2 his credit but 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.760
 that I passed them in the video here 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.960
 why is it going to start on our 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.850
 first three games in this first 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.780
 episode we're going to do both the three 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.250
 first matches I do not know anymore 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.780
 believe the first three matches so 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.550
 it's gone so you start yourself 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.290
 you will start I recommend it in 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.920
 any case in season online if you are 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.600
 level 1 in level 5 or 6 from above 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.580
 level the sfc if you're for example 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.650
 level 40 I advise you to play in 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.880
 finally good solo we made a choice it's 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.930
 you who so choose the first 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.700
 team we are going to face is going to be a 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.470
 small team with bronze players 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.120
 aulas him too in my opinion there a team 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.260
 of start-up generator he still 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.670
 reaches the mark of 70 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.160
 the collective starts right away 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.280
 with a corner the head of diane who 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.110
 opens the score 1-0 in the 31st minute 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.270
 purpose of this Senegalese or as we are I 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.100
 know more about the central gold defender 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.570
 who opens the score so you would that would 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.070
 good to win your first two matches 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.419
 because this season in division says 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.190
 it's really easy to win at 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.240
 from four wins or win 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.710
 then it's marouane chamakh who goes 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.240
 break through the ground and finish 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.490
 from his left foot quietly 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.260
 then in the 52nd minute 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.290
 it's going to be our friend late on 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.490
 dijonnais who goes the x3 or the inhabitant 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.530
 10 in any case they have it is chamakh 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.510
 and who will put a superb fly of 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.180
 left foot chamakh and back who 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.090
 returns to its old form as much in real life 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.680
 that in the game then the cepi colo which 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.510
 will launch marwan shamans and again he 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.070
 will put us a little hat for the 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.840
 first match with this team 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.340
 and so that's after my opponent is going 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.690
 decide to go away what I you 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.430
 advise not to make the limit 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.110
 if you even lose 8-0 you ask your 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.130
 joystick you leave but mostly you do not 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.830
 do not leave because it does not help 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.120
 strictly nothing to leave sailing you 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.210
 see I have 1000 credits so I'm going 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.680
 start making the first question 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.199
 gold players i'm going to choose baumann 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.139
 compared to my collective so aubin 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:33.520
 baumann he is the guardian of the same team 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.110
 what about diane so I bought them then 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.520
 I'm going to buy a right middle of 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.819
 barclays first league so chose to 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.160
 take 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.030
 marco or marko arnautovic I do not know 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.569
 what is his name? 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.490
 look carefully 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:44.319
 which has the most contracts so here is 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.690
 on the beach at very nice stats so 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:49.270
 you see that my collective and goes up to 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.069
 So here's how to chain with the 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.840
 second match so here is the frame there 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.030
 malouda do not have florent who is going 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.680
 spill over will focus its 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.660
 left foot in the 71st minute it's 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.150
 arnautovic the new recruit between 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.880
 quotes that will mark the goal is 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.380
 then there is my opponent with 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.060
 carlos martinez gave veto the 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.470
 eighteenth creations he's rolled up 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.150
 from his left foot and then 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.400
 unfortunately we will stay there so 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.720
 there will be a point in two matches 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.180
 which is not negligible anyway 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.110
 so that's going to be already at the end of 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.389
 this episode we are very soon 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.710
 for a new episode I would have done 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:23.789
 some acquisitions between the fingers 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.789
 the c-max flea
