00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
different tones it's 8 watts per side

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.269 
different tones it's 8 watts per side
and<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:30.960> has<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.320> optional<00:00:31.949> pedal

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
and this one has the optional pedal

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.700 
and this one has the optional pedal
board<00:00:32.460> attached<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.629> pedals<00:00:34.019> actually

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
board attached and the pedals actually

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.790 
board attached and the pedals actually
simulate<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.730> pedal<00:00:36.000> functions<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
simulate the pedal functions of a

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.200 
simulate the pedal functions of a
standard<00:00:37.800> acoustic<00:00:38.070> piano<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
standard acoustic piano so we have the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.170 
standard acoustic piano so we have the
sustain<00:00:39.600> pedal<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> right<00:00:40.290> hand<00:00:40.530> side

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
sustain pedal on the right hand side

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.280 
sustain pedal on the right hand side
sostenuto<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> center<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.050> soft

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
sostenuto in the center and the soft

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.580 
sostenuto in the center and the soft
pedal<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.680> left<00:00:45.140> so<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.290> is<00:00:46.380> how<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
pedal on the left so this is how the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:01:04.620 
pedal on the left so this is how the
Casio<00:00:46.920> px<00:00:47.250> 130<00:00:47.700> sense

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.790 

so<00:01:05.630> on<00:01:05.690> this<00:01:05.810> model<00:01:05.990> we<00:01:06.170> have<00:01:06.290> a<00:01:06.320> one-piece

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
so on this model we have a one-piece

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.460 
so on this model we have a one-piece
cabinet<00:01:07.520> with<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.880> pedals<00:01:08.420> attached<00:01:08.810> how<00:01:09.409> the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
cabinet with the pedals attached how the

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.500 
cabinet with the pedals attached how the
pedals<00:01:09.800> are<00:01:09.890> not<00:01:10.010> an<00:01:10.100> option<00:01:10.400> in<00:01:10.490> this<00:01:10.580> case<00:01:10.790> it

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
pedals are not an option in this case it

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.670 
pedals are not an option in this case it
has<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.750> roll<00:01:11.930> down<00:01:12.140> lid<00:01:17.259> it's<00:01:18.259> still<00:01:18.530> eight

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
has the roll down lid it's still eight

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.160 
has the roll down lid it's still eight
what's<00:01:18.890> aside<00:01:19.310> but<00:01:20.210> because<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.780> speaker

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
what's aside but because of the speaker

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.840 
what's aside but because of the speaker
placement<00:01:21.409> on<00:01:21.800> this<00:01:21.950> model<00:01:22.280> thing<00:01:22.430> underneath

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
placement on this model thing underneath

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.100 
placement on this model thing underneath
the<00:01:23.210> piano<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.630> gives<00:01:23.810> it<00:01:23.930> a<00:01:23.990> much<00:01:24.170> richer<00:01:24.560> tone

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
the piano it gives it a much richer tone

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:39.700 
the piano it gives it a much richer tone
as<00:01:27.110> you<00:01:27.170> can<00:01:27.409> hear<00:01:38.020> I'll<00:01:39.020> play<00:01:39.259> exactly<00:01:39.440> the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
as you can hear I'll play exactly the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.350 
as you can hear I'll play exactly the
same<00:01:39.950> thing<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.220> I<00:01:40.310> played<00:01:40.550> on<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.700> 130<00:01:41.149> so

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
same thing that I played on the 130 so

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.550 
same thing that I played on the 130 so
you<00:01:41.479> can<00:01:41.630> hear<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.899> sound<00:01:42.170> quality

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
you can hear the sound quality

00:01:42.560 --> 00:02:03.730 
you can hear the sound quality
difference<00:01:42.890> from<00:01:43.009> 7:30

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.470 

so<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.220> top-of-the-range<00:02:05.730> the<00:02:06.120> PX

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
so this is the top-of-the-range the PX

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.810 
so this is the top-of-the-range the PX
8:30<00:02:07.080> this<00:02:07.320> one<00:02:07.530> actually<00:02:07.680> has<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.399> polished

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
8:30 this one actually has a polished

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.530 
8:30 this one actually has a polished
ebony<00:02:09.090> cabinet<00:02:09.660> very<00:02:10.500> stylish-looking<00:02:11.540> it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
ebony cabinet very stylish-looking it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.540 
ebony cabinet very stylish-looking it
has<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> one-piece<00:02:13.410> lid<00:02:13.740> that<00:02:14.100> actually

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
has a one-piece lid that actually

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.440 
has a one-piece lid that actually
doubles<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.300> music<00:02:15.750> rest<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:18.240> when

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
doubles as the music rest that when

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.720 
doubles as the music rest that when
closed<00:02:19.280> also<00:02:20.280> acts<00:02:20.580> as<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.760> disc

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
closed also acts as a disc

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.119 
closed also acts as a disc
this<00:02:23.300> one's<00:02:23.540> 20<00:02:23.959> watts<00:02:24.170> aside<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:24.890> has<00:02:25.099> a

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
this one's 20 watts aside so it has a

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.070 
this one's 20 watts aside so it has a
much<00:02:25.519> richer<00:02:25.819> tone<00:02:26.150> better<00:02:26.420> sound<00:02:26.720> quality

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
much richer tone better sound quality

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.920 
much richer tone better sound quality
than<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.319> other<00:02:27.440> two<00:02:27.650> models<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:29.150> couple<00:02:29.840> of

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
than the other two models a couple of

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.479 
than the other two models a couple of
the<00:02:29.989> special<00:02:30.379> features<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:30.769> this<00:02:30.920> model<00:02:31.099> are

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
the special features on this model are

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.839 
the special features on this model are
the<00:02:31.819> stereo<00:02:32.299> line<00:02:32.510> out<00:02:32.720> also<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.980> SD<00:02:34.310> card

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
the stereo line out also the SD card

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.330 
the stereo line out also the SD card
feature<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:36.590> I'll<00:02:36.650> play<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.950> same<00:02:37.129> page<00:02:37.310> that

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
feature so I'll play the same page that

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.740 
feature so I'll play the same page that
I<00:02:37.519> played<00:02:37.700> on<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.849> other<00:02:38.030> two<00:02:38.180> models<00:02:38.480> taken

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
I played on the other two models taken

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.180 
I played on the other two models taken
either<00:02:38.900> sound<00:02:39.200> quality<00:02:39.560> different<00:02:39.890> zero<00:02:40.069> to

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
either sound quality different zero to

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.970 
either sound quality different zero to
twenty<00:02:40.430> one<00:02:40.489> speakers
