00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.000
 never 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.250
 he showed up for three hours last night at the 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.469
 Aztec stadium began by thanking the 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.389
 attendance of the 60,000 fans saying 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.840
 in perfect spanish hello mexico good 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.369
 Chilangos nights performed a total of 40 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.560
 songs from both the albums and 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.850
 soloist like the ones I had with the viruses 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.070
 and also with his deceased wife with the 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.230
 wings dedicated songs to his new 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.439
 wife also to the deceased linda 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.329
 also to George Harrison and John Lennon 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.550
 tomorrow will be presented in the zocalo where 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.890
 it is expected that two hundred thousand attend 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.079
 people where it is commonly 200 thousand 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.079
 people today all made balls 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.069
 and then they also start like to go 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:53.589
 the streets and even the ones in the zocalo 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:55.210
 external because it 's nothing 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.150
 this is a concert that to me 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.010
 I would like to see 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.510
 I just saw it once a lot a lot 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.399
 very much 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.710
 I saw it in the sun forum it would be 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.710
 as 18 years old or younger 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.780
 when she is just pregnant with Ã¡lex 18 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.610
 years left to follow him so much 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.810
 forum sun either one thinking that is 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.810
 our new forum does not 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.270
 and good that we are older we fit them 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.030
 a wonder and will be tomorrow 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.119
 free but but it complicates the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.890
 arrival to the socket if you want to see it in 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.320
 action that I calculate that they will no longer do 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.340
 many more tours by mccann I do not believe 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.340
 that if you think 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.110
 he has left for a while 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.630
 if it's a concert that I would have 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.340
 liked to see but then one with work 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.439
 how does he know explain anything 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.380
 but if you like so much both so much 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.380
 so much both so much to someone else 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.750
 Camila 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.310
 but first there is my work and then the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.230
 fun 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.840
 when one accepts her she can walk 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.879
 canceling like this right and left 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.260
 I would find it backwards to know how to sing lady in 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.790
 live must be madness 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.750
 I do not accuse myself and I sing it when I saw it 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.200
 but I think so but he was father 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.379
 two years on television more open 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.379
 never
