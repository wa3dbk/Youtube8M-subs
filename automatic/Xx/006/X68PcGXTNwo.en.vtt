00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.280
 i 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.380
 they tell you look at them so they are 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.660
 very well today we are going to do some 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.940
 healthy recipes and about if not 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.200
 we do fresh food tutorials ago 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.720
 a few days more than an application that 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.060
 called pompom where he was seeing a 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.730
 lots of super rich recipes but 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.829
 also healthy if you are starting a 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.509
 diet or an exercise routine you 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.520
 I highly recommend this application because 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.649
 here is not frowned upon if you see photos of 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.119
 what you are eating or while doing 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.619
 exercise in fact is very motivating 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.329
 because you can see the progress of the 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.880
 people since they started doing 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.620
 exercise or eat more water you can leave 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.990
 comments you can upload your photos 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.670
 you can receive comments and a lot 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.530
 of super useful tips and they also have 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.480
 a section where they can give you a 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.490
 Exercise routine depending on the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.230
 part of the body that you want to work and 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.270
 of the time you have to go 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.740
 I liked it a lot and if you want 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.720
 that we keep in touch there 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.950
 You can find how I speak softly 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.950
 this is what it looks like 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.990
 do not 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.390
 today we are going to make 4 super easy snacks 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.790
 for the first idea we are going to need 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.190
 raisins and almonds 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.960
 first let's cut one pass to the 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.030
 half and then we're going to put an almond 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.280
 I like many chocolates with 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.229
 almonds and if you like this I think this 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.590
 It is a good idea to take away your 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.590
 whim 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.570
 yes 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.570
 ah 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.760
 If your weakness is the cookies we are going to 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.920
 simulate ones 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.170
 first we will cut a banana in 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.170
 not very thin circles in this way 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.490
 then let's put a little bit of cream 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.890
 of peanut 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.890
 and then we'll put another circle up 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.460
 so we will taste our cookies 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:36.280
 ah 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.280
 after staying like this they know very well 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.930
 in the next idea we will use a 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.410
 apple we are going to start in circles 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.540
 Equally not too thin or too thick 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.480
 and then we can carefully remove the 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.550
 center or the seeds 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.680
 we are going to put a thin layer of 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.010
 peanut butter and then a little 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.010
 big wave 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.830
 we will stay like this 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.489
 and in the next idea we are going to cut a 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.819
 banana and then we will mix it with 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.819
 big wave 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.129
 let's form a mass try to be 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.129
 bigger than banana 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.340
 then with a spoon we will form balls 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.920
 in a dish 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.390
 we can put it in the refrigerator about 10 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.390
 minutes and they will be ready 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.879
 I hope you liked these ideas 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.650
 and that you put them into practice you do not 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.490
 forget to subscribe and see you the 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.490
 next tuesday
