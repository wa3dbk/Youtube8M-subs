immersion<00:00:59.760> down<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:01.719> a<00:01:01.750> pretty<00:01:01.989> good<00:01:02.280> science

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
immersion down to a pretty good science

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.109 
immersion down to a pretty good science
but<00:01:03.640> what<00:01:04.300> isn't<00:01:04.660> here<00:01:05.140> yet<00:01:05.170> is<00:01:05.649> this

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
but what isn't here yet is this

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.090 
but what isn't here yet is this
inertialess<00:01:07.119> notion<00:01:07.630> of<00:01:07.810> immersive<00:01:08.710> video

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
inertialess notion of immersive video

inertialess notion of immersive video
rusev<00:01:10.080> pictures<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:12.899> the<00:01:13.899> reason<00:01:14.289> for<00:01:14.619> that

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
rusev pictures and the reason for that

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.900 
rusev pictures and the reason for that
is<00:01:16.690> that<00:01:17.259> you<00:01:17.770> know<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.009> technology<00:01:18.340> just

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
is that you know the technology just

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.120 
is that you know the technology just
hasn't<00:01:19.300> been<00:01:19.649> quite<00:01:20.649> ready<00:01:20.920> for<00:01:21.009> that<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:23.130> if

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
hasn't been quite ready for that so if

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.460 
hasn't been quite ready for that so if
you<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:24.850> know<00:01:24.880> 10<00:01:25.180> conferences<00:01:25.810> like<00:01:26.050> the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
you you know 10 conferences like the

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.969 
you you know 10 conferences like the
Consumer<00:01:26.979> Electronics<00:01:27.009> Show<00:01:28.289> last<00:01:29.289> year<00:01:29.560> and

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
I'm sure that

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.650 
I'm sure that
2010b<00:01:32.550> get<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.630> lot<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.890> lot<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.220> noise<00:01:35.400> about

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
2010b get a lot of a lot of noise about

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.560

and I was so excited about this

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.430 
and I was so excited about this
development<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.330> we<00:02:30.570> we<00:02:30.840> got<00:02:30.990> out<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
development that we we got out of the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.490 
development that we we got out of the
folks<00:02:31.680> we're<00:02:32.640> creating<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.330> at<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.230> company

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
folks we're creating it at a company

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.100 
folks we're creating it at a company
called<00:02:34.680> HDI<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.820> we<00:02:35.940> invited<00:02:36.240> him<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.570> be<00:02:36.780> here

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
called HDI and we invited him to be here

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.040 
called HDI and we invited him to be here
today<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.740> see<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.700> technology<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.900> think

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
today to see the technology so I think

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
on ABC you know I saw the folks really

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.699 
on ABC you know I saw the folks really
big<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.099> this<00:03:02.249> big<00:03:03.239> displays<00:03:03.659> of<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.590> you

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
big in this big displays of that you

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.179 
big in this big displays of that you
guys<00:03:04.889> are<00:03:05.099> building<00:03:05.249> so<00:03:05.999> you<00:03:06.599> know<00:03:06.719> once<00:03:07.049> you

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.189 
guys are building so you know once you

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.770 
guys are building so you know once you
maybe<00:03:08.189> tell<00:03:08.400> us<00:03:08.459> what<00:03:09.209> are<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.389> difference

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
maybe tell us what are the difference

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.750 
maybe tell us what are the difference
between<00:03:09.989> what<00:03:10.620> we're<00:03:10.920> going<00:03:11.069> to<00:03:11.189> show<00:03:11.219> here

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
with this LCD 3d TV and when you had to

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.220 
with this LCD 3d TV and when you had to
work<00:03:17.689> brisbane<00:03:18.689> we're<00:03:18.810> going<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.989> give<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:19.200> the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
work brisbane we're going to give it the

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.129 
work brisbane we're going to give it the
big<00:03:19.829> picture<00:03:20.040> first<00:03:20.340> yeah<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:20.999> are<00:03:21.239> we<00:03:21.569> who

have developed and hopefully better

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.339 
have developed and hopefully better
about<00:03:40.889> the<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.519> Delta<00:03:42.060> these<00:03:42.989> don't<00:03:43.199> cost

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
about the the Delta these don't cost

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.360 
about the the Delta these don't cost
very<00:03:43.590> very<00:03:44.010> fast<00:03:44.930> they<00:03:45.930> will<00:03:46.169> scan<00:03:46.769> over<00:03:47.340> a

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
very very fast they will scan over a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.360 
very very fast they will scan over a
thousand<00:03:48.000> frames<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.359> second<00:03:48.719> wow<00:03:49.409> I<00:03:49.949> mean

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
thousand frames a second wow I mean

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.330 
thousand frames a second wow I mean
today<00:03:50.549> we<00:03:50.849> can<00:03:51.060> come<00:03:51.269> back<00:03:51.480> teenage<00:03:51.989> like<00:03:52.340> 240
