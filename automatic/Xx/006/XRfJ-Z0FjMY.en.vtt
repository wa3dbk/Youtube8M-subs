00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.949 
if you want to I just prefer using this
one<00:02:23.879> because<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:24.180> more<00:02:24.300> highly<00:02:24.629> pigmented

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
one because it's more highly pigmented

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.180 
one because it's more highly pigmented
and<00:02:25.379> it's<00:02:25.890> perfect<00:02:26.340> for<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.550> creamy<00:02:26.849> base<00:02:28.190> it

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
and it's perfect for a creamy base it

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.610 
and it's perfect for a creamy base it
really<00:02:29.459> keeps<00:02:29.640> your<00:02:30.239> eyelid<00:02:30.569> from<00:02:30.690> creasing
