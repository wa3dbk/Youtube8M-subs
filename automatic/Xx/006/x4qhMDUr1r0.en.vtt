lip<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.190> does<00:01:02.609> dry<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.719> not<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
lip this does dry and it's not going to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.200 
lip this does dry and it's not going to
read<00:01:04.439> glossy<00:01:04.890> after<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> while<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.820> don't<00:01:06.090> worry

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
read glossy after a while so don't worry

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.960 
read glossy after a while so don't worry
about<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:07.250> this<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
about that this is really just a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.609 
about that this is really just a
treatment

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.800 

and<00:01:15.920> after<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:16.579> we<00:01:17.030> can<00:01:17.179> go<00:01:17.359> in<00:01:17.509> with<00:01:17.539> our

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
and after that we can go in with our

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:30.060 
and after that we can go in with our
lipstick

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.070 

we<00:01:30.790> can<00:01:30.940> see<00:01:31.120> that<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.390> lines<00:01:31.600> are<00:01:31.810> already

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
we can see that the lines are already

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.300 
we can see that the lines are already
eliminated<00:01:32.260> and<00:01:32.770> they're<00:01:32.890> looking<00:01:33.280> more

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
eliminated and they're looking more

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.550 
eliminated and they're looking more
hydrated<00:01:34.800> which<00:01:35.800> is<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.100> key<00:01:36.370> factor<00:01:37.560> because

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
hydrated which is the key factor because

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.170 
hydrated which is the key factor because
we<00:01:38.710> want<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:38.950> eliminate<00:01:39.190> any<00:01:39.460> texture<00:01:40.030> before

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
we want to eliminate any texture before

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.010 
we want to eliminate any texture before
we<00:01:40.480> put<00:01:40.690> on<00:01:40.780> our<00:01:40.900> lipstick<00:01:41.350> not<00:01:41.590> after<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.840> it's

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
we put on our lipstick not after so it's

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.870 
we put on our lipstick not after so it's
basically<00:01:44.470> just<00:01:44.800> remembering<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.370> necessary

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
basically just remembering the necessary

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.700 
basically just remembering the necessary
steps<00:01:46.180> before<00:01:46.390> we<00:01:46.630> apply<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.050> lipstick<00:01:47.560> on

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
steps before we apply that lipstick on

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.980 
steps before we apply that lipstick on
to<00:01:47.980> ourselves<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.540> want<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.810> really

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
to ourselves if you want to really

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.650 
to ourselves if you want to really
define<00:01:56.410> lip<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.830> pencil<00:01:57.250> is<00:01:57.370> recommended<00:01:58.030> but

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
define lip a pencil is recommended but

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.710 
define lip a pencil is recommended but
those<00:01:58.840> are<00:01:59.050> things<00:01:59.350> that<00:01:59.650> do<00:02:00.120> dry<00:02:01.120> out<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.570> lip

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
those are things that do dry out the lip

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.570 
those are things that do dry out the lip

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
area so going straight to just a

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.010 
area so going straight to just a
lipstick<00:02:04.170> will<00:02:05.170> help<00:02:05.410> prevent<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:07.509> lines<00:02:07.780> of
