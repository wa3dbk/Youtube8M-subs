because<00:00:10.139> we<00:00:10.320> have<00:00:10.559> an<00:00:10.799> early<00:00:11.039> thesis

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
because we have an early thesis

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.640 
because we have an early thesis
statement<00:00:12.209> and<00:00:12.480> we<00:00:12.570> have<00:00:12.750> our<00:00:12.959> main<00:00:13.139> points

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
statement and we have our main points

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.230 
statement and we have our main points
the<00:00:13.709> next<00:00:14.129> step<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.699> write<00:00:14.850> our<00:00:15.000> body

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
the next step is to write our body

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.749 
the next step is to write our body
paragraphs<00:00:15.869> the<00:00:16.590> easiest<00:00:17.070> way<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.340> write<00:00:17.699> a

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:17.759 
paragraphs the easiest way to write a

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.659 
paragraphs the easiest way to write a
paragraph<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.750> use<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.109> PI<00:00:19.320> method<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.070> pi

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
paragraph is to use the PI method and pi

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.359 
paragraph is to use the PI method and pi
stands<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.390> point<00:00:21.630> information<00:00:22.369> and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
stands for point information and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.150 
stands for point information and
explanation<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.349> can<00:00:25.529> break<00:00:25.769> down<00:00:25.980> each

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
explanation and you can break down each

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.919 
explanation and you can break down each
of<00:00:26.310> your<00:00:26.400> body<00:00:26.609> paragraphs<00:00:26.849> into<00:00:27.390> these<00:00:27.630> three

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
of your body paragraphs into these three

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.589 
of your body paragraphs into these three
parts<00:00:28.499> so<00:00:28.829> let's<00:00:29.429> take<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> look<00:00:30.060> at<00:00:30.210> our<00:00:30.329> first

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
parts so let's take a look at our first

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.780 
parts so let's take a look at our first
point<00:00:31.050> I've<00:00:31.320> got<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.650> broken<00:00:31.890> down<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.520> into

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
point I've got it broken down here into

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.380 
point I've got it broken down here into
that<00:00:32.820> PI<00:00:33.500> points<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.670> first<00:00:35.910> point<00:00:36.210> is

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
that PI points so the first point is

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.480 
that PI points so the first point is
that<00:00:36.530> westernisation<00:00:37.530> was<00:00:37.710> good<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.100> Russian

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490

that westernisation was good for Russian
women<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:39.960> information<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.950> give

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
details about just how it was good for

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.700 
details about just how it was good for
them<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.300> also<00:00:45.510> where<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.900> put<00:00:46.170> my<00:00:46.320> clothes

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.240 
and then for explanation this is where I

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.120 
and then for explanation this is where I
tie<00:00:51.570> these<00:00:51.840> two<00:00:52.140> pieces<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.920> information

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
tie these two pieces of information

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.880 
tie these two pieces of information
together<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.240> then<00:00:54.810> tie<00:00:55.080> it<00:00:55.140> back<00:00:55.380> into<00:00:55.680> my

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
together and then tie it back into my

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.940 
together and then tie it back into my
thesis<00:00:56.550> statements<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.300> improving<00:00:58.170> my<00:00:58.350> thesis

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
thesis statements on improving my thesis

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.550 
thesis statements on improving my thesis
statement<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.610> these<00:00:59.790> paragraphs<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:01.350> once

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
statement with these paragraphs and once

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.960 
statement with these paragraphs and once
we<00:01:01.740> have<00:01:01.920> these<00:01:02.040> three<00:01:02.100> parts<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.880> the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
we have these three parts of the

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.910 
we have these three parts of the
paragraph<00:01:03.420> written<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.439> usually<00:01:04.619> just

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
paragraph written that it's usually just

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.859 
paragraph written that it's usually just
a<00:01:05.189> matter<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.519> moving<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.939> sentences<00:01:06.570> around

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
a matter of moving the sentences around

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.560 
a matter of moving the sentences around
so<00:01:07.109> it<00:01:07.200> looks<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.740> an<00:01:07.859> actual<00:01:08.070> paragraph<00:01:08.670> so

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
so it looks like an actual paragraph so

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.730 
so it looks like an actual paragraph so
I<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.469> so<00:01:14.539> this<00:01:15.539> is<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:15.899> paragraph

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
I have that here so this is my paragraph

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.770 
I have that here so this is my paragraph
all<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> did<00:01:17.399> was<00:01:17.609> take<00:01:17.819> the<00:01:17.999> P<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.359> the<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.479> in

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
all I did was take the P and the I in

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.649 
all I did was take the P and the I in
the<00:01:18.899> e<00:01:18.929> out<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.219> can<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:20.789> that<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.240> more

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the e out so you can see that it's more

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.679 
the e out so you can see that it's more
like<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.140> paragraph<00:01:23.210> next<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.329> want<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.539> be<00:01:24.659> sure

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
like a paragraph next we want to be sure

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.779 
like a paragraph next we want to be sure
that<00:01:24.899> we<00:01:25.140> cite<00:01:25.380> our<00:01:25.409> sources<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.369> at<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.609> end

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
that we cite our sources so at the end

and the page number but for this for
this<00:01:34.139> quote<00:01:34.889> I've<00:01:35.159> used<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.700> website<00:01:35.969> so<00:01:36.630> I've

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
this quote I've used a website so I've

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.029 
this quote I've used a website so I've
put<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.590> parentheses<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.399> website<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.770> put

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
put in parentheses the website and I put

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.950 
put in parentheses the website and I put
the<00:01:41.130> period<00:01:41.369> at<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> end<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.329> made<00:01:42.659> sure<00:01:42.689> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the period at the end and made sure that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.069 
the period at the end and made sure that
it<00:01:43.200> was<00:01:43.319> after<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.889> quotation<00:01:44.399> mark<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
it was after the quotation mark so you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.289 
it was after the quotation mark so you
want<00:01:46.469> to<00:01:46.590> type<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.950> two<00:01:47.189> more<00:01:47.429> paragraphs<00:01:47.999> just

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
want to type up two more paragraphs just

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.660 
want to type up two more paragraphs just
like<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.719> one<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.350> now<00:01:50.219> it's<00:01:50.249> time<00:01:50.609> to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
like this one but now it's time to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.099 
like this one but now it's time to
reanalyze<00:01:51.450> our<00:01:52.109> early<00:01:52.920> thesis<00:01:53.399> statement

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
reanalyze our early thesis statement

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:55.969 
reanalyze our early thesis statement
because<00:01:55.109> we<00:01:55.229> want<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.469> make<00:01:55.590> sure<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.859> it

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
because we want to make sure that it

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.469 
because we want to make sure that it
still<00:01:56.249> matches<00:01:56.729> what<00:01:56.909> we're<00:01:57.090> talking<00:01:57.450> about

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
still matches what we're talking about

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.769 
still matches what we're talking about
with<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.529> of<00:01:58.679> our<00:01:58.770> paragraphs<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.509> let's

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:00.779 
with with all of our paragraphs so let's

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:02.239 
with with all of our paragraphs so let's
suppose<00:02:01.109> that<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.619> couldn't<00:02:02.009> find

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249
