00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.720
 hello people today will be short 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.490
 The video is just as concerned when 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:25.609
 if someone is unsuccessful on your smartphone 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:30.160
 turned his camera enrolled exactly on 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:32.360
 90 degrees plus minus left right and 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.950
 I turned you is a picture 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.220
 turned upside down when you fold on 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.440
 the computer does not work like this 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.350
 quite correct and how to deal with it 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.170
 what to do in this short video this 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.340
 show the program is called which 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.650
 i use to 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.260
 turn over 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.070
 account here is her name free video flip 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.790
 and rotate 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.660
 so night separating highlight 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:10.340
 moth write that below probably video I 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:14.150
 I will write as it is called, and then it 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.710
 very simple as we see it turns out 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.320
 2 window on the left, we indicate the source 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.410
 where to get that is here push here 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.610
 Well, here we already have exactly this 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.050
 the same name 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.950
 cast video only added 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.890
 This q1 means we immediately see two windows that 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.710
 how does he turn which one 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:45.590
 here we can point out below 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:48.830
 and basically press save and go ahead 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.700
 he do it now show it right away 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.380
 I answer 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:59.030
 to fans of the program virtual dub I, too 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.340
 I respect and love this program however and 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.799
 she turns over there too much 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.680
 More certainly better than here but here 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:10.729
 this promo is more friendly and easy for 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.510
 ordinary users and besides she 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.360
 eats 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.510
 m 4 format expose additional need 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:22.220
 special version to download it to 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:25.010
 took this format and so mean it was 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:30.830
 lyrics but now to practice means with us 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:33.220
 it turns out we turned the camera by the way 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.730
 will be the next video where we fell asleep 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.959
 we get a camera like you 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.319
 see for ipsum well this is already 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.930
 I will show the video in more detail 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.550
 means and here we are already turning but 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.770
 look means 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:03:03.310
 how do we turn over now time will pass 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:06.950
 it will show us which side so 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.000
 flips over how we shot need 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.319
 vice versa 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.790
 at -90 degrees, well, in principle, it turns out 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.020
 like this 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.130
 I wanted to pick up a video of course where 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.200
 a little taboo clearly 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.500
 Well, in principle, it is clear yes what 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.920
 programlina it makes options possible 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.930
 expose what we need to do here language 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.930
 and turn off the linden computer after 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.500
 and click save and he went already 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.500
 converted no question and you get 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.140
 teaches its outcome soon have 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.610
 inverted will give and speech as follows 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.610
