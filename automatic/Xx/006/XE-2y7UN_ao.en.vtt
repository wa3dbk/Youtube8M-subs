 But come on and it's a city that you 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.150

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.540
 You will stay in a place where you do not have 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.860
 flat tyler biome if you tighten 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.200
 the guy must be an easter egg guys 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.659

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.920

 one by one the jam already put in the year 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.259
 normal 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.450
 I came back here and here it is one in 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.470
 which I think would be a truce but not 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.200
 seems to be here you go down you go 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.329
 have a way here, whatever you have 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.530
 Excuse me when you pass here. 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:08.759
 He shoots the arrow, you die. 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.319
 praiseworthy here just to take the way 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.760
 put on the ovaries 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.730

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.700
 died will not lift the face can 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.560
 coming here can destroy dispensation and also 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:27.500
 there he only played a lot, he's not going 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.319
 stay in that direction but anyway you 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.889
 You can take the arrows here to get the gold 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.889
 has the chest 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:44.359
 Then you can take your chance here. 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:48.829
 that's it, this is where the 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:52.790
 Sir, do you have any levers you're going to do? 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:55.400
 what if this reverses and that makes noise 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.209
 piston now is to squeeze that 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.989
 and that now when I go back there here 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.030
 up should only have one here sentra hole 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.489
 and will have a troop of pistons we 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.980
 because there's going to be a piston athlete here 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.139
 Do not worry, there's nothing here. 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.530
 Mass finally has a chest that he has 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.720
 emerald iron and gold 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:25.250
 There's a lot of cool, that's ok. 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:27.040
 get out of here but I swear I saw one 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.479
 haunt following me 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.500
 Now let's look up here and you do not 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:38.540
 there is nothing for you to take in fresh air and 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.889
 adam johson you can steal your legs 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.479
 do not want to 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.900
 when you know adam johnson for this 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.900
 side here 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:54.319
 shasha pro has a cave with a 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.629
 big jam 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.159
 you can pick up the items have four 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.879
 irons missing you get 8 irons 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.519
 I thought guys if you're wondering 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.769
 to start a survival pose with this cid 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.699

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:14.830
 has given to the exit of angoche already has 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:18.410
 jango desert and flash right who you 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:21.019
 you do not have a biome 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.590
 you have enough because you're not 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.440
 fatal because that's the food it's got 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.890
 sheep if I'm not mistaken, but I think 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.270
 that they are not pressed from the map 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:38.840
 but if you would then find 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:39.590
 sheep here tabu cattle is and left the 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.180

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:03.650

 minimum of 19 degrees plus 40 degrees 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.760
