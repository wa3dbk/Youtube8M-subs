taking the skateboard direct contact on
both<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.660> trucks<00:00:21.960> will<00:00:22.560> make<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.130> trick

turning the trucks up grinding along it

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.080 
turning the trucks up grinding along it
like<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.140> then<00:00:52.829> dropping<00:00:53.129> back<00:00:53.250> as<00:00:54.000> you

can see both of the taps are touching

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.660 
can see both of the taps are touching
that's<00:00:56.070> what<00:00:56.399> makes<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> 50/50<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.550> be

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that's what makes it a 50/50 it can be

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
that's what makes it a 50/50 it can be
done<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.539> body<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.899> facing<00:01:01.609> at

see<00:01:18.240> both<00:01:18.479> trucks<00:01:18.780> on

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.080 

once<00:01:22.290> you've<00:01:22.500> locked<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.340> trucks<00:01:23.640> into<00:01:24.000> the

once you've locked the trucks into the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.020 
once you've locked the trucks into the
50/50<00:01:24.720> position<00:01:25.260> you<00:01:25.920> need<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.250> let<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.760> lid

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
50/50 position you need to let the lid

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.890 
50/50 position you need to let the lid
or<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> lip<00:01:27.630> or<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> rail<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:29.280> coping<00:01:29.900> guide

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
or the lip or the rail the coping guide

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.170 
or the lip or the rail the coping guide
you<00:01:31.140> along<00:01:31.260> in<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> 50/50<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:32.910> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.120> see

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
you along in the 50/50 so as you can see

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.680 
you along in the 50/50 so as you can see
the<00:01:33.480> wheels<00:01:33.690> are<00:01:34.050> flush<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.800> against<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.690> the

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
the wheels are flush up against the the

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.390 
the wheels are flush up against the the
rail<00:01:36.900> there<00:01:37.260> and<00:01:37.620> that's<00:01:37.800> going<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.980> hold<00:01:38.220> you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
rail there and that's going to hold you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.400 
rail there and that's going to hold you
in<00:01:38.430> position<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.210> lean<00:01:39.360> too<00:01:39.600> far<00:01:39.810> inwards

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
in position if you lean too far inwards

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.310 
in position if you lean too far inwards
the<00:01:40.800> board<00:01:41.040> will<00:01:41.130> slip<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.550> of<00:01:41.670> position<00:01:42.320> and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the board will slip out of position and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.370 
the board will slip out of position and
if<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.980> lean<00:01:44.130> too<00:01:44.310> far<00:01:44.550> outwards<00:01:45.170> again<00:01:46.170> it'll

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
if you lean too far outwards again it'll

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.260 
if you lean too far outwards again it'll
slip<00:01:46.620> up<00:01:46.800> on<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:46.980> top<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.030> about

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
slip up on the top so it's about

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.170 
slip up on the top so it's about
allowing<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:49.070> glide<00:01:50.070> along<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.670> rail<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
allowing it to glide along the rail and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.660 
allowing it to glide along the rail and
then<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.110> dismount<00:01:52.560> from<00:01:52.650> there<00:01:52.979> however

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
then you can dismount from there however

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.820 
then you can dismount from there however
you<00:01:53.850> feel<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.390> ollie<00:01:54.570> out<00:01:54.690> turn<00:01:55.260> out<00:01:55.500> pop

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
you feel you can ollie out turn out pop

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
you feel you can ollie out turn out pop
out<00:01:56.040> grab<00:01:56.340> out<00:01:56.550> flip<00:01:57.240> out<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:05.310> that's<00:02:05.580> how<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
out grab out flip out and that's how you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.869 
out grab out flip out and that's how you
fifty-fifty<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.600> skateboard
