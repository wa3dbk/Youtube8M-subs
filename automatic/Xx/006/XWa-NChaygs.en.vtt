00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.460
 hello youtube people good today les 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.680
 I bring a program that is to install 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.809
 the drivers that you need your 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.020
 computer after they have 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.340
 formatted either to the act or a 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.290
 desktop computer 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.040
 first of all I want to tell you that 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.900
 this program works with the internet if 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.910
 you do not have internet can not 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.950
 download the drivers so for the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.410
 people tell me if it works 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.520
 well internet so I have to tell you that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.220
 no and well once we have 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.290
 the program we're going to go to the next link 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.280
 the link can be found in the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.280
 video description 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.880
 of the investment in 2014 11 give to 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.550
 download 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.180
 save files let's hope that 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.180
 unload 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.479
 It should be noted that I do not like it 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.570
 put passwords to my files and for 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.900
 I do not put that on because sometimes you know 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.210
 break the files by cheating 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.950
 well here we have what we do is 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.950
 extract and view scanner 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.159
 here it is 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.640
 let's double click 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.340
 and here two are going to appear 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.500
 the files one that says serial that is 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.050
 which we are going to use to activate it 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.390
 the one that says driver scanner lamo double 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.390
 click to drivers scanner 2014 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.359
 we wait here now 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.910
 this is a very useful program I use it and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.910
 I recommend it 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.180
 run 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.820
 here was to make a little window 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.590
 I'm going to tell you to perform an analysis 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.030
 installing the scanner from the eeb 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.110
 I agree it's not going to happen 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.110
 we hope it ends 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.720
 here is the driver scanner logo with 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.720
 is starting 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.260
 and good here says welcome to drivers 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.170
 and thanks for buying from the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.019
 fun in this registered version 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.080
 includes good here I get that this 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.560
 version is registered but to you 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.140
 they are going to leave here a box that says 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.390
 activate or register your product like me 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.090
 I had previously installed it and what 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.400
 I uninstalled again, well, I did not 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.590
 asked for the record because the archives 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.739
 of the system were already recorded in the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.440
 system and it comes out that my scanner drivers already 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.540
 It is registered 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.040
 well what we are going to do now is 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.040
 put in scan 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.790
 once we scan our drivers 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.550
 scanner is going to say results of 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.220
 scan 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.680
 here will come out the four devices 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.740
 they do not have controllers have 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.470
 obsolete drivers here we can see 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.850
 countless drivers that comes 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.250
 with 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.600
 with the scanner driver that supposedly 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.650
 these are already installed 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.380
 updated to date means that 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.300
 these drivers are already installed 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.560
 and updated and work correctly 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.560
 in our computer 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.420
 and those that are not installed as they say 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.810
 that are obsolete will seem to them with 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.590
 an orange box and being read the 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.210
 name of the old driver very 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.260
 old 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:14.900
 and you just for to update 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.980
 a driver or install it they click 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.980
 in updating 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.870
 as you can see here devices 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:27.130
 of high definition audio is a 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.070
 audio driver that I do not need 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.840
 very necessarily because I have audio 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.210
 My computer 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.440
 here came out this because I yesterday 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.970
 I connected a 5130 Nokia zeroes phone and 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.310
 why he says put a 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.010
 driver is very good because if you 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.060
 connect on a device 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.160
 automatically to the scanner driver what 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.230
 detects and installs its driver 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.660
 he is also the controller of others 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.490
 samsung a samsung that connects also 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.930
 a few days ago and then I get here 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.789
 that I have to take advantage of the driver 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.370
 and what are my printer drivers 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.990
 canon mg 2 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.930
 200 but I have a table of the 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.940
 drivers and that is not necessary installed and 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.340
 good friends this is the scanner driver 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.570
 have to download the link are the 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.820
