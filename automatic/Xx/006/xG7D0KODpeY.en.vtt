00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.720
 biased 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.399
 I'm going to use the following 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:14.069
 I had a pot here when it came back 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.980
 if the attack is right 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.550
 on this water day 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.999
 I'll put 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:24.619
 on this necklace while I'm going to do it here with a certain syrup 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.419
 and here in the other pan 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.159
 I'm going to put it on 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:31.470
 notified 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.170
 in fact two and a half islands 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.290
 of milk 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.430
 you can also test it warmly to advance the process that we give 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.370
 The heat in our pan will put 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.370
 a canister with a can of condensed milk 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.380
 I put it here 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.910
 now I'll put 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.810
 three themes 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.090
 better still if you have 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.340
 people that mouth and had 7 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.280
 that henchy chicken that has estimated that the recipe for maringá 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.490
 but the navy and here you go dress up to boil 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.320
 and also those who do not use it that can be used slowly 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.420
 always did 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.600
 singh per year under the pan bottom 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.250
 so that it does not stick right 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.830
 so here to the rock the kremlin 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.130
 has the tail shocked so far here on the mixer I'm going to hit 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.710
 three clear 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.710
 It's okay to say hit here. 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.240
 I'll do the following, I'll hit the clarinet. 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.690
 after I have cleared it, I'm going to add three tablespoons of 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.730
 sugar 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.810
 if three tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.640
 and I'm going to beat up the very firm peaks 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.049
 7 while the tail is melting that just boil the caldense had something 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.080
 you turn it off let it cool 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.200
 this from here 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.050
 We're going to leave a funny favor. 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.050
 There you will need a greased form. 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.260
 I let the sugar leaves if it will channel this way 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.170
 and then you'll add the cold tail in that shape any then while I go 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.470
 doing all of this here we will be however the very animated company 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.540
 and that he says of fernanda from here a little back this delicious recipe 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.879
 for you 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.189
 For fernanda the recipe is that it is almost all followed by the pope 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.510
 hopeful viewers there who are looking forward to this 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.269
 recipe 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.500
 Look here 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.280
 I did nothing more than let the process evolve in case you created it here 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.100
 the attack believed in the fire is 3d and imax olavo condensed milk and cups and 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.459

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.540
 right milk 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.929
 so it was this month that we still got to that point 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:55.169
 look at the point of it which is the idea so little that a customer but is what is that 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:59.510
 You're going to do it now or you put it on the mixer and hit it a little. 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.450
 yes this year fighting 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.450
 so the fast beat up 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.429

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.099
 look that is already getting another skeptical stance 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:25.259
 so the bubble 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.259
 It's a tremendous in bodies even well. 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:30.829

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:56.119
 and then I will add 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:04:01.139
 is that 50 grams of cocaine aside I'll leave a little bit here just to decorate 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.120
 at the end of the set 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.559
 so here we will mix 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:08.559
 slightly 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:23.770

 take to the refrigerator for more or less 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.960
 in fact the freezer for about four hours 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.400
 set me right right when 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.130
 you put a little bit of water on the fire 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.460
 bath-house places in 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.839
