decent gasket and first up I'm gonna

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.890 
decent gasket and first up I'm gonna
have<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.350> take<00:00:19.529> all<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.119> screws<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.660> get

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
have to take all the screws out and get

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.960 
have to take all the screws out and get
this<00:00:22.080> sub<00:00:22.289> out<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.619> here<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:23.189> one<00:00:23.369> nice<00:00:23.789> need

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
an out of the box we can go into here

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.860 
an out of the box we can go into here
push<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.710> tablet<00:00:36.140> pull<00:00:37.140> out<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.739> wires

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.190 

was<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> little<00:00:43.110> stiff<00:00:44.510> okay<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.930> one

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
was a little stiff okay and on this one

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.610 
was a little stiff okay and on this one
we<00:00:46.410> want<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.649> remember<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:48.719> blue<00:00:49.410> wire

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
we want to remember that the blue wire

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.410 
we want to remember that the blue wire
with<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> stripe<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> red<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
with the stripe is going to the red and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.360 
with the stripe is going to the red and
the<00:00:54.420> two<00:00:54.690> blue<00:00:54.960> wires<00:00:55.199> with<00:00:55.559> no<00:00:55.680> stripe<00:00:56.010> is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the two blue wires with no stripe is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.430 
the two blue wires with no stripe is
going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> block<00:00:57.180> which<00:00:58.050> would<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.320> our

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
going to the block which would be our

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.209 
going to the block which would be our
positive<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.039> our<00:00:59.219> negative<00:01:01.039> now<00:01:02.039> that

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
positive and our negative now that

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.500 
positive and our negative now that
everything<00:01:02.550> has<00:01:02.579> been<00:01:02.760> removed<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.390> we're

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
everything has been removed and we're

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.440 
everything has been removed and we're
left<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.290> our<00:01:04.439> empty<00:01:04.799> shell<00:01:05.150> we're<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
left with our empty shell we're going to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.469 
left with our empty shell we're going to
take<00:01:06.659> our<00:01:06.900> material<00:01:07.970> we're<00:01:08.970> lay<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.299> right<00:01:09.330> on

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
take our material we're lay it right on

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.830 
take our material we're lay it right on
top<00:01:09.780> feel<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> edges<00:01:11.659> we're<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.780> to

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
top feel that the edges we're going to

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.719 
top feel that the edges we're going to
be<00:01:12.930> clear<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.830> get<00:01:13.950> them<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> center<00:01:14.549> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
be clear and get them in the center of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.249 
be clear and get them in the center of
this<00:01:15.409> then<00:01:17.150> we're<00:01:18.150> gonna<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.990> we're<00:01:19.200> gonna

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
this then we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.539 
this then we're gonna do is we're gonna
hold<00:01:19.650> down<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.619> see<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.100> indent

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
hold down so that you can see the indent

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.240 
hold down so that you can see the indent
right<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> circle<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:26.070> then

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
right here from the circle and then

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.340 
right here from the circle and then
we're<00:01:26.369> gonna<00:01:26.460> take<00:01:26.759> our<00:01:26.909> pen<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:28.049> we're<00:01:28.200> gonna

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
we're gonna take our pen and we're gonna

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.039 
we're gonna take our pen and we're gonna
follow<00:01:28.740> an<00:01:29.340> indentation<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:30.150> around<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
follow an indentation all around and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.649 
follow an indentation all around and
make<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> circle<00:01:32.150> before<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.270> start<00:01:33.540> drawing

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
make a circle before you start drawing

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.149 
make a circle before you start drawing
your<00:01:33.900> hole<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.380> might<00:01:34.650> want<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> tape<00:01:35.130> down

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
your hole you might want to tape down

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.390 
your hole you might want to tape down
the<00:01:35.930> material<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.740> doesn't<00:01:38.009> move<00:01:38.130> while

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the material so it doesn't move while

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.700 
the material so it doesn't move while
you're<00:01:38.490> drawing<00:01:39.110> now<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.259> we<00:01:40.320> got<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
you're drawing now that we got the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.359 
you're drawing now that we got the
circle<00:01:41.810> drawn<00:01:42.810> out<00:01:43.020> from<00:01:43.409> imprinting<00:01:44.130> down

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
circle drawn out from imprinting down

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.690 
circle drawn out from imprinting down
and<00:01:44.670> seeing<00:01:45.149> where<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> crease<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:46.549> we<00:01:47.549> would

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and seeing where the crease is we would

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.520 
and seeing where the crease is we would
now<00:01:47.850> be<00:01:48.299> able<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.570> cut<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
now be able to cut out and know the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.910 
now be able to cut out and know the
entertainment<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.610> circle<00:01:51.619> instead<00:01:52.619> what

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
entertainment of the circle instead what

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.249 
entertainment of the circle instead what
we're<00:01:53.009> gonna<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:54.329> we're<00:01:54.479> gonna<00:01:54.540> take<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
we're gonna do is we're gonna take the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.429 
we're gonna do is we're gonna take the
sub<00:01:55.590> turn<00:01:56.399> upside<00:01:56.759> down<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.020> then

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
sub turn upside down on that and then

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.410 
sub turn upside down on that and then
draw<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> circle<00:01:58.979> around<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.399> once<00:02:00.270> you've

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
draw a circle around it once you've

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.030 
draw a circle around it once you've
traced<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> outer<00:02:01.259> diameter<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
traced it to the outer diameter or the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.219 
traced it to the outer diameter or the
sub<00:02:02.369> you'll<00:02:02.969> now<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.149> your<00:02:03.479> inner<00:02:03.719> diameter

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
sub you'll now have your inner diameter

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.709 
sub you'll now have your inner diameter
and<00:02:04.439> outer<00:02:04.619> diameter<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.280> your<00:02:06.000> gasket<00:02:06.509> for

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
and outer diameter of your gasket for
