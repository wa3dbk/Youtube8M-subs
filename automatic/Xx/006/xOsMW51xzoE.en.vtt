you guys let us review the AK 971 now
this<00:00:21.590> gun<00:00:21.800> was<00:00:21.920> suggested<00:00:22.460> by<00:00:22.609> hard<00:00:22.910> play<00:00:23.150> 01

this gun was suggested by hard play 01

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.839 
this gun was suggested by hard play 01
with<00:00:24.170> probably<00:00:24.740> the<00:00:24.859> shortest<00:00:25.099> comment<00:00:25.699> ever

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
with probably the shortest comment ever

made but whatever starting off with the

meters<00:00:43.010> you'll<00:00:43.909> find<00:00:44.089> yourself<00:00:44.269> winning<00:00:44.960> most

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350

gunfights<00:00:46.010> up<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.729> medium<00:00:46.879> ranges<00:00:47.449> while

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
gunfights up to medium ranges while

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.140 
gunfights up to medium ranges while
using<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.110> AK<00:00:48.559> because<00:00:49.220> it<00:00:49.369> simply<00:00:49.699> made<00:00:49.909> for

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
using the AK because it simply made for

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.969 
using the AK because it simply made for
it<00:00:50.269> though<00:00:50.540> a<00:00:50.570> downside<00:00:51.170> compared<00:00:51.680> to<00:00:51.860> the

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
auto rifles is a long reload time at

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.079 
auto rifles is a long reload time at
close<00:00:54.470> ranges<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.040> typically<00:00:55.430> want<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.850> fast

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
close ranges you typically want the fast

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.119 
close ranges you typically want the fast
reloading<00:00:56.600> weapon<00:00:56.960> but<00:00:57.440> with<00:00:57.619> a<00:00:57.650> little<00:00:57.890> bit

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
reloading weapon but with a little bit

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.399 
reloading weapon but with a little bit
of<00:00:58.159> practice<00:00:58.820> you<00:00:59.269> will<00:00:59.299> easily<00:00:59.600> learn<00:01:00.049> how<00:01:00.350> to

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
of practice you will easily learn how to

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.219 
of practice you will easily learn how to
reload<00:01:00.799> properly<00:01:01.430> so<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.909> AEK<00:01:02.330> devastates<00:01:03.019> up

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
reload properly so the AEK devastates up

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.140 
reload properly so the AEK devastates up
close<00:01:03.500> with<00:01:03.769> an<00:01:03.920> outstanding<00:01:04.580> damage<00:01:04.939> output

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
close with an outstanding damage output

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.600 
close with an outstanding damage output
we<00:01:05.600> get<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:06.020> but<00:01:06.410> on<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.650> flip<00:01:06.860> side<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.460> high

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
we get it but on the flip side the high

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.520 
we get it but on the flip side the high
rate<00:01:07.790> of<00:01:07.820> fire<00:01:07.970> can<00:01:08.570> make<00:01:08.750> medium<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.320> long

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
rate of fire can make medium to long

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.410 
rate of fire can make medium to long
range<00:01:09.560> shooting<00:01:10.040> difficult<00:01:10.760> it<00:01:10.970> has<00:01:11.030> low

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
range shooting difficult it has low

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.750 
range shooting difficult it has low
vertical<00:01:11.930> recoil<00:01:12.110> at<00:01:12.410> 0.2<00:01:13.160> but<00:01:13.610> the

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
vertical recoil at 0.2 but the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.720 
vertical recoil at 0.2 but the
horizontal<00:01:14.480> drift<00:01:14.720> is<00:01:14.960> at<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.110> high<00:01:15.410> 0.5<00:01:16.340> left

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
horizontal drift is at a high 0.5 left

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.990 
horizontal drift is at a high 0.5 left
to<00:01:17.150> 0.3<00:01:17.840> right<00:01:18.110> now<00:01:18.800> it<00:01:18.950> might<00:01:19.130> sound<00:01:19.430> bad<00:01:19.730> to

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
to 0.3 right now it might sound bad to

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.640 
to 0.3 right now it might sound bad to
begin<00:01:20.150> with<00:01:20.510> but<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:21.020> actually<00:01:21.410> a<00:01:21.440> good

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
begin with but it's actually a good

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.830 
begin with but it's actually a good
recoil<00:01:22.160> pattern<00:01:22.520> once<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.060> being<00:01:23.330> stronger

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
recoil pattern once I being stronger

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.120 
recoil pattern once I being stronger
than<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.200> other<00:01:24.350> we'll<00:01:24.800> give<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:24.980> a

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
than the other we'll give it a

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.040 
than the other we'll give it a
predictable<00:01:25.730> recoil<00:01:26.210> that<00:01:26.480> means<00:01:26.720> that<00:01:26.810> we

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
predictable recoil that means that we

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.380 
predictable recoil that means that we
will<00:01:27.200> be<00:01:27.320> able<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.800> shoot<00:01:28.100> precisely<00:01:28.670> after<00:01:29.360> a

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
will be able to shoot precisely after a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.120 
will be able to shoot precisely after a
while<00:01:29.510> of<00:01:29.540> practice<00:01:30.110> it's<00:01:30.350> all<00:01:30.530> in<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.770> muscle

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
while of practice it's all in the muscle

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.040 
while of practice it's all in the muscle
memory<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:31.940> this<00:01:32.150> is<00:01:32.300> how<00:01:32.450> you'll<00:01:32.630> want<00:01:32.900> to

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
memory so this is how you'll want to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.470 
memory so this is how you'll want to
shoot<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.500> AEK<00:01:33.950> let's<00:01:34.790> have<00:01:34.970> a<00:01:35.000> look<00:01:35.210> at<00:01:35.360> the

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
shoot the AEK let's have a look at the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.690 
shoot the AEK let's have a look at the
recoil<00:01:35.900> first<00:01:38.620> now<00:01:39.620> as<00:01:39.680> we<00:01:39.830> can<00:01:39.980> see<00:01:40.190> it<00:01:40.460> goes

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
recoil first now as we can see it goes

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.110 
recoil first now as we can see it goes
straight<00:01:40.970> up<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.750> left<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.760> it<00:01:43.760> fires

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
straight up to the left and it fires

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.950 
straight up to the left and it fires
pretty<00:01:44.300> fast<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:46.490> we<00:01:47.060> want<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.330> control<00:01:47.780> this

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
pretty fast so we want to control this

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.040 
pretty fast so we want to control this
as<00:01:48.229> good<00:01:48.470> as<00:01:48.620> possible<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.420> there<00:01:50.420> are<00:01:50.659> really

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
as good as possible and there are really

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.320 
as good as possible and there are really
no<00:01:51.229> tips<00:01:51.680> except<00:01:52.190> for<00:01:52.250> practice<00:01:52.880> because<00:01:53.180> it's

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
no tips except for practice because it's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.210 
no tips except for practice because it's
all<00:01:53.510> about<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.960> muscle<00:01:54.320> memory<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:54.860> builds

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
all about the muscle memory that builds

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.480 
all about the muscle memory that builds
up<00:01:55.340> with<00:01:55.520> time<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.060> practice<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.340> is

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
up with time and practice so this is

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.730 
up with time and practice so this is
what<00:01:58.729> I've<00:01:58.850> gotten<00:01:59.240> so<00:01:59.450> far<00:02:02.470> obviously<00:02:03.470> not

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
what I've gotten so far obviously not

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.340 
what I've gotten so far obviously not
the<00:02:03.950> best<00:02:04.159> I<00:02:04.460> don't<00:02:05.150> really<00:02:05.479> use<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:05.840> gun<00:02:06.080> I

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
the best I don't really use this gun I

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.589 
the best I don't really use this gun I
like<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.979> use<00:02:07.159> alternative<00:02:07.909> weapons<00:02:08.299> because

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
like to use alternative weapons because

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.930 
like to use alternative weapons because
I<00:02:08.720> often<00:02:08.840> get<00:02:09.080> called<00:02:09.319> a<00:02:09.409> noob<00:02:09.649> yes<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.759> does

my feelings as well
it<00:02:15.230> doesn't<00:02:15.890> hum<00:02:16.480> now<00:02:17.480> let<00:02:17.690> me<00:02:17.720> try<00:02:17.959> again<00:02:19.690> as

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
it doesn't hum now let me try again as

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.809 
it doesn't hum now let me try again as
you<00:02:22.040> can<00:02:22.160> see<00:02:22.340> I'm<00:02:22.459> firing<00:02:22.790> this<00:02:23.060> as<00:02:23.239> birth<00:02:23.739> so

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
you can see I'm firing this as birth so

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.460 
you can see I'm firing this as birth so
we<00:02:25.819> basically<00:02:26.300> get<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.870> best<00:02:27.050> result

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
we basically get the best result

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.229 
we basically get the best result
possible<00:02:27.530> as<00:02:28.129> you<00:02:28.250> can<00:02:28.400> see<00:02:28.610> there<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.879> not

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
possible as you can see there is not

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.410 
possible as you can see there is not
much<00:02:29.480> spread<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.709> yeah<00:02:31.310> let's<00:02:31.910> discuss<00:02:32.269> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
much spread so yeah let's discuss the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.869 
much spread so yeah let's discuss the
attachments<00:02:33.010> alright<00:02:34.010> as<00:02:34.160> for<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.430> last<00:02:34.640> part

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
attachments alright as for the last part

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.070 
attachments alright as for the last part
the<00:02:35.120> attachments<00:02:35.629> are<00:02:35.720> easy<00:02:35.930> and

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
the attachments are easy and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.259 
the attachments are easy and
straightforward<00:02:36.410> for<00:02:37.190> obvious<00:02:37.280> reasons<00:02:37.879> non

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
straightforward for obvious reasons non

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.300 
straightforward for obvious reasons non
magnification<00:02:39.080> sites<00:02:39.349> work<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.799> best<00:02:40.010> and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
magnification sites work the best and

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.030 
magnification sites work the best and
thurs<00:02:40.670> I'd<00:02:40.940> rather<00:02:41.180> pick<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.629> cobra<00:02:42.049> RDS<00:02:42.769> or

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
thurs I'd rather pick the cobra RDS or

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.250 
thurs I'd rather pick the cobra RDS or
our<00:02:43.340> insights<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:44.030> personally<00:02:44.810> vary<00:02:45.019> between

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
our insights I personally vary between

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.800 
our insights I personally vary between
the<00:02:45.590> co<00:02:45.769> Brandi<00:02:46.160> are<00:02:46.250> incites<00:02:46.670> now<00:02:47.000> there's<00:02:47.569> no

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
the co Brandi are incites now there's no

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.960 
the co Brandi are incites now there's no
reason<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.260> use<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.769> errands<00:02:49.069> but<00:02:49.549> I<00:02:49.610> think

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
reason to use the errands but I think

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.030 
reason to use the errands but I think
they<00:02:50.120> look<00:02:50.269> amazing<00:02:50.569> so<00:02:51.049> it<00:02:51.170> really<00:02:51.470> just<00:02:51.590> fits

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
they look amazing so it really just fits

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.440 
they look amazing so it really just fits
my<00:02:52.190> play<00:02:52.400> style<00:02:52.640> makes<00:02:52.910> me<00:02:53.060> feel<00:02:53.239> like<00:02:53.269> a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
my play style makes me feel like a

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.660 
my play style makes me feel like a
badass<00:02:53.750> as<00:02:54.620> for<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.890> second<00:02:55.280> slot<00:02:55.459> the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
badass as for the second slot the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.880 
badass as for the second slot the
foregrip<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.239> almost<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:56.750> necessity<00:02:56.890> there's

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
foregrip is almost a necessity there's

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.069 
foregrip is almost a necessity there's
no<00:02:58.069> point<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.610> bipod<00:02:59.060> with<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.390> AK<00:02:59.510> and

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
no point to the bipod with the AK and

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.140 
no point to the bipod with the AK and
the<00:03:00.410> horizontal<00:03:00.620> recoil<00:03:01.129> is<00:03:01.459> high<00:03:01.670> so<00:03:02.090> the

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
the horizontal recoil is high so the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.780 
the horizontal recoil is high so the
foregrip<00:03:02.569> is<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.810> no-brainer<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.769> diaz<00:03:04.190> accuracy

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
foregrip is a no-brainer a diaz accuracy

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.819 
foregrip is a no-brainer a diaz accuracy
will<00:03:04.970> slightly<00:03:05.329> be<00:03:05.660> affected<00:03:06.170> but<00:03:06.530> it's<00:03:06.709> of

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
will slightly be affected but it's of

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.009 
will slightly be affected but it's of
little<00:03:06.860> significance<00:03:07.420> now<00:03:08.420> since<00:03:08.660> we<00:03:08.810> put<00:03:08.989> a

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
little significance now since we put a

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.660 
little significance now since we put a
full<00:03:09.260> grip<00:03:09.410> on<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.950> best<00:03:10.129> choice<00:03:10.400> would<00:03:10.610> be

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
full grip on it the best choice would be

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.850 
full grip on it the best choice would be
a<00:03:10.819> heavy<00:03:11.090> barrel<00:03:11.450> not<00:03:11.900> only<00:03:12.049> does<00:03:12.349> it<00:03:12.410> increase

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
a heavy barrel not only does it increase

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.770 
a heavy barrel not only does it increase
the<00:03:13.190> damage<00:03:13.370> over<00:03:13.819> range<00:03:14.060> but<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.629> also

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
the damage over range but it also

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.449 
the damage over range but it also
increases<00:03:15.110> bullet<00:03:15.650> velocity<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:16.280> day<00:03:16.400> and

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
increases bullet velocity and day and

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.970 
increases bullet velocity and day and
accuracy<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:18.140> being<00:03:18.379> said<00:03:18.530> I'm<00:03:18.709> really

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
accuracy that being said I'm really

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.289 
accuracy that being said I'm really
happy<00:03:19.220> with<00:03:19.459> all<00:03:19.639> the<00:03:19.760> support<00:03:20.180> I'm<00:03:20.269> getting
