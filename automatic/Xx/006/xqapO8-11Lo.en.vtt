00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
impression well I Kendall I probably

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.170 
impression well I Kendall I probably
adds<00:03:31.130> pressure<00:03:31.310> because<00:03:31.700> they<00:03:31.849> don't<00:03:32.120> have

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
adds pressure because they don't have

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.110 
adds pressure because they don't have
really<00:03:32.630> anything<00:03:33.079> to<00:03:33.380> lose<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.919> I<00:03:34.519> thought

Friday first first regular season game
and<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.639> think<00:03:56.090> we<00:03:56.419> just<00:03:56.450> have<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.900> find<00:03:57.349> find

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
and I think we just have to find find

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.009 
and I think we just have to find find
find<00:03:58.160> our<00:03:58.459> game<00:03:58.730> there<00:03:59.329> are<00:03:59.419> so<00:03:59.569> many<00:03:59.599> areas

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
find our game there are so many areas

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.780 
find our game there are so many areas
very<00:04:00.200> we<00:04:00.739> think<00:04:00.950> we<00:04:01.040> still<00:04:01.220> have<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.549> improve

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
very we think we still have to improve

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.970 
very we think we still have to improve
install<00:04:02.180> canning<00:04:02.480> proof<00:04:02.750> but<00:04:02.989> yes<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.769> last

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
install canning proof but yes the last

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.860 
install canning proof but yes the last

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
test before the season starts so it's

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.040 
test before the season starts so it's
definitely<00:04:06.230> an<00:04:06.319> important<00:04:06.680> game<00:04:06.739> for<00:04:06.799> us
