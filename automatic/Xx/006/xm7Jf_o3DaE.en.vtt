00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.819
 moin moin guys and girls again 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.059
 inspiration and today with another 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.920
 cod goes video as you can see i have 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.080
 here it is a little gameplay 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.370
 just a small part 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.599
 and I have a little bit now 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.460
 I will draw the let's play 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.920
 not going to do that now though 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.720
 I now have more tips and tricks videos 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.400
 just make of what I do 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.529
 personally experience yes we have here or 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.660
 I have now sought out perks 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.489
 because there are so many 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.140
 parks and I already had a few 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.700
 people who wrote me too 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.640
 or friends who asked me 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.270
 hediger something for mountain she plays with 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.050
 What kind of weapon do you have to play ? 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.440
 highlight two things as you can 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.300
 both not at the same time or maybe 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.539
 should not play at the same time 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.809
 You see, I have sorry here I have 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.190
 grad monster drunk as you have seen 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.629
 I just here the extras 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.390
 listed and there are stalkers and that 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.860
 is very very important that is so 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.500
 like the third m at black ops that 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.810
 I was not sure that was like 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.380
 it is almost and then it is 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.250
 stalker and faster if run 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.729
 you're aiming at creating in 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.130
 cod black ops 2 and that's what you need 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.930
 just pretty much with the primary weapons 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.470
 if you want to be good if you are fast 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.650
 wants to get through and just with one 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.869
 Streaking is sometimes kept in often 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.320
 melee you go against the shorter one 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.479
 eat 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.369
 and here it just looks like 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.799
 her just a gun has a bigger one 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.780
 rifle makes stalker on it quasi as 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.600
 Perks and you are against smbs in the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.970
 melee win the mobility is here 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.860
 all that means you are stalker on it 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.500
 for example as''ll make you faster 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.110
 pull so you aim faster 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.820
 you can and then you can for example 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.070
 to prepare 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.740
 that's when he sprinted 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.179
 could achieve it sooner than 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.580
 Last time I would like you then for example 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.950
 to load quickly or just 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.260
 unlimited fuel 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.610
 you could also do things like them 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.870
 Do not make a fall hurt 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.769
 but I would personally now 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.450
 now I always had to think about it 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.790
 have another point I would now 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.819
 maybe not a fall 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.680
 hurt so I would play more now 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.489
 this means that faster 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.230
 Sprint I can load just after that 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.700
 Sprint can achieve faster 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.440
 that the weapon is ready soon 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.890
 I can achieve faster overall 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.380
 that I can aim for faster when 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.090
 So I run faster 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.750
 when I aim and that I do not fall 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.970
 hurt 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.370
 and so I will play further 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.440
 I play the han i beds all the time 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.610
 I think so, I would say 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.140
 this weapon is abnormally good it is already 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.180
 automatically a silencer 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.000
 integrated in the water you have to quasi 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.790
 you do not buy it on it anymore 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.980
 I think the course is nine points 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.959
 you got points as well 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.610
 very very slowly the leveling goes too 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.799
 not exactly fast I am now 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.010
 currently level 11 but I play today 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.709
 a bit longer i do 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.569
 in between videos but I play 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.470
 that's how it's been going on for quite some time 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.030
 clearly slower and yes I would 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.209
 Just say you try that yourself 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.100
 time and this in this work is just 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.560
 in my opinion very very important 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.319
 and what we are doing right now 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.600
 Everyone is starting to play 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.910
 the most important burke is mine 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.970
 opinion of what really really important 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.900
 is good for you is this is 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.209
 here dropouts that means like there 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.609
 below is not for satcom and radar 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.489
 Assign on the overview card 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.079
 everyone starts now with the 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.480
 sat consumer radar 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.340
 everyone really plays each and every three 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.840
 Degrees are really about creating that 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.940
 It is actually fasting duration 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.260
 radar on top of the map and so on 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.150
 you just do not get ridiculed anymore 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.720
 thinking that means it like that 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.820
 ghost in black ops 1 currently easy 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.859
 invisible on the map and that 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.659
 At least get us now 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.030
 in the first two weeks three 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:28.070
 huge lead over to 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.590
 in it because they just do not know hey 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.570
 where are you now think hey nadal 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.480
 there is no bus you know maybe 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.300
 not anymore from the park and yes 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.650
 you can hide best 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.560
 I would say write me your own 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.810
 best weapon and your best work what you 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.720
 maybe already revealed in 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.550
 the comments and we will hear me 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.240
 Hope you like it, I'm out 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.240
 new inspiration
