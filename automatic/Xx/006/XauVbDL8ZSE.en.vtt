00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.010 

actually<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:20.210> this<00:02:20.240> song<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:22.370> cream<00:02:23.020> did

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
actually in this song the cream did

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.800 
actually in this song the cream did
elongate<00:02:24.820> keep<00:02:25.820> my<00:02:25.940> hair<00:02:26.120> long<00:02:26.270> gated<00:02:26.660> it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
elongate keep my hair long gated it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.700 
elongate keep my hair long gated it
moisturized<00:02:27.320> it<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:28.000> wouldn't<00:02:29.000> say<00:02:29.210> it's<00:02:32.710> the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
moisturized it I wouldn't say it's the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.070 
moisturized it I wouldn't say it's the
best<00:02:33.740> moisturizer<00:02:34.340> but<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.300> didn't<00:02:35.750> shrink<00:02:35.900> my

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
best moisturizer but it didn't shrink my

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:50.150 
best moisturizer but it didn't shrink my
hair<00:02:36.260> up<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.590> really<00:02:36.860> like<00:02:37.010> that

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.910 

and<00:02:50.610> because<00:02:51.060> my<00:02:51.090> hair<00:02:51.360> has<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.690> look<00:02:51.920> justice

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
and because my hair has to look justice

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.710 
and because my hair has to look justice
if<00:02:53.070> equate<00:02:53.400> i'm<00:02:53.700> not<00:02:53.940> going<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:56.450> divide<00:02:57.450> them

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
if equate i'm not going to divide them

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.820 
if equate i'm not going to divide them
any<00:02:57.870> more<00:02:58.110> than<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:59.090> but<00:03:00.090> overall<00:03:00.900> i<00:03:01.350> like<00:03:01.680> it

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
any more than this but overall i like it

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.920 
any more than this but overall i like it
because<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.310> kept<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:03.030> elongated<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.720> link

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
because it's kept the elongated the link

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.840 
because it's kept the elongated the link
so<00:03:07.080> i<00:03:07.110> can<00:03:07.140> actually<00:03:07.440> see<00:03:07.860> my<00:03:08.010> length<00:03:08.250> whereas

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
so i can actually see my length whereas

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.220 
so i can actually see my length whereas
usually<00:03:09.240> when<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.450> do<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.630> wet<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:10.020> just

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
usually when you do it wet it just

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.530 
usually when you do it wet it just
