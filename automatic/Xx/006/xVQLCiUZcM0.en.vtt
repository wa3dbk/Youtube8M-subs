00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 it can be done so connect it 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:12.170
 directly from the chip 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:17.600
 the ignition switch we do this is the cleat on the top 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:23.820
 there is a constant plus food 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:29.699
 cleaned out patients have cute frolov 2 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:35.000
 square everywhere understands over 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:38.239
 five minutes and this wire just pull 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.239
 over here 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:52.860
 here he comes too easy 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:56.700
 here, too, this one just understands 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:04.250
 the wire now we are then moving in not 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:08.360
 dangling standard cigarette lighter 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.700
 Does not break, that is, this lighting 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.690
 central wire brass terminal is 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.770
 plus here it is black that is just a terminal 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:25.430
 remove use and not negative 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:29.160
 the wire is like this and this wire is positive 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.350
 straight will go here through 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.350
 fuse we will put through uid 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:46.229
 temper kolenochki collecting all back 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.500
 don't forget to grease the rusted fell 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.500
 down below 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.499
 the key is not the ignition 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:08.959
 zaryadochka is for me, and we also 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.679
 compressor and everything else that is 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.830
 patron 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.950
 failure works directly as in the classics 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.910
 without switching when keepers 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.549
 put 15 amp that is enough 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:28.879
 to connect compressors and any 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:33.200
 other equipment is probably the way 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.799
 Yes, the posting here is not tied to the regular but not 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.720
 was cutting 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:44.329
 and the chip remained inside that is if 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.599
 If you wish, you can breathe out and do as 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.599
 It was
