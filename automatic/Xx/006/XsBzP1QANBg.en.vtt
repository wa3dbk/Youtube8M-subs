is if you default foot swing so it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.300

basically means the automatically you

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.770 
basically means the automatically you
will<00:00:55.460> have<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:55.760> on<00:00:55.940> that<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:56.180> don't<00:00:56.570> have<00:00:56.690> to

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
will have it on that you don't have to

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.990 
will have it on that you don't have to
choose<00:00:57.020> it<00:00:57.230> just<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:57.530> our<00:00:57.680> suppose<00:00:58.070> if<00:00:58.400> you

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
choose it just so our suppose if you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.150 
choose it just so our suppose if you
only<00:00:59.240> ever<00:00:59.420> want<00:00:59.810> to<00:00:59.870> do<00:01:00.020> slow<00:01:00.290> shots<00:01:00.620> then<00:01:00.890> you

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
only ever want to do slow shots then you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.790 
only ever want to do slow shots then you
know<00:01:01.840> other<00:01:02.840> than<00:01:03.080> that<00:01:03.260> though<00:01:03.410> I<00:01:03.440> that's

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
know other than that though I that's

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.840 
know other than that though I that's
here<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.100> put<00:01:04.250> your<00:01:04.309> pants<00:01:04.549> you<00:01:04.729> can

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
here to put your pants you can

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.490 
here to put your pants you can
opportunity<00:01:05.299> spin<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:05.869> if<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.080> want<00:01:06.259> every

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
opportunity spin so if you want every

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.040 
opportunity spin so if you want every
shot<00:01:06.710> down<00:01:06.890> spin<00:01:07.280> on<00:01:07.400> it<00:01:07.550> too<00:01:07.700> then<00:01:07.880> that's<00:01:08.870> why

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
shot down spin on it too then that's why

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.940 
shot down spin on it too then that's why
I<00:01:09.080> think<00:01:09.230> the<00:01:09.440> options<00:01:09.560> are<00:01:09.860> basically

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
I think the options are basically

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.490 
I think the options are basically
useless<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:11.240> can<00:01:11.420> choose<00:01:11.540> either<00:01:11.570> stance<00:01:12.170> and

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
useless you can choose either stance and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.140 
useless you can choose either stance and
you<00:01:12.590> can<00:01:12.740> see<00:01:12.890> what<00:01:13.130> your<00:01:13.220> prize<00:01:13.400> money<00:01:13.430> is<00:01:13.850> and

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
you can see what your prize money is and

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.130 
you can see what your prize money is and
you<00:01:14.270> can<00:01:14.480> Mecosta

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
you can Mecosta

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.270 
you can Mecosta
all<00:01:15.440> point<00:01:15.620> of<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.770> game<00:01:15.890> is<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.130> get<00:01:16.250> a

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.630 
starts moving and that's your power make
at<00:03:10.329> it<00:03:10.989> I<00:03:11.410> will<00:03:11.829> show<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:12.130> again<00:03:12.370> as<00:03:12.549> I'm

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
at it I will show this again as I'm

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.100 
at it I will show this again as I'm
explaining<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:13.239> but<00:03:13.420> unfortunately<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.930> bar

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
explaining it but unfortunately the bar

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.080 
explaining it but unfortunately the bar
moves<00:03:14.380> like<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.769> fast<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.400> may<00:03:15.610> not<00:03:15.730> be<00:03:15.880> able<00:03:15.940> to

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
moves like the fast I may not be able to

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.030 
moves like the fast I may not be able to
explain<00:03:16.480> a<00:03:16.540> fast<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:16.989> often<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.709> we<00:03:17.799> have<00:03:17.920> to

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
explain a fast and often and we have to

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.009 
explain a fast and often and we have to
do<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.190> couple<00:03:18.370> takes<00:03:18.640> at<00:03:18.850> this<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.870> hit<00:03:19.989> the

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
do a couple takes at this so you hit the

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.750 
do a couple takes at this so you hit the
button<00:03:20.320> lights<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:20.890> power<00:03:21.070> meter<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.640> hit

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
button lights you power meter you hit

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.539 
button lights you power meter you hit
the<00:03:21.850> two<00:03:22.000> button<00:03:22.269> again<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.980> then<00:03:23.980> that

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
the two button again and then that

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:25.920 
the two button again and then that
basically<00:03:24.880> chooses<00:03:25.360> how<00:03:25.450> much<00:03:25.570> power<00:03:25.780> you

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
basically chooses how much power you

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.979 
basically chooses how much power you
want<00:03:26.049> then<00:03:26.850> this<00:03:27.850> is<00:03:28.360> second<00:03:28.720> part<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:28.900> the

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
want then this is second part of the

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.569 
want then this is second part of the
shot<00:03:29.200> because<00:03:29.380> as<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.590> see<00:03:29.829> it<00:03:29.890> moves<00:03:30.160> so<00:03:30.370> fast

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
shot because as I see it moves so fast

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.009 
shot because as I see it moves so fast
you<00:03:30.790> can't<00:03:31.030> do<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.390> saw<00:03:31.510> black<00:03:31.750> sea<00:03:31.840> power

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
you can't do it you saw black sea power

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.170 
you can't do it you saw black sea power
chosen<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:33.040> then<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.519> other<00:03:33.700> way<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:33.880> was

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
chosen and then the other way I was

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.789 
chosen and then the other way I was
wings<00:03:34.810> across<00:03:35.079> really<00:03:35.440> fast

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
wings across really fast

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.259 
wings across really fast
and<00:03:35.890> basically<00:03:36.489> you've<00:03:36.760> got<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.030> white

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
and basically you've got that white

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.060 
and basically you've got that white
block<00:03:37.600> there<00:03:37.870> which<00:03:38.110> depending<00:03:38.620> on<00:03:38.709> what<00:03:38.829> shot

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
block there which depending on what shot

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.410 
block there which depending on what shot
you've<00:03:39.220> got<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.640> sounds<00:03:39.880> going<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.090> be<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.180> big

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
you've got it sounds going to be a big

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.479 
you've got it sounds going to be a big
block<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:41.019> tiny<00:03:41.260> little<00:03:41.470> line<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.010> you've

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
block of a tiny little line and you've

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.920 
block of a tiny little line and you've
got<00:03:42.640> a<00:03:42.670> hit<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:43.000> button<00:03:43.239> again<00:03:43.450> when<00:03:43.810> you

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
got a hit to button again when you

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.449 
got a hit to button again when you
caused<00:03:44.140> us<00:03:44.320> to<00:03:44.470> outline<00:03:44.829> because<00:03:45.190> that's<00:03:45.370> your

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
caused us to outline because that's your

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.030 
caused us to outline because that's your
accuracy<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.480> if<00:03:46.570> you<00:03:46.660> go

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
accuracy so if you go

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.220 
accuracy so if you go
left<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.909> the<00:03:48.000> white<00:03:48.150> book<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.599> want<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.870> slice

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
left of the white book you want to slice

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.140 
left of the white book you want to slice
a<00:03:49.260> little<00:03:49.590> bit<00:03:49.709> one<00:03:50.099> way<00:03:50.129> to<00:03:50.370> go<00:03:50.670> right<00:03:50.879> then

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
a little bit one way to go right then

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.539 
a little bit one way to go right then
like<00:03:51.689> slap<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.140> saw<00:03:52.349> I'll<00:03:52.950> try<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.430> basically

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
like slap you saw I'll try and basically

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.190 
like slap you saw I'll try and basically
short<00:03:53.909> here<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.360> I've<00:03:54.480> hit<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.689> two<00:03:54.840> lets<00:03:55.110> me

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
short here so I've hit the two lets me

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.869 
short here so I've hit the two lets me
power<00:03:55.379> and<00:03:55.620> there's<00:03:55.860> me<00:03:56.069> shots<00:03:56.340> that's

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
power and there's me shots that's

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:57.350 
power and there's me shots that's
dead-on

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
dead-on

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.210 
dead-on
so<00:03:57.659> I<00:03:57.689> cause<00:03:57.989> pretty<00:03:58.379> much<00:03:58.620> straight<00:03:59.040> about

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
so I cause pretty much straight about

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.190 
so I cause pretty much straight about
scores<00:03:59.519> exactly<00:04:00.030> where<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.180> wanted<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.540> go<00:04:00.659> with

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
scores exactly where I wanted to go with

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.649 
scores exactly where I wanted to go with
the<00:04:01.379> power<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:01.799> chose<00:04:02.659> unfortunately

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
the power that I chose unfortunately

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:04.819 
the power that I chose unfortunately
though<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.750> hit<00:04:03.930> too<00:04:04.110> much<00:04:04.260> power<00:04:04.500> because<00:04:04.709> I'm

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
though I hit too much power because I'm

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:05.960 
though I hit too much power because I'm
not<00:04:05.010> really<00:04:05.190> concentrating<00:04:05.819> I'm<00:04:05.879> not

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
not really concentrating I'm not

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.130 
not really concentrating I'm not
actually<00:04:06.090> trying<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.510> beat<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.810> course<00:04:07.019> or

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
actually trying to beat of course or

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.390 
actually trying to beat of course or
anything<00:04:07.319> I'm<00:04:07.560> just<00:04:07.739> trying<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.010> explain<00:04:08.250> how

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
anything I'm just trying to explain how

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.180 
anything I'm just trying to explain how
the<00:04:08.459> shop<00:04:08.670> works<00:04:08.870> so<00:04:09.870> here<00:04:10.409> I'll<00:04:10.680> try<00:04:10.980> and

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
the shop works so here I'll try and

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.099 
the shop works so here I'll try and
slice<00:04:11.819> it<00:04:11.970> off<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.090> bit<00:04:12.299> so<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:14.670> can<00:04:14.970> also<00:04:15.180> share

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
slice it off a bit so you can also share

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.469 
slice it off a bit so you can also share
on<00:04:16.829> this<00:04:17.010> menu<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.430> can<00:04:17.699> hold<00:04:17.910> left<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.359> right

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
on this menu you can hold left and right

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.090 
on this menu you can hold left and right
the<00:04:18.660> lights<00:04:18.870> obviously<00:04:19.350> choose<00:04:19.620> where<00:04:20.010> you

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
the lights obviously choose where you

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.800 
the lights obviously choose where you
want<00:04:20.190> him<00:04:20.519> there<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.180> can<00:04:21.329> hold<00:04:21.539> up<00:04:21.660> and

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
ball so right here's there we go I've

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.020 
ball so right here's there we go I've
hit<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.720> far<00:04:28.139> too<00:04:28.380> lit<00:04:28.650> it's<00:04:29.010> it's<00:04:29.610> not<00:04:29.760> even

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
hit it far too lit it's it's not even

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.350 
hit it far too lit it's it's not even
moved

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
moved

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.200 
moved
we<00:04:30.479> shot<00:04:30.690> us<00:04:30.810> up<00:04:30.900> back<00:04:31.169> so<00:04:31.949> that's<00:04:32.820> basically

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
we shot us up back so that's basically

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.960 
we shot us up back so that's basically
how<00:04:33.389> they<00:04:33.479> shot<00:04:33.630> me<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:33.870> works<00:04:34.820> other<00:04:35.820> than

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
how they shot me it works other than

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.189 
how they shot me it works other than
that<00:04:36.090> there's<00:04:36.270> nothing<00:04:36.360> really<00:04:36.630> works<00:04:36.930> play

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
that there's nothing really works play

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.020 
that there's nothing really works play
and<00:04:37.380> I've<00:04:37.770> explained<00:04:38.370> already<00:04:38.669> that<00:04:38.880> this

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
and I've explained already that this

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.060 
and I've explained already that this
ain't<00:04:39.600> halls<00:04:39.870> on<00:04:40.080> each<00:04:40.199> courses<00:04:40.680> so<00:04:40.770> he<00:04:40.860> calls

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
ain't halls on each courses so he calls

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.320 
ain't halls on each courses so he calls
to<00:04:41.190> do<00:04:41.340> when<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.550> have<00:04:41.639> to<00:04:41.729> beat<00:04:41.850> cause<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.210> get

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
to do when you have to beat cause to get

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.360 
to do when you have to beat cause to get
prize<00:04:42.600> money<00:04:42.840> so<00:04:43.020> other<00:04:43.889> than<00:04:43.919> that<00:04:44.070> there's

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
prize money so other than that there's

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.520 
prize money so other than that there's
actually<00:04:44.669> nothing<00:04:44.850> else<00:04:45.180> is<00:04:45.330> here<00:04:45.479> and<00:04:45.690> I<00:04:45.810> like

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
actually nothing else is here and I like

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.689 
actually nothing else is here and I like
listening<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:46.830> music<00:04:46.919> for<00:04:47.250> a<00:04:47.310> little<00:04:47.460> bit<00:04:47.550> long

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
listening to music for a little bit long

00:04:47.699 --> 00:05:01.400 
listening to music for a little bit long
so<00:04:59.419> there<00:05:00.419> we<00:05:00.510> go<00:05:00.539> that's<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.810> bit<00:05:00.930> of<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.050> music

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
so there we go that's a bit of the music

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.900 
so there we go that's a bit of the music
and<00:05:01.560> on<00:05:01.949> this<00:05:02.099> section<00:05:02.430> of<00:05:02.520> it<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.699> sound

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
and on this section of it the sound

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.820 
and on this section of it the sound
effects<00:05:03.240> cuz<00:05:03.389> all<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.539> music<00:05:03.840> quits<00:05:04.080> now

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
effects cuz all the music quits now

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.640 
effects cuz all the music quits now
there<00:05:05.760> is<00:05:05.880> actually<00:05:06.300> one<00:05:06.479> thing<00:05:06.720> I<00:05:06.900> did<00:05:07.380> forget

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
there is actually one thing I did forget

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.430 
there is actually one thing I did forget
invention<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:08.400> yeah<00:05:09.150> I<00:05:09.720> almost<00:05:10.050> forgot<00:05:10.199> to

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
invention and yeah I almost forgot to

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.689 
invention and yeah I almost forgot to
mention<00:05:10.470> it<00:05:10.770> because<00:05:11.099> I<00:05:11.370> assume<00:05:11.669> that

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
mention it because I assume that

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.670 
mention it because I assume that
everyone<00:05:12.120> knows<00:05:12.270> of<00:05:12.660> golf<00:05:12.900> and<00:05:13.199> the<00:05:13.320> daughters

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
everyone knows of golf and the daughters

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.830 
everyone knows of golf and the daughters
so<00:05:14.310> basically<00:05:14.729> the<00:05:14.910> whole<00:05:14.940> point<00:05:15.300> is<00:05:15.479> this

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
so basically the whole point is this

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.200 
so basically the whole point is this
you're<00:05:16.620> getting<00:05:16.740> into<00:05:16.949> the<00:05:17.070> hauless<00:05:17.430> like<00:05:18.030> it

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
you're getting into the hauless like it

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.260 
you're getting into the hauless like it
and<00:05:18.360> it's<00:05:18.510> fewer<00:05:18.720> shots<00:05:18.930> as<00:05:19.110> you<00:05:19.199> can<00:05:19.380> and

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
and it's fewer shots as you can and

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.150 
and it's fewer shots as you can and
depending<00:05:21.270> on<00:05:21.300> how<00:05:21.510> your<00:05:22.229> part<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.740> basically

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
depending on how your part is basically

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.270 
depending on how your part is basically
like<00:05:23.669> it's<00:05:24.570> how<00:05:25.020> many<00:05:25.080> shots<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.919> people

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
like it's how many shots the people

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.430 
like it's how many shots the people
think<00:05:26.699> you<00:05:27.150> should<00:05:27.360> take<00:05:27.690> to<00:05:27.960> get<00:05:28.110> into<00:05:28.349> the

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
think you should take to get into the

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.649 
think you should take to get into the
horse<00:05:28.650> or<00:05:29.070> some<00:05:29.430> way<00:05:29.520> up<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.699> pathway<00:05:29.940> that

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
horse or some way up a pathway that

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.360 
horse or some way up a pathway that
means<00:05:30.930> they<00:05:31.169> think<00:05:31.500> it<00:05:31.710> should<00:05:31.740> take<00:05:32.130> two

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
means they think it should take two

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.430 
means they think it should take two
shots<00:05:32.699> to<00:05:32.940> get<00:05:33.090> so<00:05:33.510> easy<00:05:33.810> shots<00:05:34.050> again<00:05:34.260> in<00:05:34.380> the

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
shots to get so easy shots again in the

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.260 
shots to get so easy shots again in the
hall<00:05:34.620> if<00:05:35.010> you<00:05:35.310> get<00:05:35.490> one<00:05:35.699> shot<00:05:35.940> under<00:05:36.240> par

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
hall if you get one shot under par

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.879 
hall if you get one shot under par
that's<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:36.930> birdie<00:05:37.139> if<00:05:37.470> you<00:05:37.530> get<00:05:37.680> two<00:05:37.860> shots

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
that's a birdie if you get two shots

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.159 
that's a birdie if you get two shots
under<00:05:38.310> that's<00:05:38.490> an<00:05:38.639> eagle<00:05:38.970> I<00:05:39.180> believe<00:05:39.840> three

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
under that's an eagle I believe three

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.689 
under that's an eagle I believe three
shots<00:05:40.470> under<00:05:40.680> someone<00:05:41.070> like<00:05:41.190> an<00:05:41.310> albatross

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
bit of a rough there and you've got the

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.530 
bit of a rough there and you've got the
normal<00:06:04.890> playing<00:06:05.190> field<00:06:05.550> here<00:06:05.790> you've<00:06:06.420> also

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
normal playing field here you've also

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.060 
normal playing field here you've also
got<00:06:06.750> trees<00:06:07.020> and<00:06:07.230> other<00:06:07.320> obstacles<00:06:07.620> you've<00:06:07.950> got

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
got trees and other obstacles you've got

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.500 
got trees and other obstacles you've got
water<00:06:08.340> over<00:06:08.670> there<00:06:08.820> where<00:06:09.060> to<00:06:09.180> go<00:06:09.270> onto<00:06:09.420> the

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
water over there where to go onto the

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.140 
water over there where to go onto the
water<00:06:09.720> that<00:06:10.170> automatically<00:06:11.010> cancels<00:06:12.000> out

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
water that automatically cancels out

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.490 
water that automatically cancels out
with<00:06:12.240> another<00:06:12.420> shot<00:06:12.720> so<00:06:12.780> you<00:06:13.050> actually<00:06:13.230> get<00:06:13.440> a

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
with another shot so you actually get a

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.460 
with another shot so you actually get a
shot<00:06:13.710> penalty<00:06:14.070> for<00:06:14.220> that<00:06:15.080> so<00:06:16.080> that's<00:06:16.260> that

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
shot penalty for that so that's that
