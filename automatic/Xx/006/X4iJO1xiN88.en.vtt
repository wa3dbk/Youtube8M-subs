00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello and welcome everyone in this 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:10.440
 roulette recipe of the day and curry 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.780
 of lamb in the Indian for six people 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.400
 we need a kilogram of lamb in the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.910
 leg or in the poles three pots of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.070
 plain yogurt 2 onions 75 g butter 2 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.270
 cloves of garlic 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.850
 two teaspoons curry powder 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.860
 a teaspoon of coriander a 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.620
 cayenne pepper tip a hint 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.160
 coffee and a teaspoon of cumin 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.320
 in powder 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.140
 this sweet cardamom says nails 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.730
 clove 1 gram of saffron a stick of 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.650
 cinnamon and lucelle first step we go 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.450
 start with and march and garlic and 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.580
 onion 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.989
 ouch for me is simply 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.360
 crush it with the blah of the knife for 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.050
 remove the skin easily we cut it 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.800
 in two and we will remove the germ that 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.760
 is indigestible 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.900
 then we just go thin and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.900
 we do the same with the onion 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.900
 you have a thick bottomed casserole 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.159
 and we're going to melt the butter 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.159
 add garlic and onion 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.280
 we let it melt all that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.690
 gives us time to cut the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.170
 meat in pieces if it is not already 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.619
 I have to admit I have the least water 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.470
 bites of making garlic and onions are 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.470
 now well relaxed we will be able 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.700
 add the spices to start with the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.920
 salt the 4 spices we put the spices 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.649
 directly on the bottom of the casserole 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.240
 we lower the fire and on low fire we 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.950
 leave it for about a minute 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.810
 just the time to leave to the aromas of 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.810
 Spice time to exhale that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.080
 will be that the best cinnamon stick 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.759
 cloves and curry then 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.890
 nothing now there it feels divinely 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.539
 well we have the scent of spices that 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.740
 exhale then of course if the 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.619
 spices that you do not like you can 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.090
 replace them with something else 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.409
 the lamb is getting impatient 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.619
 this is the moment for him to enter 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.619
 scene 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.260
 and here we do not give him time 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.650
 of walleye we will immediately add the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.650
 yogurt 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.190
 we blend 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.620
 now we only have 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:30.170
 cover and go for two hours 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:35.970
 cooking on a soft fire I like that a little 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:38.520
 a lot passionately to the madness not the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.440
 Now all I love that show 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.090
 roulette recipes 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.280
 Moreover, we have done more than a hundred years 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.620
 remember for the ace entremont had 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.590
 made a better cake with hervÃ© 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.850
 cooking but suddenly more than 100 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.600
 receipts 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.100
 that makes a certain number of me 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.160
 I do not know which one was preferred 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.100
 to go we have one that you have preferred 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.140
 among all those, tell me in 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.230
 the promised comments that stays between 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.850
 we after two hours this is the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.380
 moment to add the rest of the spices 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.090
 so if you do not like finding 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.980
 whole spices in your dish like the 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.930
 clove or luz of cardamom 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.940
 what I advise you is to put 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.100
 that in a little muslin or so 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.820
 in a ball to infuse the one we put 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.270
 in the teapot we add pepper 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.740
 cayenne 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.390
 coriander seeds saffron 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.370
 if you ever helpful and saffron 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.050
 filaments the best is to do it 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.510
 brew for 10 minutes in a little 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.890
 Warm water is added cumin and finally 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.100
 the pods of cardamom 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.300
 so be careful trading like that it's a 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.410
 little damage to let but 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.340
 why because in fact small 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.790
 fragrant seeds they are to 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.140
 interior 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.270
 what I'm doing is that I give a 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.320
 little little scissors releases her small 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.320
 seeds and hop 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.920
 we mix and we cover and go for 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.720
 again 10 to 15 minutes of cooking 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.610
 nothing like a little basmati rice and 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.240
 fresh coriander to accompany 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.890

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.480

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.670
 we can prepare it full of 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.720
 different ways does not hesitate to the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.880
 say in the comments 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.100

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.230
