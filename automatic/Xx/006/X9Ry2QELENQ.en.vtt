on this move heavily the first few
chapters<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> paid<00:00:56.100> off<00:00:56.129> pretty<00:00:56.579> nicely

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
chapters and it paid off pretty nicely

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.420 
chapters and it paid off pretty nicely
the<00:00:57.600> storm<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.260> excellent<00:00:58.680> move<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.250> use

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the storm was an excellent move to use

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.010
