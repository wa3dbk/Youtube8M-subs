and<00:01:12.680> sometimes<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.920> need<00:01:14.070> technique<00:01:14.670> for

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
and sometimes we need technique for

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.520 
and sometimes we need technique for
having<00:01:15.240> an<00:01:15.360> area<00:01:15.689> where<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> units<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.350> to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.940 
this to be out it'll take about 15
seconds<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.730> capture<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:25.110> take<00:02:25.409> one's<00:02:25.590> 15

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
seconds to capture so it take one's 15

seconds the pender one time when you in
get<00:02:28.110> there<00:02:28.349> because<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.680> varies<00:02:28.890> because<00:02:29.159> your

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
get there because it varies because your

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.470 
get there because it varies because your

itself<00:02:30.720> every<00:02:31.110> 15<00:02:31.500> seconds<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:33.360> I'd<00:02:33.480> say<00:02:33.659> it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
itself every 15 seconds so I'd say it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.270 
itself every 15 seconds so I'd say it
takes<00:02:33.750> 15<00:02:34.230> seconds<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.680> capture<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:35.040> boogie

let's<00:02:40.799> say<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.069> can<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.430> ever<00:02:41.489> have<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:42.450> player

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
let's say we can I ever have it's player

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.270 
let's say we can I ever have it's player
area<00:02:44.390> now<00:02:45.390> we<00:02:45.450> could<00:02:45.629> set<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.319> we're

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
area now we could set this to we're

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.349 
area now we could set this to we're
going<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.459> use<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:48.000> player<00:02:49.549> meaning<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:50.819> it

will say if we when play 14 let that

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.039 
will say if we when play 14 let that
automatically<00:02:54.030> set<00:02:54.269> itself<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.660> player<00:02:54.840> 1

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
let's say we could do this since this

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.789 
let's say we could do this since this
instead<00:03:53.449> we<00:03:54.449> could<00:03:54.599> edit<00:03:54.780> this<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.440> we<00:03:55.680> could

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
instead we could edit this and we could

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.650 
instead we could edit this and we could
say<00:03:56.040> player<00:03:56.430> has<00:03:56.699> a<00:03:57.169> type<00:03:58.169> of<00:03:58.199> unit<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:59.660> this

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
say player has a type of unit so this

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.059 
say player has a type of unit so this
player<00:04:00.959> has<00:04:04.129> equal<00:04:05.129> to

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.140 
people don't do what we can do is you
can<00:04:45.680> copy<00:04:45.979> that<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.340> paste<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.789> and<00:04:46.910> we<00:04:47.000> can

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
can copy that and paste it and we can

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.570 
can copy that and paste it and we can
add<00:04:47.270> an<00:04:47.419> oar<00:04:47.630> in<00:04:47.840> and<00:04:48.470> when<00:04:49.130> always<00:04:49.400> in<00:04:49.490> the

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
add an oar in and when always in the

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.550 
add an oar in and when always in the
know<00:04:49.669> me<00:04:49.789> go<00:04:49.849> to<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.000> bottom<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.360> top<00:04:50.449> so<00:04:50.840> to

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
know me go to the bottom the top so to

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.629 
know me go to the bottom the top so to
move<00:04:51.710> stuff<00:04:51.889> around<00:04:51.949> you've<00:04:52.310> got<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.520> like

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
move stuff around you've got to like

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.210 
move stuff around you've got to like
move<00:04:52.849> them<00:04:53.030> down<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.360> off<00:04:53.479> so<00:04:53.840> it<00:04:53.900> says<00:04:54.220> that

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
move them down and off so it says that

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.950 
move them down and off so it says that
condition<00:04:55.699> or<00:04:55.910> this<00:04:56.090> condition<00:04:56.509> we<00:04:56.720> change

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
condition or this condition we change

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.680 
condition or this condition we change
that<00:04:57.280> so<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.400> not<00:04:58.580> sub<00:04:58.820> at<00:04:58.970> all<00:04:59.180> we<00:04:59.330> could<00:04:59.449> say

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
that so the not sub at all we could say

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.879 
that so the not sub at all we could say
GD<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.110> unit<00:05:01.270> engineer<00:05:02.349> so<00:05:03.349> this<00:05:03.500> will<00:05:03.680> work<00:05:03.830> for

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.869 
lesson I'd say and many more requests
you<00:06:36.740> send<00:06:37.009> them<00:06:37.069> in<00:06:37.219> and<00:06:37.340> I'll<00:06:37.460> do<00:06:37.610> them<00:06:37.759> and

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
that's how you can capture units and I

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.350 
that's how you can capture units and I
probably<00:06:40.189> do<00:06:40.400> another<00:06:40.430> advanced<00:06:40.939> one<00:06:41.210> with

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
probably do another advanced one with

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.909 
probably do another advanced one with
some<00:06:41.539> advancements<00:06:41.930> on<00:06:42.199> this<00:06:42.349> at<00:06:42.469> some<00:06:42.650> points
