from flaring up and causing a flash fire
I've<00:01:12.500> had<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.650> running<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.100> three<00:01:14.460> hours<00:01:14.790> now

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970

I've had it running for three hours now
and<00:01:15.860> I<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:17.070> running<00:01:17.400> around<00:01:17.490> 300<00:01:18.090> degrees<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and I was running around 300 degrees to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.380 
and I was running around 300 degrees to
cure<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:20.450> when<00:01:21.450> metal<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.350> formed<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:23.240> all<00:01:24.240> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
cure it when metal is formed like all of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.160 
cure it when metal is formed like all of
these<00:01:24.540> edges<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.140> everything<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:27.170> at

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
these edges and everything on here at

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.080 
these edges and everything on here at
the<00:01:28.320> factory<00:01:29.119> they're<00:01:30.119> coated<00:01:30.450> with<00:01:30.780> an<00:01:30.930> oil

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
the factory they're coated with an oil

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.319 
the factory they're coated with an oil
now<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.570> cut<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.439> metal<00:01:34.950> from<00:01:35.220> breaking<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
now to cut the metal from breaking as it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.050 
now to cut the metal from breaking as it
bends<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:37.740> makes<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.130> making<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> corners

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
bends that makes it making the corners

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.690 
bends that makes it making the corners
and<00:01:39.240> whatnot<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.159> burn<00:01:41.340> all<00:01:41.549> out

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and whatnot so you have to burn all out

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.270 
and whatnot so you have to burn all out
all<00:01:41.850> off<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.360> there<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.750> help<00:01:42.899> cure<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:44.210> anyway

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
all off of there to help cure it anyway

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.450 
all off of there to help cure it anyway
that's<00:01:47.450> what<00:01:48.450> we're<00:01:48.600> looking<00:01:48.899> at<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
that's what we're looking at and the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.190 
that's what we're looking at and the
reason<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.930> electric<00:01:54.930> one

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
reason that I like the electric one

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.069 
reason that I like the electric one
thing<00:01:55.409> there's<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.680> thermostat<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.869> can<00:01:57.869> pick

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
thing there's a thermostat you can pick

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.770 
thing there's a thermostat you can pick
your<00:01:58.229> temperature<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.579> it's<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.570> going<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
your temperature and it's not going to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.240 
your temperature and it's not going to
vary<00:02:00.990> all<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.409> much<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.070> be

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
vary all that much it's going to be

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.350 
vary all that much it's going to be
pretty<00:02:02.610> well<00:02:02.909> consistent

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
pretty well consistent

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.670 
pretty well consistent
and<00:02:06.540> that's<00:02:07.540> nice<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:08.080> don't<00:02:08.170> have<00:02:08.290> to<00:02:08.500> watch

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
and that's nice you don't have to watch

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.190 
and that's nice you don't have to watch
it<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:10.149> don't<00:02:10.360> have<00:02:10.570> to<00:02:10.720> keep<00:02:10.899> adding<00:02:11.290> wood

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it you don't have to keep adding wood

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.560 
it you don't have to keep adding wood
you<00:02:14.200> don't<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.950> worry<00:02:15.910> about<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.300> flare

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
you don't have to worry about the flare

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:24.690 
you don't have to worry about the flare
up<00:02:18.240> but<00:02:19.240> anyway<00:02:20.760> as<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:22.060> see<00:02:23.370> like<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.400> said

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
put a space between them so the heat can

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.060

cooking and it drips down onto the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.940 
cooking and it drips down onto the
bottom<00:04:01.940> this<00:04:02.940> thing<00:04:03.180> has<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.569> curve<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.200> it

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
bottom this thing has a curve to it it

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.000 
bottom this thing has a curve to it it
runs<00:04:05.160> down<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.489> hole<00:04:05.670> here<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.120> here's<00:04:06.390> a

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
runs down the hole here and here's a

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.860 
runs down the hole here and here's a
little<00:04:08.010> tray<00:04:08.280> for<00:04:08.610> catching<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.390> drippings

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
little tray for catching the drippings

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:18.740 
little tray for catching the drippings
and<00:04:14.090> I've<00:04:15.090> got<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.599> water<00:04:17.299> then<00:04:18.299> look<00:04:18.510> right

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
and I've got the water then look right

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.949 
and I've got the water then look right
here<00:04:20.060> it's<00:04:21.060> ready<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.479> go

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
here it's ready to go

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:32.260 
here it's ready to go
I<00:04:23.330> guess<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.510> sat<00:04:24.720> on<00:04:24.750> about<00:04:25.370> 175<00:04:26.370> right<00:04:26.639> now

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.000 

it's<00:04:33.270> not<00:04:33.570> not<00:04:33.930> that<00:04:34.169> hot<00:04:34.410> that's<00:04:34.710> works

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
it's not not that hot that's works

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.629 
it's not not that hot that's works
pretty<00:04:35.639> good<00:04:35.790> at<00:04:36.180> that<00:04:36.360> temperature<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:36.990> can

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
pretty good at that temperature you can

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.909 
pretty good at that temperature you can
touch<00:04:38.639> it

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
touch it

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.409 
touch it
of<00:04:40.919> course<00:04:41.160> it's<00:04:41.370> temperature<00:04:41.880> is<00:04:42.090> showing

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
of course it's temperature is showing

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.980 
of course it's temperature is showing
down<00:04:42.600> because<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.080> had<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.470> open<00:04:44.840> but<00:04:45.840> it's

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
down because I had it open but it's

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.090 
down because I had it open but it's
going<00:04:46.139> to<00:04:46.200> start<00:04:46.410> rising<00:04:46.680> that's

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
going to start rising that's

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.760 
going to start rising that's
approximately<00:04:48.080> been<00:04:49.080> about<00:04:49.289> another<00:04:49.530> minute

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
approximately been about another minute

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.840 
approximately been about another minute
it<00:04:50.070> shall<00:04:50.280> be<00:04:50.400> back<00:04:50.610> up<00:04:50.789> to<00:04:51.800> about<00:04:52.800> 175<00:04:55.729> and<00:04:56.729> I

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
it shall be back up to about 175 and I

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.240 
it shall be back up to about 175 and I
paid<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:58.550> $129<00:04:59.550> plus<00:04:59.789> tax<00:05:00.060> for<00:05:00.180> it<00:05:00.450> I<00:05:01.100> think<00:05:02.100> it's

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
one neither you would buy the way you

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.540 
one neither you would buy the way you
soak<00:05:17.669> the<00:05:17.820> wood<00:05:18.500> for<00:05:19.500> about<00:05:19.770> 30<00:05:20.039> minutes<00:05:20.430> in

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
soak the wood for about 30 minutes in

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.610 
soak the wood for about 30 minutes in
water<00:05:21.080> before<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.530> ready<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:23.310> start<00:05:23.639> and<00:05:24.620> that

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
water before you ready to start and that

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.010 
water before you ready to start and that
helps<00:05:26.010> to<00:05:26.400> make<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:26.970> smoke<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.810> water

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
helps to make the smoke and the water

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.710 
helps to make the smoke and the water
trade<00:05:28.349> naturally<00:05:28.860> that<00:05:29.039> is<00:05:29.280> to<00:05:29.789> keep<00:05:29.970> it<00:05:30.150> humid

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
trade naturally that is to keep it humid

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.500 
trade naturally that is to keep it humid
and<00:05:30.870> damp<00:05:30.960> inside<00:05:31.849> it<00:05:32.849> helps<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.270> tenderize

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
and damp inside it helps to tenderize

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:40.550 
and damp inside it helps to tenderize
the<00:05:34.020> meat<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:37.080> that's<00:05:37.560> about<00:05:38.250> it
