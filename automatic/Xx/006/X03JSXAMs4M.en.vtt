 olive jar if we already have some 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.640

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.260
 cut in half and good what 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.220

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.000
 the days 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.220

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.570
 open better ha ha 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.570

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.040

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.830

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:09.960
 those of the people that the 10 seconds 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:13.760
 we already have our garlic head operate 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.760
 and we are going to go then 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.360
 the teeth also like that was being 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.360
 the 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.690
 within our work 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.360
 so much agreed cold 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.130

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.480

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.290
 put a couple of bay leaves for 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.879
 that are well seasoned 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.879
 and nobody because of white 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.230
 I listened 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.230
 ah 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.820
 The truth is that my old lady is very good 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.870
 he does not 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.790
 and in recent times 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.310
 Well now the theme with water is that 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.310
 pour the water and the vinegar 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:34.280
 good water 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:36.790
 I put mineral water in the eby and then 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.790
 let it cool 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.669
 this shirt says protect the tongue 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.960
 Ukrainian good you will feel with that makes 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.210
 a couple of weeks the parliament 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.080
 ukrainian 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.080
 I approve the 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:05:00.530
 and well they heard us normal 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.500
 there is 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:09.520
 we go straight from the water 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.379
 remember that it has to be fresh water 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.379
 but that we have previously served 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.360
 to cover orders 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.930
 ah 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.420
 hate 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.669
 or so I fell short with the salt 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.300
 much more 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.610
 how to use a little more salt 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.610
 and now half a cup of vinegar 

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:04.689
 adding white 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:11.010
 ah 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.510
 and then nothing else we have to cover 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.300
 be well covered so you do not 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.970
 they are worth it, they have to make sure 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.040
 that is well covered we cover and what 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.249
 seasonal form during mystical time 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.029
 four days minimum days 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:26.029
 until they see 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.569
 it gives me more 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.569
 not so green 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.050
 they can not bite and try 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.409
 and you're ready to eat very well 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:45.739
 where are we going to get seasonal 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:45.739
 a week and we're going to prepare it 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.800
