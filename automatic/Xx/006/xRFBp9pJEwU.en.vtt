people it is 855 of the am I have a

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.019 
people it is 855 of the am I have a
tutorial<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.420> today<00:00:19.369> so<00:00:20.369> we're<00:00:20.850> going<00:00:20.970> to

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
tutorial for you today so we're going to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.779 
tutorial for you today so we're going to
be<00:00:21.119> learning<00:00:21.270> about<00:00:21.630> how<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.470> make<00:00:23.189> objects

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
be learning about how to make objects

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.240 
be learning about how to make objects
invisible<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:25.140> game<00:00:25.320> engine<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.949> how<00:00:26.189> do

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
invisible in the game engine and how do

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.029 
invisible in the game engine and how do
you<00:00:26.460> fake<00:00:26.699> reflections<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.810> game<00:00:28.680> engine

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
you fake reflections in the game engine

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.070 
you fake reflections in the game engine
so<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.519> going<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.789> pretty<00:00:30.359> cool<00:00:30.720> pretty

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
so it's going to be pretty cool pretty

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.790 
so it's going to be pretty cool pretty
short<00:00:31.439> tutorial<00:00:31.949> actually<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:33.649> let's<00:00:34.649> get

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
short tutorial actually so let's get

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.850 
short tutorial actually so let's get
going<00:00:35.690> ok<00:00:36.690> I'm<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.410> go<00:00:37.500> ahead<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
going ok I'm just going to go ahead and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.729 
going ok I'm just going to go ahead and
use<00:00:38.040> my<00:00:38.219> default<00:00:38.610> cube<00:00:39.379> go<00:00:40.379> into<00:00:40.620> my

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
use my default cube go into my

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.900 
use my default cube go into my
properties<00:00:41.309> tab<00:00:42.410> materials<00:00:43.520> add<00:00:44.520> new<00:00:46.730> go<00:00:47.730> down

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
properties tab materials add new go down

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.040 
properties tab materials add new go down
here<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.230> transparency<00:00:49.230> check<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.809> change<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
here to transparency check it change the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.310 
here to transparency check it change the
Alpha<00:00:52.469> down<00:00:52.820> to<00:00:53.820> about<00:00:54.030> halfway<00:00:54.329> or

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
Alpha down to about halfway or

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.670 
Alpha down to about halfway or
transparency<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.280> want<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:58.440> we're

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
transparency you want and then we're

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.439 
transparency you want and then we're
going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.859> go<00:00:58.949> into<00:00:59.190> textured<00:00:59.940> mode<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
going to go into textured mode and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.410 
going to go into textured mode and
you'll<00:01:00.780> notice<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.350> still<00:01:01.670> not<00:01:02.670> transparent

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you'll notice it's still not transparent

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.100 
you'll notice it's still not transparent
it's<00:01:03.899> all<00:01:04.049> white<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.129> ugly<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:06.930> want

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it's all white and ugly so what we want

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.899 
it's all white and ugly so what we want
to<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.530> press<00:01:07.740> n<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.790> go<00:01:09.180> down<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.720> display

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
to do is press n and go down to display

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.840 
to do is press n and go down to display
change<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> from<00:01:12.210> multi<00:01:12.689> texture<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.409> glsl<00:01:15.200> and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
change it from multi texture to glsl and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.840 
change it from multi texture to glsl and
now<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.960> put<00:01:19.200> an<00:01:19.290> object<00:01:19.409> behind<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.430> really

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
now if we put an object behind it really

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.020 
now if we put an object behind it really
quick<00:01:22.040> give<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.189> some<00:01:23.369> color<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:25.049> rad

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
quick give it some color and it's rad

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.249 
quick give it some color and it's rad
maybe<00:01:27.030> fix<00:01:27.420> my<00:01:27.600> lighting<00:01:28.049> with<00:01:28.229> doesn't<00:01:28.680> exist

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
maybe fix my lighting with doesn't exist

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.310 
maybe fix my lighting with doesn't exist
now<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.650> see<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.810> transparent

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
now you can see that it is transparent

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.910 
now you can see that it is transparent
and<00:01:34.759> will<00:01:35.759> be<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.240> when<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.049> go<00:01:37.170> into<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.770> game

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
and will be so when you go into the game

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.219 
and will be so when you go into the game
dungeon<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:40.110> that's<00:01:40.229> pretty<00:01:40.470> cool<00:01:42.020> next<00:01:43.020> step

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
dungeon so that's pretty cool next step

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.630 
dungeon so that's pretty cool next step
on<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> list<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.130> faking<00:01:44.640> reflections

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
on the list is faking reflections

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.149 
on the list is faking reflections
unfortunately<00:01:47.640> blender<00:01:48.149> cannot<00:01:49.159> cannot

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
unfortunately blender cannot cannot

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.840 
unfortunately blender cannot cannot
actually<00:01:50.460> put<00:01:50.939> reflections<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.670> game

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
actually put reflections on in the game

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.959 
actually put reflections on in the game
engine<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.570> there<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> cool<00:01:55.890> way<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.610> fake

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
engine so there is a cool way to to fake

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.060 
engine so there is a cool way to to fake
them<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:59.119> that<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.710> I'm<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:02.040> to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
them and that is I'm just going to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.389 
them and that is I'm just going to
uncheck<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.640> transparency<00:02:03.590> going<00:02:04.590> into<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
uncheck it transparency going into the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.969 
uncheck it transparency going into the
texture<00:02:06.000> tab<00:02:06.240> add<00:02:06.860> new<00:02:07.860> image<00:02:09.679> click<00:02:10.679> where<00:02:10.950> it

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
texture tab add new image click where it

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.340 
texture tab add new image click where it
says<00:02:11.099> clouds<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.090> whatever<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.569> says<00:02:12.840> for<00:02:13.080> you

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
says clouds so whatever it says for you

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.330 
says clouds so whatever it says for you
go<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.590> image<00:02:13.890> or<00:02:14.370> movie<00:02:15.830> then<00:02:16.830> go<00:02:17.040> down<00:02:17.280> to

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
go to image or movie then go down to

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.730 
go to image or movie then go down to
open<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.120> you're<00:02:18.810> going<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.990> want<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.200> open<00:02:19.560> a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
open and you're going to want to open a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.730 
open and you're going to want to open a
reflection<00:02:20.520> map<00:02:20.840> that's<00:02:21.840> pretty<00:02:22.050> much<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:22.530> a

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
reflection map that's pretty much just a

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.040 
reflection map that's pretty much just a
scene<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:23.340> looks<00:02:23.580> like<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.300> scene<00:02:24.600> around

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
scene that looks like the scene around

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.970 
scene that looks like the scene around
your<00:02:25.470> object<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.900> will<00:02:28.350> blend<00:02:28.740> in

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
your object so that it will blend in

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.610 
your object so that it will blend in
with<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.600> guess<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.870> show<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.170> here

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
with it I guess I can show you here

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.360 
with it I guess I can show you here
where<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.190> my<00:02:32.340> reflection<00:02:33.920> do-do-do-do

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.550 

flexion<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.550> got<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.120> alphabetize<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.380> should

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
flexion I got it alphabetize that should

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.560 
flexion I got it alphabetize that should
have<00:02:40.650> been<00:02:40.680> much<00:02:41.100> quicker<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.210> see<00:02:42.420> this

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
have been much quicker if you see this

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.930 
have been much quicker if you see this
would<00:02:42.750> go<00:02:42.900> great<00:02:42.930> with<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.800> desert<00:02:44.430> scene

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
would go great with like a desert scene

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.660 
would go great with like a desert scene
I<00:02:45.120> guess<00:02:45.360> it's<00:02:46.350> kind<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.680> cool<00:02:46.980> flexion<00:02:47.520> map

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
I guess it's kind of a cool flexion map

you'll<00:03:44.940> see<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.300> reflection<00:03:45.900> actually<00:03:46.290> moves

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
you'll see the reflection actually moves

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.670 
you'll see the reflection actually moves
with<00:03:47.790> your<00:03:48.180> camera<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.200> does<00:03:49.350> that<00:03:49.560> in<00:03:49.650> a

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
with your camera and it does that in a

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.010 
with your camera and it does that in a
game<00:03:49.860> engine<00:03:50.070> too<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:51.090> this<00:03:51.210> would<00:03:51.390> be<00:03:51.420> really

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
game engine too so this would be really

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.750 
game engine too so this would be really
good<00:03:52.380> if<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.680> were<00:03:52.770> trying<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.160> make<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.730> a

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
good if you were trying to make like a

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.270 
good if you were trying to make like a
car<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.510> game<00:03:54.690> engine<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.010> wanted

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
car in the game engine and you wanted

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.230 
car in the game engine and you wanted
this<00:03:57.090> for<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.540> paint<00:03:58.910> actually<00:03:59.910> did<00:04:00.090> that

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
this for the paint actually did that

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.350 
this for the paint actually did that
earlier<00:04:00.270> it's<00:04:00.870> more<00:04:01.260> greg<00:04:01.560> did<00:04:01.770> that<00:04:01.950> earlier

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
earlier it's more greg did that earlier

earlier it's more greg did that earlier
works<00:04:03.360> out<00:04:03.540> pretty<00:04:03.660> well<00:04:04.190> so<00:04:05.190> that's<00:04:06.120> that's

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
works out pretty well so that's that's

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.660 
works out pretty well so that's that's
