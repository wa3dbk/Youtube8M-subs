00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.710 
won't because we have this one over here
you<00:03:30.110> can<00:03:30.319> just<00:03:30.350> make<00:03:30.770> a<00:03:31.150> fool

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
you can just make a fool

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.480 
you can just make a fool
um<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:36.570> top<00:03:36.870> doesn't<00:03:37.260> necessarily<00:03:38.190> need<00:03:38.220> to

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
um the top doesn't necessarily need to

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.900 
um the top doesn't necessarily need to
be<00:03:38.730> all<00:03:39.230> logs<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.800> can<00:03:41.040> just<00:03:41.220> be<00:03:41.340> regular

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
be all logs it can just be regular

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.250 
be all logs it can just be regular
wooden<00:03:42.510> planks<00:03:44.450> let's<00:03:45.450> collect<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:46.020> come<00:03:46.230> on

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
wooden planks let's collect it come on

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.100 
wooden planks let's collect it come on
it<00:03:47.220> takes<00:03:47.580> a<00:03:47.730> while<00:03:47.880> actually<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.660> don't<00:03:48.870> really

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
it takes a while actually I don't really

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.290 
it takes a while actually I don't really
know<00:03:49.500> what<00:03:49.710> to<00:03:49.860> talk<00:03:50.100> when<00:03:50.310> I'm<00:03:50.430> building<00:03:50.850> it's

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
know what to talk when I'm building it's

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.770 
know what to talk when I'm building it's
so<00:03:51.450> embarrassing<00:03:53.090> usually<00:03:54.090> I'm<00:03:54.330> doing

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
so embarrassing usually I'm doing

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
something and I commented over it and I

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.270 
something and I commented over it and I
just<00:03:58.800> misplaced<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.550> block<00:03:59.840> great<00:04:01.130> damn<00:04:02.130> it

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
just misplaced a block great damn it

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.750 
just misplaced a block great damn it
another<00:04:03.240> one<00:04:03.890> okay<00:04:04.890> that's<00:04:05.190> enough<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:07.760> shall

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
another one okay that's enough I shall

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.520 
another one okay that's enough I shall
make<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.420> back<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.410> library

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.800 

let's<00:04:16.190> take<00:04:16.430> off<00:04:16.670> this<00:04:17.139> weight<00:04:18.139> oh<00:04:19.630> damn<00:04:20.630> it

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
let's take off this weight oh damn it

let's take off this weight oh damn it
now<00:04:21.790> apparently<00:04:22.790> glass<00:04:23.780> panes<00:04:24.190> don't<00:04:25.190> drop

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
now apparently glass panes don't drop

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.860 
now apparently glass panes don't drop
anything<00:04:26.169> again

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
anything again

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.839

uh okay
I<00:04:31.909> want<00:04:32.749> to<00:04:32.809> make<00:04:33.020> actually<00:04:33.679> i'm<00:04:33.770> going<00:04:33.979> to

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
I want to make actually i'm going to

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.260 
I want to make actually i'm going to
make<00:04:34.219> the<00:04:34.879> edges<00:04:35.679> also<00:04:36.679> out<00:04:36.860> of<00:04:36.889> cobblestone

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
make the edges also out of cobblestone

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.940 
make the edges also out of cobblestone
Oh

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.270

windows not made of out of glass panes

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.560 
windows not made of out of glass panes
cuz<00:05:56.690> I<00:05:56.780> don't<00:05:56.840> like<00:05:57.020> them<00:05:57.380> very<00:05:57.590> much<00:05:58.010> I<00:05:58.570> prefer
