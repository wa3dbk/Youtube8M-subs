we have the soviet/russian
luna<00:00:04.350> 3<00:00:04.680> which<00:00:04.980> on<00:00:05.190> October<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.759> 7th<00:00:06.060> 1959

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
luna 3 which on October the 7th 1959

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.709 
luna 3 which on October the 7th 1959
supposedly<00:00:08.040> took<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.849> first<00:00:09.059> images<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.630> the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
supposedly took the first images of the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.020 
supposedly took the first images of the
hidden<00:00:10.019> side<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.590> Moon<00:00:10.830> now<00:00:11.550> what<00:00:11.730> does<00:00:11.880> in

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
hidden side of the Moon now what does in

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.490 
hidden side of the Moon now what does in
particular<00:00:12.269> what<00:00:12.570> we<00:00:12.690> actually<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:13.139> here<00:00:13.170> of

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
particular what we actually have here of

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.400 
particular what we actually have here of
course<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:14.630> doesn't<00:00:15.630> really<00:00:15.839> show<00:00:16.080> too<00:00:16.260> much

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
course it doesn't really show too much

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.550 
course it doesn't really show too much
of<00:00:16.529> detail<00:00:17.119> the<00:00:18.119> reason<00:00:18.449> being<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.230> was

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
of detail the reason being is that was

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.580 
of detail the reason being is that was
given<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.279> was<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.430> lot<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.090> light<00:00:21.590> was

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
given that it was a lot of light was

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.320 
given that it was a lot of light was
coming<00:00:22.859> from<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.070> Sun<00:00:23.310> supposedly<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.210> it

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
coming from the Sun supposedly and it

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.630 
coming from the Sun supposedly and it
just<00:00:24.510> didn't<00:00:24.779> show<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:25.140> enough<00:00:25.380> detail<00:00:25.800> but

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
just didn't show up enough detail but

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.470 
just didn't show up enough detail but
what<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.449> find<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.760> these<00:00:29.760> are<00:00:30.179> actually

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
what we find is these are actually

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.970 
what we find is these are actually
models<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.489> Soviet<00:00:32.940> Russians<00:00:33.270> used<00:00:33.980> to

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
models that the Soviet Russians used to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.930 
models that the Soviet Russians used to
fake<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.960> images<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.980> supposedly

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
fake all the the images of supposedly

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.319 
fake all the the images of supposedly
seeding<00:00:39.450> craft<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.710> view<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> moon<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.059> also

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
seeding craft to view the moon and also

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.799 
seeding craft to view the moon and also
land<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> moon<00:00:42.960> lunar<00:00:43.379> land<00:00:44.360> so<00:00:45.360> that's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
land on the moon lunar land so that's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.740 
land on the moon lunar land so that's
Luna<00:00:46.110> 3<00:00:46.379> over<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> sea<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.460> 1959<00:00:48.000> supposedly

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.770 
of the moon
I<00:01:01.649> watched<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.550> actually<00:01:03.000> fine<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.390> this

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
I watched you actually fine with this

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.080 
I watched you actually fine with this
one<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.080> particular<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.650> we've<00:01:05.430> got<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
one in particular as we've got the the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.910 
one in particular as we've got the the
league<00:01:06.590> of<00:01:07.590> these<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.610> three<00:01:09.030> which<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.740> can

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
league of these on three which you can

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.490 
league of these on three which you can
actually<00:01:11.100> see<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:13.110> league<00:01:13.350> is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
actually see that this league is

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.990 
actually see that this league is
actually<00:01:13.770> quite<00:01:13.950> close<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.490> Morel<00:01:14.820> moon

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
actually quite close to this Morel moon

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.460 
actually quite close to this Morel moon
because<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.600> actually<00:01:15.720> see<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> shadow

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
because you can actually see the shadow

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950 
because you can actually see the shadow
of<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.860> outlined<00:01:17.280> here<00:01:17.640> underneath<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.210> quite

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
of it outlined here underneath it quite

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.070 
of it outlined here underneath it quite
clearly<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:20.460> that's<00:01:23.689> pretty<00:01:24.689> much<00:01:24.869> just

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
clearly so that's pretty much just

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.710 
clearly so that's pretty much just
showing<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> model<00:01:26.400> moon<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.909> how

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
showing that it is a model moon and how

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.620 
showing that it is a model moon and how
all<00:01:28.020> these<00:01:28.170> things<00:01:28.890> sort<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.220> give<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.210> away<00:01:30.299> as

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
all these things sort of give it away as

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.020 
all these things sort of give it away as
it<00:01:30.780> were<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.310> also<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.850> here

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
it were and what we also have up here

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.969 
it were and what we also have up here
what<00:01:33.240> she<00:01:33.570> done<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.290> model<00:01:34.590> moon<00:01:34.740> for

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
what she done with this model moon for

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.170 
what she done with this model moon for
some<00:01:35.100> reason<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> she<00:01:35.820> got<00:01:35.970> like<00:01:36.150> a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
some reason was of it she got like a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.749 
some reason was of it she got like a
paper<00:01:36.840> or<00:01:36.990> cowboy<00:01:37.409> patch<00:01:37.860> which<00:01:38.640> you've

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
paper or cowboy patch which you've

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.219 
paper or cowboy patch which you've
actually<00:01:38.909> put<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.659> actually<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:39.960> it

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
actually put up here and actually see it

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.380 
actually put up here and actually see it
lift<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> sides<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.850> they

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
lift it up on the sides here they

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.639 
lift it up on the sides here they
obviously<00:01:42.570> haven't<00:01:42.899> been<00:01:43.020> too<00:01:43.259> good<00:01:43.439> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
obviously haven't been too good and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.590 
obviously haven't been too good and
creating<00:01:44.009> these<00:01:44.159> models<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:45.450> whatever

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
creating these models for whatever

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.590 
creating these models for whatever
reasons<00:01:46.079> or<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.680> initially<00:01:47.360> put<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.450> these

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
reasons or they initially put all these

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.539 
reasons or they initially put all these
little<00:01:48.840> things<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.500> here<00:01:49.710> maybe<00:01:50.009> people<00:01:50.340> could

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
little things in here maybe people could

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.100 
little things in here maybe people could
pick<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.360> actually<00:01:51.659> see<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:51.990> they've

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
pick up on and actually see what they've

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.859 
pick up on and actually see what they've
done<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.560> faking<00:01:52.860> these<00:01:53.600> photos<00:01:54.600> in

of<00:02:01.590> paper<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.219> loosely<00:02:02.579> attached<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
of paper and loosely attached and the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.580 
of paper and loosely attached and the
model<00:02:03.390> moon<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.020> actually<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.469> up

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
model moon that you can actually see up

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.830 
model moon that you can actually see up
here<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:05.909> quite<00:02:06.060> square<00:02:07.099> and<00:02:08.660> what<00:02:09.660> what

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
here so it's quite square and what what

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.240 
here so it's quite square and what what
nests<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.259> actually<00:02:10.530> done<00:02:10.770> when<00:02:10.979> they<00:02:11.129> and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
nests have actually done when they and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.700 
nests have actually done when they and
she<00:02:11.400> was<00:02:11.580> faking<00:02:11.819> them

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
she was faking them

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.350 
she was faking them
moon<00:02:13.190> photos<00:02:13.640> as<00:02:13.790> well<00:02:13.970> they've<00:02:14.240> actually

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
moon photos as well they've actually

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.630 
moon photos as well they've actually
taken<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:15.110> sort<00:02:16.070> of<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.250> slight

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
taken a sort of the slight

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.510 
taken a sort of the slight
representation<00:02:17.570> of<00:02:17.690> what<00:02:18.160> Russians<00:02:19.160> did<00:02:19.370> and

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
representation of what Russians did and

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.890 
representation of what Russians did and
them<00:02:19.610> actually<00:02:19.820> improved<00:02:20.210> on<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.690> better

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
them actually improved on and better

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.190 
them actually improved on and better
quality<00:02:21.700> models<00:02:22.700> at<00:02:22.940> NASA<00:02:23.150> used<00:02:23.540> obviously

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
quality models at NASA used obviously

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.840 
quality models at NASA used obviously
they've<00:02:24.530> kept<00:02:24.770> us<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> little<00:02:25.100> bit<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.460> shape

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
they've kept us a little bit of a shape

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.730 
they've kept us a little bit of a shape
and<00:02:26.090> some<00:02:26.270> sort<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.570> semblance<00:02:26.810> at<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.380> top<00:02:27.590> of

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
and some sort of semblance at the top of

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.230 
and some sort of semblance at the top of
the<00:02:27.860> arrow<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.130> they<00:02:28.520> have<00:02:28.640> fake<00:02:28.880> model

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
the arrow that they have fake model

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.780 
the arrow that they have fake model
moons<00:02:29.890> showing<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.980> backside<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.610> moon

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
moons showing the backside of the moon

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.460

or faking the backside of the moon as

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.750 
or faking the backside of the moon as
well<00:02:35.350> it's<00:02:36.350> pretty<00:02:36.560> much<00:02:36.680> like<00:02:36.920> they<00:02:37.130> had<00:02:37.730> a

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
well it's pretty much like they had a

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.180 
well it's pretty much like they had a
bit<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.270> upmanship<00:02:38.870> they<00:02:39.440> were<00:02:39.530> playing<00:02:39.800> with

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190

each other as it were and both of the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.410 
each other as it were and both of the
sides<00:02:43.340> faking<00:02:43.820> all<00:02:44.060> these<00:02:44.270> images<00:02:44.690> and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
sides faking all these images and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.690
