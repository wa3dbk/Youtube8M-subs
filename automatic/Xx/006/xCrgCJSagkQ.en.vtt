00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 Hello everyone, you are with herka today 18 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.530
 October 2014 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:13.860
 941 am and this is a review of nokia headphones 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:17.480
 wh-102 tsat headphones come in three different 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.010
 colors blue yellow and red 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.769
 actually why they are generally bought and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.070
 I used to go with my works 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.640
 who defaulted on their iphone 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.489
 everything suited me but the sound in them is possible 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.280
 say so quiet and if you walk without 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.460
 bag which presses the cable earpods 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.649
 cars they often fall out 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.079
 Here it got me but give big 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.910
 money for headphones I do not see sense to me 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.960
 sorry let's say a thousand rubles to pay for 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.610
 headphones or a half thousand so I don't 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.300
 changed them basically sound me in them 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.440
 arranged here and I came across the site 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.760
 sitilink on such here headphones me very 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.159
 like the design color and price of 190 rubles 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.530
 on the site of the stiring and yellow and blue 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.070
 Headphones so for 190 rubles red 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.790
 for some reason almost 1000 rubles 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.830
 and those who want to hear how they sound 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.860
 in the video I can not turn on the music 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.270
 just because you are banned for this tuba 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.490
 that's why you have to believe me on 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.350
 word and i will show you the look of these 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.350
 most headphones well firstly that to me 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.549
 liked it as i said design 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.409
 looks very stylish 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.390
 and it is quite cheap though everywhere except 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.500
 system is not worth almost a thousand or 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.979
 one and a half thousand rubles like that 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.840
 left right earpiece it is written inside 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.579
 headband or this is why 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.540
 will have to turn the headphones like this 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.869
 just take it and immediately see what 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.219
 the ear must be worn properly 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:03.750
 I liked the earpiece in the same way, that 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:06.290
 microphone and switch tracks on the iPhone 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.789
 by the way it works 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.370
 located on the left side i'm left-handed and 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.640
 it's very convenient for me but no 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.280
 volume switches are bad but for 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.480
 such a price is a sin to complain 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.050
 I also really liked those 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.050
 wires 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.690
 as can be said on any faces 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.349
 And on these headphones there is such a feature as 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.120
 lasso I've never seen this before 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.280
 maybe on the same demons I 'll explain right now 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.760
 as prepared let's say twisted like this 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:44.459
 headphones so that they do not get confused 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.459
 so here they twisted all of them up 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:53.250
 end of the twist we insert this 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:56.819
 lasso and we do like this and headphones 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.099
 never get confused here this all 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.230
 appearance here say even more 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.079
 nothing as for sound unlike 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.510
 the japanese on these headphones have bass and 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.930
 they sound good enough and the sound in 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.170
 a whole lot better than the stick and regex 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.830
 louder I know that there are Candy 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.810
 audiophiles who 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.550
 will say headphones there for 8,000 rubles 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.550
 sound much better 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.190
 but as I said, I am 8 for 8000 rubles 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:30.050
 the best home theater buy and on it 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:33.200
 I will listen to the whole house at 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.200
 Columns 51, that's why I can say something 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.470
 that the sound is good enough especially for 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.080
 its price 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.700
 this is no good what for 190 rubles buy 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.510
 to thread terrible headphones in which 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.620
 terrible sound 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:52.780
 but here the truth is very very good sound 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:58.010
 there are bass not the sound itself is very bright 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:01.370
 I listened to them rather passed with them 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.410
 I have 4 already listened to music and me all 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.910
 suits the more podcast and 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.100
 contently listen on iphone 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.250
 after they earpods very quiet and sound 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.170
 through these headphones is loud enough that 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.000
 I can take from minus the difference from 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.740
 the japanese 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.739
 which are inserted better around nobody 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.690
 won't hear what's going on wearing these 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.490
 headphones adding slightly above average 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.230
 loudness if you use 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.480
 public transport is likely 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.870
 how grandma will push you and tell you to turn it off 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.290
 your 100 low music there or say 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.419
 name you do not know what some 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.150
 assholes if you listen to something 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.790
 in addition to carriage or shura 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.280
 what is the central Vladimir wind to her 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.810
 northern 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.420
 Well, Moscow is probably better with this 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.280
 more loyal people here in the far 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:55.310
 Moscow region is not so well from the minuses 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.970
 I want to note that there is no volume rocker 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.070
 volume can not be changed only 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.180
 you can stop the track on the iPhone 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.520
 switch tracks back and forth 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.010
 stop track once clicked twice 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.380
 clicked the next track three times clicked 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.770
 previous earpods the same in 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.720
 principle, you can answer the call too 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.700
 once press then zone calls and 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.520
 Do you answer the call like this ? 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.920
 press hang up sound through 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.140
 the microphone is good enough I did not expect 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.650
 what kind of money will i get 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.450
 such a good microphone with headphones 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.090
 this is all this my personal opinion never 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.800
 pr nobody nobody paid any 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.900
 headphones for 190 rubles 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.470
 somewhere there at the beginning of the video when 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.220
 I was looking for a percentage of the screenshot even appear 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:43.020
 of these headphones when i came sitilink 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.200
 my next muhosranska to 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.810
 pick up headphones there a whole regiment of them lies 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.760
 therefore, they are very well snapping up even 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.950
 my village 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.990
 As you can see, a lot of them are taking and 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.380
 I even have headphones at work 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.760
 listened asked to order here on this 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.430
 everything was with you herca 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.450
 I will say once again that the headphones for your 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:09.500
 the price is excellent more than excellent I do not know 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:12.300
