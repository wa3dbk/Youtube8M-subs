stayed<00:01:56.119> true<00:01:56.300> to<00:01:56.360> ourselves<00:01:56.569> and<00:01:57.229> we<00:01:57.289> did<00:01:57.500> the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
stayed true to ourselves and we did the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.130 
stayed true to ourselves and we did the
best<00:01:57.619> performances<00:01:58.520> we<00:01:58.640> could<00:01:58.819> have<00:01:59.030> and<00:01:59.330> if

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
best performances we could have and if

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.589 
best performances we could have and if
it<00:02:00.319> backlash<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:01.160> did<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.970> know<00:02:02.000> it

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
it backlash it did and you know it

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.600 
it backlash it did and you know it
doesn't<00:02:02.990> really<00:02:03.110> matter<00:02:03.440> because<00:02:03.709> we<00:02:04.280> both

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
doesn't really matter because we both

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.820 
doesn't really matter because we both
had<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.000> time<00:02:05.539> of<00:02:05.840> our<00:02:05.929> lives<00:02:06.170> out<00:02:06.530> on<00:02:06.560> that
