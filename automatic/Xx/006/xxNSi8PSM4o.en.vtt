00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
to be honest but I do know you can't

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.860 
to be honest but I do know you can't
because<00:02:50.930> I've<00:02:51.200> tried<00:02:51.440> in<00:02:51.740> store<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:53.090> on<00:02:53.690> the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
because I've tried in store and on the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.900 
because I've tried in store and on the
front<00:02:54.490> so<00:02:55.490> I<00:02:56.080> do<00:02:57.080> have<00:02:57.500> a<00:03:00.040> filter<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.370> don't

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
front so I do have a filter I don't

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.180 
front so I do have a filter I don't
normally<00:03:02.120> use<00:03:02.330> filters<00:03:02.960> but<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.100> an

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
normally use filters but this is an

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.890 
normally use filters but this is an
expensive<00:03:04.610> lens<00:03:04.850> in<00:03:05.000> my<00:03:05.120> opinion<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.780> do

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
expensive lens in my opinion so I do

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.750 
expensive lens in my opinion so I do
have<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:07.250> Hoya

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
have the Hoya

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.260 
have the Hoya
it's<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.360> 77<00:03:09.050> millimeter<00:03:09.790> filter<00:03:10.790> for<00:03:11.030> anyone

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
it's a 77 millimeter filter for anyone

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.380

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.170 
who's interested I yeah I'm gonna do
I'll<00:03:15.170> probably<00:03:15.500> do<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.190> little<00:03:16.460> bit<00:03:16.760> about<00:03:16.940> this

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
I'll probably do a little bit about this

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.780 
I'll probably do a little bit about this
in<00:03:17.450> my<00:03:17.600> review<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.370> not<00:03:19.370> sure<00:03:19.520> I'm<00:03:19.670> not

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
in my review of this not sure I'm not

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.310 
in my review of this not sure I'm not
sure<00:03:19.910> if<00:03:20.030> I'm<00:03:20.120> gonna<00:03:20.209> keep<00:03:20.540> using<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:21.020> it

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
sure if I'm gonna keep using this it

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.970 
sure if I'm gonna keep using this it
