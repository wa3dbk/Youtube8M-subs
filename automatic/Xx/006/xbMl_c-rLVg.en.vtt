00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:12.590
 The guests have a good sense of Nakamura rent and that Ito Hanai is a team that is devoted to being a team 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.240
 It is Terakawa 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:19.880
 The power that has led the Japanese Prime Minister 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:25.519
 World Championships 50m has a whiff from a glance 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:28.800
 It is a feeling that everybody who is no longer in this one night show is not yet in Japan today 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.620
 I think that pressure is also there, of course Gane still Hey 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.130
 Later on Japan record 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:38.660
 I think it is where I want to put pressure on the Yes sound powerhouse of the world I was break through the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.230
 Hula says he wants to give self-study on the 58 second level 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.130
 I think this is also because it is higher than in much the dispatch standard recording 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.130
 For that purpose, how long in the first half I want to enter 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.130
 Class 7 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.970
 28 seconds 7 in 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.400
 Qualifying who entered the finals at 28 seconds 9 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:00.620
 I was supposed to learn for 59 seconds 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.800
 And attention is hated of 3 courses depending on whether one more representative frame can be taken 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.780
 And the boundary of 5 courses 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.619
 During this time, I think that these two people are quite strong, but I 'm glad I really feel that 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.920
 Say 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:19.890
 I want to challenge but it might be a keep up that over to the Well by all means Kurakawa players 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.310
 If dispatch standard record be entered entered the early return than the 48 suede and in good times 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.310
 Not 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.700
 ni 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.289
 While Hirai coach watched 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.289
 To 3 types of Olympics 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.990
 The other side of the final start screen is 8 crosses before 1 Kos 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.170
 The rise beat a strong world cause played grabbed the sub-ticket directly below 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.170
 0 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.530
 Why is it configured 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.530
 And I stood at the top of the side Te 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.440
 us but 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.819
 I 'm happy to express my house so I want to step on here 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.540
 While taking off the final submission to the hair color knit 25 meters 20 by that kind of thing 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.430
 It is dead 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.430
 It is because there are Inaba and the world 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:33.290
 Buber but 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.390
 It's cool but it's Sakaba 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.849
 The sea is a whopping 1 minute 0 seconds ghost Water Yam over decision Dawazu 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:54.580
 Lager stunning Japan new record and Taijo decision but 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.610
 Sakai didn't reach another two hundredths of a second 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.610
 Oh 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.170
 It contains the west mummy place 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.269
 Disappointing wow 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:24.590
 I've seen it as a qualifying semi-final, but you are a tall player 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.739
 But I it was a feeling like a pet does not rise with it is a movement now sorceress 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.610
 We broke late Inada, but did not let you cut a little 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:36.290
 Hirakawa but the representative of Japan new song is decided This is Mr. Sakuraku 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:43.010
 But I guard is the last Nee 10 meters a little tight tan was stunning race Yes 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:44.580
 If there is a correction, it will aim at 58 seconds . It is a decision in 59 seconds . 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.830
 It is decided Terakawa Tera 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.830
 Thank you Thank you for viewing 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.600
 I told you without regret 4 years ago 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.360
 Over 4 years 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.860
 I was waiting for this moment 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.550
 We are relieved decided to representative 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.470
 Moreover, Japan's new record 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:12.510
 My goal was to swim in the 58 second range 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.510
 It's too bad for a little good time but 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.000
 Exactly 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.510
 In production 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.190
 Record too 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:25.820
 Prepared I think I want to to be able to also win 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:28.390
 I think that there is this continuation that is not only representative as you mentioned now 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.390
 This time 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.810
 Looking to London 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.810
 Because it was this tournament 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.300
 One more step 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.300
 Level up 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.190
 I want to work hard in production 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.190
 Thank you very much for your congratulations 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:56.760
 heavy 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:05:02.070
 Hiroo struggled to win an Olympic entry decision for the first time in 3 tournaments 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.360
 Of 59 seconds an example of out now time to be third place much less to get ready with the record of last year's World Championships 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.950
 It will be equivalent each time 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.139
 Mr. Ota Sakai can not stand up without seeing it 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.050
 The other really this area 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:17.340
 Mr. Nakamura 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:23.130
 But I fully open is what the hey and stunning race of Terakawa become divided light and darkness in this true 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:25.139
 There is yeah Well Seiji Sakai Well I think that the chagrin I want to connect that also in higher order 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.249
 More than anything 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.259
 that 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:34.529
 I think that there is a Buckley at that aimed at the teeth 58-second range, so that Well firm 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:37.889
 And a production 4 more 2 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:44.350
 I think this tournament will come to an end There is a good record 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:47.890
 And challenges Deato taking um but it is not greet the production in the three months that troubled 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:53.650
 Because I think there is a part that looks like that task too 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:56.030
 Um It is they can race if we calm even things that a firm production also medal 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.270
 I think I can cup 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.810
 Would not you are getting better and better in time is 4 after entering to come right under the good position of the column out 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.630
 Or 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:07.850
 That's right that kind of thing 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:12.120
 There was a trap of play cheapness, but this can also be corrected and the store of that firm place 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:14.160
 I think it is a good stroke to go up 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:20.210
 Arakawa is wonderfully 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.210
 It is the Olympics participation decision for the first time in two tournaments that made me realize
