00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
point where we get a factory down at

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.239 
point where we get a factory down at
that<00:01:43.780> point<00:01:44.049> we're<00:01:44.140> going<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.319> snap<00:01:44.619> a<00:01:44.679> reactor

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 
that point we're going to snap a reactor

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.520 
that point we're going to snap a reactor
on<00:01:45.399> there<00:01:45.609> and<00:01:45.700> drop<00:01:45.880> another<00:01:46.119> barracks<00:01:46.539> so

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:50.889 
you're going to throw down that factory

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:52.410 
you're going to throw down that factory
just<00:01:51.249> about<00:01:51.429> the<00:01:51.579> time<00:01:51.639> where<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:51.939> get<00:01:52.030> 100

once<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:52.250> get<00:02:52.400> two<00:02:53.360> tanks<00:02:53.690> on<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.900> board<00:02:54.170> I'm

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
once you get two tanks on the board I'm

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.790 
once you get two tanks on the board I'm
gonna<00:02:55.040> go<00:02:55.190> ahead<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.370> push<00:02:55.610> out<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:57.140> we'll

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.509 
to in front of his base and then we're
also<00:03:13.010> going<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.459> rally<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.299> troops<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:16.370> this

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
also going to rally the troops to this

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.770 
also going to rally the troops to this
position<00:03:16.840> no<00:03:17.840> God<00:03:18.080> says<00:03:18.380> complete

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.559 

okay<00:03:22.770> so<00:03:23.220> here<00:03:23.490> we<00:03:23.610> are<00:03:23.730> we've<00:03:24.000> got<00:03:24.180> two<00:03:24.360> tanks

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
okay so here we are we've got two tanks

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.540 
okay so here we are we've got two tanks
set<00:03:24.870> up<00:03:24.990> I<00:03:25.200> poked<00:03:25.680> up<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:26.010> don't<00:03:26.069> see<00:03:26.340> anything

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.610 
set up I poked up I don't see anything
there<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.720> decided<00:03:28.050> to<00:03:28.110> drop<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.319> tank

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
there and so I decided to drop a tank

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.580 
there and so I decided to drop a tank
there<00:03:28.800> that<00:03:29.670> being<00:03:29.910> said<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.870> particular

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
there that being said this particular

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.190 
there that being said this particular
fight<00:03:31.860> doesn't<00:03:32.069> go<00:03:32.340> as<00:03:32.580> quite<00:03:33.330> quite<00:03:33.930> as<00:03:34.080> well

as I wanted they do end up taking out
that<00:03:37.110> first<00:03:37.440> wave<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.740> course<00:03:38.160> we<00:03:38.310> do<00:03:38.430> have

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610

base<00:05:45.850> so<00:05:46.120> that<00:05:46.150> you<00:05:46.330> constantly<00:05:46.840> have

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
base so that you constantly have

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.560 
base so that you constantly have
reinforcements<00:05:48.130> coming<00:05:48.310> in<00:05:48.580> as<00:05:48.760> you<00:05:49.240> can<00:05:49.360> see

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
reinforcements coming in as you can see

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.840

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
up to three tanks and quite a few

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.230 
up to three tanks and quite a few
marines<00:05:52.420> and<00:05:52.920> at<00:05:53.920> that<00:05:54.070> point<00:05:54.340> he<00:05:54.520> just<00:05:54.970> wasn't

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
marines and at that point he just wasn't

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.750 
marines and at that point he just wasn't
really<00:05:55.780> expecting<00:05:56.140> that<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:56.680> couldn't<00:05:57.100> get

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
really expecting that and couldn't get

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.120 
really expecting that and couldn't get
units<00:05:58.270> onto<00:05:58.510> the<00:05:58.600> board<00:05:58.870> quick<00:05:59.770> enough<00:05:59.980> if

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
units onto the board quick enough if

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.350 
units onto the board quick enough if
you're<00:06:00.280> going<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.550> everything<00:06:00.940> mode<00:06:01.120> or

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
you're going to everything mode or

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.690 
you're going to everything mode or
everyone<00:06:01.780> mode<00:06:01.960> right<00:06:02.110> here<00:06:02.350> you<00:06:03.280> do<00:06:03.430> see<00:06:03.610> his

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
everyone mode right here you do see his

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.190 
everyone mode right here you do see his
economy<00:06:04.120> was<00:06:04.300> pretty<00:06:04.480> strong<00:06:04.690> he<00:06:04.840> did<00:06:05.020> have

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
economy was pretty strong he did have

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.750 
economy was pretty strong he did have
two<00:06:05.380> refineries<00:06:07.110> but<00:06:08.110> at<00:06:08.980> that<00:06:09.070> point<00:06:09.430> I<00:06:09.550> think

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
two refineries but at that point I think

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.040 
two refineries but at that point I think
he<00:06:09.880> only<00:06:10.000> had<00:06:10.210> two<00:06:10.510> racks<00:06:10.840> and<00:06:11.170> one<00:06:11.620> factory

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
he only had two racks and one factory

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.750 
he only had two racks and one factory
looks<00:06:14.050> like<00:06:14.230> he<00:06:14.440> did<00:06:14.680> throw<00:06:15.100> up<00:06:15.130> an<00:06:15.250> expansion

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
looks like he did throw up an expansion

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.700 
looks like he did throw up an expansion
here<00:06:16.000> which<00:06:16.630> was<00:06:16.810> probably<00:06:17.080> the<00:06:17.380> source<00:06:17.590> of

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
here which was probably the source of

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.230 
here which was probably the source of
his<00:06:17.830> demise<00:06:18.010> if<00:06:18.370> you<00:06:18.460> can<00:06:18.580> see<00:06:18.760> sitting<00:06:19.120> on<00:06:19.210> a

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
his demise if you can see sitting on a

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.080 
his demise if you can see sitting on a
lot<00:06:19.450> of<00:06:19.540> minerals<00:06:20.100> had<00:06:21.100> he<00:06:21.220> seen<00:06:21.460> this<00:06:21.640> coming

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
lot of minerals had he seen this coming

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.490 
lot of minerals had he seen this coming
he<00:06:22.240> might<00:06:22.540> have<00:06:22.630> been<00:06:22.720> able<00:06:22.810> to<00:06:22.960> bunker<00:06:23.290> up<00:06:23.410> a

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
he might have been able to bunker up a

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.270 
he might have been able to bunker up a
little<00:06:23.710> bit<00:06:24.540> because<00:06:25.540> that's<00:06:25.930> it<00:06:26.200> terran<00:06:27.040> vs
