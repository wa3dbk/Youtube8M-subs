just<00:01:33.939> a<00:01:34.210> really<00:01:34.329> nice<00:01:34.570> nice<00:01:35.020> neat<00:01:35.380> little

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
just a really nice nice neat little

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.090 
just a really nice nice neat little
effect<00:01:37.030> it<00:01:37.750> took<00:01:37.929> me<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.140> little<00:01:38.259> while<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.920> make

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
effect it took me a little while to make

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.880 
effect it took me a little while to make
and<00:01:39.429> then<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.840> course<00:01:40.929> we<00:01:41.350> have<00:01:41.469> the<00:01:41.500> undead

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
and then of course we have the undead

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.020 
and then of course we have the undead
creature<00:01:42.130> which<00:01:42.490> has<00:01:42.700> 200<00:01:43.210> health<00:01:43.450> which<00:01:44.259> is

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
creature which has 200 health which is

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.850 
creature which has 200 health which is
greatly<00:01:46.140> surpassing<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.229> undead<00:01:47.500> marine

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
greatly surpassing the undead marine

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.429 
greatly surpassing the undead marine
which<00:01:48.100> only<00:01:48.250> has<00:01:48.429> 30<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:49.360> they're<00:01:50.229> getting<00:01:50.319> a

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
which only has 30 and they're getting a

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.109 
which only has 30 and they're getting a
little<00:01:50.560> close<00:01:50.860> so<00:01:51.039> let's<00:01:51.219> bomb<00:01:51.429> the<00:01:51.670> crap<00:01:51.880> out

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
little close so let's bomb the crap out

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.600 
little close so let's bomb the crap out
of<00:01:52.149> them<00:01:53.939> all<00:01:54.939> right<00:01:55.209> and<00:01:56.159> they<00:01:57.159> have<00:01:57.310> for

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
of them all right and they have for

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.399 
of them all right and they have for
armor<00:01:58.090> whereas<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.569> undead<00:01:58.810> Marine<00:01:59.049> has<00:01:59.140> zero

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
armor whereas the undead Marine has zero

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.929 
armor whereas the undead Marine has zero
so<00:01:59.709> they're<00:01:59.829> able<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.189> take<00:02:00.399> up<00:02:00.640> they're<00:02:00.850> able

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
so they're able to take up they're able

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.359 
so they're able to take up they're able
to<00:02:01.119> soak<00:02:01.360> up<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.780> lot<00:02:01.840> of<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:02.739> machine<00:02:03.130> gun

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
to soak up a lot of that machine gun

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.870 
to soak up a lot of that machine gun
damage<00:02:03.789> because<00:02:04.689> before<00:02:05.110> armor<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:06.130> regular

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
damage because before armor the regular

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.719 
damage because before armor the regular
marine<00:02:07.209> you<00:02:07.630> know<00:02:07.780> has<00:02:08.289> six<00:02:08.679> damage<00:02:08.920> regularly

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
marine you know has six damage regularly

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.270 
marine you know has six damage regularly
so<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.269> takes<00:02:10.479> takes<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.989> lot<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.500> attack

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
so it takes takes a lot of that attack

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.850 
so it takes takes a lot of that attack
away<00:02:12.489> a<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.930> course<00:02:14.200> are<00:02:14.410> armed<00:02:14.769> and

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
away a of course are armed and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.259 
away a of course are armed and
biological<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:15.579> they<00:02:15.670> take<00:02:15.849> a<00:02:15.910> little<00:02:16.120> bit

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
biological so they take a little bit

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.030 
biological so they take a little bit
more<00:02:16.390> damage<00:02:16.870> from<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.260> grenade<00:02:17.650> launcher

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
more damage from the grenade launcher

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.610 
more damage from the grenade launcher
and<00:02:18.160> more<00:02:18.340> explosive<00:02:18.880> type<00:02:19.030> weapons<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:20.410> while

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
and more explosive type weapons so while

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.860 
and more explosive type weapons so while
these<00:02:20.890> undead<00:02:21.730> creatures<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> little<00:02:22.390> stronger

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
these undead creatures a little stronger

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.819 
these undead creatures a little stronger
meteor<00:02:23.860> against<00:02:24.569> small<00:02:25.569> arms<00:02:25.959> they<00:02:26.230> they<00:02:26.620> take

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
meteor against small arms they they take

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.410 
meteor against small arms they they take
more<00:02:27.069> damage<00:02:27.220> from<00:02:27.579> the<00:02:27.640> heavier<00:02:28.000> weapons

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
more damage from the heavier weapons

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.530 
more damage from the heavier weapons
such<00:02:28.690> as<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:29.140> grenade<00:02:29.980> launcher<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:30.670> as<00:02:31.329> you

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
such as the grenade launcher so as you

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.140 
such as the grenade launcher so as you
can<00:02:31.629> see<00:02:31.840> watch<00:02:32.200> all<00:02:32.410> those<00:02:32.620> other<00:02:33.579> nice<00:02:33.819> bugs

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
can see watch all those other nice bugs

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.569 
can see watch all those other nice bugs
burn<00:02:35.370> that's<00:02:36.370> good<00:02:36.609> stuff<00:02:36.880> right<00:02:37.090> there<00:02:37.209> I

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
burn that's good stuff right there I

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.199 
burn that's good stuff right there I
just<00:02:39.579> thought<00:02:39.700> it's<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:39.940> cool<00:02:40.090> effect

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
just thought it's a cool effect

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.030 
just thought it's a cool effect
personally<00:02:40.930> because<00:02:41.079> it<00:02:41.260> just<00:02:41.380> burns<00:02:41.680> them<00:02:41.920> to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
personally because it just burns them to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.280 
personally because it just burns them to

than<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:39.540> know<00:03:39.690> things<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.709> go<00:03:40.950> boom<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.989> in

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
than you know things that go boom so in

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.750 
than you know things that go boom so in
the<00:03:43.170> abilities<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.980> marine<00:03:44.340> cadet<00:03:44.610> he

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
the abilities that the marine cadet he

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.490 
the abilities that the marine cadet he
has<00:03:44.849> a<00:03:44.879> lockdown<00:03:45.150> we<00:03:45.599> can<00:03:45.750> shoot<00:03:45.989> faster<00:03:46.409> and

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
has a lockdown we can shoot faster and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.399 
has a lockdown we can shoot faster and
do<00:03:46.590> more<00:03:47.129> damage<00:03:47.390> at<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.450> cost<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:48.959> movement

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
do more damage at the cost of movement

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.970 
do more damage at the cost of movement
so<00:03:49.680> if<00:03:49.920> you'll<00:03:50.549> have<00:03:50.700> any<00:03:50.909> ideas<00:03:51.769> towards<00:03:52.769> what

so if you'll have any ideas towards what

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.380 
so if you'll have any ideas towards what
the<00:03:53.040> machine<00:03:53.370> gunner<00:03:53.640> could<00:03:53.879> have<00:03:54.120> as<00:03:54.299> an

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
the machine gunner could have as an

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.190 
the machine gunner could have as an
ability<00:03:54.859> maybe<00:03:55.859> I<00:03:56.359> don't<00:03:57.359> know<00:03:57.480> you're<00:03:58.079> trying

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
ability maybe I don't know you're trying

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.069

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
denial when where nothing can go in

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.140
