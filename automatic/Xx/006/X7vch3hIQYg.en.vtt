hello<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.319> CG<00:00:02.070> animator<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:03.620> today

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
hello this is CG animator and today

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.670 
hello this is CG animator and today
we're<00:00:04.890> going<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.069> do<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.549> fluid<00:00:06.480> San<00:00:06.839> tutorial

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
we're going to do a fluid San tutorial

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.190 
we're going to do a fluid San tutorial
and<00:00:08.120> it's<00:00:09.120> not<00:00:09.269> going<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.480> be<00:00:09.570> too<00:00:09.809> in-depth

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
and it's not going to be too in-depth

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.110 
and it's not going to be too in-depth
i'm<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:10.650> going<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.830> show<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.040> some<00:00:11.400> the

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
i'm just going to show you some the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.789 
i'm just going to show you some the
basics<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.719> then<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.900> couple<00:00:13.200> tricks<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.769> I

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
basics and then a couple tricks that I

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.310 
basics and then a couple tricks that I
found<00:00:14.130> another<00:00:15.089> make<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.509> pretty<00:00:15.719> fast<00:00:16.020> and

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
found another make it pretty fast and

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.890 
found another make it pretty fast and
you<00:00:17.100> know<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.220> make<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.400> look<00:00:17.520> pretty<00:00:17.609> good<00:00:17.900> so

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
you know I make it look pretty good so

if<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.780> click<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.190> it<00:01:08.190> just<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.760> simulation

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
if you click that it just the simulation

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.540 
if you click that it just the simulation
is<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> hit<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:11.100> which<00:01:11.400> is

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
is to go down and hit this which is

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.510 
is to go down and hit this which is
going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.730> be<00:01:11.850> our<00:01:12.030> domain<00:01:12.480> here<00:01:13.340> which<00:01:14.340> is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
going to be our domain here which is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.480 
going to be our domain here which is
what<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.910> Bates<00:01:15.210> inside<00:01:15.690> which<00:01:16.140> means

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
what if Bates inside which means

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.010 
what if Bates inside which means
simulation<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.580> going<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.820> happen<00:01:18.720> inside

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
simulation is going to happen inside

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.070 
simulation is going to happen inside
here<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.530> gonna<00:01:19.680> be<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:20.100> 50<00:01:20.580> Fox<00:01:21.080> Hill

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
here and it's gonna be like 50 Fox Hill

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.270 
here and it's gonna be like 50 Fox Hill
being<00:01:22.380> visible<00:01:22.830> what<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> done<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:26.070> just

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
being visible what is done so it just

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.370 
being visible what is done so it just
goes<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> normal<00:01:27.240> fluid<00:01:27.510> nothing

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
goes down with a normal fluid nothing

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.330 
goes down with a normal fluid nothing
else<00:01:28.940> obstacle<00:01:29.940> means<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.530> would<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.860> an

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
else obstacle means that it would be an

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.510 
else obstacle means that it would be an
obstacle<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.840> fluid<00:01:34.170> or<00:01:34.410> another<00:01:35.040> for

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
obstacle for the fluid or another for

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.490 
obstacle for the fluid or another for
another<00:01:35.729> fluid<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.050> you<00:01:37.229> would<00:01:37.350> have<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
another fluid like if you would have a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.999 
another fluid like if you would have a
box<00:01:37.770> here<00:01:38.070> from<00:01:38.340> monkey<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.560> then<00:01:40.560> after<00:01:40.890> us

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
box here from monkey and then after us

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.820 
box here from monkey and then after us
bullets<00:01:41.729> go<00:01:41.880> down<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.380> fluids<00:01:43.710> would

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
bullets go down then the fluids would

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.230 
bullets go down then the fluids would
react<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> month<00:01:44.550> of<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.789> box<00:01:45.000> or

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
react to the month of your box or

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.779 
react to the month of your box or
whatever<00:01:45.679> inflow<00:01:46.679> which<00:01:46.979> would<00:01:47.190> which<00:01:47.610> is

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
whatever inflow which would which is

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.330 
whatever inflow which would which is
what<00:01:47.970> we're<00:01:48.119> gonna<00:01:48.210> pick<00:01:48.450> today<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.920> keeps

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
what we're gonna pick today it keeps

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.480 
what we're gonna pick today it keeps
flowing<00:01:51.330> what<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.289> pretty<00:01:52.950> basic<00:01:53.160> you

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
flowing what is in pretty basic you

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.570 
flowing what is in pretty basic you
that's<00:01:54.000> where<00:01:54.179> to<00:01:54.360> understand<00:01:55.250> outflow<00:01:56.250> it

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
that's where to understand outflow it

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.410 
that's where to understand outflow it
takes<00:01:56.910> away<00:01:57.530> from<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:59.960> fluid<00:02:01.789> particle<00:02:02.789> not

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
takes away from the fluid particle not

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.790 
takes away from the fluid particle not
quite<00:02:03.750> sure<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.229> does<00:02:04.560> yet

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
quite sure what that does yet

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.130 
quite sure what that does yet
control<00:02:06.700> this<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.480> like<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.890> magnet<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:10.330> water

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
control this is like a magnet the water

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.160 
control this is like a magnet the water
like<00:02:11.560> if<00:02:11.710> you<00:02:11.860> would<00:02:12.040> have<00:02:12.790> water<00:02:13.240> bottom<00:02:13.960> part

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
like if you would have water bottom part

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.980 
like if you would have water bottom part
of<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:15.420> domain<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:17.520> then<00:02:18.520> put<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.870> text<00:02:19.870> or

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
of the domain and then put a text or

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.830 
of the domain and then put a text or
logo<00:02:20.380> or<00:02:20.470> whatever<00:02:20.740> under<00:02:21.670> control<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.270> bring

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
logo or whatever under control and bring

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.730 
logo or whatever under control and bring
it<00:02:22.960> up<00:02:23.110> then<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.340> would<00:02:24.550> stick<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.740> mesh

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
it up then it would stick to the mesh

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.620 
it up then it would stick to the mesh
that<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.310> have<00:02:27.490> there<00:02:27.670> we're<00:02:28.450> going<00:02:28.540> to

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
that you have there we're going to

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.320 
that you have there we're going to
picnic<00:02:29.260> flow<00:02:29.470> today<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:30.160> choose<00:02:30.430> both<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.060> I

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
picnic flow today you choose both and I

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.890 
picnic flow today you choose both and I
want<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.660> go<00:02:31.810> on<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.470> exit<00:02:32.830> taxes<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:34.330> there's

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
want to go on the exit taxes so there's

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.160 
want to go on the exit taxes so there's
a<00:02:36.240> 1.2<00:02:37.240> or<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:38.290> me<00:02:38.410> too<00:02:39.960> that's<00:02:40.960> pretty

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
a 1.2 or this is me too that's pretty

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.100 
a 1.2 or this is me too that's pretty
good<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:42.310> means<00:02:42.520> it'll<00:02:42.730> go<00:02:42.910> along<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.930> x

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
good that means it'll go along the x

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.800 
good that means it'll go along the x
axis<00:02:44.260> which<00:02:44.680> is<00:02:44.710> this<00:02:45.070> red<00:02:45.370> line<00:02:46.800> right<00:02:47.800> here

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.400 
axis which is this red line right here
that's<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.860> like<00:02:51.100> this

focus the top right keep it in 20 and
I'm<00:04:06.910> not<00:04:06.940> going<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.209> bake<00:04:07.390> it<00:04:07.420> normally<00:04:07.930> it

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
I'm not going to bake it normally it

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.770 
I'm not going to bake it normally it
would<00:04:08.560> take<00:04:08.590> too<00:04:08.860> long<00:04:08.910> but<00:04:09.910> I'm<00:04:10.270> gonna<00:04:10.390> put<00:04:10.690> it

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
would take too long but I'm gonna put it

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.220 
would take too long but I'm gonna put it
to<00:04:10.930> about<00:04:11.170> 125<00:04:11.740> and<00:04:12.610> normally<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.780> takes<00:04:13.840> a

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
to about 125 and normally it takes a

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.070 
to about 125 and normally it takes a
long<00:04:14.500> time<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:15.070> end<00:04:15.490> it<00:04:15.610> but<00:04:15.970> if<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.299> put<00:04:16.870> n

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
long time to end it but if you put n

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.670 
long time to end it but if you put n
time<00:04:17.290> to<00:04:17.500> about<00:04:18.150> 0.45<00:04:19.350> doesn't<00:04:20.350> take<00:04:20.500> that

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
time to about 0.45 doesn't take that

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.740 
time to about 0.45 doesn't take that

long for some reason with Mike manage my
computer<00:04:23.200> I<00:04:23.410> can<00:04:24.160> only<00:04:24.400> use<00:04:24.790> it<00:04:25.210> for<00:04:25.270> in<00:04:25.900> flow

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940

yeah<00:04:28.530> i'm<00:04:29.530> just<00:04:29.710> going<00:04:29.890> to<00:04:29.919> bake<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.340> I'm<00:04:30.760> going

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
yeah i'm just going to bake it I'm going

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.300 
yeah i'm just going to bake it I'm going
to<00:04:30.970> pause<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:31.270> while<00:04:31.540> it<00:04:31.630> bakes<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:33.040> will<00:04:33.160> only

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
to pause it while it bakes it will only

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.150 
to pause it while it bakes it will only
take<00:04:33.520> about<00:04:33.669> five<00:04:34.000> minutes<00:04:34.140> the<00:04:35.140> little<00:04:35.919> tip<00:04:36.070> I

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
take about five minutes the little tip I

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.700 
take about five minutes the little tip I
will<00:04:36.820> check<00:04:37.060> up<00:04:37.210> on<00:04:37.360> that<00:04:37.540> so<00:04:38.380> I'm<00:04:38.500> going<00:04:38.680> to

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
will check up on that so I'm going to

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
didn't want to wait all this time I

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.140 
didn't want to wait all this time I
waited<00:04:47.320> for<00:04:47.410> about<00:04:47.500> 10<00:04:47.710> minutes<00:04:47.890> so<00:04:48.850> you<00:04:49.000> want

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
waited for about 10 minutes so you want

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.000 
waited for about 10 minutes so you want
to<00:04:49.210> delete<00:04:49.330> this<00:04:49.650> let's<00:04:50.650> see<00:04:50.770> how<00:04:50.830> it<00:04:50.860> looks

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
to delete this let's see how it looks

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.790 
to delete this let's see how it looks
like<00:04:51.540> it<00:04:52.540> doesn't<00:04:52.720> look<00:04:52.900> too<00:04:53.050> good<00:04:53.080> that's

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
like it doesn't look too good that's

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.710 
like it doesn't look too good that's
because<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.130> preview<00:04:54.610> resolution<00:04:55.420> was<00:04:55.540> only

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
because the preview resolution was only

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.190 
because the preview resolution was only
25<00:04:56.140> Rosie<00:04:57.450> so<00:04:58.450> I'm<00:04:58.570> just<00:04:58.750> going<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.930> give<00:04:59.080> it<00:04:59.110> a

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
25 Rosie so I'm just going to give it a

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.239 
25 Rosie so I'm just going to give it a
color

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:02.249 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:05.539 

make<00:05:02.819> it<00:05:03.029> red<00:05:03.299> or<00:05:03.329> something<00:05:04.249> I'm<00:05:05.249> not<00:05:05.399> gonna

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:05.549 
make it red or something I'm not gonna

00:05:05.549 --> 00:05:08.179 
make it red or something I'm not gonna
say<00:05:05.909> smoother<00:05:06.599> add<00:05:06.839> sub<00:05:07.559> syrup<00:05:07.799> to<00:05:07.949> make<00:05:08.099> it

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:08.189 
say smoother add sub syrup to make it

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:09.829 
say smoother add sub syrup to make it
look<00:05:08.339> better<00:05:08.489> because<00:05:08.819> it's<00:05:09.179> just<00:05:09.239> a<00:05:09.509> tutorial

00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:09.839

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:14.419 
you can do that if you want I'll make it
go<00:05:12.839> faster<00:05:13.259> and<00:05:13.289> turn<00:05:13.589> over<00:05:13.829> something<00:05:14.309> off
