00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
they're actually a week before and we we

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.509 
they're actually a week before and we we
talked<00:02:47.660> about<00:02:47.810> bees<00:02:48.260> disappear<00:02:49.040> he<00:02:49.220> had<00:02:49.340> these

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
talked about bees disappear he had these

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.860 
talked about bees disappear he had these
unexpected<00:02:50.299> die<00:02:50.660> offs<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.079> had<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.380> new

unexpected die offs that had a new
symptoms<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:53.970> we<00:02:54.180> expected<00:02:54.870> initially

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
symptoms and so we expected initially

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.800 
symptoms and so we expected initially
that<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.099> was<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.489> royal<00:02:56.790> related<00:02:57.420> problem

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
that it was just a royal related problem

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.680 
that it was just a royal related problem
is<00:02:57.959> due<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.500> mind<00:02:58.950> besides<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.239> bees<00:03:00.450> are

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
is due to this mind besides the bees are

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.280 
is due to this mind besides the bees are
all<00:03:00.810> full<00:03:01.670> weapon<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:02.790> their<00:03:02.970> intestines<00:03:03.660> and

there's a lot of questions out here that
need<00:05:57.570> to<00:05:57.750> be<00:05:57.780> answered<00:05:58.050> and<00:05:58.710> I<00:05:58.830> expected<00:05:59.400> to

diseases and we only had one show up
still<00:06:06.889> didn't<00:06:07.190> answer<00:06:07.430> the<00:06:07.880> whole<00:06:08.030> question<00:06:08.360> I

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
still didn't answer the whole question I

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.170 
still didn't answer the whole question I
suspect<00:06:10.099> that<00:06:10.190> there<00:06:10.550> there's<00:06:10.910> something

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
suspect that there there's something

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.640 
suspect that there there's something
that<00:06:13.060> there's<00:06:14.060> something<00:06:14.120> that<00:06:14.780> in<00:06:15.440> the

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
that there's something that in the

that there's something that in the

environment that is triggering that
that's<00:06:18.169> that's<00:06:18.800> starting<00:06:19.430> this<00:06:19.580> whole

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
that's that's starting this whole

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.120 
that's that's starting this whole
process<00:06:20.120> that's<00:06:20.630> allowing<00:06:21.229> other<00:06:21.800> high

know<00:06:24.620> we<00:06:24.740> we<00:06:25.039> have<00:06:25.250> a<00:06:25.280> lot<00:06:25.580> more<00:06:25.610> answers<00:06:26.270> today

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
know we we have a lot more answers today

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.129 
know we we have a lot more answers today
than<00:06:26.930> we<00:06:27.080> did<00:06:27.259> in<00:06:27.560> November<00:06:28.130> of<00:06:28.840> 2006<00:06:29.840> but

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
than we did in November of 2006 but

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.350 
than we did in November of 2006 but
there's<00:06:30.830> probably<00:06:31.009> more<00:06:31.550> questions<00:06:32.120> and

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
there's probably more questions and

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.990 
there's probably more questions and
there<00:06:32.449> are<00:06:32.539> answers<00:06:32.990> so<00:06:33.949> we're<00:06:34.130> asked<00:06:34.550> faced

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
there are answers so we're asked faced

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.730 
there are answers so we're asked faced
with<00:06:35.240> asking<00:06:35.660> what<00:06:35.810> are<00:06:35.930> the<00:06:36.020> alternative

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
with asking what are the alternative

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.300 
with asking what are the alternative
ways<00:06:36.949> to<00:06:36.979> get<00:06:37.310> the<00:06:37.430> crop<00:06:37.669> pollinated<00:06:39.310> there's

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
ways to get the crop pollinated there's

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.580 
ways to get the crop pollinated there's
one<00:06:40.610> example<00:06:41.210> that<00:06:41.509> comes<00:06:41.750> from<00:06:41.990> a<00:06:42.110> valley<00:06:42.349> in

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
one example that comes from a valley in

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.670 
one example that comes from a valley in
China<00:06:42.889> an<00:06:43.069> area<00:06:43.370> that<00:06:43.490> was<00:06:43.639> so<00:06:44.020> so<00:06:45.020> toxic<00:06:45.650> that

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
China an area that was so so toxic that
