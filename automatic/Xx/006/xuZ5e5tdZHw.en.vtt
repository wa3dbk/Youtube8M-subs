think will come in very handy for the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.160 
think will come in very handy for the
property<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.710> I'm<00:01:11.240> working<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.990> has<00:01:13.140> a

bulk sample and they they mailed it and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.740 
bulk sample and they they mailed it and
processed<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:01.820> they<00:02:02.820> actually<00:02:02.969> had<00:02:03.420> quite

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
processed it and they actually had quite

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.870 
processed it and they actually had quite
a<00:02:03.780> low<00:02:04.020> recovery<00:02:04.619> rate<00:02:04.829> according<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.369> some<00:02:05.729> of

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
a low recovery rate according to some of

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.199 
a low recovery rate according to some of
the<00:02:07.280> assessment<00:02:08.280> reports<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.819> I've<00:02:09.000> been

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
the assessment reports that I've been

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.620 
the assessment reports that I've been
reviewing<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.730> so<00:02:11.730> what<00:02:12.330> I

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
reviewing and so what I

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.790 
reviewing and so what I
on<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> lark<00:02:13.140> when<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.410> was<00:02:13.500> up<00:02:13.620> there<00:02:13.740> last

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
on a lark when I was up there last

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.370 
on a lark when I was up there last
year's<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.700> asked<00:02:15.270> ade<00:02:15.420> some<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.930> tailings

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
year's I asked ade some of the tailings

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
year's I asked ade some of the tailings
and<00:02:16.590> found<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.780> highest<00:02:18.990> sample<00:02:19.980> out<00:02:20.280> of

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
and found that the highest sample out of

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.640 
and found that the highest sample out of
four<00:02:20.610> samples<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.120> took<00:02:21.150> assayed<00:02:21.840> else<00:02:22.350> per

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
four samples I took assayed else per

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.460 
four samples I took assayed else per
tonne<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.790> figure<00:02:24.150> there's<00:02:24.390> still<00:02:25.050> gold<00:02:25.320> in

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
tonne so I figure there's still gold in

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.070 
tonne so I figure there's still gold in
those<00:02:25.590> tailings<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.570> I<00:02:27.600> thought<00:02:27.870> well

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
those tailings and so I thought well

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.510 
those tailings and so I thought well
maybe<00:02:28.110> if<00:02:28.410> it's<00:02:28.560> if<00:02:28.830> there's<00:02:28.980> some<00:02:29.100> free<00:02:29.280> gold

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
maybe if it's if there's some free gold

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.070 
maybe if it's if there's some free gold
I<00:02:29.670> should<00:02:29.820> be<00:02:29.910> able<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> capture<00:02:30.360> some<00:02:30.720> using

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
I should be able to capture some using

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.410 
I should be able to capture some using
this<00:02:31.230> system<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.520> that's<00:02:32.700> my<00:02:32.910> whole<00:02:33.180> idea

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
this system so that's my whole idea

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.090 
this system so that's my whole idea
behind<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.230> loose<00:02:34.500> box<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:36.800> just<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.920> little

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
behind this loose box and just a little

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.790 
behind this loose box and just a little
bit<00:02:38.580> about<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.120> design<00:02:39.300> again<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.590> very

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
bit about the design again it's very

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.660 
bit about the design again it's very
similar<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.760> one<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.060> eighty<00:02:42.270> mesh<00:02:42.510> uses

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
similar to the one that eighty mesh uses

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.460 
similar to the one that eighty mesh uses
it's<00:02:44.670> can<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.390> was<00:02:45.510> constructed<00:02:46.140> in<00:02:46.290> two

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
it's can it was constructed in two

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.950 
it's can it was constructed in two
separate<00:02:47.010> parts<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.640> could<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:48.510> kind<00:02:48.900> of

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
separate parts so it could be kind of

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.380 
separate parts so it could be kind of
easily<00:02:49.260> transportable<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.940> van<00:02:51.150> or<00:02:51.330> a

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
easily transportable in a in a van or a

I'll<00:03:06.780> take<00:03:06.960> you<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.140> little<00:03:07.350> bit<00:03:07.470> closer<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:08.070> so

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
I'll take you a little bit closer in so

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.130 
I'll take you a little bit closer in so
you<00:03:08.640> can<00:03:08.760> have<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.910> better<00:03:09.120> look<00:03:09.300> at<00:03:09.480> this<00:03:09.630> thing

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
you can have a better look at this thing

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.290 
you can have a better look at this thing
this<00:03:10.830> is<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.040> back<00:03:11.190> end<00:03:11.460> of<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.700> sluice<00:03:11.940> I

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
this is the back end of the sluice I

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.990 
this is the back end of the sluice I
have<00:03:12.660> some<00:03:12.900> expanded<00:03:13.350> metal<00:03:13.440> grating<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:14.790> is

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
have some expanded metal grating this is

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.120 
have some expanded metal grating this is
we're<00:03:15.810> gonna<00:03:15.990> be<00:03:16.170> dumping<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.740> tailings

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
we're gonna be dumping in the tailings

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.040 
we're gonna be dumping in the tailings
mixed<00:03:17.430> with<00:03:17.520> water<00:03:17.730> any<00:03:18.450> coarser<00:03:18.930> material

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
mixed with water any coarser material

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.520 
mixed with water any coarser material
will<00:03:19.650> be<00:03:19.770> left<00:03:19.950> on<00:03:20.130> top<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.520> the<00:03:20.580> grading<00:03:21.530> all

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
will be left on top of the grading all

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.590 
will be left on top of the grading all
the<00:03:22.740> slurry<00:03:22.980> once<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.370> hits<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.670> slick<00:03:24.360> plate

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
the slurry once it hits the slick plate

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.940 
the slurry once it hits the slick plate
it'll<00:03:25.410> float<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:25.800> down<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.790> sluice<00:03:27.770> to<00:03:28.770> the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
it'll float on down the sluice to the

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.910 
it'll float on down the sluice to the
throat<00:03:29.430> which<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.820> again<00:03:30.120> 4<00:03:30.420> inches<00:03:30.660> wide<00:03:30.920> you

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
throat which is again 4 inches wide you

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.650 
throat which is again 4 inches wide you
know<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.490> water<00:03:32.670> depth<00:03:32.970> will<00:03:33.120> increase<00:03:33.180> in

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
know the water depth will increase in

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.990 
know the water depth will increase in
this<00:03:33.720> area<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:35.070> also<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.490> turret<00:03:35.760> will<00:03:35.880> be<00:03:35.970> a

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
this area and also the turret will be a

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.280 
this area and also the turret will be a
little<00:03:36.180> bit<00:03:36.330> more<00:03:36.450> turbulent<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:36.990> hopefully

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
little bit more turbulent and hopefully

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.960 
little bit more turbulent and hopefully
the<00:03:37.440> gold<00:03:37.650> will<00:03:37.770> drop<00:03:38.040> out<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.430> be<00:03:38.520> grabbed<00:03:38.790> by

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
the gold will drop out and be grabbed by

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.390 
the gold will drop out and be grabbed by
that<00:03:39.150> grading<00:03:39.530> that's<00:03:40.530> half<00:03:40.710> inch<00:03:40.950> grading

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
that grading that's half inch grading

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.400 
that grading that's half inch grading
and<00:03:41.640> adjacent<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.300> I<00:03:42.420> got<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.660> coarser

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
and adjacent to it I got a coarser

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.330 
and adjacent to it I got a coarser
grading<00:03:43.830> made<00:03:44.459> from<00:03:44.670> bread<00:03:44.910> flats<00:03:45.209> and

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
grading made from bread flats and

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.920 
grading made from bread flats and
underneath<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.670> grading<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.209> have<00:03:48.390> miner's

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
underneath the grading I have miner's

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.550 
underneath the grading I have miner's
moss<00:03:49.459> I<00:03:50.750> ran<00:03:51.750> out<00:03:51.930> of<00:03:51.959> miner's<00:03:52.350> moss

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
moss I ran out of miner's moss

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.010 
moss I ran out of miner's moss
unfortunately<00:03:53.459> so<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.060> had<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.270> actually<00:03:54.600> use<00:03:54.990> a

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
unfortunately so I had to actually use a

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.140 
unfortunately so I had to actually use a
different<00:03:55.500> type<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.709> material<00:03:55.920> at<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:56.730> end<00:03:56.910> of

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
different type of material at the end of

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.820 
different type of material at the end of
the<00:03:57.270> sluice<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.810> actually<00:03:58.380> went<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.709> the

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
the sluice I actually went to the

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.320 
the sluice I actually went to the
hardware<00:03:59.070> store<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.340> paid<00:03:59.520> 6<00:03:59.790> bucks<00:03:59.850> for<00:04:00.300> a

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
hardware store and paid 6 bucks for a

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.500 
hardware store and paid 6 bucks for a
washable<00:04:00.990> furnace<00:04:01.440> filter<00:04:01.800> not<00:04:02.670> exactly<00:04:03.330> the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
washable furnace filter not exactly the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.150 
washable furnace filter not exactly the
same<00:04:03.720> stuff<00:04:04.020> but<00:04:04.050> I'll<00:04:04.530> give<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.740> a<00:04:04.860> try<00:04:05.100> and

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
same stuff but I'll give it a try and

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.990 
same stuff but I'll give it a try and
see<00:04:05.340> if<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.520> works

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
see if it works

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.050 
see if it works
and<00:04:06.560> underneath<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:08.280> miner's<00:04:08.610> moss<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:08.970> the

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
and underneath the miner's moss and the

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.540 
and underneath the miner's moss and the
furnace<00:04:09.330> filter<00:04:09.600> I<00:04:09.630> also<00:04:09.870> put<00:04:10.290> some<00:04:10.709> felt<00:04:11.400> to

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
furnace filter I also put some felt to

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.570 
furnace filter I also put some felt to
catch<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.480> finer<00:04:12.660> gold<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.950> that's<00:04:14.190> um

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
catch the finer gold so so that's um

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.340 
catch the finer gold so so that's um
that's<00:04:14.910> sort<00:04:15.510> of<00:04:15.540> what<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:15.720> looks<00:04:15.959> like<00:04:16.140> and

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
that's sort of what it looks like and

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.630 
that's sort of what it looks like and
that's<00:04:16.410> sort<00:04:16.590> of<00:04:16.680> what<00:04:16.770> I<00:04:16.830> have<00:04:17.070> in<00:04:17.190> place<00:04:17.400> I

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
that's sort of what I have in place I

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.380 
that's sort of what I have in place I
also<00:04:18.120> put<00:04:18.450> in<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:19.049> clamped<00:04:20.010> down<00:04:20.040> some<00:04:20.430> chunks

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
also put in I clamped down some chunks

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.140 
also put in I clamped down some chunks
of<00:04:21.510> plastic<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.410> hold<00:04:22.650> down<00:04:22.860> that's<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.250> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
of plastic to hold down that's the the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.830 
of plastic to hold down that's the the
bread<00:04:24.390> flats<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.930> grading<00:04:25.169> so

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
bread flats and the grading so

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.760 
bread flats and the grading so
hopefully<00:04:26.530> that'll<00:04:26.710> work<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:28.470> on<00:04:29.470> another

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
hopefully that'll work and on another

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.420 
hopefully that'll work and on another
note<00:04:29.980> I<00:04:30.240> like<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.360> do<00:04:31.480> things<00:04:31.720> on<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:31.930> cheap

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
note I like to do things on the cheap

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.180 
note I like to do things on the cheap
this<00:04:33.430> whole<00:04:33.850> thing<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.360> think<00:04:34.919> probably<00:04:35.919> cost

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
this whole thing I think probably cost

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.480 
this whole thing I think probably cost
me<00:04:36.340> about<00:04:36.400> 150<00:04:37.090> bucks<00:04:37.889> 120<00:04:38.889> bucks<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.280> get<00:04:39.370> the

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
me about 150 bucks 120 bucks to get the

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.189 
me about 150 bucks 120 bucks to get the
metal<00:04:39.729> fabricated<00:04:40.389> which<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:40.870> thought<00:04:41.020> was<00:04:41.139> a

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
metal fabricated which I thought was a

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.350 
metal fabricated which I thought was a
pretty<00:04:41.350> good<00:04:41.530> deal<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:42.240> most<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.330> other

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
pretty good deal and most the other

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.909 
pretty good deal and most the other
stuff<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.750> had<00:04:43.870> kicking<00:04:44.139> around<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.410> house<00:04:44.560> I

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
stuff I had kicking around the house I

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.400 
stuff I had kicking around the house I
didn't<00:04:45.639> want<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:46.630> spend<00:04:46.780> too<00:04:46.960> much<00:04:47.050> money<00:04:47.229> you

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
didn't want to spend too much money you

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.960 
didn't want to spend too much money you
think<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.680> miners<00:04:47.949> must<00:04:48.100> have<00:04:48.310> paid<00:04:48.430> about<00:04:48.550> 40

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
think the miners must have paid about 40

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.700 
think the miners must have paid about 40
bucks<00:04:49.120> with<00:04:49.360> shipping<00:04:49.750> it<00:04:50.320> was<00:04:50.440> kind<00:04:50.590> of<00:04:50.650> a

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
bucks with shipping it was kind of a

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.689 
bucks with shipping it was kind of a
specialty<00:04:51.100> item<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.490> had<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.669> order<00:04:51.820> in<00:04:52.060> and

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
specialty item I had to order in and

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.980 
specialty item I had to order in and
yeah<00:04:54.699> so<00:04:54.970> one<00:04:55.060> hundred<00:04:55.120> fifty<00:04:55.479> hundred<00:04:55.570> sixty

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
yeah so one hundred fifty hundred sixty

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.650 
yeah so one hundred fifty hundred sixty
bucks<00:04:56.850> don't<00:04:57.850> want<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.090> spend<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.330> lot<00:04:58.419> of<00:04:58.479> money

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
bucks don't want to spend a lot of money

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.360 
bucks don't want to spend a lot of money
want<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.500> make<00:04:59.620> sure<00:04:59.740> you<00:04:59.889> get<00:05:00.010> some<00:05:00.190> gold

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
want to make sure you get some gold

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.360 
want to make sure you get some gold
though<00:05:00.610> if<00:05:01.360> I<00:05:01.510> don't<00:05:01.690> get<00:05:01.780> any<00:05:01.960> gold<00:05:02.200> I'm<00:05:03.190> out

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
though if I don't get any gold I'm out

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.800 
though if I don't get any gold I'm out
of<00:05:03.400> pocket<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:03.820> little<00:05:03.940> bit<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.360> just<00:05:04.630> walk

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
of pocket a little bit and just walk

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.350 
of pocket a little bit and just walk
away<00:05:05.020> with<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:05.200> bruised<00:05:05.500> ego<00:05:05.620> so<00:05:06.010> not<00:05:06.910> too<00:05:07.120> bad

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
away with a bruised ego so not too bad

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.010 
away with a bruised ego so not too bad
and<00:05:08.729> the<00:05:09.729> only<00:05:09.760> other<00:05:10.090> thing<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.419> got<00:05:10.570> a<00:05:10.600> workout

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
and the only other thing I got a workout

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
and the only other thing I got a workout
is<00:05:11.320> the<00:05:11.860> flow<00:05:12.220> rate<00:05:12.250> I'm<00:05:12.970> not<00:05:13.150> sure<00:05:13.300> how<00:05:13.419> much

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
is the flow rate I'm not sure how much

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.080 
is the flow rate I'm not sure how much
should<00:05:15.040> throw<00:05:15.250> down<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.550> sluice<00:05:15.760> at<00:05:15.940> any

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
should throw down the sluice at any

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.310 
should throw down the sluice at any
given<00:05:16.300> time<00:05:16.540> I'll<00:05:16.810> do<00:05:16.960> a<00:05:17.020> little<00:05:17.139> bit<00:05:17.289> more

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
given time I'll do a little bit more

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.379 
given time I'll do a little bit more
research<00:05:17.680> on<00:05:17.889> that<00:05:18.100> once<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:19.030> find<00:05:19.240> that<00:05:19.300> out

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
research on that once I find that out

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.279 
research on that once I find that out
I'll<00:05:19.630> let<00:05:19.810> let<00:05:20.260> you<00:05:20.380> know<00:05:20.530> also<00:05:21.340> I<00:05:22.050> did<00:05:23.050> find

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
I'll let let you know also I did find

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.980 
I'll let let you know also I did find
out<00:05:23.410> that<00:05:23.699> there<00:05:24.699> is<00:05:24.850> an<00:05:25.000> optimal<00:05:25.449> range<00:05:25.660> for

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
out that there is an optimal range for

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.870 
out that there is an optimal range for
setting<00:05:26.350> this<00:05:26.440> thing<00:05:26.500> up<00:05:26.830> at<00:05:27.130> an<00:05:27.370> angle<00:05:27.490> of<00:05:27.789> a

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
setting this thing up at an angle of a

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.960 
setting this thing up at an angle of a
boat<00:05:28.060> between<00:05:28.360> 7<00:05:28.840> and<00:05:28.960> 12<00:05:29.650> degrees<00:05:30.039> it<00:05:30.729> seems

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
boat between 7 and 12 degrees it seems

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.219 
boat between 7 and 12 degrees it seems
to<00:05:31.150> be<00:05:31.919> an<00:05:32.919> optimal<00:05:33.400> angle<00:05:33.789> for<00:05:34.270> capturing<00:05:34.990> the

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
to be an optimal angle for capturing the

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.279 
to be an optimal angle for capturing the
fine<00:05:35.740> gold<00:05:35.979> so<00:05:36.510> once<00:05:37.510> it<00:05:37.660> gets<00:05:37.780> out<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.080> field

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
fine gold so once it gets out the field

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.320 
fine gold so once it gets out the field
we'll<00:05:38.440> set<00:05:38.620> it<00:05:38.650> up<00:05:38.770> like<00:05:38.860> that<00:05:38.979> and<00:05:39.190> yeah<00:05:40.060> we'll

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
we'll set it up like that and yeah we'll

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.170 
we'll set it up like that and yeah we'll
see<00:05:40.479> how<00:05:40.510> it<00:05:40.630> goes<00:05:40.810> well<00:05:41.710> I'll<00:05:41.919> head<00:05:42.910> out<00:05:42.940> to

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
see how it goes well I'll head out to

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.180 
see how it goes well I'll head out to
the<00:05:43.270> field<00:05:43.479> give<00:05:43.810> it<00:05:43.900> a<00:05:43.990> test<00:05:44.200> and<00:05:44.560> post

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
the field give it a test and post

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.380 
the field give it a test and post
another<00:05:45.400> video<00:05:45.870> with<00:05:46.870> the<00:05:46.990> results
