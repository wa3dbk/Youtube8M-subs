hi<00:00:01.439> good<00:00:01.890> morning<00:00:02.210> today<00:00:03.210> we'll<00:00:03.720> be<00:00:03.899> learning

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
hi good morning today we'll be learning

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.559 
hi good morning today we'll be learning
about<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.650> working<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.310> turbocharger<00:00:05.970> so

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
about the working of a turbocharger so

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.280 
about the working of a turbocharger so
here<00:00:07.529> we<00:00:07.710> have<00:00:07.980> actually<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:09.240> strip<00:00:09.990> a

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
here we have actually a strip a

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.430 
here we have actually a strip a
turbocharger<00:00:11.190> so<00:00:11.730> let's<00:00:12.480> see<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.809> dismantled

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
turbocharger so let's see the dismantled

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.369 
turbocharger so let's see the dismantled
view<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.630> turbocharger<00:00:15.630> over<00:00:15.780> here<00:00:16.109> we'll

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
view of a turbocharger over here we'll

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.320 
view of a turbocharger over here we'll
be<00:00:16.619> identifying<00:00:17.580> all<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.000> internal

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
be identifying all the internal

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.710 
be identifying all the internal
components<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.770> turbocharger<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.850> we'll

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
components of the turbocharger and we'll

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.689 
components of the turbocharger and we'll
see<00:00:21.960> how<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.500> turbocharger<00:00:23.400> actually<00:00:23.910> works<00:00:24.779> so

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
see how a turbocharger actually works so

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.290 
see how a turbocharger actually works so
this<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.960> look<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.560> how<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
this is the look this is how a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.930 
this is the look this is how a
turbocharger<00:00:30.300> actually<00:00:30.720> looks<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.520> so<00:00:32.520> this

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
turbocharger actually looks like so this

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.830 
turbocharger actually looks like so this
is<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.360> exhaust<00:00:34.160> side<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:36.239> means<00:00:36.450> that

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
is the exhaust side and that means that

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.510 
is the exhaust side and that means that
where<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.290> exhaust<00:00:37.620> gas<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.040> entering<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
where the exhaust gas is entering the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.209 
where the exhaust gas is entering the
turbocharger<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:40.110> area<00:00:40.320> where<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
turbocharger and this area where the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.389 
turbocharger and this area where the
fresh<00:00:41.460> air<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.940> being<00:00:42.329> sucked<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.399> delivered

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
fresh air is being sucked and delivered

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.330 
fresh air is being sucked and delivered
to<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> inlet<00:00:45.480> manifold<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.379> engine<00:00:46.680> so

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
to the inlet manifold of the engine so

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.029 
to the inlet manifold of the engine so
let's<00:00:47.700> see

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
let's see

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.229 
let's see
look<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> turbocharger<00:00:50.879> from<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
look the turbocharger from the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.700 
look the turbocharger from the
right-hand<00:00:52.170> side<00:00:52.500> from<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.280> area<00:00:53.690> okay<00:00:54.710> so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
right-hand side from this area okay so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.610 
right-hand side from this area okay so
you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.719> clearly<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you can see you can clearly see at the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.130 
you can see you can clearly see at the
center<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.609> black<00:01:00.030> veins<00:01:00.480> over<00:01:00.870> here

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
center here this black veins over here

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.799 
center here this black veins over here
is<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.440> turbine<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:03.059> are<00:01:03.180> looking<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
is the turbine so we are looking the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.880 
is the turbine so we are looking the
turbocharger<00:01:04.530> from<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.339> direction<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.619> this

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
turbocharger from this direction so this

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.850 
turbocharger from this direction so this
is<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.310> turbine<00:01:09.270> very<00:01:09.689> clearly<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.590> black

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
is the turbine very clearly it is black

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.530 
is the turbine very clearly it is black
in<00:01:11.100> color<00:01:11.130> because<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> used

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
in color because this is a used

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.160 
in color because this is a used
turbocharger<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:14.700> carbon<00:01:15.060> deposits<00:01:15.210> are

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
turbocharger and the carbon deposits are

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.249 
turbocharger and the carbon deposits are
visible<00:01:16.680> over<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:18.390> areas<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.110> can

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
visible over here so this areas you can

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.830 
visible over here so this areas you can
see<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.560> connected<00:01:20.009> towards<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.840> XO's

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
see is connected towards the XO's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.770 
see is connected towards the XO's
manifold<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.250> engine<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.299> means<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
manifold of the engine that means the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.320 
manifold of the engine that means the
exhaust<00:01:25.200> air<00:01:25.470> enters<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.340> turbocharger

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
exhaust air enters the turbocharger

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.600 
exhaust air enters the turbocharger
through<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.900> direction<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:29.100> comes<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
through this direction and it comes and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.810 
through this direction and it comes and
hit<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.509> veins<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> turbine<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
hit the veins of the turbine here and it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.850 
hit the veins of the turbine here and it
escaped<00:01:33.450> through<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.930> silencer<00:01:34.590> through

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
escaped through the silencer through

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.240 
escaped through the silencer through
this<00:01:35.070> area<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:36.090> let's<00:01:36.299> open<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.960> cover<00:01:37.259> so

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
this area so let's open this cover so

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.550 
this area so let's open this cover so
here<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.939> see<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> clear<00:01:39.840> picture<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
here you can see a clear picture of the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.910 
here you can see a clear picture of the
turbine<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.750> how<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.110> actually<00:01:43.350> looks

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
turbine so this is how it actually looks

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.700 
turbine so this is how it actually looks
like<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.149> clearly<00:01:45.630> see<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.320> veins

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
like here we can clearly see the veins

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.539 
like here we can clearly see the veins
the<00:01:47.490> angle<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.270> veins<00:01:48.960> over<00:01:49.439> here<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.130> this

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
the angle of the veins over here so this

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.260 
the angle of the veins over here so this
is<00:01:50.610> how<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.899> EXO's<00:01:52.259> gas<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.759> coming<00:01:53.759> from<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
is how the EXO's gas is coming from the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.039 
is how the EXO's gas is coming from the
X<00:01:54.930> was<00:01:55.140> manifold<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.640> hits<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.600> turbine

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
X was manifold and hits the turbine

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.289 
X was manifold and hits the turbine
resulting<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.250> turbine<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.759> rotate<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.180> an

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
resulting in the turbine to rotate in an

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.319 
resulting in the turbine to rotate in an
anti-clockwise<00:02:01.490> direction<00:02:02.490> after<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
anti-clockwise direction after the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.649 
anti-clockwise direction after the
turbine<00:02:03.979> rotates<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.399> EXO's<00:02:05.729> gas<00:02:05.939> xscape

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
turbine rotates the EXO's gas xscape

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.389 
turbine rotates the EXO's gas xscape
through<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.229> silence<00:02:07.649> or<00:02:07.829> towards<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
through the silence or towards the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.699 
through the silence or towards the
atmosphere<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.239> that's<00:02:09.509> simply<00:02:09.899> what<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
atmosphere so that's simply what the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.070 
atmosphere so that's simply what the
expose<00:02:11.039> gas<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.610> doing<00:02:12.120> or<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.660> how<00:02:12.690> an

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
expose gas is doing or this is how an

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.760 
expose gas is doing or this is how an
expose

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
expose

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.820 
expose
is<00:02:13.920> powering<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.930> turbocharger<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.200> this

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
is powering a turbocharger so this

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.370 
is powering a turbocharger so this
turbine<00:02:17.370> attains<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:18.050> rpm<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.370> rpm<00:02:20.940> is

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
turbine attains a rpm and this rpm is

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.740 
turbine attains a rpm and this rpm is
transmitted<00:02:22.550> towards<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.820> fins<00:02:24.210> or<00:02:24.570> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
transmitted towards the fins or the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.170 
transmitted towards the fins or the
blades<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.680> compressor<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.790> means<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
blades of the compressor that means the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.120 
blades of the compressor that means the
compressor<00:02:27.480> blades<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:28.260> been<00:02:28.350> powered<00:02:28.920> with

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
compressor blades have been powered with

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.840 
compressor blades have been powered with
the<00:02:29.250> help<00:02:29.490> of<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:30.450> rpm<00:02:31.080> which<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:32.100> produced

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
the help of this rpm which is produced

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.960 
the help of this rpm which is produced
by<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.690> velocity<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.370> exhaust<00:02:35.460> gas

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
by the velocity of the exhaust gas

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.530 
by the velocity of the exhaust gas
hitting<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:39.210> is<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:40.430> compressor

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
hitting it so this is the compressor

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.790 
hitting it so this is the compressor
casing<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.960> can<00:02:43.110> see<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.440> compressor

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
casing and you can see the compressor

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.090 
casing and you can see the compressor
blades<00:02:44.040> over<00:02:44.520> here<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.350> port<00:02:46.710> where

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
blades over here so this is a port where

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.850 
blades over here so this is a port where
the<00:02:47.540> fresh<00:02:48.540> air<00:02:48.810> from<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.110> atmosphere<00:02:49.200> is

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
the fresh air from the atmosphere is

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.280 
the fresh air from the atmosphere is
being<00:02:50.160> sucked<00:02:50.520> inside<00:02:51.170> towards<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
being sucked inside towards the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.990 
being sucked inside towards the
turbocharger<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.250> have<00:02:53.430> been<00:02:53.580> compressed

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
turbocharger I have been compressed

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.930 
turbocharger I have been compressed
inside<00:02:54.600> these<00:02:55.470> casing<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.220> these<00:02:56.670> being

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
inside these casing and these being

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.550 
inside these casing and these being
supplied<00:02:57.330> through<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.870> direction<00:02:58.410> towards

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
supplied through this direction towards

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.820 
supplied through this direction towards
the<00:02:58.920> inlet<00:02:59.480> manifold<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.930> engine<00:03:01.260> so

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
the inlet manifold of the engine so

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.610 
the inlet manifold of the engine so
let's<00:03:02.130> see<00:03:02.340> how<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.580> actually<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:04.050> air<00:03:04.200> fresh

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
let's see how I actually the air fresh

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.040 
let's see how I actually the air fresh
air<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:04.980> being<00:03:05.220> sucked<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:06.060> compressed

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
air is being sucked and get compressed

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.270 
air is being sucked and get compressed
inside<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.580> area<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.420> we<00:03:09.810> have<00:03:10.020> removed<00:03:10.440> this

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
inside this area so we have removed this

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.380 
inside this area so we have removed this
casing<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.540> let's<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:12.990> these<00:03:13.730> fins<00:03:14.730> or<00:03:15.060> the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
casing so let's see these fins or the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.980 
casing so let's see these fins or the
veins<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.970> compressor<00:03:17.970> very<00:03:18.150> clearly<00:03:18.480> so

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
veins of the compressor very clearly so

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.930 
veins of the compressor very clearly so
this<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.620> how<00:03:19.830> actually<00:03:20.570> it<00:03:21.570> looks<00:03:22.200> like<00:03:22.940> so

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
this is how actually it looks like so

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.760 
this is how actually it looks like so
here<00:03:24.240> you<00:03:24.390> can<00:03:24.540> see<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.840> much<00:03:25.380> more<00:03:25.530> clear

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
here you can see a much more clear

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.710 
here you can see a much more clear
picture<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.880> as<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.750> turbine<00:03:28.709> over<00:03:29.130> here

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
picture so as the turbine over here

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.290 
picture so as the turbine over here
rotates<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:31.050> rpm<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:31.860> reflected<00:03:32.550> over<00:03:32.970> here

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
rotates that rpm is reflected over here

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.880 
rotates that rpm is reflected over here
so<00:03:33.630> as<00:03:33.840> these<00:03:35.570> compressor<00:03:36.570> blades<00:03:37.170> rotate<00:03:37.709> it

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
so as these compressor blades rotate it

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.380 
so as these compressor blades rotate it
sucks<00:03:38.370> fresh<00:03:38.730> air<00:03:38.970> from<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.360> atmosphere

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
sucks fresh air from the atmosphere

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.570 
sucks fresh air from the atmosphere
through<00:03:40.080> this<00:03:40.350> direction<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.220> fresh<00:03:41.430> air

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
through this direction and the fresh air

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.120 
through this direction and the fresh air
enters<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:44.450> compressor<00:03:45.450> blades<00:03:45.990> and<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.709> gets

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
enters the compressor blades and it gets

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.130 
enters the compressor blades and it gets
compressed<00:03:47.580> when<00:03:48.240> it<00:03:48.360> pass<00:03:48.630> through<00:03:48.660> these

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
compressed when it pass through these

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.810 
compressed when it pass through these
veins<00:03:49.350> because<00:03:49.709> here<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.130> area<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.459> getting

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
veins because here the area is getting

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.910 
veins because here the area is getting
reduced<00:03:51.330> over<00:03:51.780> here<00:03:52.020> and<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.620> can<00:03:52.740> see<00:03:52.890> a

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
reduced over here and you can see a

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.760 
reduced over here and you can see a
channel<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.880> this<00:03:54.510> winds<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:55.020> as<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:55.440> enters

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
channel of this winds so as it enters

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.250 
channel of this winds so as it enters
here<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.610> air<00:03:56.850> get<00:03:57.120> compressed<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.140> is

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
here the air get compressed and it is

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.440 
here the air get compressed and it is
the<00:03:58.440> plate<00:03:58.709> towards<00:03:59.340> Inlet<00:03:59.640> manifold<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.270> the

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
the plate towards Inlet manifold of the

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.250 
the plate towards Inlet manifold of the
engine<00:04:00.780> through<00:04:01.380> this<00:04:02.040> area<00:04:02.480> so<00:04:03.480> this

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
engine through this area so this

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.520 
engine through this area so this
actually<00:04:04.709> can<00:04:04.950> give<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.490> a<00:04:05.550> clear<00:04:05.910> example

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
actually can give you a clear example

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.750 
actually can give you a clear example
explenation<00:04:07.530> about<00:04:07.800> how<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.160> works<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.580> we

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
explenation about how it works so we

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.660 
explenation about how it works so we
have<00:04:08.970> open<00:04:09.390> both<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.930> cover<00:04:10.320> so<00:04:10.709> both<00:04:11.489> the

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
have open both the cover so both the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.699 
have open both the cover so both the
turbine<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.750> compressor<00:04:12.780> blades<00:04:13.380> are

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
turbine and the compressor blades are

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.520 
turbine and the compressor blades are
visible<00:04:14.100> over<00:04:14.220> here<00:04:14.550> so<00:04:15.030> EXO's<00:04:15.780> gas<00:04:16.049> is<00:04:16.200> coming

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
visible over here so EXO's gas is coming

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.710 
visible over here so EXO's gas is coming
and<00:04:16.650> hitting<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.070> turbine<00:04:17.400> here<00:04:17.760> which<00:04:18.330> helps

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
and hitting the turbine here which helps

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.650 
and hitting the turbine here which helps
the<00:04:18.870> turbine<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.799> rotate<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:20.430> after<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.270> the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
the turbine to rotate and after that the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.020 
the turbine to rotate and after that the
EXO's<00:04:22.049> gas<00:04:22.320> escapes<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.490> would<00:04:23.669> through<00:04:23.910> the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
EXO's gas escapes I would through the

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.870 
EXO's gas escapes I would through the
silencer<00:04:24.600> towards<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.410> atmosphere<00:04:25.919> so<00:04:26.310> what

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
silencer towards the atmosphere so what

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.140 
silencer towards the atmosphere so what
is

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
is

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.189 
is
left<00:04:27.330> behind<00:04:27.720> is<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.320> RPM<00:04:30.530> produced<00:04:31.530> or

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
left behind is the RPM produced or

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.540 
left behind is the RPM produced or
attained<00:04:34.199> by<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.470> turbine<00:04:35.009> due<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.460> the

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
attained by the turbine due to the

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.550 
attained by the turbine due to the
velocity<00:04:35.789> of<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.630> exhaust<00:04:36.720> gas<00:04:37.110> hitting<00:04:37.470> the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
velocity of the exhaust gas hitting the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.830 
velocity of the exhaust gas hitting the
turbine<00:04:37.889> and<00:04:38.070> this<00:04:38.280> rpm<00:04:38.850> is<00:04:38.970> transmitted<00:04:39.690> to

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840

will be capable of combusting or burning

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.120 
will be capable of combusting or burning
more<00:05:22.979> fuel<00:05:23.340> inside<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:25.080> inlet<00:05:25.560> manifold

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
more fuel inside the inlet manifold

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.670 
more fuel inside the inlet manifold
which<00:05:26.570> facilitates<00:05:27.570> the<00:05:27.690> engine<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.199> produce

which facilitates the engine to produce

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.330 
which facilitates the engine to produce
more<00:05:29.340> power<00:05:29.699> or<00:05:30.030> more<00:05:30.930> torque<00:05:31.260> so<00:05:31.740> that's<00:05:32.099> how

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
more power or more torque so that's how

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.339 
more power or more torque so that's how
simply<00:05:32.699> it<00:05:32.970> a<00:05:33.090> butcher<00:05:33.840> is<00:05:34.110> providing<00:05:34.620> a<00:05:34.740> boost

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349 
simply it a butcher is providing a boost

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.850 
simply it a butcher is providing a boost
with<00:05:37.349> the<00:05:37.440> help<00:05:37.650> of<00:05:38.840> producing<00:05:39.840> with<00:05:40.530> helps

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
with the help of producing with helps

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.250 
with the help of producing with helps
the<00:05:41.099> engine<00:05:41.250> to<00:05:41.580> produce<00:05:41.760> more<00:05:42.120> power<00:05:42.840> or<00:05:42.960> more

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
the engine to produce more power or more

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.490 
the engine to produce more power or more
torque<00:05:43.620> so<00:05:44.010> this<00:05:44.280> is<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.870> dismantled<00:05:45.870> view<00:05:46.169> so

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
torque so this is a dismantled view so

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.070 
torque so this is a dismantled view so
here<00:05:46.710> we<00:05:46.860> have<00:05:47.099> the<00:05:47.639> turbine<00:05:48.270> we<00:05:48.479> have<00:05:48.690> the

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
here we have the turbine we have the

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.330 
here we have the turbine we have the
compressor<00:05:49.409> blades<00:05:49.590> so<00:05:49.979> this<00:05:50.130> is<00:05:50.250> the

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
compressor blades so this is the

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.930 
compressor blades so this is the
compressor<00:05:50.729> crazy<00:05:51.030> and<00:05:51.419> this<00:05:51.659> is<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:52.940> turbine

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
compressor crazy and this is the turbine

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.320 
compressor crazy and this is the turbine
casing<00:05:54.150> so<00:05:54.690> I<00:05:54.960> hope<00:05:55.470> you<00:05:55.979> simply<00:05:56.610> got<00:05:56.820> the<00:05:56.970> idea

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
casing so I hope you simply got the idea

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.890 
casing so I hope you simply got the idea
of<00:05:57.710> how<00:05:58.710> a<00:05:58.740> turbocharger<00:05:59.729> works<00:05:59.970> and<00:06:00.270> the
