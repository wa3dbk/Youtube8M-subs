00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.390
 hello friends you like to be again 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.940
 with all of you the figure that we are going to 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.770
 do this time is this dragon's already 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.119
 that sometimes children do not request it and 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.279
 well, this is a very 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.619
 simple and quick to make them 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.360
 said good figure well let's start 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.029
 to make our figure we will need 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.570
 four balloons one ovary inflated to one 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:31.689
 fourth one green inflated to eight fingers what 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.210
 same as this other green and red then 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.430
 will be isolated to the size that is 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.739
 in detail of the breast is being 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.500
 this is good option and as we 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.350
 to start with the yellow balloon we are going to 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.789
 make two three-finger sausages for 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.789
 form what your eyes will be 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:03.700
 we talk very well about this part and here 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.460
 let's get the surplus right now 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.370
 we cut this now with the mouthpiece of 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.970
 green balloon we're going to tie the here to 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.900
 this part 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.900
 we look good 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.750
 and we're going to make a sausage of it 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.390
 size than the yellow ones that can three 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.390
 fingers and let's go through it in the middle 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.520
 now if we hide the mouthpiece in the middle 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.659
 of the three tapes we just made 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.939
 and we cut the surplus that we just 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.240
 cut here in the yellow balloon is going 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.780
 staying like this now the next thing is let's 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.780
 to make two petals the sausage 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.690
 that we have about three 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.290
 fingers and we make another one a little bit more 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.290
 small 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.710
 on the bottom side we will have been 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.500
 well now so you do not notice in these 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.030
 holes now at the time we put 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.009
 also the flaming ones of the masters 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.980
 so that's the little head we're going to do 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.280
 two more movies we are going to do then one 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.280
 pellet 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.750
 and we are going to make pinch 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.250
 trying our eastern globe and we're going 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.400
 to do the same thing a little ball and we're going to 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.400
 do 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.750
 we spent a lot towards the bay maps 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.290
 this way we will have stayed this way 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.380
 now we are going to make our little ball 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.320
 more or less like about two fingers 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.860
 we make another little ball and we are going to make it 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.860
 pinch 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.420
 now let's do 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.720
 a sausage of about four 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.720
 fingers 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.780
 other pretty and we see again do 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.780
 other templates 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.650
 and we just talked 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.650
 d 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.510
 and we are staying in this way with 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.560
 this now we are going to make a 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:38.860
 four fingers sausage 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.860
 and we make two smaller sausages 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.849
 and good so we will have stayed 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.080
 formed part of what will be our 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:54.850
 dragon now with green balloon 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.850
 let's make ourselves petals 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.680
 whichever is about a quarter 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.680
 and remember our air 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.540
 we arrive so that our 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.540
 prophet 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.010
 and we are going to approach it perfectly for 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.010
 I do not let go 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.690
 and now let's put it right here 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.690
 where is the pinch 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.789
 and well we will have stayed like this now 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.480
 nothing more 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:19.540
 we do this 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.420
 in this part we occupy and we go to 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.780
 press so that the form of 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.780
 the lic 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.240
 so we do the same thing on the other side 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.699
 and well look like this and we are staying 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.699
 our deal now with the red balloon 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.699
 we go 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.120
 and start doubling to organize and 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.120
 we started to turn 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.990
 we give him 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.069
 we had a good time 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.420
 and cut 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:20.490
 now this part we are going to get into what 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.490
 which is here the two sticks we made 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.940
 While we cut the surplus of life 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.940
 behind 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.100
 and it just so settled 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.580
 and well look here we have already left 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:56.670
 that is our other with and nothing else there 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.140
 have to draw the eyes depending on the 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.300
 faction that you want to give the 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.000
 expression rather either happy or 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.100
 as is so angry we will give 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.630
 now then a few little eyes 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.620
 aggressive 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.620
 to this other 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:25.600
 and that's how we have this other guy 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:28.650
 of expressions of eyes I do not know which one is 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.650
 the one you like the most 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.490
 and well I hope that this simple 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.680
 figure is very practical and especially 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.240
 that many children have fun because we 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.390
 we see in the following tutorial up 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.390
 then
