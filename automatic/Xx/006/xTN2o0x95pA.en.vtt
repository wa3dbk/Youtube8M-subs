 in mexico I do not know if this thing is 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 available in more countries than 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.830
 Latin America but good as they see in 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.650
 esteem of a few days and a girl gave 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.320
 the option to pay the games in pesos 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.859
 Mexicans because at the box office and cemex and 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.370
 the symbol of money in 355 or the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.930
 shades of mordor in 439 and so you already 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.780
 They charge in pesos and well this is something 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.520
 advantageous for all for all that 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.480
 we buy and good what we have to 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.010
 do is for example let's buy 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.550
 let's buy I do not know 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.000
 this network line and good there tells us 59 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.400
 pesos 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.170
 well here is an offer for if any 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.090
 he is interested but we give him in 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.830
 add to cart 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.710
 and as you see here it tells us that it is in 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.270
 mexican pesos of this I also 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.729
 they were asking several people if 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.040
 was compatible with mac or with windows and 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.360
 Well this depends on each game but 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.130
 here for example here is the incognito 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.690
 this windows or that is compatible 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.619
 with windows but the manzanita does not appear 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:25.040
 of mac so well then it's not for 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:28.310
 good mac we give in buy for me 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.080
 and here are the payment methods 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.850
 well here is like paypal for 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.800
 predetermined since it is the most used 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.960
 that I understand good here is 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.850
 paysafecard visa mastercard american 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.400

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.680
 certified that I live in Mexico 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.990
 and well if there are any Argentinean out there 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.300
 how good I know there are several but what 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.070
 you can try to do this check that 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.050
 can already be pacified I leave it 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.850
 in the comments since there is quite 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.130
 people from Latin America that is not only 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.470
 mexico and good could take from doubts to 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.330
 others so well we give to 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.780
 who accepted the conditions 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.310
 we see that it is the price and therefore if 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.190
 they will charge us taxes for the 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.670
 change from dollars to pesos 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.430
 let's confirm authorization and good 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.470
 here from the steam navigator we 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.720
 redirect to the specify and 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.730
 well here is 59 pesos did not add 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.620
 no taxes or anything here if the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.140
 price is specific what you are going to pay 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.090
 and well we put the code if 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.020
 we need more card codes 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.020
 we prick here 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.550
 and there he will send us to the other 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.060
 page where we can put more cards 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.680
 in case on Thursday too expensive and 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.070
 Well, we have to put several cards 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.290
 200 of 500 well and well we give you 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.400
 what if in the box and we will pay 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.200
 and ready we would have the game in 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.960
 our steve account so so 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.840
 well this also has to be said with a 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.860
 little detail I tried to buy a game with 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.360
 the visa electron card of bancomer that 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.550
 is what you get with the winner card and 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.620
 it seems that it serves us this is a detail 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.019
 Well for those who have this card 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.239
 so this is useful for the moment 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:19.120
 It works with other debit cards and with 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.879
 credit cards so well then 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.110

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.000
