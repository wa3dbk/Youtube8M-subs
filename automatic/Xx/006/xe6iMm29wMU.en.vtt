 hobbit output the desolation of smog 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.160
 at the cinema the opportunity was all found 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.510
 for warner to announce the porting of the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.279
 trilogy on our game consoles a 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.289
 adaptation made of odds and ends 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.760
 ok it's easy I you rope that 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.560
 according to his first trailer would do 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.010
 strangely reference to the first two 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.390
 feature films 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.130
 watch out we are not immune 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.810
 a surprise because we see bad tt games 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.250
 go out in 2d the hobbit throats 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.809

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.190
 expected return for July of the year 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.320
 next if the few blame 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.489
 towards the productions tt games are the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.050
 same for several years it takes 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.790
 to admit that the studio is still transposing 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.260
 each universe brilliantly tastes 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.040
 marvel is the living proof of this 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.570
 more about next-gen 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.760

 of bilbon and gandalf ensures some 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.289
 variety to the adventurous should be 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.640
 conducive and cooperation 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.199
 we leave so serene about the fate 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.180
 reserved for hobbit gosiers remains to 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.370
 know precisely its content well 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 sure its release date to following hacker 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.180
 one day forever pirates ubisoft 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.949
 had clearly announced the color with 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.659
 assassin's creed iv you're going to eat some 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.430
 dlc and the first of them even 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.750
 paid the luxury of a launch trailer 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.060
 if you are one of the few to have 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.320

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.939
 that you can not see edouard anymore 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.070
 cannois in painting then this dlc 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.479
 could surely interest you in 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.030
 edouard effect leaves room for his 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.890
 second adewale who during nine missions 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.600
 estimated 3 hours of play will embark 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.259
 in a fierce fight against the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.420
 slavery 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.280
 detail that is important the dlc the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.140
 price of freedom fits fifteen years 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.579
 after the end of the main measure of 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.450
 what to satiate the fans of some 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.890
 new revelations 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.390
 available tomorrow you will be 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.340
 asked for ten euros unless you 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.110
 have opted for the season pass and in this 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.670
 case the dlc will obviously be free 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.079
 would this be the crisis in our friends 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.640
 of activity is that the players of 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.619
 I will suddenly be aware 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.420
 that call of duty is not the only fps 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.250
 to the world so if it's true that call of 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.840
 duty ghost is a good game it seems all 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.430
 likewise be at the end of your career in 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.869
 believe the first sales results 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.490
 attention because if indeed the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.380
 last code will probably not be able to 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.759
 to match his predecessors 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.810
 no less than the best-selling game in 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.969
 November in the United States 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.770
 there is a 19% drop in 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.479
 sales in comparison to black ops two 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.960
 over the same period a figure that in 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.940
 says long 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.590
 from where hollow analyst at cowen and 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.300
 company the man said the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.580
 figures are more disturbing than this to 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.709
 what the cabinet expected with 19% of 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.240
 sales down from 2012 and 36 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.430
 % less sales compared to 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.690
 modern warfare 3 release late 2011 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.280
 this news comes to drive the nail 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.020
 after our info that indicated that the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.730
 attendance of multi knew her 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.680
 also a significant decline and 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.600
 reasons for this disenchantment were multiple 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.700
 the year 2013 will have been this great return 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.020
 of gta but especially of the arrival of the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.970
 new generation of consoles 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.050

 day is asked by sablon 07 who 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.170
 said completely lost with the notion 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.650

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.080
 of the online game of downloaded games 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.269
