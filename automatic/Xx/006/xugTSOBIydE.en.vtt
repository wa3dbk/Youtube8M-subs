California<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:18.210> links<00:00:18.770> we<00:00:19.770> got<00:00:19.920> started<00:00:20.220> with

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
California the links we got started with

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
California the links we got started with
the<00:00:20.550> idea

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
the idea

Carol<00:00:22.199> one<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.470> go<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> Europe<00:00:22.949> we<00:00:23.130> knew<00:00:23.279> that

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
Carol one to go to Europe we knew that

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.920 
Carol one to go to Europe we knew that
the<00:00:23.609> load<00:00:23.760> suits<00:00:24.029> weren't<00:00:24.269> fast<00:00:24.449> enough<00:00:24.689> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
the load suits weren't fast enough to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.540 
the load suits weren't fast enough to
compete<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> Ferraris<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.189> only<00:00:26.310> had

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
compete with the Ferraris we only had

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.019 
compete with the Ferraris we only had
top<00:00:27.060> speed<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.630> roadsters<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.230> about

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
top speed with the roadsters of about

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.450 
top speed with the roadsters of about
165<00:00:30.029> miles<00:00:30.269> per<00:00:30.420> hour<00:00:30.859> so<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:31.890> explained<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
165 miles per hour so I explained to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.910 
165 miles per hour so I explained to
Carol<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.059> said<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.809> think<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.649> get<00:00:34.739> some

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
Carol I said I think we can get some

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.220 
Carol I said I think we can get some
free<00:00:35.130> horsepower<00:00:35.579> at<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.850> top<00:00:36.120> end<00:00:36.390> but<00:00:36.660> you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
free horsepower at the top end but you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.630 
free horsepower at the top end but you
may<00:00:37.380> not<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> looks<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> car

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
may not like the looks of the car

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.850 
may not like the looks of the car
because<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.180> pretty<00:00:39.420> strange<00:00:39.750> idea<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
because it's a pretty strange idea and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.650 
because it's a pretty strange idea and
he's<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.730> don't<00:00:41.910> care<00:00:42.300> if<00:00:42.420> they're<00:00:42.540> gonna

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
he's just I don't care if they're gonna

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660 
he's just I don't care if they're gonna
be<00:00:42.840> fast<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.500> said<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.800> think<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.309> will<00:00:44.460> be

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
be fast and I said I think it will be

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.600 
be fast and I said I think it will be
but<00:00:45.660> nobody's<00:00:46.410> ever<00:00:46.530> built<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.980> car<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.430> looks

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
but nobody's ever built a car that looks

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.600 
but nobody's ever built a car that looks
like<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.329> modern<00:00:49.200> age<00:00:49.350> actually<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
like this in the modern age actually the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.850 
like this in the modern age actually the
design<00:00:50.969> concept<00:00:51.809> came<00:00:52.020> from<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> Germans<00:00:52.710> own

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
design concept came from the Germans own

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.229 
design concept came from the Germans own
late<00:00:53.100> 1930s

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
late 1930s

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.500 
late 1930s
so<00:00:54.989> when<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.289> drew<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.160> up<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:56.730> showed<00:00:57.360> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
so when I drew it up and they showed it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.090 
so when I drew it up and they showed it
to<00:00:57.629> everybody<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> shop<00:00:58.379> they<00:00:58.770> all

to everybody in the shop they all
refused<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.699> work<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.180> they<00:01:00.270> thought<00:01:00.449> it

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
refused to work on if they thought it

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.439 
refused to work on if they thought it
was<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.870> ugly<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.760> actually<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.850> was<00:01:02.940> Ken<00:01:03.180> miles

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
was so ugly so actually it was Ken miles

okay<00:01:22.049> everybody's<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> work<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
Daytona on the course of it ran away

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.690 
Daytona on the course of it ran away
from<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> Ferraris<00:01:31.829> down<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.549> we

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
from the Ferraris down there so we

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.210 
from the Ferraris down there so we
actually<00:01:32.930> backed<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> power<00:01:34.290> down<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.950> we

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
actually backed the power down and we

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.280 
actually backed the power down and we
did<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:35.880> got<00:01:35.909> about<00:01:36.240> 25<00:01:36.750> percent<00:01:37.140> better

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
did that we got about 25 percent better

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.920 
did that we got about 25 percent better
fuel<00:01:37.409> efficiency<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.299> look<00:01:39.479> at<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> now

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
fuel efficiency so if you look at it now

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.359 
fuel efficiency so if you look at it now
everybody<00:01:40.650> thinks<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> pretty

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
everybody thinks it's a pretty

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.999 
everybody thinks it's a pretty
cool-looking<00:01:41.610> car<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.229> was<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> radical

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
cool-looking car but it was a radical

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.219 
cool-looking car but it was a radical
radical<00:01:44.490> change<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.270> development<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
radical change with development with the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.719 
radical change with development with the
back<00:01:46.380> end<00:01:46.619> chopped<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.610> look

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
back end chopped up but now if you look

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.210 
back end chopped up but now if you look
at<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.180> modern<00:01:48.630> automobile<00:01:49.110> course<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.860> even

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
at all modern automobile course and even

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.530 
at all modern automobile course and even
after<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:51.000> everything<00:01:51.210> looked<00:01:51.479> like

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
after this one everything looked like

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.480 
after this one everything looked like
that<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.439> was<00:01:52.619> at<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> point<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.159> Carroll

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that and this was at a point in Carroll

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.749 
that and this was at a point in Carroll

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
let me start on the idea and of course

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.080 
let me start on the idea and of course
there<00:02:26.709> was<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:26.950> much<00:02:27.069> resistance<00:02:27.459> from<00:02:27.880> this

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
there was so much resistance from this

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.940 
there was so much resistance from this
great<00:02:28.569> group<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:29.019> guys<00:02:29.170> we<00:02:29.440> had<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.739> shop

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
great group of guys we had in the shop

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.440 
great group of guys we had in the shop
who<00:02:30.190> were<00:02:30.310> probably<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.790> best<00:02:30.819> collection

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
who were probably the best collection

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.229 
who were probably the best collection
race<00:02:32.260> car<00:02:32.500> builders<00:02:32.830> from<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.130> world<00:02:33.310> that

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
race car builders from the world that

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.910 
race car builders from the world that
there<00:02:34.750> was<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.870> lot<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.170> question<00:02:35.620> whether<00:02:35.769> the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
there was a lot of question whether the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.860 
there was a lot of question whether the
car<00:02:36.190> get<00:02:36.430> built<00:02:36.670> or<00:02:36.849> not<00:02:36.910> but<00:02:37.299> since<00:02:37.540> we<00:02:37.630> didn't

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
car get built or not but since we didn't

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.410 
car get built or not but since we didn't
have<00:02:37.959> any<00:02:38.110> time<00:02:38.410> he<00:02:39.190> said<00:02:39.430> Oh<00:02:39.640> we'll<00:02:40.060> go<00:02:40.239> ahead

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
have any time he said Oh we'll go ahead

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.990 
have any time he said Oh we'll go ahead
and<00:02:40.540> get<00:02:40.959> it<00:02:41.080> done<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.560> then<00:02:41.739> it<00:02:42.580> turned<00:02:42.849> out

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
and get it done and then it turned out

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.210 
and get it done and then it turned out
that<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.299> was<00:02:43.420> fast<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.989> we<00:02:44.470> built<00:02:44.709> five<00:02:44.950> more

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
that it was fast and we built five more

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.190 
that it was fast and we built five more
so<00:02:45.940> there<00:02:46.209> were<00:02:46.269> only<00:02:46.360> six<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.900> them<00:02:47.019> built

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
so there were only six of them built

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.350 
so there were only six of them built
could<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:48.250> do<00:02:48.400> something<00:02:48.700> like<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.030> today<00:02:49.239> I

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
could you do something like this today I

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.000 
could you do something like this today I
don't<00:02:49.569> think<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.780> can<00:02:49.930> well<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.349> think<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:50.830> is

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
don't think you can well I think this is

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.589 
don't think you can well I think this is
one<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.370> problems<00:02:51.760> we<00:02:51.940> have<00:02:52.120> an<00:02:52.239> American

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
one of the problems we have an American

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.569 
one of the problems we have an American
Racing<00:02:52.989> right<00:02:53.200> now<00:02:53.380> it's<00:02:53.620> it's<00:02:53.799> way<00:02:54.220> way<00:02:54.549> over

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
Racing right now it's it's way way over

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.710 
Racing right now it's it's way way over
regulated<00:02:55.299> and<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.319> rules<00:02:56.530> are<00:02:56.769> far<00:02:57.069> far<00:02:57.489> too

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
regulated and the rules are far far too

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.720 
regulated and the rules are far far too
restrictive<00:02:58.720> like<00:02:58.900> arena<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.709> when<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.519> look

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
restrictive like arena so when you look

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.940 
restrictive like arena so when you look
at<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:00.880> car<00:03:01.120> like<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.599> DeltaWing<00:03:02.319> which<00:03:02.620> was

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
at a car like the DeltaWing which was

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.530 
at a car like the DeltaWing which was
designed<00:03:03.280> by<00:03:03.459> Ben<00:03:03.730> Bowlby<00:03:04.000> which<00:03:04.329> is<00:03:04.510> a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
designed by Ben Bowlby which is a

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.870 
designed by Ben Bowlby which is a
complete<00:03:04.959> new<00:03:05.140> sheet<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:05.440> paper<00:03:05.880> again

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
complete new sheet of paper again

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.759 
complete new sheet of paper again
there's<00:03:07.329> a<00:03:07.420> lot<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.720> resistance<00:03:08.049> in<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.560> car

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
there's a lot of resistance in the car

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.000 
there's a lot of resistance in the car
but<00:03:09.609> it's<00:03:09.819> an<00:03:10.000> idea<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.930> people<00:03:10.959> are<00:03:11.590> now

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
but it's an idea that people are now

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.490 
but it's an idea that people are now
beginning<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.459> accept<00:03:12.940> but<00:03:13.930> when<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.290> come

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
beginning to accept but when you come

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.190 
beginning to accept but when you come
with<00:03:14.709> something<00:03:15.069> radical<00:03:15.579> its<00:03:16.420> ridiculed<00:03:16.989> at

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
with something radical its ridiculed at

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.220 
with something radical its ridiculed at
first<00:03:17.470> then<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.130> will<00:03:19.030> see<00:03:19.359> firstly<00:03:19.720> opposed

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
first then it will see firstly opposed

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.650 
first then it will see firstly opposed
and<00:03:20.590> then<00:03:21.220> finally<00:03:21.609> it<00:03:21.700> becomes<00:03:21.940> self<00:03:22.269> evident

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
and then finally it becomes self evident

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.410 
and then finally it becomes self evident
that<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.049> car<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.470> very<00:03:24.010> successful<00:03:24.609> and<00:03:25.209> it

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
that the car is very successful and it

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.050 
that the car is very successful and it
goes<00:03:25.600> ahead<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.590> it's<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.859> it's<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.609> wonderful

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
goes ahead so it's a it's a wonderful

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.370 
goes ahead so it's a it's a wonderful
thing<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.389> goes<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:28.720> it's<00:03:28.900> not<00:03:29.019> just<00:03:29.260> an

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
thing that goes on it's not just an

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.890 
thing that goes on it's not just an
automobile<00:03:29.859> design<00:03:30.220> this<00:03:30.760> architecture<00:03:31.630> its
