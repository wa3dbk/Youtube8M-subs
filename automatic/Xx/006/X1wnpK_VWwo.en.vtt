the floor and we're just going to play
you<00:01:15.009> a<00:01:15.220> prototype<00:01:15.819> which<00:01:15.970> we<00:01:16.090> can't<00:01:16.270> actually

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
you a prototype which we can't actually

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.370 
you a prototype which we can't actually
film<00:01:16.840> so<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:18.700> just<00:01:18.850> low<00:01:19.000> in<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.149> camera<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.479> bit

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.389 

this<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.649> something<00:01:23.979> we're<00:01:24.100> not<00:01:24.130> allowed<00:01:24.369> to

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
this is something we're not allowed to

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.880 
this is something we're not allowed to
film<00:01:24.610> because<00:01:24.880> it's<00:01:25.030> not<00:01:25.300> actually<00:01:26.049> close<00:01:26.860> to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
film because it's not actually close to

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.919 
film because it's not actually close to
finish<00:01:27.310> but<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.360> should<00:01:28.539> be<00:01:28.630> able<00:01:28.690> to<00:01:28.840> hear

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929
