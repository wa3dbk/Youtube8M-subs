 hello lucky lion and good as 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.059
 promised is debt we are here in the 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:11.450
 review of what is 0.8 zero point 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.820
 alpha the to say version 4 where it 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.990
 suppose that they corrected several books and 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.210
 they will ask good but which ones 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.099
 they corrected something so I'm not very 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.689
 sure because in the google + group 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.179
 has not been updated yet they have not put 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.439
 which is what they fixed and is a bit 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.750
 strange because good the truth I do not 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.210
 I have the micro minecraft bought 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.790

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.489
 you're a pirate or something like that not so much 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.020
 that but that right now I do not have 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.270

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.460
 versions that have been pulling out so 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.890
 Greetings if you are seeing this and 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.850

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.420
 the new textures review for 0.8 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.119
 point 0 as you can see there are already the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.520
 other blocks and everything and as I say in 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.220
 If I do not know what changed from this 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.790
 new version of good aja the new 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.340
 Version of the 0 point version of 8.0 is 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.140
 I do not know how to say it and it's good to review 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.860
 quickly look there is the block of 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.560
 coal that looks pretty good 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.440
 and good if you do not know say yes 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.470
 what changed and really good to me 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.920
 version 3 I tell myself pretty well do not 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.410
 I went with so many books only for one 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.380
 moment it came out like a direct lightning 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.750
 from the sun towards me it did not look like a 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.790
 blue line or it did not go up weird but in 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.140
 yes that was the only bus I got 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.970
 find and good for example right now 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.880
 we have everything to the fullest 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.640
 ok there we have everything good - this 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.560
 obviously but everything is at its maximum and 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.330
 it runs quite well actually me 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.420
 I love it I like it very much even at 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.360
 be recording and did not notice any kind of 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.790
 look at them here is what the grass is 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.680
 high on creative and when all that ok 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.780
 little battery does not matter 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.300
 we continue and good also something that 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.030
 I had seen in version 2 it seemed to me 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.310
 that the face of the cow is a bit 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.410
 strange but good right now it's all 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.790
 normal and something that is very funny what 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.860
 Well, I like it a lot, it's that 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.830
 we can make animals follow us 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.110
 and also raise them and beat vito 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.570
 piglets piglets come see come and 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.630
 remove the duck hit the duck for you 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.090
 let go to see do not hit the 102 the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.040
 102 106 restless 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.730
 and really, it's pretty 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.230
 great this new version not what not 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.489
 understand is how I owe you to give 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.489
 eat so that they will breed have already seen as 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.860
 helen to see you I also give you is not 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.680
 that must be another great one to see we are going 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.940
 to invoke another big big I said 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.819
 I create a big one because they are all 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.220
 little ones because ay ay ay ay boy already 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.269
 came out to see you have this heart 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.540
 I also want you to have your 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.160
 little hearts do not let them mate or if 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.560
 a piglet came out I think 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.799
 but they are very good they are very handsome 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.930
 all the little pigs and well even the 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.250
 Pig textures looks better even 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.780
 you can see your nose 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.760
 I remember that in wild 2 it seems to me and 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.800
 3 write I did review the 3 because 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.350
 they wonder good I think that I still do not know 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.930
 I saw his nose in 3D or it's like with 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.910
 highlighted by saying it and explodes and does not 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.709
 look pretty cool and calm 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.620
 quiet 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.720
 and I do not know in truth that I already 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.640
 moment this version did not I have not 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.120
 found no bus so far 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.700
 he was not played very little and do not know if 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.990
 I really have somewhere there but until 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.060
 the moment I tell you that everything goes quite 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:09.340
 well only that case for example by 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:14.350
 a moment if you can if you can see 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:17.169
 the sheep is as if it will be combined with what 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.970
 what is the vallita but good those are 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.370
 minor things that being arranged 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.470
 easily do not miss the fence 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.320
 back back 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.750
 and nothing if I tell you 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.900
 supposedly I was going to tell you the bucs 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.240
 that were corrected but as yet not 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.979
 it does not come out what are the ones that 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.980
 They corrected in this new version 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.440
 I can not comment I know 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.210
 and for example here we have also what 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.910
 What are they 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.550
 the new foods the carrot potato and 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.889
 the radishes or beets is what they want 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.870
 call I know them by radishes but 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.180
 Well I hope you liked it and if 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.020
 want to download this version go through 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.669
 the droid channel and after that happen 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.370
 to your taringa post because thanks to 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.080
 this is that I have this version and nothing in 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.770
 yes I hope you liked it and good 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.860
 obviously I do not know if everyone works 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.800
 this version or enter if the 0.8 point 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.870
 zero would be girls thing about what 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.310
 yourselves check them because if not 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.220
 it works well then it's not something 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.110
 none of us is depending 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.729
 also the device that you have as 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.620
 for example, because my tablet works 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.840
 all perfect maximum distance and others 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.150
 even recording and I like that 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.280
 too much but I do not assure you that 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.290
 all work for you though those of moya 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.210
 is what they are trying to do that 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.100
 work on one device at least 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.139
 mid-range that works well 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.730
 minecraft is why that also 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.250
 take a long time to get the new 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.070
 updates and nothing now yes I 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.710
 dismissal because he did not stop talking here 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.870
 you can even see the shadows I do not know 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.460
 if it looks pretty good everything is 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.770
 really liking this version compared 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.720
 with pc the way it has gone 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.419
 updating as we go forward 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.280
 pretty good at minecraft and the dream 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.500
 that some day we can have logos is my 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.990
 bigger dream and nothing I think that already 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.610
 talk too much so I already say goodbye and 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.860
 I hope you liked it is because 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.870
 example this one 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.120
 this map to do the review of the 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.280
 textures that may arise for 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.050
 0.8 zero point I hope that out there 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.389
 some mapmakers are already 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.039

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.050
 textures are working the new 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:27.000
 textures and nothing I hope you have 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.379
