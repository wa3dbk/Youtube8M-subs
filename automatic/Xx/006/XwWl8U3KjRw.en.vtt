this car step one for this vehicle is

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.040 
this car step one for this vehicle is
that<00:00:39.910> we<00:00:40.030> need<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.210> disassemble<00:00:40.629> the<00:00:40.960> whole

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
that we need to disassemble the whole

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.180 
that we need to disassemble the whole
vehicle<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:42.010> get<00:00:42.160> it<00:00:42.250> prepped<00:00:42.489> for<00:00:42.579> paint

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.830 

before<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.520> paint<00:00:48.760> goes<00:00:49.000> onto<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.360> vehicle

before the paint goes onto the vehicle

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.440 
before the paint goes onto the vehicle
the<00:00:50.410> painter<00:00:50.739> has<00:00:50.950> to<00:00:51.130> mix<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.670> formula<00:00:52.239> of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
the painter has to mix the formula of

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.430 
the painter has to mix the formula of
the<00:00:52.810> proper<00:00:53.170> color<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.870> we<00:00:56.050> want<00:00:56.200> to<00:00:56.290> make<00:00:56.410> sure

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
the proper color so we want to make sure

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.040 
the proper color so we want to make sure
the<00:00:57.010> design<00:00:57.190> keeps<00:00:57.700> true<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.300> keep<00:00:58.930> the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
whipple supercharger this is what goes

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.050 
whipple supercharger this is what goes
on<00:01:09.260> it<00:01:09.380> comes<00:01:09.590> with<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.770> new<00:01:09.920> manifold<00:01:10.490> it's<00:01:10.910> got

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
on it comes with a new manifold it's got

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.700 
on it comes with a new manifold it's got
an<00:01:11.150> intercooler<00:01:11.660> in<00:01:11.930> here<00:01:12.020> that<00:01:12.140> cools<00:01:12.410> the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
an intercooler in here that cools the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.920 
an intercooler in here that cools the
air<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.610> way<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:13.940> supercharger<00:01:14.540> works<00:01:14.750> by

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
air the way the supercharger works by

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.270 
air the way the supercharger works by
spinning<00:01:15.290> around<00:01:15.500> here<00:01:15.680> like<00:01:15.830> this<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.130> show

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
spinning around here like this and show

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.160 
spinning around here like this and show
you<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.850> put<00:01:17.000> a<00:01:17.030> belt<00:01:17.330> on<00:01:17.510> this<00:01:17.750> thing<00:01:18.020> and

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
you you put a belt on this thing and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.930 
you you put a belt on this thing and
this<00:01:18.470> spins<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.100> when<00:01:19.190> it<00:01:19.280> spins<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:19.790> watch

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
this spins and when it spins you watch

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.070 
this spins and when it spins you watch
this<00:01:20.090> piece<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.390> tape<00:01:20.510> here<00:01:20.690> this<00:01:20.870> is<00:01:20.990> the

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
this piece of tape here this is the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.020 
this piece of tape here this is the
intake<00:01:21.290> where<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.800> air<00:01:21.950> comes<00:01:22.220> in<00:01:22.460> see<00:01:22.940> I'm

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
intake where the air comes in see I'm

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.609 
intake where the air comes in see I'm
spinning<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.510> and<00:01:23.690> it's<00:01:23.810> sucking<00:01:24.080> in<00:01:24.320> if<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:24.500> go

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
spinning it and it's sucking in if I go

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:25.750 
spinning it and it's sucking in if I go
the<00:01:24.740> other<00:01:24.770> way<00:01:24.860> it<00:01:24.979> pushes<00:01:25.250> out<00:01:25.369> while<00:01:25.580> this

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
the other way it pushes out while this

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.480 
the other way it pushes out while this
is<00:01:26.270> spinning<00:01:26.720> this<00:01:26.840> thing<00:01:27.050> so<00:01:27.350> fast<00:01:27.650> it's<00:01:28.369> like

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
is spinning this thing so fast it's like

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.480 
is spinning this thing so fast it's like
a<00:01:28.610> huge<00:01:29.150> huge<00:01:29.780> vacuum<00:01:30.320> which<00:01:30.410> is<00:01:30.470> forcing<00:01:31.220> air

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
a huge huge vacuum which is forcing air

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.030 
a huge huge vacuum which is forcing air
through<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.510> motor<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:33.200> we<00:01:33.619> forced<00:01:33.920> here

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
through the motor and we forced here

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.530 
through the motor and we forced here
through<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.310> motor<00:01:34.490> it's<00:01:34.729> called<00:01:34.970> boost<00:01:35.300> and

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
through the motor it's called boost and

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.520 
through the motor it's called boost and
it<00:01:35.600> promotes<00:01:35.840> boost<00:01:36.170> which<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.500> course

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
it promotes boost which of course

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.889 
it promotes boost which of course
horsepower<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.430> more<00:01:37.700> air<00:01:38.149> through<00:01:38.210> a<00:01:38.660> motor

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
horsepower the more air through a motor

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.020 
horsepower the more air through a motor
the<00:01:39.350> more<00:01:39.530> fuel<00:01:39.800> you<00:01:39.830> can<00:01:40.160> add<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.880> more

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
the more fuel you can add the more

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.700 
the more fuel you can add the more
horsepower<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:41.660> can<00:01:41.780> do<00:01:41.869> this<00:01:42.050> baby<00:01:42.470> right

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
horsepower you can do this baby right

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.920 
horsepower you can do this baby right
here<00:01:42.770> will<00:01:43.100> add<00:01:43.190> about<00:01:43.369> 150<00:01:44.210> more<00:01:44.360> horsepower

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
here will add about 150 more horsepower

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.219
