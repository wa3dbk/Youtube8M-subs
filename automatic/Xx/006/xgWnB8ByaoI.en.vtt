00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.170
 or they identify with the issue of not 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.000
 They reach them good money and not 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.680
 he does not know how to manage them well 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.020
 Well, can you ask any questions here? 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.660
 our coaches who accompany us here 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.189
 in the cabin in human reengineering 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.350
 and good we are left with the slope of 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.689
 where do we start or is it the 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.070
 money every fortnight or give us the money 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.500
 our our partner 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.079
 once you have our hands on 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.570
 there that how to start managing it 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.520
 well there are two two factors that you have to 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.530
 take here into account the first factor is 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.140
 so that you can be 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.910
 You must intelligently know how 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.860
 spend wisely you have to have 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.780
 tools for this and at the same time 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.809
 you also have to be the person 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.460
 correct because you may not be the person 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.260
 correct and it's as if you were 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.239
 configuration to manage money or 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.739
 wealth as if it were a glass that 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.570
 you are filling with water and if it is a 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.340
 little glass, it does not matter how much 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.590
 more abundance will come is going to 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.180
 overflow and you're not going to keep anything like that 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.430
 that what we're going to do here is 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:19.159
 give you tools of no matter your 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:23.600
 income as being dispensing is like this 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.789
 the tools yes good the first 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.409
 part is important to understand that we have 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.420
 basic needs those you have to 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.520
 have the covers because obviously 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.469
 it is what you have to 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.409
 always be on the lookout but once 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.750
 what you do is that good part 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.640
 also the other part that you have left 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.530
 equal those two parties not the other party 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.929
 what you have left is important to divide it into 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.329
 something very important that is the question 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.000
 of learning you have to know your 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.159
 skills for you to start as a 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.530
 undertake that part because many times 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.170
 especially the housewives stop 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.719
 a lot because suddenly they wait for 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.060
 help their husbands the fact of 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.640
 have more income but you do not need 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.349
 leaving your house is just knowing 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.810
 your skills so that you start 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.819
 exploit them and that through that you 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.650
 you are making an investment you have to 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.930
 make an investment to the best you like 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.730
 I do not know how to cut hair invests in 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.640
 learn to cut the hair so that you 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.760
 you can from your house and have that income 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.239
 not to start having the fact of 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.349
 offer that service 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:32.180
 remunerating also let's say trying 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.909
 in the money that we receive for 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.230
 the work we do because we are at 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.590
 pending home and gives us our 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.450
 couple said you good to separate for 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.889
 the things I imagine necessary and what 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.530
 basic but how to start 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:51.859
 distribute it and how suddenly do not leave us 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.520
 carry on the craving for promotions 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.950
 for the 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.920
 what he offers us every time he touches us 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.900
 at the door as first of all that 's 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.880
 an excellent question right because 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.010
 because we are talking about spending 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.720
 smartly your money you have to 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.850
 also have a structure to be able 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.040
 spend your money wisely 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.810
 then one of the false beliefs that 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.620
 we see from the false beliefs that we have 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.240
 observed is that people are very 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.310
 polarized to say ok I'm right now 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.320
 at an age where I must produce 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.480
 so I have to generate assets and 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.610
 then I 'm going to work or 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.370
 there are other people who say nothing look 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.530
 God provides here I'll take it and not 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.770
 matter I do not do any assets and everything 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.100
 this and apart they are working or going to 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.720
 day as it says terminal to 15 when finished 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.400
 sometimes up to 5 pesos because it's going to 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.250
 arrive the fortnight of today and 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.680
 they say good the free one if the important thing is 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.830
 foresee that you do not spend more than you 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.570
 you are receiving because that is the first 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.670
 trick then you have to have as very 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.220
 present and well then also the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.260
 will to know what it is that what 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.330
 you have to prioritize what it is 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.610
 important and what really is urgent 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.040
 your life has to be a balance your life 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.990
 it is a balance if you are in your life and 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.120
 you're nothing more in a question where 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.710
 you do not have an intelligence where not 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.020
 you have some characteristics or a 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.000
 configuration to enjoy your life 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.830
 fully then you will fall into 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.930
 situations where you will not be 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.150
 losing health by wanting 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.760
 accumulate wealth or vice versa will be 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.470
 completely at the other end but 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.510
 how would it be that you can really 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.880
 balance this that you just like that 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.190
 you can be generating income and 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.600
 generating assets so that you achieve what 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.480
 we call ourselves financial freedom 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.450
 and this I define as the one you have 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.060
 enough monthly income to 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.340
 that you live without working these as 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.920
 would be if you get to achieve this because 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.660
 would you be the owner of your time then what 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.420
 What are you looking for is a balance so that for a 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.730
 aside, you have the discipline to be 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.980
 making a saving for what assets 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.270
 achieve your financial freedom but for 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.610
 another side also that you can go to 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.150
 buy those bags those shoes that 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.170
 car that screen in which 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.510
 unfortunately people do not do 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.110
 are wanting to make purchases from 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.910
 impulses 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.890
 that will make them feel very 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.250
 valuable but that are probably 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.290
 pawning its financial capital to 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.660
 look good with someone but in the end 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.610
 of the day its same programming in 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.980
 to money and wealth the 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.810
 leads to not enjoying this or it's going to be 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.090
 something ephemeral is going to be something that is going to 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.790
 last very little and the next one came out 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.230
 season bag then it's already 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.510
 until you're not going to want to leave because it 's 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.780
 old but what would it be like to come out with a 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.060
 bag does not matter if it cost you 150 pesos or 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.230
 150 thousand pesos or even I well I 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.880
 I'm on my back because I know there are bags 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.680
 but it is valid or it will not be translated there 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.780
 I'm going to give up all that and I'm going to 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.250
 come back very spiritual and then already that 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.080
 it does not matter you do not have to look for a 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.220
 balance in their lives then when you 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.710
 you have the correct configuration 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.610
 then you will have an enjoyment and a 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.610
 correct balance
