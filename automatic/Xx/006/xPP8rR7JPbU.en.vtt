00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
this is the big hole we know not for the

00:05:20.860 --> 00:06:12.840 
this is the big hole we know not for the
front<00:05:21.130> cross<00:05:21.430> brace

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:55.360 

using<00:06:13.850> the<00:06:53.020> top<00:06:54.020> raise<00:06:54.290> which<00:06:54.530> also<00:06:54.710> forms<00:06:55.100> a

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
using the top raise which also forms a

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.030 
using the top raise which also forms a
handle<00:06:56.110> okay<00:06:57.110> and<00:06:57.350> then<00:06:57.470> we'll<00:06:57.590> go<00:06:57.710> and<00:06:57.770> grab<00:06:58.010> a

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 
handle okay and then we'll go and grab a

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.160 
handle okay and then we'll go and grab a
heart<00:06:58.370> top<00:06:58.670> and<00:06:58.910> show<00:06:59.540> you<00:06:59.600> the<00:06:59.780> trolley<00:07:00.050> in

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.170 
heart top and show you the trolley in

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.470 
heart top and show you the trolley in
operation<00:07:00.680> so<00:07:01.220> the<00:07:01.340> trolley<00:07:01.640> comes<00:07:02.000> already

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:02.480 
operation so the trolley comes already

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.530 
operation so the trolley comes already
with<00:07:02.840> this<00:07:02.990> pre<00:07:03.260> avoids<00:07:03.620> adding<00:07:04.520> here<00:07:04.820> to<00:07:05.330> stop

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 
with this pre avoids adding here to stop

you strapped in the paperwork on your

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:12.630 
you strapped in the paperwork on your
laptop<00:07:07.460> that's<00:07:08.450> it<00:07:08.630> about<00:07:08.750> five<00:07:09.140> minutes

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:12.640 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.730 

perceptron<00:07:13.640> a<00:07:13.970> sample<00:07:14.470> so<00:07:15.470> we've<00:07:15.590> got

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
perceptron a sample so we've got

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.070 
perceptron a sample so we've got
Freelander<00:07:16.400> hard<00:07:16.640> top<00:07:16.880> but<00:07:17.780> obviously

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
Freelander hard top but obviously

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.300 
Freelander hard top but obviously
different<00:07:18.680> this<00:07:18.830> will<00:07:19.010> fit<00:07:19.250> the<00:07:19.400> mx-5

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
different this will fit the mx-5

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.990 
different this will fit the mx-5
basically<00:07:22.310> make<00:07:22.520> sure

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 
basically make sure

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.910 
basically make sure
you<00:07:24.300> have<00:07:24.600> taught<00:07:24.840> much<00:07:25.080> more<00:07:25.320> manoeuvrable

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:25.920 
you have taught much more manoeuvrable

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.590 
you have taught much more manoeuvrable
and<00:07:26.190> then<00:07:26.850> obviously<00:07:27.000> when<00:07:27.240> you've<00:07:27.360> got<00:07:27.480> it

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:27.600 
and then obviously when you've got it

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.540 
and then obviously when you've got it
into<00:07:27.750> position<00:07:30.050> wheels<00:07:31.050> at<00:07:31.200> the<00:07:31.230> bottom<00:07:31.710> okay

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:32.550 
into position wheels at the bottom okay

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.730 
into position wheels at the bottom okay
to<00:07:32.820> lock<00:07:33.150> the<00:07:33.270> wheels<00:07:33.320> and<00:07:34.320> that<00:07:34.470> will<00:07:34.590> lock

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
to lock the wheels and that will lock

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.750 
to lock the wheels and that will lock
into<00:07:35.040> position

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:35.760 
into position

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.210 
into position
and<00:07:36.240> then<00:07:36.420> simply<00:07:36.870> just<00:07:37.050> click<00:07:37.230> that<00:07:37.500> little
