00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:18.990

 show here my setup kings is to start 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:27.480
 showing me a slap in my cockpit 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:31.859
 copied the homemade cope so did it 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.280
 all in metal has this long line that 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.940
 Here I made this mine that I can 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.629
 good the tv here behind to play the games 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.989
 playstation 3 has put the tv here on 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:51.149
 hospital keyboard and e is easier to 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:56.149
 the cockpit to 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:01.109
 the room that is one you can see today 27 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.690
 The bank that I put a mountain gave 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.970
 a lot of work to find what creates a 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.320
 bank in this particular bank so a 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.530
 because it's a two door car and 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.119
 you get here it's down to demote 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.860
 stage 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.710
 Only I bought in scrap is 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:26.850
 missing apache from the bottom right here 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.430
 which is the exchange of the day 27 also the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:36.060
 speakers to a tech shop 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:40.549
 also 5.1 my computer while I 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:44.630
 I'll show you here, I'll put the opening 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.630
 from cas project 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.520
 my computer that the office as 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:02.440
 you can see the first cosmos 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:06.830
 generation is 17 generation third 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:13.340
 3770 beauty 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:18.860
 the plate is a 670's and vg if not me 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.320
 mistake that tea enthusiast of the 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:27.260
 three surround- connected monitors and 23 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:30.739
 inches of lg beauty to rain more 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:36.770
 it's so damn themis the keyboard is 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:41.500
 new is clear without the basics even from here it is 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.500
 one of the cetaceans is and 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:52.100
 the opening of the project is very cool I 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.360
 I have another computer that I put in the 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.010
 finally nike 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:04.370
 he is 1 and 7 and second generation and one 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:07.850
 plate 68 50 I am not mistaken is a plate 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.300
 reasonable to play racing games but 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.180
 project the newest municipality and I 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.400
 I believe it's designed for nvidia it 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.470
 right mode not on the other computer 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.560
 due to the processor video card and 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:32.170
 the rest he would walk away from ram 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.170
 he is 16 and he has a ssd of 120 days 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:49.940
 the k project here in that part of the cockpit 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:54.650
 I did it to get the kopittke. 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:58.489
 if you put the exchange here as if it were 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.739
 of a car very close to the bank 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.459
 in one of the things that I liked about this 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.120
 Bank 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:10.720
 besides it looks quite right 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:15.680
 here is no pattern across 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:21.560
 There is no picture that is more 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:24.700
 Nice does a solo cockpit project 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.280
 he somehow became cool 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.720
 brings no great difficulty not 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.720
 in relation to the tops 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.850
 I really liked yes in relation to 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.220
 stocks I've seen that worked 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.220
 a company and any computer 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.949
 he also the bank as a bank of 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:59.590
 car but he has regulation is what 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:03.740
 matters here forward behind the 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:07.160
 recline it and here you put it to 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.009
 back and forth I do not have and I think 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.560
 he goes forward behind 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.860
 this part of the pedal here too 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.310
 if I want I'll get up she's adjustable 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.310
 also 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.669
 became so to speak is within 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:31.860
 conditions imposed in our country so 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.860
 to not be so cool 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.660
 AndrÃ© said that next year I go 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.610
 set up another machine with the most 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.770
 top 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.510
 For the time being you 're giving everything 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.390
 right 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.370
 Thanks guys, anything like this is 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.430
 you are interested in putting some 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:56.030
 racing game there can be new old 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:59.320
