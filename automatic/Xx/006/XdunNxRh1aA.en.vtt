00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.429
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.260
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.240
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.309
 they are also more and more in the car 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.049
 I need more and more power outlets 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.039
 I was not only at home in the car 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.260
 uncountable anyway, but that's it 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.100
 navigation system that wants to 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.990
 socket 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.970
 there's my plan comes that we also 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.920
 the outlet is my camera there 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.540
 also wants to plug in there is mine 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.940
 rear camera which also wants to the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.500
 outlet it is even more mine 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.110
 charger for example for the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.879
 mobile phone etc 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.800
 but so many outlets Armenia car me 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.379
 do not have a car is almost like that 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.860
 I bring many sockets with me 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.690
 at least that's what revolt found 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.430
 perfect for the little ones 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.579
 is sufficient and that is one 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.160
 sockets multiplier there is that 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.010
 Tal on the table and now we turn 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.270
 Let's see it goes back there 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.570
 put it in the car socket and have 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.310
 her really massive error contacts and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.090
 drive here I found so great have 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 I never saw it 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.170
 the things are coming to the plug 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.420
 but that's not it 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.130
 child insurance but may altfeld im 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.020
 car then no money or piece 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 anything else to the short-circuit inside the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.700
 evil and so uses today or that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.070
 So we have already done so 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.390
 thinks well and the cnnic joint 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.759
 when I'm back here 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.740
 I can now bend when I 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.840
 So my outlet is down there somewhere 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.060
 I can do it from the top or 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.170
 from the side or whatever that 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.649
 I can do almost anything 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.040
 3500 milliamps so three and a half amps 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.899
 I can pull out of the socket and 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.250
 Then I looked at hand press 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.200
 all because I was actually also 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.509
 exaggerated for something like a manual too 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.460
 But if that's not part of it 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.130
 works because it overloads it 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.640
 or anything else if you are here 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.640
 front 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.590
 because that you can unscrew that at 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.619
 most of these things like that 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.590
 if they watch that unscrewing 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.349
 once here is these plastics then 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.989
 a pinnacle and there comes a fine 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.000
 fuse out like you 're in just radio 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.760
 loading or accessories or tinkering job 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.349
 and see if the first 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.379
 maybe blown out is replacing 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.959
 by not equal no stronger 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.790
 take a screwdriver again 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.610
 digital how it works else goes 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.470
 not because broken so handy for 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.580
 the ever-increasing devices in 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.580
 our car for us
