00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
more here batter looks smooth now we're

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.910 
more here batter looks smooth now we're
going<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.410> pour<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.770> into<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:39.350> baking<00:02:40.350> pan<00:02:40.530> it

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
can be any shape you wanted but this is

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.730 
can be any shape you wanted but this is
a<00:02:44.220> recipe<00:02:44.730> for<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.090> smaller<00:02:45.570> slice<00:02:45.870> cake<00:02:46.350> it's<00:02:46.650> a

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
a recipe for a smaller slice cake it's a

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.290 
a recipe for a smaller slice cake it's a
little<00:02:47.040> smaller<00:02:47.310> than<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.790> one<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.150> get

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
little smaller than the one that you get

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.950 
little smaller than the one that you get
in<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.570> box

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
in the box

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.620 
in the box
so<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.380> small<00:02:49.740> pan<00:02:50.010> works<00:02:50.250> really<00:02:50.760> well<00:02:51.060> maybe

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
so a small pan works really well maybe

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.870 
so a small pan works really well maybe
in<00:02:51.810> mind<00:02:51.990> by<00:02:52.170> mine<00:02:52.410> I'm<00:02:53.400> gonna<00:02:53.520> go<00:02:53.700> ahead<00:02:53.790> and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
in mind by mine I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.350 
in mind by mine I'm gonna go ahead and
or<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.500> spray<00:02:55.500> some<00:02:55.740> oil<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
or just spray some oil in it so that it

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:05.450 
or just spray some oil in it so that it
doesn't<00:02:58.250> take<00:02:59.250> these<00:03:01.820> decoders<00:03:04.190> okay

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
doesn't take these decoders okay

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.570 
doesn't take these decoders okay
pan<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.270> ready<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.770> oven<00:03:08.070> has<00:03:08.190> actually
