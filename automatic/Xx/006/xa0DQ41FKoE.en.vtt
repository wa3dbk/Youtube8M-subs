here<00:00:11.309> which<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.969> five<00:00:12.300> by<00:00:12.509> five<00:00:12.540> by<00:00:12.960> five

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
here which is a five by five by five

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.499 
here which is a five by five by five
cuboid<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.400> changes<00:00:14.759> shape<00:00:14.820> we'll<00:00:15.269> get<00:00:15.389> to

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
cuboid and it changes shape we'll get to

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.880 
cuboid and it changes shape we'll get to
that<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.960> minute

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
that in a minute

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.620 
that in a minute
it's<00:00:17.250> really<00:00:17.550> really<00:00:17.760> weird<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.359> know<00:00:18.390> ever

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
it's really really weird you know ever

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.450 
it's really really weird you know ever
since<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.990> saw<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.410> puzzle<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.830> wanted<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.279> for

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
since I saw this puzzle I wanted it for

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.120 
since I saw this puzzle I wanted it for
the<00:00:20.520> fact<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.910> it's<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.960> cuboid<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:22.890> it

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the fact that it's a cuboid but it

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.009 
the fact that it's a cuboid but it
doesn't<00:00:23.460> have<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> same<00:00:23.939> kind<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.359> numeric

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
doesn't have the same kind of numeric

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.620 
doesn't have the same kind of numeric
laws<00:00:25.350> as<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> cuboid<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.340> by<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.330> what<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.539> mean

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
laws as a cuboid and by that what I mean

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.200 
laws as a cuboid and by that what I mean
as<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> cuboid<00:00:28.349> usually<00:00:28.949> has<00:00:29.160> two<00:00:29.849> different

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
as a cuboid usually has two different

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.269 
as a cuboid usually has two different
numbers<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.199> here<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.590> three<00:00:31.859> by<00:00:32.009> three

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
numbers so here we have three by three

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.350 
numbers so here we have three by three
by<00:00:32.309> two<00:00:32.780> okay<00:00:33.809> over<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.370> two<00:00:35.850> by

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
by two okay over here we have a two by

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.380 
by two okay over here we have a two by
two<00:00:36.390> by<00:00:37.050> four<00:00:37.559> okay<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.730> when<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
two by four okay and when you have the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.229 
two by four okay and when you have the
same<00:00:39.660> numbers<00:00:40.110> as<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.070> four<00:00:41.460> by<00:00:41.670> four<00:00:41.700> one

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
same numbers as in a four by four one

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.330 
same numbers as in a four by four one
two<00:00:42.390> three<00:00:42.420> four<00:00:42.660> by<00:00:43.140> four<00:00:43.440> by<00:00:43.469> four<00:00:44.070> it's

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
two three four by four by four it's

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.610 
two three four by four by four it's
always<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> square<00:00:45.239> puzzle<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.260> here<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.590> can

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
always a square puzzle but here we can

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.520 
always a square puzzle but here we can
see<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.430> five<00:00:47.730> by<00:00:48.090> five<00:00:48.450> by<00:00:49.140> five

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
see that there are five by five by five

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.799 
see that there are five by five by five
and<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> two<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> four<00:00:50.879> layers<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.719> been

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and the two in the four layers have been

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.350 
and the two in the four layers have been
squished<00:00:52.289> down<00:00:52.559> by<00:00:52.829> half<00:00:53.190> which<00:00:53.489> makes<00:00:54.180> it

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
squished down by half which makes it

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.000 
squished down by half which makes it
actually<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.750> cuboid<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.440> as<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.860> see

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
actually a cuboid because as you can see

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.279 
actually a cuboid because as you can see
if<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.219> turn<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> square

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
if I turn it like this it's not a square

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.709 
if I turn it like this it's not a square
puzzle<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.070> ever<00:00:59.670> since<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.120> saw<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.539> I

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
price and I'm not sure about that price

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.170 
price and I'm not sure about that price
if<00:01:29.040> that's<00:01:29.340> still<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.030> I'm<00:01:30.119> not

you<00:01:31.979> know<00:01:32.070> you've<00:01:32.250> been<00:01:32.340> modding<00:01:33.150> puzzles<00:01:33.570> for

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
you know you've been modding puzzles for

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.390 
you know you've been modding puzzles for
a<00:01:33.840> while<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.079> think<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.100> could<00:01:35.280> probably

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
a while I think that you could probably

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.490 
a while I think that you could probably
make<00:01:35.880> your<00:01:36.090> own<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.990> actually<00:01:37.350> wasn't

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
make your own so this actually wasn't

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.920 
make your own so this actually wasn't
made<00:01:37.740> by<00:01:37.890> him<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.220> was<00:01:38.400> made<00:01:38.640> by<00:01:38.850> me<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.390> he

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
made by him this was made by me and he

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.630 
made by him this was made by me and he
did<00:01:40.140> help<00:01:40.380> me<00:01:40.530> out<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> process<00:01:41.280> he<00:01:41.430> kind

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
did help me out with the process he kind

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.249 
did help me out with the process he kind
of<00:01:41.729> explained<00:01:42.119> how<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
of explained how to do it it was a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.350 
of explained how to do it it was a
little<00:01:43.710> bit<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.009> lengthy<00:01:44.460> process<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:45.240> me

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
little bit of a lengthy process for me

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.929 
little bit of a lengthy process for me
because<00:01:45.689> usually<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.700> you

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
because usually all I do is I just you

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.999 
because usually all I do is I just you
know<00:01:48.000> cut<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.509> cube<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:48.990> fill<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.770> was

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
know cut a cube and fill it and this was

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.190 
know cut a cube and fill it and this was
a<00:01:50.189> lot<00:01:50.490> more<00:01:50.520> complex<00:01:51.060> than<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.750> had<00:01:52.020> never

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
a lot more complex than that I had never

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.170 
a lot more complex than that I had never
actually<00:01:52.320> done<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.890> before<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.430> some<00:01:54.090> of

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
actually done this before like some of

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.560 
actually done this before like some of
these<00:01:54.270> pieces<00:01:54.540> are<00:01:54.899> completely<00:01:55.530> rebuilt<00:01:56.250> I've

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
these pieces are completely rebuilt I've

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.819 
these pieces are completely rebuilt I've
completely<00:01:57.570> rebuilt<00:01:58.110> some<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.469> these<00:01:58.560> pieces

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
completely rebuilt some of these pieces

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.819 
completely rebuilt some of these pieces
and<00:01:59.509> this<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.840> end<00:02:01.049> result<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.530> I've<00:02:01.649> just

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
and this is the end result and I've just

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.499 
and this is the end result and I've just
finished<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.310> today<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.729> I'm<00:02:02.850> I'm<00:02:03.360> actually

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
finished it today and I'm I'm actually

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.300 
finished it today and I'm I'm actually
pretty<00:02:03.719> proud<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.380> one<00:02:04.590> now<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.979> can't

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
pretty proud of this one now I can't

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.789 
pretty proud of this one now I can't
exactly<00:02:05.640> tell<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.240> how<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> make<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.200> it's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
exactly tell you how to make this it's

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.499 
exactly tell you how to make this it's
not<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.009> my<00:02:08.340> place<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.879> do<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.239> because

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
not really my place to do that because

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.040 
not really my place to do that because
I'm<00:02:10.259> not<00:02:10.530> sure<00:02:10.679> if<00:02:10.830> triponin<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.120> you

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
I'm not sure if triponin is going to you

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.210 
I'm not sure if triponin is going to you
know

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
know

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.950 
know
plan<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.640> sell<00:02:13.910> them<00:02:14.210> or<00:02:14.330> anything<00:02:14.510> best<00:02:14.840> so

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
plan to sell them or anything best so

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.270 
plan to sell them or anything best so
it's<00:02:15.080> not<00:02:15.170> really<00:02:15.380> my<00:02:15.470> place<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:15.770> go<00:02:16.010> around

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
it's not really my place to go around

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.340 
it's not really my place to go around
and<00:02:16.430> tell<00:02:16.550> people<00:02:16.610> how<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.000> make<00:02:17.330> them<00:02:17.570> you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
and tell people how to make them you

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
and tell people how to make them you
know<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.620> might<00:02:18.770> be<00:02:18.800> hurting<00:02:19.100> his<00:02:19.340> business

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
know it might be hurting his business

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.300 
know it might be hurting his business
but<00:02:20.330> what<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:20.630> can<00:02:21.020> tell<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.280> is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
but what I can tell you is that it is

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.610 
but what I can tell you is that it is
made<00:02:22.610> out<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.910> one<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.150> these<00:02:23.360> this<00:02:24.020> is<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.350> five

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
made out of one of these this is a five

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.310 
made out of one of these this is a five
by<00:02:24.830> five<00:02:24.860> by<00:02:25.280> four<00:02:25.580> from<00:02:25.820> you<00:02:26.270> as<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.960> can<00:02:27.110> see

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
by five by four from you as you can see

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.560 
by five by four from you as you can see
if<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.530> put<00:02:27.710> them<00:02:27.890> side-by-side<00:02:28.420> they<00:02:29.420> are

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
if you put them side-by-side they are

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.020 
if you put them side-by-side they are
the<00:02:29.720> same<00:02:29.990> height<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.680> that's<00:02:31.190> because<00:02:31.640> this

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
the same height and that's because this

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.080 
the same height and that's because this
is<00:02:32.240> equivalent<00:02:32.960> to<00:02:33.200> four<00:02:33.620> cubic<00:02:34.280> pieces<00:02:34.880> and

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
is equivalent to four cubic pieces and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.510 
is equivalent to four cubic pieces and
this<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.720> one<00:02:36.020> two<00:02:36.290> three<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:36.890> two<00:02:37.220> halves

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
this is one two three and two halves

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.060 
this is one two three and two halves
which<00:02:37.820> makes<00:02:38.060> four<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.740> what<00:02:39.740> I've<00:02:39.830> done

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
which makes four and what I've done

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.090 
which makes four and what I've done
basically<00:02:40.580> is<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.840> know<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.080> top<00:02:42.320> layer<00:02:42.590> here

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
basically is you know the top layer here

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.699 
basically is you know the top layer here
is<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.640> same<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.690> know<00:02:44.780> this<00:02:45.020> is<00:02:45.230> untouched

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
is the same you know this is untouched

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.030 
is the same you know this is untouched
but<00:02:46.340> this<00:02:46.670> layer<00:02:46.970> here<00:02:47.450> it's<00:02:48.290> been<00:02:48.530> cut<00:02:48.800> down

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
but this layer here it's been cut down

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.540 
but this layer here it's been cut down
now<00:02:49.640> I've<00:02:50.300> had<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.570> build<00:02:50.959> this<00:02:51.500> entire<00:02:51.800> middle

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
now I've had to build this entire middle

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.280 
now I've had to build this entire middle
layer<00:02:52.730> because<00:02:53.180> as<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.450> can<00:02:53.570> see<00:02:53.630> here<00:02:54.110> there

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
layer because as you can see here there

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.320 
layer because as you can see here there
is<00:02:54.320> none<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.430> mechanism<00:02:56.090> on<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.300> inside

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
is none and the mechanism on the inside

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330 
is none and the mechanism on the inside
does<00:02:56.900> not<00:02:56.930> allow<00:02:57.350> a<00:02:57.380> middle<00:02:57.770> layer<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.190> you've

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
does not allow a middle layer so you've

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.030 
does not allow a middle layer so you've
got<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:58.640> alter<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.330> how<00:03:00.080> it's<00:03:00.320> done<00:03:00.530> it's<00:03:00.830> not

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
got to alter that how it's done it's not

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.490 
got to alter that how it's done it's not

is absolutely amazing it's it's even

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.220 
is absolutely amazing it's it's even
better<00:03:10.610> than<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:10.880> original<00:03:11.030> five<00:03:11.660> by<00:03:11.840> five<00:03:12.050> by

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
better than the original five by five by

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.960 
better than the original five by five by
four<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.740> was<00:03:12.860> made<00:03:13.070> out<00:03:13.100> of<00:03:13.250> I'll<00:03:13.700> go

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
four that it was made out of I'll go

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.730 
four that it was made out of I'll go
ahead<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.420> show<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.750> these<00:03:15.200> layers<00:03:15.470> as<00:03:15.709> you

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
ahead and show you these layers as you

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.170 
ahead and show you these layers as you
can<00:03:15.950> see<00:03:16.160> nothing<00:03:16.640> is<00:03:16.760> catching<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:18.910> all<00:03:19.910> the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
can see nothing is catching and all the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.229 
can see nothing is catching and all the
layers<00:03:20.390> move<00:03:20.930> very<00:03:21.500> very<00:03:21.650> nicely<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:22.580> really

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
layers move very very nicely I really

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.630 
layers move very very nicely I really
really<00:03:23.450> like<00:03:23.660> these<00:03:23.959> layers<00:03:24.290> here<00:03:24.769> I<00:03:24.920> like<00:03:25.459> how

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
really like these layers here I like how

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.870 
really like these layers here I like how
these<00:03:26.300> little<00:03:26.540> layers<00:03:27.320> are<00:03:27.680> half<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.400> size<00:03:28.640> I

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
these little layers are half the size I

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.910 
these little layers are half the size I
just<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.269> find<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.050> really<00:03:30.320> really<00:03:30.500> neat<00:03:30.739> I

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
just I find that really really neat I

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.290 
just I find that really really neat I
found<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:31.489> really<00:03:31.610> really<00:03:31.880> neat<00:03:32.090> when<00:03:32.269> I

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
found that really really neat when I

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.870 
found that really really neat when I
made<00:03:32.570> my<00:03:32.600> um<00:03:33.050> my<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.709> guess<00:03:33.950> half<00:03:34.130> proportional

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
made my um my I guess half proportional

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.330 
made my um my I guess half proportional
three<00:03:35.420> by<00:03:35.540> three<00:03:35.720> by<00:03:35.840> five<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:37.100> was<00:03:37.250> the

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
three by three by five and that was the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.920 
three by three by five and that was the
same<00:03:37.550> thing<00:03:37.790> now<00:03:38.269> I've<00:03:38.390> got<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.570> five<00:03:38.780> by<00:03:38.900> five

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
same thing now I've got a five by five

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.320 
same thing now I've got a five by five
by<00:03:39.230> five<00:03:39.440> version<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.100> so<00:03:40.280> again<00:03:41.090> these

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
by five version of it so again these

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.449 
by five version of it so again these
layers<00:03:41.840> all<00:03:42.230> move<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:45.260> moves<00:03:45.799> very<00:03:46.190> very

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
layers all move and it moves very very

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.370 
layers all move and it moves very very
well<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:46.820> seamlessly<00:03:47.420> I'll<00:03:47.930> go<00:03:48.080> ahead<00:03:48.140> and<00:03:48.320> do

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
well and seamlessly I'll go ahead and do

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.740 
well and seamlessly I'll go ahead and do
a<00:03:48.410> checker<00:03:48.709> pattern<00:03:48.980> for<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.430> guys<00:03:49.580> now<00:03:54.670> as

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
a checker pattern for you guys now as

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.210 
a checker pattern for you guys now as
you<00:03:56.750> can<00:03:56.870> see<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:57.080> checker<00:03:57.410> pattern<00:03:57.650> looks<00:03:57.950> very

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
you can see a checker pattern looks very

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.039 
you can see a checker pattern looks very
very<00:03:58.459> nice<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:58.880> used<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.239> original<00:03:59.450> stickers

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
very nice I used the original stickers

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.690 
very nice I used the original stickers
that<00:04:00.200> came<00:04:00.410> with<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.650> five<00:04:00.830> by<00:04:01.010> five<00:04:01.250> by<00:04:01.459> four

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
that came with the five by five by four

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.430 
that came with the five by five by four
so<00:04:01.910> sticking<00:04:02.330> this<00:04:02.420> thing<00:04:02.630> wasn't<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.959> problem

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
so sticking this thing wasn't a problem

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.650 
so sticking this thing wasn't a problem
I<00:04:03.620> basically<00:04:04.250> just<00:04:04.340> cut<00:04:04.790> all<00:04:05.030> of<00:04:05.209> these<00:04:05.390> in

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
I basically just cut all of these in

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.120 
I basically just cut all of these in
half<00:04:05.959> and<00:04:06.350> that's<00:04:06.500> how<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.680> made<00:04:06.980> these

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
half and that's how I made these

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.800 
half and that's how I made these
stickers<00:04:07.430> now<00:04:08.000> if<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.180> look<00:04:08.330> really<00:04:08.510> closely

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
stickers now if you look really closely

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.360 
stickers now if you look really closely
you<00:04:08.989> can<00:04:09.230> see<00:04:09.440> at<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.709> tops<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.100> them<00:04:10.250> are

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
you can see at the tops of them are

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.100 
you can see at the tops of them are
rounded<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:10.850> the<00:04:11.000> bottoms<00:04:11.390> are<00:04:11.510> still<00:04:11.810> sharp

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
rounded and the bottoms are still sharp

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.630 
rounded and the bottoms are still sharp
because<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.470> did<00:04:12.709> not<00:04:12.860> bother<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.280> round<00:04:13.489> them

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
because I did not bother to round them

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.550 
because I did not bother to round them
out<00:04:13.790> but<00:04:14.390> if<00:04:14.540> you<00:04:14.660> didn't<00:04:14.930> notice<00:04:15.170> it<00:04:15.260> already

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
out but if you didn't notice it already

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.229 
out but if you didn't notice it already
then<00:04:15.890> it's<00:04:16.130> not<00:04:16.310> really<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.580> big<00:04:16.760> deal<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.209> it

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
then it's not really a big deal is it

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.729 
then it's not really a big deal is it
I'm<00:04:18.109> gonna<00:04:18.260> go<00:04:18.440> ahead<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.680> put<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.070> back<00:04:19.220> and

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
I'm gonna go ahead and put it back and

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.260 
I'm gonna go ahead and put it back and
yeah<00:04:21.739> I<00:04:21.770> just<00:04:21.950> I<00:04:22.340> really<00:04:22.580> really<00:04:22.910> love<00:04:23.090> this

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
yeah I just I really really love this

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.820 
yeah I just I really really love this
puzzle<00:04:23.599> I've<00:04:23.930> solved<00:04:24.470> it<00:04:24.590> without

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
puzzle I've solved it without

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.710 
puzzle I've solved it without
shape-shifting<00:04:25.669> first<00:04:25.940> because<00:04:26.240> this

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
shape-shifting first because this

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.660 
shape-shifting first because this
is<00:04:26.810> a<00:04:26.870> shape-shifting<00:04:27.560> cube<00:04:27.890> as<00:04:28.070> you<00:04:28.280> can<00:04:28.430> see

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
is a shape-shifting cube as you can see

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.810 
is a shape-shifting cube as you can see
in<00:04:28.850> it<00:04:29.000> bandages<00:04:29.570> because<00:04:29.930> now<00:04:30.440> these<00:04:31.400> layers

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
in it bandages because now these layers

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.420 
in it bandages because now these layers
are<00:04:32.150> locked<00:04:32.390> together<00:04:33.040> so<00:04:34.040> let's<00:04:34.250> go<00:04:34.340> ahead

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
are locked together so let's go ahead

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.680 
are locked together so let's go ahead
actually<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:34.970> just<00:04:35.000> scramble<00:04:35.510> it<00:04:35.600> up

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
actually and just scramble it up

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.300 
actually and just scramble it up
completely<00:04:36.170> and<00:04:36.440> before<00:04:37.010> I<00:04:37.040> start

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
completely and before I start

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.080 
completely and before I start
shape-shifting<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.480> always<00:04:38.900> want<00:04:39.230> to

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
shape-shifting you always want to

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.340 
shape-shifting you always want to
Scrabble<00:04:41.090> it<00:04:41.150> up<00:04:41.270> as<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.480> cuboid<00:04:41.930> first<00:04:44.350> so

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
Scrabble it up as a cuboid first so

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.590 
Scrabble it up as a cuboid first so
let's<00:04:45.650> go<00:04:47.800> I've<00:04:48.800> been<00:04:49.010> showing<00:04:49.250> pictures<00:04:49.880> of

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
let's go I've been showing pictures of

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.170 
let's go I've been showing pictures of
this<00:04:50.810> on<00:04:51.110> Facebook<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:52.190> if<00:04:52.370> you<00:04:52.610> like<00:04:52.940> me<00:04:53.060> on

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.810 
up a little bit more here okay I think
that's<00:05:02.330> pretty<00:05:02.630> good<00:05:02.800> so<00:05:03.800> now<00:05:04.070> let's<00:05:04.640> go<00:05:04.790> on

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
that's pretty good so now let's go on

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.970 
that's pretty good so now let's go on
with<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.060> shape-shifting<00:05:05.330> let's<00:05:05.960> turn<00:05:06.260> this

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
with the shape-shifting let's turn this

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.820 
with the shape-shifting let's turn this
layer<00:05:07.280> like<00:05:07.730> this<00:05:08.030> and<00:05:08.450> this<00:05:09.080> layer<00:05:09.380> let's

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
layer like this and this layer let's

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.170 
layer like this and this layer let's
move<00:05:10.130> it<00:05:10.480> like<00:05:11.480> that<00:05:11.750> as<00:05:12.740> you<00:05:13.640> can<00:05:13.790> see<00:05:14.000> it

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
move it like that as you can see it

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.230 
move it like that as you can see it
becomes<00:05:14.540> very<00:05:15.260> very<00:05:15.620> scrambled<00:05:16.280> very<00:05:16.910> quickly

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
becomes very very scrambled very quickly

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.590 
becomes very very scrambled very quickly
when<00:05:17.510> your<00:05:17.740> shape-shifting<00:05:19.180> now<00:05:20.180> it<00:05:20.390> moves

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
when your shape-shifting now it moves

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.210 
when your shape-shifting now it moves
just<00:05:20.870> like<00:05:20.960> a<00:05:21.050> 3x3<00:05:21.620> because<00:05:21.890> like<00:05:22.040> I<00:05:22.160> said

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
just like a 3x3 because like I said

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.120 
just like a 3x3 because like I said
these<00:05:23.060> two<00:05:23.120> are<00:05:23.510> bandaged<00:05:23.870> together<00:05:24.290> so<00:05:24.980> are

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
these two are bandaged together so are

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.950 
these two are bandaged together so are
these<00:05:25.340> two<00:05:25.640> in<00:05:25.820> the<00:05:26.060> middle<00:05:26.270> is<00:05:26.390> not<00:05:26.660> and

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
these two in the middle is not and

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.900 
these two in the middle is not and
that's<00:05:27.290> the<00:05:27.500> way<00:05:27.620> it<00:05:27.710> is<00:05:27.830> on<00:05:27.860> all<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.430> sides<00:05:28.669> as

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
that's the way it is on all the sides as

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.390 
that's the way it is on all the sides as
you<00:05:29.060> can<00:05:29.210> see<00:05:29.530> so<00:05:30.530> let's<00:05:30.680> continue<00:05:31.010> with<00:05:31.220> the

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
you can see so let's continue with the

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.020 
you can see so let's continue with the
scramble

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
scramble

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.430 
scramble
I<00:05:34.270> haven't<00:05:35.270> actually<00:05:35.390> scrambled<00:05:36.020> it<00:05:36.110> and

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
I haven't actually scrambled it and

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.500 
I haven't actually scrambled it and
solved<00:05:36.740> it<00:05:36.770> like<00:05:36.919> this<00:05:37.100> yet<00:05:37.340> I'm<00:05:38.090> wondering<00:05:38.419> if

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
solved it like this yet I'm wondering if

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.590 
solved it like this yet I'm wondering if
I<00:05:38.630> can't<00:05:38.930> yeah<00:05:39.440> it<00:05:39.800> reminds<00:05:40.160> me<00:05:40.310> of<00:05:40.400> my<00:05:40.850> three

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
I can't yeah it reminds me of my three
