like<00:04:57.639> to<00:04:58.639> be<00:04:58.970> minor<00:04:59.270> chord<00:04:59.810> he<00:05:00.110> put<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.440> three

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
like to be minor chord he put it three

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:10.519 
like to be minor chord he put it three
times<00:05:00.919> up

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:10.529 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:23.269 

so<00:05:11.529> it<00:05:11.619> goes<00:05:11.799> like<00:05:12.099> 1<00:05:14.519> 2<00:05:15.519> 3<00:05:15.549> 4<00:05:16.589> 5<00:05:17.589> 6<00:05:18.029> and<00:05:19.589> 2<00:05:20.589> 3<00:05:20.949> 4<00:05:21.459> 5
