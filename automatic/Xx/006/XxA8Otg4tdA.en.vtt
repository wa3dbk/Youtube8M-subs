00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
good at that so I'll see what happens

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.690 
good at that so I'll see what happens
this<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.469> intro<00:00:37.739> if<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.100> notice<00:00:38.370> it's

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
this is the intro if you notice it's

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.080 
this is the intro if you notice it's
tiled<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.510> reason<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.260> because

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
tiled and the reason for that is because

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.310 
tiled and the reason for that is because
you<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.300> take<00:00:42.570> graphic<00:00:42.870> shoes<00:00:43.050> when<00:00:43.230> you

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
you have to take graphic shoes when you

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.400 
you have to take graphic shoes when you
enter<00:00:43.620> anybody's<00:00:43.890> home<00:00:44.570> that<00:00:45.570> being<00:00:45.809> said<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
enter anybody's home that being said you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.040 
enter anybody's home that being said you
have<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:48.289> shoe<00:00:49.289> closet<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:50.629> it's<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.809> good

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
have the shoe closet here it's a good

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.209 
have the shoe closet here it's a good
amount<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.440> shoes<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:55.160> want<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
amount of shoes so with that I want a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.549 
amount of shoes so with that I want a
second<00:00:56.640> fit<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> good<00:00:57.270> 20<00:00:57.449> pair<00:00:57.840> here

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.250 

so<00:01:01.760> storage<00:01:02.760> space<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.300> definitely<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:04.110> an

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
so storage space is definitely not an

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.910 
so storage space is definitely not an
