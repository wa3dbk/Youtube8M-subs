I'd<00:01:14.540> consider<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.050> a<00:01:15.170> mid-range<00:01:15.590> smartphone

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
I'd consider it a mid-range smartphone

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.790 
I'd consider it a mid-range smartphone
at<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:17.780> time<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:19.430> day<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:20.990> know<00:01:21.140> there

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
at this time of the day you know there

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.010 
at this time of the day you know there
are<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:21.920> lot<00:01:21.980> higher<00:01:22.670> powered<00:01:23.210> phones<00:01:23.540> out<00:01:23.810> now

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
are a lot higher powered phones out now

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.340 
are a lot higher powered phones out now
like<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.620> GS<00:01:24.950> 4<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:25.670> phones<00:01:26.450> like<00:01:26.720> that<00:01:26.930> that

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
like the GS 4 and phones like that that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.250 
like the GS 4 and phones like that that
actually<00:01:27.920> will<00:01:28.640> be<00:01:28.850> able<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.270> make<00:01:29.900> this<00:01:30.050> at

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
actually will be able to make this at

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.580 
actually will be able to make this at
perform<00:01:30.770> even<00:01:31.460> greater<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:33.020> this<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.320> just<00:01:33.440> a

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
perform even greater so this is just a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.190 
perform even greater so this is just a
mid-range<00:01:33.950> phone<00:01:34.280> I'm<00:01:34.610> sure<00:01:34.790> even<00:01:35.060> a<00:01:35.330> low-end

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
mid-range phone I'm sure even a low-end

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.460 
mid-range phone I'm sure even a low-end
phone<00:01:36.500> would<00:01:36.770> be<00:01:36.800> able<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.190> run<00:01:37.400> this<00:01:37.550> ok<00:01:38.470> but

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
phone would be able to run this ok but

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.469 
phone would be able to run this ok but
you<00:01:39.619> know<00:01:39.740> with<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:39.950> little<00:01:40.130> bit<00:01:40.280> more<00:01:40.880> lag

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
you know with a little bit more lag

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.969 
you know with a little bit more lag
maybe<00:01:42.410> but<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.520> point<00:01:43.759> is<00:01:43.910> this<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.650> first

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
maybe but the point is this is the first

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.890
