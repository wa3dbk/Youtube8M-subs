00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.340 

hey<00:00:02.400> everybody<00:00:02.790> today<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.540> wanted<00:00:03.900> to<00:00:04.049> review

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
hey everybody today I wanted to review

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.600 
hey everybody today I wanted to review
the<00:00:04.740> canon<00:00:05.400> 85<00:00:05.820> millimeter<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.450> 1.2<00:00:07.610> unlike

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
the canon 85 millimeter of 1.2 unlike

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.359 
the canon 85 millimeter of 1.2 unlike
other<00:00:08.790> reviews<00:00:09.210> i<00:00:09.450> guess<00:00:10.039> people<00:00:11.039> who<00:00:11.160> are

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:11.369 
other reviews i guess people who are

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.369 
other reviews i guess people who are
looking<00:00:11.789> to<00:00:11.849> review<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:12.509> lens<00:00:12.719> really<00:00:13.110> know

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
looking to review this lens really know

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.120 
looking to review this lens really know
what<00:00:13.619> it's<00:00:13.740> capable<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.400> its<00:00:15.920> aperture<00:00:16.920> goes

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
what it's capable of its aperture goes

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.919 
what it's capable of its aperture goes
down<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.490> 1.2<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.179> guess<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.570> point<00:00:18.689> in<00:00:18.840> my

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:18.929 
down to 1.2 I guess the point in my

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.390 
down to 1.2 I guess the point in my
review<00:00:19.259> is<00:00:19.439> I've<00:00:19.590> actually<00:00:19.769> had<00:00:20.099> this<00:00:20.220> lens

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
review is I've actually had this lens

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.269 
review is I've actually had this lens
for<00:00:20.519> about<00:00:20.789> four<00:00:21.210> years<00:00:21.390> now<00:00:21.890> and<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.099> it's<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
for about four years now and so it's a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.220 
for about four years now and so it's a
long-term<00:00:24.080> review<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.349> usability<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
long-term review on usability and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.380 
long-term review on usability and
practicality<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.470> guess<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.849> as<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.179> see

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
practicality I guess so as you can see

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.960 
practicality I guess so as you can see
the<00:00:30.980> 85<00:00:31.980> millimeter<00:00:32.970> is<00:00:33.180> quite<00:00:33.630> large

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
the 85 millimeter is quite large

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.490 
the 85 millimeter is quite large
compared<00:00:35.970> to<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:37.280> 24<00:00:38.280> 7d<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.960> smaller

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
compared to the 24 7d and it's smaller

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.840 
compared to the 24 7d and it's smaller
brother<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.610> 35<00:00:42.270> millimeter<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:44.220> 85

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
brother the 35 millimeter the 85

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.720 
brother the 35 millimeter the 85
millimeter<00:00:45.420> lens<00:00:45.720> is<00:00:47.930> pretty<00:00:48.930> much<00:00:49.110> fat<00:00:49.980> as

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
millimeter lens is pretty much fat as

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.540 
millimeter lens is pretty much fat as
you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.150> here<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.540> uses<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:52.010> 72<00:00:53.010> millimeter

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you can see here it uses a 72 millimeter

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.890 
you can see here it uses a 72 millimeter
ring<00:00:53.910> which<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:55.760> guess<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.940> pretty<00:00:57.180> annoying<00:00:57.510> if

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
ring which I guess is pretty annoying if

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.270 
ring which I guess is pretty annoying if
you<00:00:58.830> are<00:00:59.310> pretty<00:00:59.700> much<00:00:59.820> set<00:01:00.150> to<00:01:01.040> have<00:01:02.040> all<00:01:02.250> of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
you are pretty much set to have all of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.450 
you are pretty much set to have all of
your<00:01:02.520> filters<00:01:02.970> using<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.229> standard<00:01:04.710> 77

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
your filters using the standard 77

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.680 
your filters using the standard 77
millimeter<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.120> all<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> out<00:01:06.450> lenses<00:01:08.570> one<00:01:09.570> of

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
millimeter for all the out lenses one of

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.360 
millimeter for all the out lenses one of
the<00:01:09.750> issues<00:01:10.050> I<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.320> with<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.620> lens<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.160> its

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
the issues I have with this lens is its

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.540 
the issues I have with this lens is its
focusing<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:13.290> uses<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.070> known<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.370> a

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
focusing it uses what is known as a

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.140 
focusing it uses what is known as a
focus<00:01:15.060> by<00:01:15.210> wire<00:01:15.480> mechanism<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.970> what<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
focus by wire mechanism and what that

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.390 
focus by wire mechanism and what that
means<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.750> can't<00:01:19.140> physically<00:01:19.920> focus

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
means is you can't physically focus

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.370 
means is you can't physically focus
regardless<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.270> whether<00:01:21.480> Nigar<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.870> manual

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
regardless of whether Nigar and manual

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.010 
regardless of whether Nigar and manual
or<00:01:22.830> auto<00:01:23.070> focus<00:01:23.490> without<00:01:23.850> power<00:01:24.090> if<00:01:24.930> you

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
or auto focus without power if you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.840 
or auto focus without power if you
notice<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> element<00:01:25.830> does<00:01:26.190> not<00:01:26.370> move<00:01:26.580> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
notice the element does not move it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.290 
notice the element does not move it
needs<00:01:27.390> power<00:01:27.690> to<00:01:29.000> essentially<00:01:30.000> move<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
needs power to essentially move the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.240 
needs power to essentially move the
servos<00:01:30.690> when<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.080> ring<00:01:31.260> is<00:01:31.290> triggered<00:01:32.070> it's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
servos when the ring is triggered it's

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
servos when the ring is triggered it's
all<00:01:32.520> electronic<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:35.840> guess<00:01:36.840> that's<00:01:37.080> good

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
all electronic and I guess that's good

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.490 
all electronic and I guess that's good
if<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.580> light<00:01:38.790> focusing<00:01:39.300> because<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
if you like a light focusing because the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.180 
if you like a light focusing because the
glass<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> bit<00:01:41.159> heavy<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.350> think<00:01:44.070> it's

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
glass is a bit heavy but I think it's

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.680 
glass is a bit heavy but I think it's
just<00:01:44.310> another<00:01:44.490> piece<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.970> break<00:01:45.150> down<00:01:45.330> once

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
just another piece to break down once

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.310 
just another piece to break down once
time<00:01:46.650> goes<00:01:46.950> by<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:48.570> not<00:01:48.780> as<00:01:48.900> precise

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
time goes by and it's not as precise

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.170 
time goes by and it's not as precise
especially<00:01:49.950> when<00:01:50.130> you're<00:01:50.250> doing<00:01:50.520> video<00:01:50.820> work

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
especially when you're doing video work

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.730 
especially when you're doing video work
and<00:01:51.510> you<00:01:51.750> want<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:54.020> get<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> depth<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.470> field

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and you want to get the depth of field

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.789 
and you want to get the depth of field
solo<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.820> at<00:01:56.970> one<00:01:57.120> point<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.900> you<00:01:58.590> want

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
solo so at one point to that you want

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.630 
solo so at one point to that you want
precise<00:01:59.369> focusing<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:01.140> won't<00:02:01.640> give

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
precise focusing and it's it won't give

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.460 
precise focusing and it's it won't give
you<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> precise<00:02:03.299> field<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.900> a<00:02:03.930> physical

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
you the precise field that a physical

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.440 
you the precise field that a physical
lens<00:02:04.650> would<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:05.580> all<00:02:05.760> electronic<00:02:06.270> so

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
lens would it's it's all electronic so

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.779 
lens would it's it's all electronic so
you<00:02:06.510> have<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.900> fudge<00:02:07.830> with<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.369> then<00:02:08.549> fudge

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
you have to fudge with it and then fudge

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.660 
you have to fudge with it and then fudge
back<00:02:09.090> you'll<00:02:09.779> eventually<00:02:09.929> get<00:02:10.259> there<00:02:10.439> but

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
back you'll eventually get there but

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.960 
back you'll eventually get there but
it's<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.790> slow<00:02:12.029> kind<00:02:12.749> of

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
it's a slow kind of

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.180 
it's a slow kind of
beast<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:14.410> guess<00:02:14.590> that's<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:14.920> goes<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.160> the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
beast and I guess that's it goes of the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.500 
beast and I guess that's it goes of the
same<00:02:15.370> with<00:02:15.520> autofocusing<00:02:16.150> when<00:02:16.390> your

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
same with autofocusing when your

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.470 
same with autofocusing when your
autofocusing<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:18.580> will<00:02:18.730> take<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.000> while<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.270> get

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
autofocusing it will take a while to get

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.020 
autofocusing it will take a while to get
there<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.840> isn't<00:02:20.020> as<00:02:20.230> fast<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.160> focuses<00:02:21.820> most

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
there it isn't as fast and focuses most

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.940 
there it isn't as fast and focuses most
lenses<00:02:22.390> but<00:02:22.630> that's<00:02:22.840> really<00:02:23.470> because<00:02:23.770> the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
lenses but that's really because the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.420 
lenses but that's really because the
element<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.400> pretty<00:02:25.300> large<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.920> again<00:02:27.250> it's

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
element is pretty large and again it's

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.160 
element is pretty large and again it's
it's<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.910> portrait<00:02:28.270> lens<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:28.690> not<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> sports

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
it's a portrait lens it's not a sports

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.590 
it's a portrait lens it's not a sports
lens<00:02:29.470> one<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.580> graphs<00:02:30.820> I<00:02:30.970> have<00:02:31.180> with<00:02:31.450> this

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
lens one of the graphs I have with this

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:44.670 
lens one of the graphs I have with this
lens<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.950> as<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.760> see<00:02:42.900> unlike<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.530> other

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
lens is as you can see unlike the other

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.610 
lens is as you can see unlike the other
lenses<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:46.570> glass<00:02:47.410> here<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:49.420> pretty<00:02:50.410> much

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
lenses this glass here is pretty much

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.870 
lenses this glass here is pretty much
right<00:02:51.250> on<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:52.120> edge<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:53.470> see<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.880> compared

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
right on the edge you see that compared

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.540 
right on the edge you see that compared
to<00:02:55.000> every<00:02:55.240> other<00:02:55.330> ones<00:02:55.600> I've<00:02:55.780> used<00:02:56.430> or<00:02:57.430> at

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
to every other ones I've used or at

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.600 
to every other ones I've used or at
least<00:02:57.580> there's<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:59.500> divot<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.670> some<00:03:01.180> sort<00:03:02.610> where

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
least there's a divot of some sort where

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.600 
least there's a divot of some sort where
the<00:03:03.700> glass<00:03:03.910> isn't<00:03:04.180> fully<00:03:04.840> touching<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:06.520> you

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
the glass isn't fully touching so you

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.860 
the glass isn't fully touching so you
don't<00:03:06.760> have<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.000> worry<00:03:07.270> about<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.720> being

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
don't have to worry about it being

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.440 
don't have to worry about it being
scratched<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:09.820> notice<00:03:10.030> here<00:03:10.209> there's<00:03:10.390> uh

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
scratched you notice here there's uh

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.140 
scratched you notice here there's uh
probably<00:03:11.350> about<00:03:11.610> two<00:03:12.610> or<00:03:12.760> three<00:03:12.790> millimeters

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
probably about two or three millimeters

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.449 
probably about two or three millimeters
of<00:03:14.140> space<00:03:16.050> here<00:03:17.050> it's<00:03:17.350> there's<00:03:17.739> nothing<00:03:17.980> so

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
of space here it's there's nothing so

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.410 
of space here it's there's nothing so
changing<00:03:19.090> lenses<00:03:19.269> quickly<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.140> field<00:03:20.440> as

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
changing lenses quickly on the field as

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.780 
changing lenses quickly on the field as
you<00:03:22.420> can<00:03:22.570> see<00:03:22.720> is<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.870> pretty<00:03:23.140> precarious<00:03:24.100> task

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
you can see is a pretty precarious task

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.780 
you can see is a pretty precarious task
and<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.209> do<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.870> with<00:03:25.959> great<00:03:26.170> care<00:03:26.200> the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.910 

materials<00:03:30.790> is<00:03:31.330> it's<00:03:31.959> actually<00:03:32.170> very<00:03:32.709> well

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
materials is it's actually very well

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.860 
materials is it's actually very well
built<00:03:33.160> I<00:03:33.370> would<00:03:33.580> say<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.850> plastic<00:03:34.300> is<00:03:34.450> on<00:03:34.570> par

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
built I would say the plastic is on par

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.210 
built I would say the plastic is on par
with<00:03:36.150> 2470<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.360> doesn't<00:03:38.140> have<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.890> weather

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
with 2470 it doesn't have the weather

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.710 
with 2470 it doesn't have the weather
sealing<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:40.560> 2470<00:03:41.560> has<00:03:41.739> but<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:43.360> know<00:03:43.450> like<00:03:43.630> I

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
sealing the 2470 has but you know like I

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.420 
sealing the 2470 has but you know like I
said<00:03:43.780> earlier<00:03:44.200> this<00:03:44.380> lens<00:03:44.680> is<00:03:45.040> pretty<00:03:45.310> much

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
said earlier this lens is pretty much

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.640 
said earlier this lens is pretty much
babied<00:03:46.090> so<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:48.610> doesn't<00:03:48.910> quite<00:03:49.000> go<00:03:49.239> out<00:03:49.650> when

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
babied so it doesn't quite go out when

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.979 
babied so it doesn't quite go out when
it's<00:03:50.860> raining<00:03:51.250> anyways<00:03:51.880> it's<00:03:52.480> pretty<00:03:52.780> fragile

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
it's raining anyways it's pretty fragile

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.570 
it's raining anyways it's pretty fragile
to<00:03:53.530> me<00:03:53.680> but<00:03:54.400> it's<00:03:54.670> built<00:03:54.910> pretty<00:03:56.190> pretty<00:03:57.190> solid

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
to me but it's built pretty pretty solid

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.090 
to me but it's built pretty pretty solid
the<00:03:58.180> glass<00:03:58.780> is<00:03:58.959> so<00:03:59.110> heavy<00:03:59.320> though<00:03:59.530> that<00:03:59.739> if<00:03:59.860> I

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
the glass is so heavy though that if I

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.800 
the glass is so heavy though that if I
think<00:04:00.190> you<00:04:00.489> dropped<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:00.910> it's<00:04:01.150> pretty<00:04:01.570> much

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
think you dropped this it's pretty much

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
think you dropped this it's pretty much
gonna<00:04:02.019> be<00:04:02.170> done<00:04:02.320> for

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.780 

unlike<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:06.720> 35<00:04:07.720> millimeter<00:04:07.930> where<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.440> think

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
unlike the 35 millimeter where I think

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.580 
unlike the 35 millimeter where I think
you<00:04:09.790> know<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.090> plastic<00:04:10.480> is<00:04:10.690> it's<00:04:11.380> a<00:04:11.440> bit

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
you know the plastic is it's a bit

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.530 
you know the plastic is it's a bit
cheaper<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:12.070> mean<00:04:12.310> it's<00:04:12.430> it's<00:04:12.670> an<00:04:12.760> L<00:04:12.880> lens<00:04:13.260> but

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
cheaper I mean it's it's an L lens but

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.990 
cheaper I mean it's it's an L lens but
doesn't<00:04:16.540> compared<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.640> thickness<00:04:18.640> that

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
doesn't compared to the thickness that

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.180 
doesn't compared to the thickness that
these<00:04:19.870> two<00:04:20.140> have<00:04:22.650> mounting<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.740> lens<00:04:23.950> is

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
these two have mounting the lens is

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.730 
these two have mounting the lens is
pretty<00:04:24.789> straightforward

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.830 

think<00:04:28.740> obviously<00:04:29.220> if<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:29.580> have<00:04:29.759> a<00:04:29.790> 1d<00:04:30.389> series

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
think obviously if you have a 1d series

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.810 
think obviously if you have a 1d series
body<00:04:31.080> or<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:32.180> battery<00:04:33.180> pack<00:04:34.250> makes<00:04:35.250> things<00:04:35.580> a

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
body or a battery pack makes things a

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.100 
body or a battery pack makes things a
bit<00:04:35.850> easier<00:04:36.660> especially<00:04:37.440> if<00:04:37.740> you're<00:04:37.919> filming

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
bit easier especially if you're filming

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:47.150 
bit easier especially if you're filming
video<00:04:44.000> because<00:04:45.000> there's<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:46.050> lot<00:04:46.289> of<00:04:46.320> room<00:04:47.009> in

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
video because there's a lot of room in

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.460 
video because there's a lot of room in
the<00:04:47.220> bottom<00:04:48.410> like<00:04:49.410> say<00:04:49.560> with<00:04:49.680> mounting<00:04:50.070> it's

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
the bottom like say with mounting it's

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.439 
the bottom like say with mounting it's
it'd<00:04:52.470> be<00:04:52.650> pretty<00:04:52.830> careful<00:04:53.100> not<00:04:53.699> to<00:04:54.210> scratch

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
it'd be pretty careful not to scratch

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.379 
it'd be pretty careful not to scratch
the<00:04:54.870> glass<00:04:54.990> on<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.039> edges<00:04:56.850> of<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.120> metal

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
the glass on the edges of the metal

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:03.500 
the glass on the edges of the metal
mount<00:04:58.789> and<00:04:59.789> it<00:05:00.090> snaps<00:05:00.389> into<00:05:00.600> place<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:03.240> only

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
mount and it snaps into place the only

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.029 
mount and it snaps into place the only
time<00:05:03.720> I<00:05:03.750> guess<00:05:04.050> I<00:05:04.199> would<00:05:04.350> have<00:05:04.470> problems

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
time I guess I would have problems

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.779 
time I guess I would have problems
mounting<00:05:05.990> would<00:05:06.990> be<00:05:07.110> on<00:05:07.320> video<00:05:07.919> where<00:05:08.430> we

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
mounting would be on video where we

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.920 
mounting would be on video where we
would<00:05:09.270> use<00:05:09.449> a<00:05:09.479> t2i<00:05:10.080> or<00:05:10.500> 5d<00:05:11.210> without<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.539> battery

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
would use a t2i or 5d without a battery

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:23.659 
would use a t2i or 5d without a battery
pack<00:05:14.389> and<00:05:21.349> I'm<00:05:22.349> not<00:05:22.530> sure<00:05:22.800> you<00:05:22.979> can<00:05:23.099> tell<00:05:23.400> here

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
pack and I'm not sure you can tell here

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.710 
pack and I'm not sure you can tell here
that<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:25.370> lens<00:05:26.370> is<00:05:26.610> actually<00:05:26.759> larger<00:05:27.479> than

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
that the lens is actually larger than

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.129 
that the lens is actually larger than
the<00:05:27.960> body<00:05:28.229> and<00:05:29.240> this<00:05:30.240> actually<00:05:30.599> causes<00:05:30.960> some

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
the body and this actually causes some

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.240 
the body and this actually causes some
problems<00:05:31.289> especially<00:05:31.710> when<00:05:31.979> you're<00:05:32.099> using

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
problems especially when you're using

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.920 
problems especially when you're using
mounting<00:05:32.729> plates<00:05:34.729> usually<00:05:35.729> the<00:05:35.849> plates<00:05:36.210> sit

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
mounting plates usually the plates sit

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.370 
mounting plates usually the plates sit
here<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:37.919> the<00:05:38.130> lens<00:05:38.510> obstruct<00:05:39.510> obstruct<00:05:39.750> sit

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
here and the lens obstruct obstruct sit

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.110 
here and the lens obstruct obstruct sit
so<00:05:40.650> sometimes<00:05:41.070> you<00:05:41.250> have<00:05:41.280> to<00:05:41.460> push<00:05:41.699> the<00:05:41.880> plate

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
so sometimes you have to push the plate

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.409 
so sometimes you have to push the plate
back<00:05:42.389> or<00:05:43.380> you<00:05:44.310> have<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.639> difficult<00:05:45.270> time

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
back or you have the difficult time

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.640 
back or you have the difficult time
mounting<00:05:45.900> and<00:05:46.020> unmounting<00:05:46.190> the<00:05:47.190> lens<00:05:47.430> on<00:05:48.389> a

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
mounting and unmounting the lens on a

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.629 
mounting and unmounting the lens on a
t2i<00:05:49.650> or<00:05:49.979> a<00:05:50.010> 5d<00:05:50.550> that<00:05:51.060> doesn't<00:05:51.479> have<00:05:52.639> the

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
t2i or a 5d that doesn't have the

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.210 
t2i or a 5d that doesn't have the
battery<00:05:54.150> pack<00:05:54.389> another<00:05:55.380> feature<00:05:55.680> that<00:05:55.800> I<00:05:55.949> find

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
battery pack another feature that I find

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.450 
battery pack another feature that I find
pretty<00:05:56.430> useful<00:05:56.880> is<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.360> lens<00:05:57.810> hood<00:05:58.139> and<00:05:58.460> the

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
pretty useful is the lens hood and the

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.580 
pretty useful is the lens hood and the
reason<00:05:59.820> is<00:05:59.970> it<00:06:00.120> actually<00:06:00.479> uses<00:06:00.720> a<00:06:01.050> push-button

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
reason is it actually uses a push-button

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.240 
reason is it actually uses a push-button
mechanism<00:06:01.880> instead<00:06:02.880> of<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.060> bayonet<00:06:04.039> so<00:06:05.039> what

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
mechanism instead of the bayonet so what

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.120 
mechanism instead of the bayonet so what
that<00:06:05.370> means<00:06:05.580> is<00:06:05.970> if<00:06:06.449> you<00:06:06.510> notice<00:06:06.979> there<00:06:07.979> is

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
that means is if you notice there is

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.580 
that means is if you notice there is
these<00:06:08.250> little<00:06:08.520> blades<00:06:08.849> that<00:06:09.199> come<00:06:10.199> in<00:06:10.349> and<00:06:10.470> out

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
these little blades that come in and out

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.580 
these little blades that come in and out
and<00:06:10.770> when<00:06:10.919> you<00:06:10.979> push<00:06:12.110> and<00:06:13.110> what<00:06:13.199> that<00:06:13.380> allows

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
and when you push and what that allows

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.629 
and when you push and what that allows
you<00:06:13.710> to<00:06:13.770> do<00:06:13.949> is<00:06:14.130> this<00:06:15.090> pretty<00:06:15.990> much<00:06:16.430> snaps<00:06:17.430> on

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
you to do is this pretty much snaps on

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.659 
you to do is this pretty much snaps on
and<00:06:17.669> then<00:06:18.030> snaps<00:06:18.360> off<00:06:18.599> Wow<00:06:19.349> and<00:06:20.220> I<00:06:20.310> found<00:06:20.550> it

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
and then snaps off Wow and I found it

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.570 
and then snaps off Wow and I found it
useful<00:06:20.970> because<00:06:21.770> during<00:06:22.770> events<00:06:23.190> sometimes

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
useful because during events sometimes

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.790 
useful because during events sometimes
when<00:06:23.909> I<00:06:23.940> have<00:06:24.120> multiple<00:06:24.539> bodies<00:06:25.199> and<00:06:25.409> multiple

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
when I have multiple bodies and multiple

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.879 
when I have multiple bodies and multiple
lenses<00:06:26.389> during<00:06:27.389> prep<00:06:27.630> time<00:06:27.780> I<00:06:27.840> have<00:06:28.080> to<00:06:28.199> go<00:06:28.380> fix

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
lenses during prep time I have to go fix

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.890 
lenses during prep time I have to go fix
the<00:06:29.039> bayonets

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
the bayonets

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.990 
the bayonets
you<00:06:31.199> know<00:06:31.320> I'll<00:06:31.530> line<00:06:31.740> up<00:06:31.919> correctly<00:06:32.340> and<00:06:32.699> then

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
you know I'll line up correctly and then

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.170 
you know I'll line up correctly and then
twist<00:06:33.300> it<00:06:33.479> and<00:06:33.630> go<00:06:33.930> on<00:06:34.080> to<00:06:34.169> the<00:06:34.260> next<00:06:34.409> lens<00:06:34.620> and

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
twist it and go on to the next lens and

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.339 
twist it and go on to the next lens and
even<00:06:36.180> though<00:06:36.240> it<00:06:36.330> takes<00:06:36.450> a<00:06:36.539> few<00:06:36.690> seconds<00:06:37.080> you

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
even though it takes a few seconds you

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.150 
even though it takes a few seconds you
know<00:06:37.440> this<00:06:37.620> just<00:06:37.889> allows<00:06:38.159> me<00:06:38.190> to<00:06:38.400> snap<00:06:38.639> on

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
know this just allows me to snap on

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.010 
know this just allows me to snap on
I<00:06:39.220> don't<00:06:39.670> even<00:06:39.760> think<00:06:39.880> about<00:06:40.120> it<00:06:40.420> and<00:06:40.540> move<00:06:40.660> on

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
I don't even think about it and move on

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.140 
I don't even think about it and move on
and<00:06:41.380> it's<00:06:41.920> you<00:06:42.430> know<00:06:42.460> the<00:06:42.640> little<00:06:42.880> things<00:06:43.060> that

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
and it's you know the little things that

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:49.680 
and it's you know the little things that
I<00:06:43.770> find<00:06:44.770> are<00:06:45.010> useful<00:06:47.310> the<00:06:48.310> lens<00:06:48.520> itself<00:06:49.000> well

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
I find are useful the lens itself well

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.810 
I find are useful the lens itself well
it's<00:06:49.840> pretty<00:06:50.020> expensive<00:06:50.260> I<00:06:50.770> think<00:06:50.860> new<00:06:51.430> it's

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:51.820 
it's pretty expensive I think new it's

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.490 
it's pretty expensive I think new it's
about<00:06:51.970> 1800<00:06:52.840> USD<00:06:53.380> and<00:06:54.210> use<00:06:55.210> it's<00:06:55.840> probably

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
about 1800 USD and use it's probably

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.070 
about 1800 USD and use it's probably
about<00:06:56.620> 16<00:06:57.270> keep<00:06:58.270> your<00:06:58.390> tape<00:06:58.540> depending<00:06:59.020> the

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
about 16 keep your tape depending the

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.630 
about 16 keep your tape depending the
condition<00:06:59.530> I<00:07:01.830> believe<00:07:02.830> it<00:07:02.980> is<00:07:03.100> actually<00:07:03.340> one

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.640 
condition I believe it is actually one

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.930 
condition I believe it is actually one
of<00:07:03.670> the<00:07:03.850> better<00:07:04.120> purchases<00:07:04.720> that<00:07:04.930> I've<00:07:05.080> made

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 
of the better purchases that I've made

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.570 
of the better purchases that I've made
as<00:07:06.940> far<00:07:07.180> as<00:07:07.300> usability<00:07:07.720> goes<00:07:08.050> it<00:07:08.350> is<00:07:08.580> excellent

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580 
as far as usability goes it is excellent

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.100 
as far as usability goes it is excellent
for<00:07:09.850> portraits<00:07:10.330> and<00:07:12.360> aside<00:07:13.360> from<00:07:13.510> having<00:07:13.870> to

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.110 
for portraits and aside from having to

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.210 
for portraits and aside from having to
baby<00:07:14.320> it<00:07:14.530> a<00:07:14.560> lot<00:07:14.770> it<00:07:16.230> it<00:07:17.230> would<00:07:17.800> pretty<00:07:18.070> much

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.220 
baby it a lot it it would pretty much

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.970 
baby it a lot it it would pretty much
pay<00:07:18.430> for<00:07:18.460> itself
