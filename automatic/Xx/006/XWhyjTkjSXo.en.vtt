00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.740
 the skin is a mantle that surrounds us and separates us from the external environment 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.160
 in adults 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.639
 It has an extension of more than two square meters with a weight between 5 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.599
 and 7 kilos 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:15.659
 sometimes 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.820
 the Greek word dermis is used to designate the entire skin 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.710
 however in medicine the skin is divided into a superficial layer oettinger 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.710
 my and in a deep layer same power 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.699
 when we observe the surface of the palm of the hands or the plant of the 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:36.620
 feet 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.100
 we see that there are drawings in it formed by thin ridges of the 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.909
 epidermis 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:41.850
 which are called 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.170
 dermatologists 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.360
 debbie wasserman means time 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.150
 phil meaningful coke 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.720
 no two people with the same drawings even between identical twins 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.720
 we can find small differences 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.580
 for this reason and since very old 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.900
 thermocouple figures pillars of fingers known fingerprints 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.610
 have been used by the police to identify individuals 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.380
 the epidermis 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.340
 It is waterproof 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.380
 but not to some chemicals that they can not cross or to 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 later to be absorbed by the organism 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.220
 they constitute the first immunological barrier 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.850
 not only to viruses and bacteria but also to make your asp or toxin 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.360
 certain poisons of animals and plants 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.360
 thanks to other people who are in them 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.170
 It also protects us from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.170
 thanks to the production of a dark colored pigment called melanin 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.390
 not only protects us from the environment but also does not relate to it 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.090
 thanks to various types of receptors located throughout its surface 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.350
 because they are able to perceive sensations of touch 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.359
 Pressure 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.790
 all these environmental stimuli are not captured by the recipients 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:38.269
 cutaneous which transmit nerve impulses that reach the brain and 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.509
 they inform about the state of the environment that surrounds us 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:45.909
 This information is very useful when making decisions such as 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.059
 remove them from the fire 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.879
 or a nail 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:56.869
 the skin 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:00.299
 also plays an important role in the control of body temperature 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.629
 after an intense exercise 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.319
 the sweat will restrict the surface of the skin so that the heat passes from 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.599
 the innermost regions of the body 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.599
 To the exterior 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.919
 the same nerve orders that activate the sweat glands of 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:21.679
 the skin 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:25.099
 they favor an increase in blood flow that is reflected by their 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.209
 redness 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.969
 and that favors the loss of heat from the blood to the atmosphere 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.109
 The skin also has mechanisms that prevent the loss of heat by decreasing 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.859
 cutaneous circulation in cold situations becoming paler 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.439
 other mechanisms to prevent the loss of body heat are secondary in the 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.009
 shoulder 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:48.439
 but very important in other mammals as they live in populated areas 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.589
 a thick layer of fat and abundant hair are essential in these 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:56.589
 animals to withstand low external temperatures
