the barbell bent over row is a great
exercise<00:00:13.250> for<00:00:13.820> building<00:00:14.090> thickness<00:00:14.780> in<00:00:15.020> width

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620

why<00:00:24.320> I<00:00:24.350> always<00:00:24.650> recommend<00:00:25.279> doing<00:00:25.400> a<00:00:25.669> fair

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
why I always recommend doing a fair

share of both rows and pull downs in

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.120 
share of both rows and pull downs in
every<00:00:29.270> back<00:00:29.480> workout<00:00:29.960> but<00:00:30.560> for<00:00:30.740> some<00:00:30.950> people

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
every back workout but for some people

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.220 
every back workout but for some people
the<00:00:31.730> bent<00:00:31.939> over<00:00:32.060> row<00:00:32.210> can<00:00:32.630> place<00:00:32.840> a<00:00:32.870> lot<00:00:33.200> of

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
the bent over row can place a lot of

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.500 
the bent over row can place a lot of
stress<00:00:33.680> in<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.040> lower<00:00:34.190> back<00:00:34.520> that<00:00:35.210> can<00:00:35.390> be

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
stress in the lower back that can be

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.060 
stress in the lower back that can be
counterproductive<00:00:35.840> if<00:00:36.500> you<00:00:36.650> have<00:00:36.770> lower<00:00:36.980> back

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
counterproductive if you have lower back

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.850 
counterproductive if you have lower back
issues<00:00:37.489> if<00:00:38.150> this<00:00:38.420> is<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.720> case<00:00:38.930> for<00:00:38.960> you<00:00:39.380> then

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
issues if this is the case for you then

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.069 
issues if this is the case for you then
let<00:00:40.070> me<00:00:40.190> recommend<00:00:40.579> a<00:00:40.879> new<00:00:41.059> exercise<00:00:41.629> that<00:00:42.020> I

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
let me recommend a new exercise that I

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.860 
let me recommend a new exercise that I
call<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.949> supported<00:00:43.579> bent<00:00:43.789> over<00:00:43.940> row<00:00:44.270> not

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
call the supported bent over row not

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.660 
call the supported bent over row not
only<00:00:45.109> will<00:00:45.260> this<00:00:45.350> exercise<00:00:45.890> remove<00:00:46.309> stress

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
only will this exercise remove stress

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.790 
only will this exercise remove stress
from<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:46.969> lower<00:00:47.120> back<00:00:47.420> but<00:00:48.230> it<00:00:48.320> can<00:00:48.440> help<00:00:48.590> you

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
from the lower back but it can help you

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.279 
from the lower back but it can help you
place<00:00:49.039> more<00:00:49.340> focus<00:00:49.820> on<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.090> lats<00:00:50.329> when<00:00:50.930> you<00:00:51.079> do

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
place more focus on the lats when you do

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.439 
place more focus on the lats when you do
rows<00:00:51.559> that's<00:00:52.370> why<00:00:52.640> I<00:00:52.670> recommend<00:00:52.969> that

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
rows that's why I recommend that

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.319 
rows that's why I recommend that
everyone<00:00:53.780> gives<00:00:54.170> it<00:00:54.289> a<00:00:54.379> try<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:56.000> do<00:00:56.179> the

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
everyone gives it a try to do the

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.810 
everyone gives it a try to do the
supported<00:00:56.960> bent<00:00:57.199> over<00:00:57.350> row<00:00:57.679> set<00:00:58.280> an<00:00:58.429> incline

from<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.600> lower<00:01:32.840> back<00:01:33.110> but<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:34.189> also<00:01:34.340> makes

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
from the lower back but it also makes

from the lower back but it also makes
the<00:01:34.939> bent-over<00:01:35.270> row<00:01:35.570> a<00:01:35.840> much<00:01:36.229> stricter<00:01:36.619> move

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
the bent-over row a much stricter move

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.179 
the bent-over row a much stricter move
it<00:01:38.270> prevents<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:38.899> from<00:01:38.930> using<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.560> legs<00:01:39.829> and

it prevents you from using the legs and
lower<00:01:40.310> back<00:01:40.430> to<00:01:41.329> get<00:01:41.509> momentum<00:01:41.689> on<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.320> bar<00:01:42.530> it

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
lower back to get momentum on the bar it

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.130 
lower back to get momentum on the bar it
forces<00:01:43.670> your<00:01:43.790> lats<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.390> do<00:01:44.570> all<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.930> work

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
forces your lats to do all the work

throughout the entire range of motion
although<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.770> will<00:01:49.009> limit<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.399> amount<00:01:49.549> of

although this will limit the amount of
way<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:49.939> can<00:01:50.299> use<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:51.200> stricter<00:01:51.680> form<00:01:51.979> will

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
way you can use the stricter form will

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.310 
way you can use the stricter form will
cause<00:01:52.430> you<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.670> use<00:01:52.909> more<00:01:53.240> lap<00:01:53.509> muscle<00:01:53.899> fibers

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
cause you to use more lap muscle fibers

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
cause you to use more lap muscle fibers
which<00:01:55.009> can<00:01:55.250> help<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.670> build<00:01:55.880> greater<00:01:56.390> lat<00:01:56.780> mass

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
which can help to build greater lat mass

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.039 
which can help to build greater lat mass
you<00:01:58.340> can<00:01:58.490> also<00:01:58.700> do<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.149> supported<00:01:59.719> bent<00:01:59.930> over

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
you can also do the supported bent over

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.230 
you can also do the supported bent over
