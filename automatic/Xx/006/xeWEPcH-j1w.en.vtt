00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
this is really quite simple so we're

the top of one of these buildings and

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.090 
the top of one of these buildings and
these<00:00:42.420> are<00:00:42.570> well<00:00:43.350> first<00:00:43.590> sir<00:00:43.710> they're<00:00:43.920> quite

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
these are well first sir they're quite

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.940 
these are well first sir they're quite
studying<00:00:44.520> how<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> screen<00:00:45.120> stereo<00:00:45.950> statues

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
studying how to screen stereo statues

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.959 
studying how to screen stereo statues
but<00:00:47.129> these<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.399> some<00:00:47.520> birds<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.910> are

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
but these are some birds that are

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.479 
but these are some birds that are
they're<00:00:48.300> modeled<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.680> fine<00:00:50.070> detail

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
they're modeled with really fine detail

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.279 
they're modeled with really fine detail
on<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> wings<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.149> whatnot<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> amazing

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
on the wings and whatnot but the amazing

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.229 
on the wings and whatnot but the amazing
thing<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:52.980> toggle<00:00:53.160> off<00:00:53.489> tessellation

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
thing is if we toggle off tessellation

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.600 
thing is if we toggle off tessellation
you<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.350> see<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.530> there's<00:00:55.800> only<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.340> few

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
you can see that there's only a few

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.360 
you can see that there's only a few
polygons<00:00:57.180> representing<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> base<00:00:58.109> mesh<00:00:58.440> and

magnitude<00:01:14.939> more<00:01:15.450> than<00:01:16.110> pci-express<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.189> we

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
magnitude more than pci-express so we

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
magnitude more than pci-express so we
really<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.909> use<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> processing<00:01:18.990> power

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
really have to use the processing power

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.289 
really have to use the processing power
of<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> GPU<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.670> level<00:01:21.119> of

of the GPU to get this level of
geometric<00:01:21.780> fidelity<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.250> fly<00:01:23.460> through

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

the<00:01:23.759> city<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.390> enjoy<00:01:24.659> some<00:01:24.869> more<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.200> the

things to think about is that the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
building this is the kind of capability

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.090 
building this is the kind of capability
that<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:57.990> fermi<00:01:58.260> architecture<00:01:58.710> brings<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.070> us

that the fermi architecture brings to us

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.560 
that the fermi architecture brings to us
and<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.030> kind<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.270> power<00:02:00.450> that

and this is the kind of power that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.630 
and this is the kind of power that

from incredible geometric complexity I

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.830 
from incredible geometric complexity I
thought<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.400> maybe<00:02:14.640> transition<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.390> some

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
thought we maybe transition to some

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.320 
thought we maybe transition to some
volumetric<00:02:16.380> complexity<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:18.030> let's<00:02:18.180> go<00:02:18.300> ahead

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
volumetric complexity so let's go ahead

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.840 
volumetric complexity so let's go ahead
and<00:02:18.480> bring<00:02:18.600> up<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.900> next<00:02:19.110> demo<00:02:19.610> what<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:20.700> have

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
and bring up the next demo what we have

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.460 
and bring up the next demo what we have
here<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.180> couple<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.660> crash<00:02:21.840> test<00:02:22.140> dummies

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
here is a couple of crash test dummies

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.800 
here is a couple of crash test dummies
on<00:02:22.680> they<00:02:23.489> might<00:02:23.910> be<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> little<00:02:24.300> familiar<00:02:24.480> to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
on they might be a little familiar to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.630 
on they might be a little familiar to
some<00:02:24.959> nvidia<00:02:25.530> folk<00:02:25.770> they<00:02:25.950> kind<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.160> represent

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
some nvidia folk they kind of represent

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.660 
some nvidia folk they kind of represent
a<00:02:26.790> some<00:02:27.510> characters<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.020> nvidia<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:29.400> when<00:02:29.580> we

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
a some characters in nvidia so when we

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.010 
a some characters in nvidia so when we
go<00:02:29.790> ahead<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.090> fire<00:02:30.300> up<00:02:30.330> one<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.959> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
go ahead and fire up one of the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.750 
go ahead and fire up one of the
simulations<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.860> what<00:02:32.190> we're<00:02:32.310> doing<00:02:32.520> here<00:02:32.730> is

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
simulations so what we're doing here is

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.150 
simulations so what we're doing here is
a<00:02:32.940> volumetric<00:02:33.360> simulation<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.830> full

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
a volumetric simulation this is a full

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.280 
a volumetric simulation this is a full
3d<00:02:35.520> box<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.090> simulation<00:02:36.660> basically<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
3d box of a simulation basically a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.699 
3d box of a simulation basically a
real-time<00:02:37.860> fluid<00:02:38.340> simulation<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:39.060> smoke<00:02:39.709> and

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
real-time fluid simulation of smoke and

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.680 
real-time fluid simulation of smoke and
then<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.890> can<00:02:41.010> see<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.430> nice<00:02:41.790> rendered

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
then you can see it's a nice rendered

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.270 
then you can see it's a nice rendered
smoke<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.140> other<00:02:43.680> nice<00:02:43.860> thing<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.190> we're

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
smoke the other nice thing that we're

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.070 
smoke the other nice thing that we're
doing<00:02:44.310> here<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.910> ray<00:02:45.330> marching<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.840> do<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
doing here is ray marching to do the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.100 
doing here is ray marching to do the
shadows<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:47.310> fact<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.850> computation<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:48.959> its

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
shadows in fact the computation in its

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.199 
shadows in fact the computation in its
fullest<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.560> about<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.799> million<00:02:50.220> voxels<00:02:50.700> all

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
fullest is about a million voxels all

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.930 
fullest is about a million voxels all
using<00:02:51.750> Buddha<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.620> simulation<00:02:53.220> takes<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.820> new

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
using Buddha the simulation takes a new

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.570 
using Buddha the simulation takes a new
account<00:02:54.180> all<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.630> typical<00:02:54.810> fluid

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
account all the typical fluid

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.630 
account all the typical fluid
simulations<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.230> can<00:02:57.350> see<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.680> crash

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
simulations and you can see the crash

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.770

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
of fighting it off with this fan

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.330 
of fighting it off with this fan
imparting<00:03:02.450> velocity<00:03:03.320> into<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.710> certainly

so<00:03:04.520> Tony<00:03:04.940> what<00:03:05.150> are<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:05.300> benefits<00:03:05.450> if<00:03:05.840> you

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
so Tony what are the benefits if you

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.290 
so Tony what are the benefits if you
didn't<00:03:06.770> come<00:03:06.890> across<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.670> benefit<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.090> using

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
didn't come across the benefit of using

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.540 
didn't come across the benefit of using

at all changes so you can fire up more
or<00:03:19.640> less<00:03:19.790> mode<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.240> can<00:03:20.270> change<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.780> behavior

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200

and again it's all in real time and the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.220 
and again it's all in real time and the
other<00:03:22.970> it's<00:03:23.120> impossible<00:03:23.690> for<00:03:23.840> an<00:03:23.900> artist<00:03:24.170> to

food simulation villa so this that's one

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.590 
food simulation villa so this that's one
example<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.290> really<00:04:18.560> innovative<00:04:18.769> use<00:04:19.190> of

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.080 
class a new class of real-time graphics
experience<00:04:24.800> so<00:04:25.520> let's<00:04:25.669> take<00:04:25.790> a<00:04:25.820> look<00:04:26.030> at

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
experience so let's take a look at

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.730 
experience so let's take a look at
another<00:04:26.300> example<00:04:26.450> of<00:04:27.050> simulation<00:04:27.620> and

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
another example of simulation and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.180 
another example of simulation and
graphics<00:04:28.100> screwed<00:04:29.200> yeah<00:04:30.200> okay<00:04:30.800> clap

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.379 

so<00:04:35.190> what<00:04:35.370> we've<00:04:35.520> done<00:04:35.550> here<00:04:35.669> this<00:04:36.060> is<00:04:36.210> actually

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
so what we've done here this is actually

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.279 
so what we've done here this is actually
three<00:04:36.960> simulations

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
three simulations

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.010 
three simulations
this<00:04:38.680> was<00:04:38.889> actually<00:04:39.430> inspired<00:04:39.939> or<00:04:40.449> maybe<00:04:40.839> an

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
this was actually inspired or maybe an

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.159 
this was actually inspired or maybe an
homage<00:04:41.289> to<00:04:41.499> a<00:04:41.770> demo<00:04:42.369> that<00:04:42.899> instant<00:04:43.899> worth<00:04:44.020> of

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
homage to a demo that instant worth of

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:45.869 
homage to a demo that instant worth of
unfed<00:04:44.589> cuba<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:44.979> folks<00:04:45.189> at<00:04:45.309> stanford<00:04:45.729> did<00:04:45.819> a

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
time we can manipulate it so why don't

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.059 
time we can manipulate it so why don't
we<00:05:24.610> go<00:05:24.759> ahead<00:05:24.849> and<00:05:25.139> maybe<00:05:26.139> grab<00:05:26.469> a<00:05:26.499> boat<00:05:26.800> and

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
we go ahead and maybe grab a boat and

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.570 
we go ahead and maybe grab a boat and
slosh<00:05:27.789> it<00:05:27.819> around<00:05:28.029> in<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.330> water<00:05:29.159> or<00:05:30.159> in<00:05:30.399> the

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
slosh it around in the water or in the

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.760 
slosh it around in the water or in the
water<00:05:30.819> there<00:05:31.449> you<00:05:31.569> go<00:05:31.689> and<00:05:31.930> you<00:05:32.319> can<00:05:32.349> see<00:05:32.559> it

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
water there you go and you can see it

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.799 
water there you go and you can see it
actually<00:05:32.889> it's<00:05:33.490> coupled<00:05:33.909> so<00:05:34.089> it<00:05:34.209> impacts<00:05:34.689> that

00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:34.809 
actually it's coupled so it impacts that

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:36.629 
actually it's coupled so it impacts that
the<00:05:35.020> flow<00:05:35.259> of<00:05:35.289> the<00:05:35.499> water<00:05:35.529> you<00:05:36.309> can<00:05:36.459> put

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
the flow of the water you can put

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.279 
the flow of the water you can put
objects<00:05:36.999> into<00:05:37.209> the<00:05:37.330> ways<00:05:37.479> it'll<00:05:37.839> change<00:05:38.050> that

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
objects into the ways it'll change that

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.589 
objects into the ways it'll change that
the<00:05:38.439> course<00:05:38.680> of<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:38.919> way<00:05:39.039> it's<00:05:39.599> this

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
the course of the way it's this

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.189 
the course of the way it's this
simulation<00:05:41.020> again<00:05:41.499> it's<00:05:42.099> a<00:05:42.309> fully<00:05:42.669> volumetric

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
simulation again it's a fully volumetric

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.589 
simulation again it's a fully volumetric
and<00:05:44.199> from<00:05:44.409> a<00:05:44.879> real-time<00:05:45.879> perspective<00:05:46.360> we<00:05:46.449> can

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
and from a real-time perspective we can

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:47.879 
and from a real-time perspective we can
pan<00:05:46.809> around<00:05:46.839> and<00:05:47.229> look<00:05:47.319> at<00:05:47.409> from<00:05:47.589> different

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
pan around and look at from different

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.889 
pan around and look at from different
lighting<00:05:48.069> angles<00:05:48.459> this<00:05:49.389> is<00:05:49.539> the<00:05:49.659> kind<00:05:49.870> of

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:49.899 
lighting angles this is the kind of

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:51.509 
lighting angles this is the kind of
thing<00:05:49.959> that<00:05:50.139> we<00:05:50.289> would<00:05:50.409> expect<00:05:50.620> to<00:05:50.709> see<00:05:50.919> coming

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:51.519 
thing that we would expect to see coming

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:54.209 
thing that we would expect to see coming
in<00:05:51.669> next<00:05:52.209> generation<00:05:52.870> real-time<00:05:53.499> games<00:05:53.830> for

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
in next generation real-time games for

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.670 
in next generation real-time games for
example<00:05:54.580> it's<00:05:55.059> a<00:05:55.300> completely<00:05:56.110> possible<00:05:56.379> to<00:05:56.620> do

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
example it's a completely possible to do

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.439 
example it's a completely possible to do
this<00:05:56.769> in<00:05:56.919> fact<00:05:57.129> entirely<00:05:57.639> on<00:05:57.729> a<00:05:57.789> single<00:05:58.089> GPU

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
this in fact entirely on a single GPU

00:05:58.449 --> 00:05:59.879 
this in fact entirely on a single GPU
and<00:05:58.719> in<00:05:58.809> fact<00:05:58.930> that's<00:05:59.139> what<00:05:59.229> we're<00:05:59.379> doing<00:05:59.409> here

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
and in fact that's what we're doing here

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.150 
and in fact that's what we're doing here
we're<00:06:00.550> using

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
we're using

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.470 
we're using
the<00:06:01.250> GPU<00:06:01.580> to<00:06:01.640> drive<00:06:01.820> the<00:06:01.940> entire<00:06:02.060> simulation

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
the GPU to drive the entire simulation

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.110 
the GPU to drive the entire simulation
so<00:06:03.140> this<00:06:03.620> is<00:06:03.650> a<00:06:03.800> practical<00:06:04.490> thing<00:06:04.520> probably<00:06:04.940> in

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
so this is a practical thing probably in

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.490 
so this is a practical thing probably in
the<00:06:05.210> not-too-distant<00:06:05.630> future<00:06:05.930> for<00:06:06.350> real

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
the not-too-distant future for real

plant<00:06:06.740> class<00:06:06.950> games<00:06:07.570> yeah<00:06:08.570> this<00:06:08.750> to<00:06:09.320> put<00:06:09.530> this

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
plant class games yeah this to put this

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.190 
plant class games yeah this to put this
in<00:06:09.800> comparison<00:06:10.400> the<00:06:10.850> simulations<00:06:11.510> that<00:06:11.780> the

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
in comparison the simulations that the

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.460 
in comparison the simulations that the
Fed<00:06:12.680> cube<00:06:12.920> White<00:06:13.130> House<00:06:13.310> down<00:06:14.050> took<00:06:15.050> about

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
Fed cube White House down took about

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.100 
Fed cube White House down took about
three<00:06:15.920> minutes<00:06:16.100> per<00:06:16.490> frame<00:06:16.790> on<00:06:17.330> a<00:06:17.390> rack<00:06:17.780> of

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
three minutes per frame on a rack of

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.350 
three minutes per frame on a rack of
four<00:06:18.440> core<00:06:18.710> opteron<00:06:18.920> and<00:06:19.550> we're<00:06:20.000> running<00:06:20.240> this

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
four core opteron and we're running this

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.300 
four core opteron and we're running this
in<00:06:20.570> real<00:06:20.750> time<00:06:21.050> in<00:06:21.350> stereo<00:06:21.830> so<00:06:22.070> we're<00:06:22.190> about

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
in real time in stereo so we're about

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.670 
in real time in stereo so we're about
five<00:06:22.700> thousand<00:06:23.330> times<00:06:23.600> faster<00:06:23.720> now<00:06:24.200> we're<00:06:24.590> not

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
five thousand times faster now we're not

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.020 
five thousand times faster now we're not
doing<00:06:24.950> exactly<00:06:25.250> the<00:06:25.520> same<00:06:25.550> kind<00:06:25.940> of

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
doing exactly the same kind of

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.580 
doing exactly the same kind of
simulation<00:06:26.420> but<00:06:26.630> in<00:06:26.750> terms<00:06:26.930> of<00:06:27.080> you<00:06:27.530> know

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
simulation but in terms of you know

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.050 
simulation but in terms of you know
interesting<00:06:27.860> approximation<00:06:28.550> that's<00:06:28.880> a

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
interesting approximation that's a

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.790 
interesting approximation that's a
that's<00:06:29.570> pretty<00:06:29.840> good<00:06:29.930> Scott<00:06:30.200> so<00:06:30.620> these<00:06:30.740> are

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
that's pretty good Scott so these are

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.170 
that's pretty good Scott so these are
these<00:06:31.100> are<00:06:31.160> all<00:06:31.340> tech<00:06:31.550> demos<00:06:31.850> but<00:06:32.000> in<00:06:32.120> the

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
these are all tech demos but in the

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.640 
these are all tech demos but in the
final<00:06:32.330> analysis<00:06:32.870> mean<00:06:33.110> the<00:06:33.170> algorithms<00:06:33.590> you

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
final analysis mean the algorithms you

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.890 
final analysis mean the algorithms you
guess<00:06:33.800> because<00:06:34.190> they're<00:06:34.370> using<00:06:34.730> to<00:06:34.900> simulate

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
guess because they're using to simulate

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.650 
guess because they're using to simulate
physics<00:06:36.410> here<00:06:36.680> is<00:06:37.150> basically<00:06:38.150> the<00:06:38.540> same

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
physics here is basically the same

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.420 
physics here is basically the same
algorithms<00:06:39.170> that<00:06:39.200> science<00:06:39.740> has<00:06:39.770> been<00:06:40.040> used<00:06:40.220> to

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
algorithms that science has been used to

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.000 
algorithms that science has been used to
or<00:06:40.850> engineers<00:06:41.780> would<00:06:41.930> use<00:06:42.140> to<00:06:42.320> simulate

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
or engineers would use to simulate

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.480 
or engineers would use to simulate
whatever<00:06:43.730> physical<00:06:44.240> world<00:06:44.750> at<00:06:44.930> their<00:06:45.020> point

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
whatever physical world at their point

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.890 
whatever physical world at their point
that's<00:06:46.490> exactly<00:06:46.850> right<00:06:47.000> it's<00:06:47.180> just<00:06:47.360> you<00:06:47.780> would

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
that's exactly right it's just you would

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.210 
that's exactly right it's just you would
just<00:06:48.020> crank<00:06:48.530> them<00:06:48.650> up<00:06:48.770> to<00:06:48.920> the<00:06:49.010> next<00:06:49.160> level

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.220 
just crank them up to the next level

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.580 
just crank them up to the next level
fidelity<00:06:49.850> use<00:06:50.150> more<00:06:50.390> precision<00:06:50.750> use<00:06:51.050> more

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
fidelity use more precision use more

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.830 
fidelity use more precision use more
particles<00:06:51.920> or<00:06:52.280> a<00:06:52.580> higher<00:06:53.120> resolution<00:06:53.330> grid

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
particles or a higher resolution grid

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.150 
particles or a higher resolution grid
that<00:06:54.050> kind<00:06:54.230> of<00:06:54.260> thing<00:06:54.410> that's<00:06:54.650> exactly<00:06:55.010> right

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 
that kind of thing that's exactly right

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.370 
that kind of thing that's exactly right
so<00:06:55.430> last<00:06:55.610> year<00:06:55.790> last<00:06:56.600> year<00:06:56.750> the<00:06:57.020> smoke<00:06:57.260> down
