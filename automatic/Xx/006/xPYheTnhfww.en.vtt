steering drop arm a couple of times to

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.920

make two three loops while three is

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.330 
make two three loops while three is
ideal<00:02:27.670> use<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.850> induction<00:02:29.090> heater<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.920> warm

up the drop arm puller you don't need it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.730 
up the drop arm puller you don't need it
read<00:02:34.880> up<00:02:35.060> because<00:02:35.300> red-hot<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.930> too<00:02:36.230> hot<00:02:36.440> just

read up because red-hot is too hot just

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.520 
read up because red-hot is too hot just
warming<00:02:37.460> up<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.000> expands<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.260> makes

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
warming up so it expands and it makes

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
the release easier if the drop arm

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.950 
the release easier if the drop arm
puller<00:02:44.780> is<00:02:45.230> tight<00:02:45.760> for<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.880> arm<00:02:47.210> drop<00:02:47.660> arm<00:02:47.870> is

puller is tight for the arm drop arm is

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.590 
puller is tight for the arm drop arm is
tight<00:02:48.520> more<00:02:49.520> reffered

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
tight more reffered

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.290

it<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.350> possible<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:51.860> remove<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.640> four<00:02:52.850> screw

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
it is possible to remove the four screw

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.990 
it is possible to remove the four screw
and<00:02:53.690> put<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.260> sidekick<00:02:54.709> amount<00:02:55.010> 1500
