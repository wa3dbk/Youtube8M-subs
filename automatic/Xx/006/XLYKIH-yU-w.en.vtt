00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
because this is gonna come out to be

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.230 
because this is gonna come out to be
probably<00:02:53.290> 2<00:02:53.620> ounces<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.670> know<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:55.000> this

fits six ounces so you would need to

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.550 
fits six ounces so you would need to
triple<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.360> recipe<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.840> order<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.170> fit<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.440> in

in<00:04:58.560> here<00:04:59.210> but<00:05:00.210> it<00:05:00.540> is<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.720> good<00:05:00.960> way<00:05:01.140> to<00:05:01.169> try<00:05:01.470> it

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
in here but it is a good way to try it

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.180 
in here but it is a good way to try it
out<00:05:01.770> so<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:05.150> love<00:05:06.150> this<00:05:06.330> white<00:05:07.190> liquidy

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
out so I love this white liquidy

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.750 
out so I love this white liquidy
consistency<00:05:09.740> shake<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:10.860> up<00:05:10.979> a<00:05:11.100> little<00:05:11.160> bit<00:05:11.490> if

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
consistency shake it up a little bit if

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.230 
consistency shake it up a little bit if
you<00:05:11.790> want<00:05:11.910> to<00:05:12.479> but<00:05:12.900> that<00:05:13.140> is<00:05:13.590> basically<00:05:14.430> the

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
you want to but that is basically the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.020 
you want to but that is basically the
mixture<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.169> I<00:05:16.979> think<00:05:17.160> I'm<00:05:17.250> gonna<00:05:17.370> do<00:05:17.610> one

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
mixture and I think I'm gonna do one

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.700 
mixture and I think I'm gonna do one
more<00:05:18.210> round<00:05:18.390> of<00:05:18.600> this<00:05:18.780> so<00:05:19.140> I'll<00:05:19.260> be<00:05:19.380> right<00:05:19.500> back

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
more round of this so I'll be right back

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:31.870 
more round of this so I'll be right back
and<00:05:20.010> it<00:05:20.160> should<00:05:20.340> be<00:05:20.370> about<00:05:20.640> there<00:05:21.330> so<00:05:21.360> once

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.150 

so<00:05:32.930> now<00:05:33.930> it's<00:05:34.170> just<00:05:34.350> a<00:05:34.470> little<00:05:34.680> bit<00:05:34.950> higher

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
so now it's just a little bit higher

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.430 
so now it's just a little bit higher
which<00:05:35.520> is<00:05:35.700> good<00:05:35.910> because<00:05:36.090> two<00:05:36.840> ounces<00:05:37.200> is<00:05:37.410> a

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
which is good because two ounces is a

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.340 
which is good because two ounces is a
little<00:05:37.800> too<00:05:38.010> small<00:05:38.720> for<00:05:39.720> this<00:05:39.900> kind<00:05:40.169> of<00:05:40.230> a

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
little too small for this kind of a

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.620 
little too small for this kind of a
container<00:05:40.770> but<00:05:41.669> that<00:05:41.880> is<00:05:42.000> how<00:05:42.150> you<00:05:42.210> can<00:05:42.450> make

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
container but that is how you can make

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.500 
container but that is how you can make
it<00:05:42.660> and<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.650> use<00:05:43.800> this<00:05:44.070> I<00:05:44.280> suggest<00:05:44.760> you<00:05:45.120> massage

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
it and to use this I suggest you massage

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.110 
it and to use this I suggest you massage
it<00:05:45.780> into<00:05:46.020> your<00:05:46.139> damp<00:05:46.560> skin<00:05:46.919> and<00:05:47.220> let<00:05:47.700> it<00:05:47.820> sit

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
it into your damp skin and let it sit

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.700 
it into your damp skin and let it sit
