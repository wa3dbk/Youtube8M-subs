notes and then there's like an open
hi-hat<00:00:47.600> at<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.559> end<00:00:48.710> of<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.860> phrase<00:00:49.129> goes

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
boom boom boom boom dah so you actually

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.280 
boom boom boom boom dah so you actually
have<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.149> switch<00:00:53.420> which<00:00:53.629> hand<00:00:53.839> is<00:00:53.960> hitting<00:00:54.199> the

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
have to switch which hand is hitting the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.810 
have to switch which hand is hitting the
snare<00:00:54.500> halfway<00:00:54.890> through<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.159> beat<00:00:55.309> when<00:00:55.699> we

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
snare halfway through the beat when we

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.979 
snare halfway through the beat when we
were<00:00:55.879> touring<00:00:56.089> on<00:00:56.329> it<00:00:56.420> actually<00:00:56.540> started

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
were touring on it actually started

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.399 
were touring on it actually started
adding<00:00:57.170> in<00:00:57.409> a<00:00:57.559> bell<00:00:58.809> every<00:00:59.809> other<00:00:59.930> eighth<00:01:00.170> note

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
adding in a bell every other eighth note

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:01.930 
adding in a bell every other eighth note
so<00:01:00.920> it's<00:01:01.070> actually<00:01:01.190> turned<00:01:01.460> into<00:01:01.579> a<00:01:01.699> really

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
so it's actually turned into a really

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.969 
so it's actually turned into a really
intricate<00:01:02.300> drum<00:01:02.659> part<00:01:08.440> then<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.560> chorus<00:01:09.860> is

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
intricate drum part then the chorus is

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.320 
intricate drum part then the chorus is
actually<00:01:10.250> much<00:01:10.460> easier<00:01:10.490> than<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.940> verse<00:01:11.090> it's

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
actually much easier than the verse it's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.669 
actually much easier than the verse it's
just<00:01:11.509> a<00:01:11.600> pretty<00:01:11.750> straightforward<00:01:11.990> sixteenth

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
just a pretty straightforward sixteenth

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.279 
just a pretty straightforward sixteenth
note<00:01:12.890> I<00:01:13.100> had<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.660> snares<00:01:14.660> just<00:01:14.899> on<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.110> twos

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
note I had the snares just on the twos

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.169 
note I had the snares just on the twos
and<00:01:15.440> fours<00:01:15.619> really<00:01:16.429> trying<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.700> lay<00:01:16.789> back<00:01:16.940> into

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
and fours really trying to lay back into

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:24.430 
and fours really trying to lay back into
the<00:01:17.270> pocket<00:01:17.600> as<00:01:17.690> much<00:01:17.810> as<00:01:17.960> possible<00:01:23.440> the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
the pocket as much as possible the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.649 
the pocket as much as possible the
bridge<00:01:24.710> is<00:01:24.979> a<00:01:25.009> total<00:01:25.490> breakdown<00:01:25.700> with<00:01:26.240> where

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
bridge is a total breakdown with where

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.779 
bridge is a total breakdown with where
we<00:01:26.750> actually<00:01:26.869> it<00:01:27.649> kind<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:27.920> evolved<00:01:28.369> in<00:01:28.550> a<00:01:28.640> live

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
we actually it kind of evolved in a live

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.320 
we actually it kind of evolved in a live
setting<00:01:29.619> we<00:01:30.619> expand<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.399> whereas<00:01:32.149> on<00:01:32.270> the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
setting we expand it whereas on the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.510 
setting we expand it whereas on the
record<00:01:32.600> it's<00:01:32.720> kind<00:01:32.869> of<00:01:32.929> a<00:01:33.020> short<00:01:33.229> thing<00:01:33.520> when

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520
