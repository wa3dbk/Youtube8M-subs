00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.670
 what wave says latin america again 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.150
 I am kike and there are many people who are 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.210
 asking how to do the flex and today they 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.040
 I will teach how to do it ready the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.820
 Strapping is a very important movement 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.460
 for your break dancing or live in the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.230
 first step is therefore when I do 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:41.870
 the power me then half for here 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:44.270
 the left leg goes here on its side and 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.750
 to the left hand also goes in the 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.840
 floor and let's kick the leg 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:55.060
 left 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:01.140
 back and opposite and the right leg goes 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.140
 to push off the ground for example here 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:13.190
 and the two legs go opposite like a 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:16.840
 and as I told you the most important thing 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:21.630
 it's the waist because we're going to upload it 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.630
 when we are in front again 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.720
 when we arrive in front of both hands 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.910
 they're here 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:37.900
 on the side the left leg we 're going 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:40.810
 to climb close to the face like that the leg 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.350
 so the left hand first we're going 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.380
 to climb and the left leg right 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.409
 forgiveness goes 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.920
 A) Yes 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:55.700
 we need fields for the hand 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.530
 left to put it on the ground another 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.230
 once for example 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:08.870
 so when we want to go in front 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.160
 the right hand we raise it and the 

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:14.660
 left leg 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.620
 you know here and opposite again and 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.620
 also the right leg 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:26.189
 I understand that 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:30.540
 as I have long legs and how they 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:34.200
 I said it is very important to have the waist 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.500
 very high in front so that there is field 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.480
 for the legs to go to the side and 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.400
 also back and go back to the front 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.530
 friends that's all 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.549
 practice it and also subscribe the 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.549
