00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
single jointed elbow kind of hard to

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.880 
single jointed elbow kind of hard to
move<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:34.740> big<00:03:34.980> guy<00:03:35.130> around<00:03:39.500> doesn't<00:03:40.500> see<00:03:40.770> him

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
a swivel on the wrist like I thought it

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.000 
a swivel on the wrist like I thought it
did<00:03:45.390> if<00:03:45.570> it<00:03:45.660> does<00:03:45.900> mine's<00:03:46.290> definitely<00:03:46.560> kind<00:03:46.920> of

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
did if it does mine's definitely kind of

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.970 
did if it does mine's definitely kind of
locked<00:03:47.220> up<00:03:47.460> but<00:03:48.260> he<00:03:49.260> does<00:03:49.440> have<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.710> back<00:03:49.950> and

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
locked up but he does have a back and
