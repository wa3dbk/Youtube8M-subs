of<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.709> airplane<00:03:44.829> that<00:03:45.370> you're<00:03:45.489> trying<00:03:45.849> to

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
of the airplane that you're trying to

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.229 
of the airplane that you're trying to
shoot<00:03:46.180> at<00:03:46.389> and<00:03:46.629> you<00:03:47.469> use<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:48.400> one<00:03:48.639> or<00:03:48.969> the<00:03:49.030> two

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
shoot at and you use the one or the two

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.979 
shoot at and you use the one or the two
or<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.959> three<00:03:49.989> as<00:03:50.560> your<00:03:50.829> rear<00:03:51.040> aiming<00:03:51.459> point

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
or the three as your rear aiming point

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.750 
or the three as your rear aiming point
based<00:03:52.989> on<00:03:53.200> your<00:03:53.680> estimate<00:03:54.219> of<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.459> speed<00:03:54.579> of

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
based on your estimate of the speed of

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.280 
based on your estimate of the speed of
the<00:03:55.090> airplane<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:57.540> then<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.689> fire<00:03:58.930> off<00:03:59.109> your

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
the airplane and then you fire off your

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.459 
the airplane and then you fire off your
round<00:03:59.879> and<00:04:00.879> hopefully<00:04:01.419> if<00:04:01.930> you're<00:04:02.079> a<00:04:02.139> really

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:02.469 
round and hopefully if you're a really

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:03.960 
round and hopefully if you're a really
really<00:04:02.680> good<00:04:02.859> shot<00:04:03.129> maybe<00:04:03.370> you<00:04:03.579> hit<00:04:03.819> this

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
really good shot maybe you hit this

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.759 
really good shot maybe you hit this
airplane<00:04:04.449> that's<00:04:04.629> flying<00:04:04.930> but<00:04:05.199> past<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.650> at

airplane that's flying but past you at
300<00:04:06.190> knots<00:04:07.440> if<00:04:08.440> you've<00:04:08.620> got<00:04:08.829> several<00:04:09.280> hundred

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
300 knots if you've got several hundred

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.280 
300 knots if you've got several hundred
people<00:04:09.729> doing<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.329> maybe<00:04:10.629> one<00:04:10.930> or<00:04:11.049> two<00:04:11.169> of

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
people doing that maybe one or two of

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.819 
people doing that maybe one or two of
them<00:04:11.409> will<00:04:11.530> actually<00:04:11.560> hit<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.129> airplane

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
them will actually hit the airplane

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.699 
them will actually hit the airplane

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
kind of awkward because the ank that gun

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.420
