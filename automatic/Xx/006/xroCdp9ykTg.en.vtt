let's<00:02:03.090> use<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.120> lot<00:02:04.330> of<00:02:04.360> interesting<00:02:04.750> parts<00:02:05.050> in

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
let's use a lot of interesting parts in

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.870 
let's use a lot of interesting parts in
it<00:02:05.320> so<00:02:05.470> that<00:02:05.620> people<00:02:05.800> can<00:02:06.040> manipulate<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.730> or

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
it so that people can manipulate it or

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.240 
it so that people can manipulate it or
we<00:02:07.030> can<00:02:07.210> change<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.690> why<00:02:08.679> don't<00:02:08.800> we<00:02:08.890> bring<00:02:09.039> back

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
we can change it why don't we bring back

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.979 
we can change it why don't we bring back
Blood<00:02:09.759> Gulch<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.209> carve<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.599> all<00:02:10.720> up<00:02:10.869> into

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
Blood Gulch and carve it all up into

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.800 
Blood Gulch and carve it all up into
pieces<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:11.950> people<00:02:12.550> can<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.540> start

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
pieces so that people can and start

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.839 
pieces so that people can and start
manipulating<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.650> interesting<00:02:15.370> ways<00:02:15.550> and

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
manipulating it and interesting ways and

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.140 
manipulating it and interesting ways and
then<00:02:16.629> sanctuary<00:02:17.409> was<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.739> other<00:02:17.860> one<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
then sanctuary was the other one the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.550 
then sanctuary was the other one the
cage<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.560> Paradiso<00:02:21.780> that's<00:02:22.780> just<00:02:23.050> Chad<00:02:23.349> and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
cage and Paradiso that's just Chad and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.259 
cage and Paradiso that's just Chad and
I'm<00:02:23.650> playing<00:02:24.220> with<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.400> map<00:02:24.640> editor<00:02:25.030> and

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
I'm playing with a map editor and

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.080 
I'm playing with a map editor and
actually<00:02:25.659> building<00:02:26.080> cool<00:02:26.800> maps<00:02:27.159> within<00:02:27.670> forge

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
actually building cool maps within forge

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.940 
actually building cool maps within forge
world<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.569> mean

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
world I mean

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.130 
world I mean
doing<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.310> exactly<00:02:29.910> how<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.510> fans<00:02:30.810> would<00:02:31.020> do

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
doing that exactly how the fans would do

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.520 
doing that exactly how the fans would do
it<00:02:32.599> we<00:02:33.599> definitely<00:02:33.930> looked<00:02:34.050> at<00:02:34.170> what<00:02:34.319> we<00:02:34.410> did

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
it we definitely looked at what we did

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.380 
it we definitely looked at what we did
in<00:02:34.590> Halo<00:02:34.800> 3<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:35.160> said<00:02:35.910> what<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.209> we<00:02:36.239> learn

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
in Halo 3 and said what can we learn

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.990 
in Halo 3 and said what can we learn
from<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:37.590> one<00:02:37.800> thing<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.069> build<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.730> a

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
from this it's one thing to build just a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.809 
from this it's one thing to build just a
stunning<00:02:39.780> amount<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:40.200> map<00:02:40.349> variants<00:02:40.800> but<00:02:41.190> like

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
stunning amount of map variants but like

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.880 
stunning amount of map variants but like
nobody<00:02:42.569> was<00:02:42.720> expecting<00:02:42.840> for<00:02:43.470> George<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.830> don't

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
nobody was expecting for George I don't

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.180 
nobody was expecting for George I don't
think<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.640> was<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.090> completely<00:02:45.450> whoa

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
think like I was just a completely whoa

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.610 
think like I was just a completely whoa
what<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:48.360> Rube<00:02:48.510> Goldberg<00:02:48.750> machines<00:02:49.349> yeah

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
what the Rube Goldberg machines yeah

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.710 
what the Rube Goldberg machines yeah
those<00:02:49.890> are<00:02:50.069> everywhere<00:02:52.849> in<00:02:53.849> Halo<00:02:54.060> 3<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.540> was

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
those are everywhere in Halo 3 it was

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.390 
those are everywhere in Halo 3 it was
cool<00:02:55.049> that<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.410> can<00:02:55.560> move<00:02:55.680> things<00:02:55.860> around<00:02:56.160> but

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
cool that you can move things around but

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.059 
cool that you can move things around but
it<00:02:56.519> was<00:02:56.610> still<00:02:56.819> kind<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.150> clunky<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:58.230> we're

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
it was still kind of clunky and we're

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.210 
it was still kind of clunky and we're
like<00:02:59.220> we<00:03:00.090> have<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.420> make<00:03:00.569> this<00:03:00.750> better<00:03:01.220> what

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
like we have to make this better what

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.050 
like we have to make this better what
are<00:03:02.340> some<00:03:02.459> of<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.580> tricks<00:03:02.819> that<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
are some of the tricks that the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.809 
are some of the tricks that the
community<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.480> using<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.340> how<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.400> we<00:03:05.670> make

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
community is using and how can we make

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.400 
community is using and how can we make
those<00:03:05.970> not<00:03:06.239> be<00:03:06.390> tricks<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.989> just<00:03:07.140> make<00:03:07.290> those

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
those not be tricks and just make those

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.870 
those not be tricks and just make those
be<00:03:07.590> tools<00:03:08.239> we<00:03:09.239> we<00:03:09.720> took<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.260> stuff<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.980> made

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
be tools we we took that stuff and made

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.640 
be tools we we took that stuff and made
it<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.209> real<00:03:12.450> feature<00:03:12.720> there's<00:03:13.230> normal

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
it like a real feature there's normal

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.400 
it like a real feature there's normal
phased<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.400> fixed<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.329> normal<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.840> like<00:03:16.200> Halo

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
phased and fixed so normal is like Halo

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.140 
phased and fixed so normal is like Halo
3<00:03:16.650> style<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:17.190> know<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.370> bumps<00:03:17.640> into<00:03:17.700> stuff<00:03:18.060> and

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
3 style you know it bumps into stuff and

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.880 
3 style you know it bumps into stuff and
you<00:03:18.269> let<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.510> go<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.900> falls<00:03:19.170> on<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:19.380> ground<00:03:19.470> and

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
you let it go it falls on the ground and

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.059 
you let it go it falls on the ground and
moves<00:03:20.280> around<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.640> stuff<00:03:20.810> fixed<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.860> same

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
moves around and stuff fixed is the same

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.920 
moves around and stuff fixed is the same
thing<00:03:23.310> except<00:03:23.819> when<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.060> let<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.299> go<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.690> stays

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
thing except when you let it go it stays

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.890 
thing except when you let it go it stays
exactly<00:03:25.230> where<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.739> was<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.730> then<00:03:27.030> phase<00:03:27.480> is

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
exactly where it was and then phase is

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.680 
exactly where it was and then phase is
the<00:03:28.200> coolest<00:03:28.560> because<00:03:29.519> it<00:03:29.910> means<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.269> while

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
the coolest because it means that while

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.850 
the coolest because it means that while
you're<00:03:30.840> editing<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.110> object<00:03:31.500> it's<00:03:31.680> not

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
you're editing the object it's not

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.900 
you're editing the object it's not
actually<00:03:32.280> reacting<00:03:32.549> with<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.670> environment

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
actually reacting with the environment

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.569 
actually reacting with the environment
you<00:03:33.810> can<00:03:33.959> put<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.319> through<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.769> wall<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.430> can

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
you can put it through a wall you can

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.629 
you can put it through a wall you can
put<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.569> know<00:03:36.600> through<00:03:36.959> other<00:03:37.079> objects

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
put it you know through other objects

good for object placement because like

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.710

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
directly to three other blocks you can

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.050 
directly to three other blocks you can
select<00:04:13.470> individual<00:04:14.010> objects<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.609> say<00:04:14.760> get
