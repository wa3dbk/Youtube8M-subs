and<00:05:35.520> New<00:05:36.510> World<00:05:36.540> Series<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.350> year<00:05:37.530> after<00:05:37.740> and

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
and New World Series the year after and

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.950 
and New World Series the year after and
I<00:05:38.160> think<00:05:38.430> we<00:05:38.940> got<00:05:38.970> a<00:05:39.120> taste<00:05:39.420> of<00:05:39.510> it<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.750> first

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
I think we got a taste of it the first

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.160 
I think we got a taste of it the first
year<00:05:40.170> the<00:05:40.290> second<00:05:40.650> year<00:05:40.680> we<00:05:41.450> we<00:05:42.450> obviously

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
year the second year we we obviously

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.990 
year the second year we we obviously
contracted<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.190> then<00:05:44.310> the<00:05:44.400> third<00:05:44.580> year<00:05:44.790> once

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
contracted and then the third year once

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.740 
contracted and then the third year once
we<00:05:45.150> had<00:05:45.300> lost<00:05:45.570> their<00:05:45.840> it<00:05:46.470> wasn't<00:05:47.750> successful

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
we had lost their it wasn't successful

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.750 
we had lost their it wasn't successful
but<00:05:48.870> we<00:05:49.020> got<00:05:49.200> some<00:05:49.440> decent<00:05:49.830> results<00:05:50.550> and

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
but we got some decent results and

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.240 
but we got some decent results and
towards<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.210> end<00:05:51.270> of<00:05:51.570> that<00:05:52.230> season<00:05:52.590> I<00:05:52.950> felt

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
towards the end of that season I felt

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.200 
towards the end of that season I felt
like<00:05:53.430> we<00:05:54.210> could<00:05:54.480> go<00:05:55.110> to<00:05:55.170> a<00:05:55.260> racetrack<00:05:55.560> and<00:05:56.010> be

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
like we could go to a racetrack and be

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.940 
like we could go to a racetrack and be
competitive<00:05:57.210> on<00:05:57.660> some<00:05:58.230> nights<00:05:58.500> not<00:05:58.620> every

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
competitive on some nights not every

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.520 
competitive on some nights not every
night<00:05:59.070> but<00:05:59.130> sometimes<00:05:59.870> do<00:06:00.870> you<00:06:00.930> relate<00:06:01.230> to<00:06:01.410> the

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
night but sometimes do you relate to the

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.990 
night but sometimes do you relate to the
struggles<00:06:01.950> are<00:06:02.100> some<00:06:02.220> of<00:06:02.310> these<00:06:02.370> kids<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.820> be

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
struggles are some of these kids that be

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.640 
struggles are some of these kids that be
having<00:06:03.270> that<00:06:03.390> sort<00:06:03.510> of<00:06:03.660> you<00:06:04.110> know<00:06:04.140> roll<00:06:04.440> down

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
having that sort of you know roll down

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.630 
having that sort of you know roll down
to<00:06:04.740> this<00:06:04.830> place<00:06:05.040> where<00:06:05.220> it's<00:06:05.340> just<00:06:05.520> so

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
to this place where it's just so

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.790 
to this place where it's just so
brutally<00:06:06.180> competitive<00:06:06.440> almost<00:06:07.440> definitely

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
brutally competitive almost definitely

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.160 
brutally competitive almost definitely
it's<00:06:08.150> parramatta<00:06:09.150> I<00:06:09.390> think<00:06:09.780> our<00:06:09.960> sydney

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
it's parramatta I think our sydney

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.080 
it's parramatta I think our sydney
speedway<00:06:10.650> at<00:06:11.100> the<00:06:11.250> moment<00:06:11.640> is<00:06:11.900> the<00:06:12.900> toughest

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
speedway at the moment is the toughest

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.540 
speedway at the moment is the toughest
racing<00:06:15.090> in<00:06:15.330> the<00:06:15.390> country<00:06:16.020> apart<00:06:16.650> from<00:06:17.130> maybe

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
racing in the country apart from maybe

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.020 
racing in the country apart from maybe
the<00:06:17.730> classic<00:06:18.180> or<00:06:18.330> somewhere<00:06:18.660> like<00:06:18.690> that<00:06:20.030> and

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
the classic or somewhere like that and

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.210 
the classic or somewhere like that and
I've<00:06:21.210> been<00:06:21.420> there<00:06:21.480> I've<00:06:21.720> been<00:06:22.110> to<00:06:22.620> I<00:06:22.650> went<00:06:23.100> to

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
I've been there I've been to I went to

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.170 
I've been there I've been to I went to
many<00:06:23.400> of<00:06:23.580> all<00:06:23.760> Syrian<00:06:24.060> races<00:06:24.420> and<00:06:24.570> didn't<00:06:24.780> make

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
many of all Syrian races and didn't make

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.029 
many of all Syrian races and didn't make
to<00:06:25.600> watch<00:06:25.750> your<00:06:25.900> feature<00:06:26.110> races<00:06:26.410> then<00:06:26.710> you<00:06:26.830> get

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
to watch your feature races then you get

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.040 
to watch your feature races then you get
it's<00:06:27.310> disappointing<00:06:27.699> and<00:06:28.330> it<00:06:28.449> almost

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
it's disappointing and it almost

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.920 
it's disappointing and it almost
heartbreaking<00:06:29.880> when<00:06:30.880> you<00:06:30.940> down<00:06:31.570> there<00:06:31.750> to<00:06:31.840> do

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
heartbreaking when you down there to do

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.129 
heartbreaking when you down there to do
a<00:06:31.960> race<00:06:32.199> and<00:06:32.410> you<00:06:32.470> have<00:06:32.620> to<00:06:32.770> watch<00:06:32.979> them<00:06:33.250> but

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
a race and you have to watch them but

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:37.860 
a race and you have to watch them but
you've<00:06:35.139> got<00:06:35.380> to<00:06:35.410> keep<00:06:36.539> soldiering<00:06:37.539> along

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
you've got to keep soldiering along

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.860 
you've got to keep soldiering along
pretty<00:06:38.139> margin<00:06:38.800> and<00:06:39.090> if<00:06:40.090> you<00:06:40.270> really<00:06:40.479> want<00:06:40.810> to

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
pretty margin and if you really want to

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.950 
pretty margin and if you really want to
do<00:06:41.020> it<00:06:41.199> then<00:06:41.789> keep<00:06:42.789> going<00:06:43.030> and<00:06:43.300> I'm<00:06:43.539> sure

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
do it then keep going and I'm sure

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.890 
do it then keep going and I'm sure
eventually<00:06:44.229> after<00:06:45.190> you've<00:06:45.520> done<00:06:45.669> you

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
eventually after you've done you

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.999 
eventually after you've done you
apprenticeship<00:06:46.900> as<00:06:47.020> such<00:06:47.259> in<00:06:47.440> a<00:06:47.530> sprint<00:06:47.800> car

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.009 
apprenticeship as such in a sprint car

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.240 
apprenticeship as such in a sprint car
then<00:06:48.490> you<00:06:48.610> start<00:06:48.850> making<00:06:48.880> the<00:06:49.240> shows<00:06:49.449> and<00:06:49.690> it

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
then you start making the shows and it

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.980 
then you start making the shows and it
wasn't<00:06:51.250> see<00:06:51.430> where<00:06:52.120> does<00:06:52.270> this<00:06:52.330> racing<00:06:52.810> thing

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:52.990 
wasn't see where does this racing thing

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.320 
wasn't see where does this racing thing
come<00:06:53.199> from<00:06:53.229> in<00:06:53.530> your<00:06:53.650> in<00:06:53.860> your<00:06:53.889> family<00:06:54.400> ah<00:06:54.550> yeah

obviously<00:06:55.630> my<00:06:56.039> my<00:06:57.039> dad<00:06:57.280> raised<00:06:57.610> me<00:06:57.729> just<00:06:58.030> back

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.150 
obviously my my dad raised me just back

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.810 
obviously my my dad raised me just back
in<00:06:58.300> the<00:06:58.509> early<00:06:58.780> 80s<00:06:58.990> in<00:06:59.740> Darwin<00:07:00.400> and<00:07:02.639> me<00:07:03.639> just

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 
in the early 80s in Darwin and me just

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.760 
in the early 80s in Darwin and me just
back<00:07:04.240> then<00:07:04.479> we<00:07:04.599> were<00:07:04.690> obviously<00:07:04.840> a<00:07:05.110> very<00:07:05.590> low

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
back then we were obviously a very low

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.969 
back then we were obviously a very low
budget<00:07:06.190> deal<00:07:06.400> um<00:07:07.330> he<00:07:08.020> was<00:07:08.199> obviously<00:07:08.590> in<00:07:08.830> that

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979 
budget deal um he was obviously in that

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:10.560 
budget deal um he was obviously in that
much<00:07:09.160> of<00:07:09.190> a<00:07:09.400> focus<00:07:09.580> so<00:07:09.849> he<00:07:09.970> raced<00:07:10.210> while<00:07:10.449> he

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570 
much of a focus so he raced while he

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.969 
much of a focus so he raced while he
could<00:07:10.780> and<00:07:10.960> then<00:07:11.020> gave<00:07:11.229> it<00:07:11.259> up<00:07:11.500> for<00:07:11.530> a<00:07:11.770> few

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:11.979 
could and then gave it up for a few

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:14.580 
could and then gave it up for a few
years<00:07:12.070> before<00:07:12.370> when<00:07:13.330> that<00:07:13.570> was<00:07:13.750> probably<00:07:14.229> more

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 
years before when that was probably more

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.550 
years before when that was probably more
when<00:07:14.800> I<00:07:14.830> was<00:07:15.039> like<00:07:15.220> eight<00:07:15.520> or<00:07:15.550> nine<00:07:16.229> we<00:07:17.229> didn't

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 
when I was like eight or nine we didn't

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.320 
when I was like eight or nine we didn't
have<00:07:17.860> too<00:07:18.039> much<00:07:18.160> to<00:07:18.310> do<00:07:18.430> with<00:07:18.460> me<00:07:18.789> but<00:07:19.000> I<00:07:19.030> felt

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
have too much to do with me but I felt

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.760 
have too much to do with me but I felt
we<00:07:19.389> used<00:07:19.509> to<00:07:19.570> go<00:07:19.660> and<00:07:19.750> watch<00:07:19.900> it<00:07:20.110> all<00:07:20.560> the<00:07:20.620> time

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770 
we used to go and watch it all the time

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.010 
we used to go and watch it all the time
obviously<00:07:21.099> in<00:07:21.430> Darwin<00:07:21.820> and<00:07:21.940> then<00:07:22.120> they

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.020 
obviously in Darwin and then they

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.960 
obviously in Darwin and then they
started<00:07:23.440> a<00:07:23.590> class<00:07:23.919> up<00:07:24.220> and<00:07:24.370> down<00:07:24.520> with<00:07:24.789> dirt

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:24.970 
started a class up and down with dirt
