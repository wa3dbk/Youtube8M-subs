00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
needs to do some damage because he's

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.830 
needs to do some damage because he's
sucking<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.790> lot<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:02.000> economy<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.570> get<00:03:02.690> this

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
sucking a lot of economy to get this

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.140 
sucking a lot of economy to get this
barracks<00:03:03.170> out<00:03:03.320> this<00:03:03.530> fast<00:03:03.800> but<00:03:04.760> yeah<00:03:05.120> I

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
barracks out this fast but yeah I

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.030 
barracks out this fast but yeah I
expected<00:03:05.660> Reapers<00:03:05.930> as<00:03:06.050> well<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:06.350> nope<00:03:06.560> no<00:03:06.830> gas

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
expected Reapers as well but nope no gas

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.290 
expected Reapers as well but nope no gas
so<00:03:07.280> it's<00:03:07.430> going<00:03:07.550> straight<00:03:07.760> for<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.030> Marines

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
so it's going straight for the Marines

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.600 
so it's going straight for the Marines
which<00:03:08.480> means<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.870> will<00:03:09.170> have<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.980> get

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
which means that you will have to get

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.260 
which means that you will have to get
these<00:03:11.030> holing<00:03:11.570> SUVs<00:03:11.990> to<00:03:12.790> supergrass<00:03:13.790> if<00:03:14.120> he

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
these holing SUVs to supergrass if he

against squirtle i believe it was but uh

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.290 
against squirtle i believe it was but uh
that<00:05:56.040> was<00:05:56.160> just<00:05:56.340> simply<00:05:56.520> because<00:05:56.700> the<00:05:56.970> rust<00:05:57.150> is

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
that was just simply because the rust is

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
so so difficult for supposing

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.140 
so so difficult for supposing
counter-attack<00:05:59.430> so<00:05:59.550> if<00:05:59.610> we<00:05:59.669> see<00:05:59.790> that<00:05:59.940> same

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
counter-attack so if we see that same

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.879

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
throughout play gets cross farms could

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.460 
throughout play gets cross farms could
be<00:06:01.950> tough<00:06:02.130> for<00:06:02.280> paralyzed<00:06:02.700> and<00:06:03.690> some<00:06:04.229> app<00:06:04.320> you

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
be tough for paralyzed and some app you

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.090 
be tough for paralyzed and some app you
want<00:06:04.590> on<00:06:04.740> before<00:06:05.010> so<00:06:05.250> not<00:06:05.669> a<00:06:05.700> bad<00:06:05.910> choice<00:06:07.100> well

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
want on before so not a bad choice well

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.190 
want on before so not a bad choice well
then<00:06:08.250> ask<00:06:08.460> him<00:06:08.639> so<00:06:08.880> that's<00:06:09.120> a<00:06:09.389> little<00:06:09.540> bit<00:06:09.840> i

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
then ask him so that's a little bit i

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
would have been maybe a way to go one

just weird for this map i feel
personally<00:06:20.300> the<00:06:21.300> main<00:06:21.630> base<00:06:21.810> is<00:06:21.960> too<00:06:22.080> small

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
personally the main base is too small

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.390 
personally the main base is too small
there's<00:06:22.590> not<00:06:22.680> a<00:06:22.710> lot<00:06:22.860> of<00:06:22.889> place<00:06:23.100> to<00:06:23.220> hide

well<00:06:26.229> it<00:06:27.229> isn't<00:06:27.439> more<00:06:27.680> costly<00:06:28.129> and<00:06:28.250> paralyzing

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:28.939 
well it isn't more costly and paralyzing
