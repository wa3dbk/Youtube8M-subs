00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.020
 capcom you 're under very low 25 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.240
 anniversary the dog man 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.310
 capcom makes an announcement of the new title 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.770
 to celebrate these 25 years of 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.500
 blue bomber called rock manex over 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.720
 I honestly expected more from this 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.970
 game I did not expect it to be the great 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.579
 thing but the truth was waiting for me so 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.499
 less new or st on the part of capcom and 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.289
 that the trailer of the game pleased me 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:29.449
 a lot but hell, they did not do that 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.270
 they come up recycled st of the first 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.250
 rock man x well well keep calm 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.680
 and criticize this game decently 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.250
 as every game deserves, even though it does not 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.250
 I deserve it 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.120
 the story tells that for causes 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.130
 unknown a crack opens in the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.260
 space and time causing the 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.660
 dimensions of all rock sagas 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.850
 man join like this the doctor william sigma 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.620
 coming to join forces against Rotman and 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.710
 the other protagonists of the others 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.629
 sagas up there all good all super 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.580
 one can think that it is a worthy 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.500
 story for an anniversary game 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.240
 the dog man but unfortunately not 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.729
 they could take advantage of not even so 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.160
 decent story following with the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.380
 history at some time the 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.940
 Dr. Willy and Sigma manage to imprison 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.220
 our heroes in one dimension 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.290
 unknown and all that web now the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.090
 protagonist being a robot created by 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.399
 the doctor light and another that I do not remember 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.229
 name said robot being named as 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.990
 over one that has like new 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.450
 characteristic or potential surprise 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.210
 infinite a shit is the same as the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.520
 Unlimited potential of ex but good 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.780
 practically that's the story 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.580
 I would have liked it more than 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.950
 protagonists of that game would have 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.790
 been the classic rock man and ex something like that 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.790
 like the sonic generations 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.460
 good leaving the story aside 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.189
 now I will criticize because the gameplay 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.079
 the character is practically stupid 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.030
 walk alone with this has already said the 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.350
 exploration that had every title of 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.329
 rock man went to hell 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.460
 instead we have to go picking 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.159
 what enemies leave lying on the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.140
 So when they are destroyed, they get 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.720
 letters to improve our former pirate 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.459
 and for more so we get the parts of 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.670
 the armor that we put in this title 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.709
 I mean, I can believe that 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.870
 method of collecting objects for 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.209
 ship games and you're that is cellular 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.000
 but chucha in a game of rock man that 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.340
 kind of asshole no mames capcom no 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.530
 innovated a shit me waiting for or that 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.870
 good and decent tests since as there was 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.120
 said later I really liked the 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.459
 of the trailer but not my new music 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.110
 we have in all the missions you will hear 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.329
 nothing West Central 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.329
 james way of the x1 version of super 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.010
 nintendo the music is recycled in a 98 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.190
 percent since in certain occasions 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.380
 the west of the trailer sounds talking about 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.750
 the characters really expected me 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.620
 mavericks of all the sagas some of 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.900
 the saga but 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.239
 of the classic and more or less like that the thing 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.549
 but neither cock is practically a rock 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.220
 man x 1 but more shit all 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.230
 mavericks are from x 1 the scenarios 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.780
 They are candles because how do you see it? 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.030
 beginning you see it at the end the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.129
 same scenario over and over again which 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.069
 nothing is remarkable the animations 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.290
 they are terrible they are very slow and until 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.030
 something rough and in the only moment that 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.220
 it seems that they can harm you is when 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.470
 fights against some maverick since the 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.750
 missions are so short and repetitive and 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.760
 especially easy and for more we can 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.530
 observe that our pirate protagonist 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.049
 level up which is done to me 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.030
 stupid I do not need arguments for 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.640
 say that just level up in 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.799
 this game is stupidly unnecessary 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.450
 maybe against the mavericks but in 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.670
 missions is unnecessary since 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.620
 just click shoot and you load 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.959
 to any mechanic and to cross 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.450
 on your way I really have not played 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.720
 the game but only with the video from behind 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.069
 you can give an idea of what the fuck is 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.019
 talking a bit more about the game 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.239
 I really like it a little bit that we 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.549
 offer the west of the trailer but in 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.970
 full version that makes me feel like 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.100
 what 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.740
 he came back but he came back with a failure 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.840
 called over 1 and record that I have in 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.750
 mind that maybe capcom sells something 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.520
 about the game I explain myself in the version 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.100
 of rock man x 1 for ios 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.260
 capcom sold the complete armor the 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.209
 hearts and their tanks and other 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.220
 price of 3 dollars 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.109
 having already done that I have in 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.510
 mind that maybe they do something similar 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.820
 with this new title there is not much 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.130
 variety in the game good maybe what 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.990
 do when using said armor but not 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.670
 I think they make a big change because 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.980
 we only have the option to jump 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.930
 shoot and make a giga attack on the 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.790
 game said attack previously 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.890
 mentioned plagiarized of x 2 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.870
 at a glance you can see that I'm 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.360
 being very hard with this game but 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.280
 capcom practically scoffed he fucked up and 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.890
 He pulls a fart to Roman in the face with 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.620
 that shit for the 10th anniversary of dog 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.900
 man made the rock man 8 and the x4 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.730
 I bet many who have played those 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.010
 games will say they are great 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.310
 capcom if he wanted to do those 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.160
 two great titles and now in 225 years 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.770
 they only made a rock man x 1 but 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.330
 more shit and shit and some out there 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.240
 they are saying that you have to get used to 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.520
 to this new game that getting used to and 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.160
 all that blowjob me and my most sincere 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.320
 live opinions in the industry of the 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.300
 games you always have to innovate or so 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.350
 least keep up with the pace and condition of their 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.180
 Titles 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.220
 just as rotman has done all this 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.680
 innovating time like he did with the 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.540
 saga x in the saga keeping their 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.550
 innovations and features that 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.340
 make specials without affecting the 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.650
 playability rofman dax is another story 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.900
 in this theme and the battle network and star 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.910
 force I consider them shit maybe some 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.490
 day give them a chance to those two 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.090
 sagas especially to the battle network 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.610
 what is the What 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.770
 it pleases him but the exodus see is inferior 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.230
 at any rock man title destroying the 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.270
 classic gameplay completely up to 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.639
 the dogma one entertains me and it amuses 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.919
 more than the fuck and already having 25 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.930
 years old not like this thing that 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.540
 has just one day left and it's a 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.580
 but the graphics do not criticize them so 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.100
 which is a touch mobile which is not 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.540
 You can ask for a lot and I am excited and 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.120
 shout with emotion when you see the wallpaper 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.010
 when it was just announced and as soon as 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.800
 little my expectations of this new 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.169
 title was collapsing personally already 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.389
 to finish this video the game is a 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.190
 detection the most infamous and garbage going 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.470
 game of the rock man franchise no 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.080
 brings nothing new only 1st and a 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.419
 pirated character of rock manex only 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.400
 it's new offers really I was expecting 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.860
 this year because he believed that this 25 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.870
 anniversary would be great and there would be a 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.120
 game by which if I could enjoy 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.760
 once again rock man but in way to 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.560
 this thing I put a 0.5 not what 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.570
 I recommend the truth if you're a fan of the 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.300
 saga maybe to spend a little bit of time 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.130
 idle but nothing more capcom announced 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.420
 recently they will be working on 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.090
 rock magic titles 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.520
 luck will reach the 50th anniversary but 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.100
 in my opinion if they will continue taking out games 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.710
 so really leave roman just like 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.140
 I is yoda TASAGAYA I do not expect anything 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.480
 just remakes but let's see what blowjobs 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.000
 future will capcom already with this said me 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.830
 dismissal rate comment good things or 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.440
 bad if you like to do it here you 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.440
 dismisses 0 15 x 9 to other
