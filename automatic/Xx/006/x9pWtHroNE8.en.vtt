00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.099
 time to learn about the water cycle 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.220
 The water cycle covers evaporation, precipitation, compensation and return 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.499
 very well 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.499
 very good that is so fun cook 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:33.170
 so I'm talking here it has to be a movie or a joke 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.890
 this is important the material 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.680
 the scientist 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.020
 2 I do not know if you really are moving away from the water molecules 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.250
 I have been studious of the raw material 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.300
 50 years I think it's something about the water cycle 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.750
 hence, it is all this 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.750
 it's not bad work 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.330
 working on a presentation 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.110
 that will show this latest research showed a new 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.560
 display 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.560
 I still not very known 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.580
 I suppose with democracy alive 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.539
 despite that 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.280
 tell me who I am 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.830
 all of your observation satellites from part of the water and space cycle 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.200
 finally we are getting 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.350
 a global perspective of the movement of the band 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.260
 we are applying that to meet the growing needs of being 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.380
 human fresh water 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.940
 coahuila is that we have advanced much more 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.350
 those that have been used 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.130
 just a little bit of us 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.160
 the member of the data sent 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.159
 first we were very restrained and water vapor are going to be the same 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.610
 student assumption 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.780
 the data indicate that water vapor is increasing and we think that it 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.689
 found related to an increase in the water department of the soil 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.130
 below the relations with the farc 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.670
 even though what's on the conversation 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.630
 as we know the double value of the goals in Tehran 17 5% 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 is conversing in various attitudes d the 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.070
 wow the internal structure before the clouds 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.499
 according to these works 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.799
 from the clouds we have noticed a growing number of clubs that are more 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.489
 active women 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.659
 this advantage 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.090
 the los angeles lakers added their ninth title that the presentation on 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.949
 mainland 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.629
 it also increased 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.069
 so that means that the more rivers that deliver us more fresh water from 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.629
 new oceans 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.649
 yes something despite the rise of the time 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.509
 and the alteration of rivers 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.299
 with humans 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.430
 also the water cycle is really generating some changes 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.309
 significant for this cause iberdrola is the need for fresh water really 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:43.919
 increasing since 1900 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:48.349
 50 we must almost three times smaller than a typical family in states 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.860
 United 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.880
 now they use 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.309
 hundreds of liters of water per person per day after 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:56.219
 since only 3 percent of water and land are with you and the greatest 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.139
 part of these two reporters from the polar caps humans 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.449
 We are claiming Wednesday that the departure back from the cycle of the 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.939
 Water 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.139
 just to satisfy them 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.139
 and here is the other channel also diverse trends 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:13.389
 wow the temperatures rise should be causing more evaporation by 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:15.639
 exactly the prevention 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.589
 global warming 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:20.139
 apparently an acceleration of the integral water cycle with more 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.619
 evaporation plus water the atmosphere and more precipitation 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:26.539
 last storms strong floods 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.199
 we are seeing it in some 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.499
 not because rafa 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.179
 we need more information for people 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.809
 something we need said to understand the success of the uaz jesus lobato things 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:39.529
 esoteric comforted clouds and precipitation from the satellite collect 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:39.999
 data 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:42.719
 about evaporation and water 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.829
 and even still because that's really hard to measure but in 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.280
 future missions to we could do first we begin to better understand how 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:51.799
 Water currents flow on the surface of the earth 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.469
 for this we need two satellites one to measure soil moisture and another 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.809
 to look at surface water levels 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.689
 then we want to measure how quickly the water evaporates from the 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.869
 ocean we can do is observe the levels of salt that are 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.419
 we want to know how much light water will be frozen we have and for that 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.630
 we need snow and ice levels 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.729
 but some rumors 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:12.429
 we need to contramano 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:15.869
 with water even though we have that's why these injuries are very 

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:16.680
 important

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.849
 Rodriguez too 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.849
 and he's right because of so much luck because many possible 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.180
 I do not understand most of this in this sense when they are stopped by this 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.870
 work concept to do 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.900
 I also 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.639
 and this is a health benefit
