going to start looking for qualitative
factors<00:01:40.960> in<00:01:41.380> addition<00:01:41.740> because<00:01:41.920> everybody's

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
factors in addition because everybody's

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.830

want to be admire so why don't I just
behave<00:04:56.300> like<00:04:56.450> them<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:56.990> he<00:04:57.140> found<00:04:57.350> there<00:04:57.470> was

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
behave like them and he found there was

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.050 
behave like them and he found there was
nothing<00:04:57.800> impossible<00:04:58.370> about<00:04:58.430> behaving<00:04:58.850> like

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
nothing impossible about behaving like

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.300 
nothing impossible about behaving like
them<00:04:59.240> and<00:04:59.450> similarly<00:05:00.260> he<00:05:00.650> did<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:00.919> same<00:05:01.100> thing

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
them and similarly he did the same thing

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.790 
them and similarly he did the same thing
on<00:05:01.669> the<00:05:01.910> reverse<00:05:02.210> side<00:05:02.419> in<00:05:02.660> terms<00:05:02.810> of<00:05:03.020> getting

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
on the reverse side in terms of getting

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.860 
on the reverse side in terms of getting
rid<00:05:03.919> of<00:05:03.950> those<00:05:04.130> qualities<00:05:04.640> so<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.180> would

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
rid of those qualities so I would

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.450 
rid of those qualities so I would
suggest<00:05:06.080> that<00:05:06.620> if<00:05:06.979> you<00:05:07.070> write<00:05:07.220> those

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
suggest that if you write those

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.740 
suggest that if you write those
qualities<00:05:07.880> down<00:05:08.060> and<00:05:08.240> think<00:05:08.390> about<00:05:08.600> them<00:05:08.690> a

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
qualities down and think about them a

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.570 
qualities down and think about them a
little<00:05:08.840> while<00:05:09.080> and<00:05:09.229> make<00:05:09.320> them<00:05:09.440> habitual<00:05:09.890> you

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
little while and make them habitual you

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.250 
little while and make them habitual you
will<00:05:10.760> be<00:05:10.910> the<00:05:11.030> one<00:05:11.180> that<00:05:11.300> you<00:05:11.390> want<00:05:11.570> to<00:05:11.600> buy<00:05:11.720> 10%

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
will be the one that you want to buy 10%

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.180 
will be the one that you want to buy 10%
of<00:05:12.320> when<00:05:12.470> you<00:05:12.560> get<00:05:12.680> all<00:05:12.770> through<00:05:12.979> and<00:05:13.130> the

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
of when you get all through and the

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.469 
of when you get all through and the
beauty<00:05:13.430> of<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:13.610> is<00:05:13.700> you<00:05:13.729> already<00:05:14.000> hold<00:05:14.090> 100

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
beauty of it is you already hold 100

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.120 
beauty of it is you already hold 100
percent<00:05:14.780> you're<00:05:15.020> stuck<00:05:15.200> with<00:05:15.350> it<00:05:15.470> so<00:05:15.500> you

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
percent you're stuck with it so you

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.409 
percent you're stuck with it so you
might<00:05:16.250> as<00:05:16.310> well<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.610> might<00:05:16.760> as<00:05:16.880> well<00:05:16.910> be<00:05:17.240> that

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
might as well you might as well be that

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.099 
might as well you might as well be that
person<00:05:17.990> somebody<00:05:18.710> else<00:05:18.890> will
