it<00:01:34.530> gets<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.310> SCV's<00:01:35.909> our<00:01:36.560> main<00:01:37.560> yarding

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
it gets so SCV's our main yarding

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.130 
it gets so SCV's our main yarding
however<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.790> say<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.000> over<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.960> gonna

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
however you say it over and it's gonna

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.870 
however you say it over and it's gonna
but<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.500> does<00:01:40.619> look<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:40.829> our<00:01:41.250> Protoss<00:01:41.700> player

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
but it does look like our Protoss player

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.090 
but it does look like our Protoss player
being<00:01:42.119> very<00:01:42.329> smart<00:01:42.420> trying<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.649> under<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
being very smart trying to get under and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.770 
being very smart trying to get under and
stay<00:01:44.340> under<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:45.149> make<00:01:45.329> sure<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.689> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
stay under to make sure that this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.880 
stay under to make sure that this
command<00:01:46.110> center<00:01:46.380> cannot<00:01:46.710> drop

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
command center cannot drop

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.930 
command center cannot drop
these<00:01:47.979> are<00:01:48.070> going<00:01:48.190> to<00:01:48.250> come<00:01:48.430> in<00:01:48.580> here<00:01:48.790> and

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
these are going to come in here and

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.640 
these are going to come in here and
clean<00:01:49.390> up<00:01:49.450> all<00:01:49.780> those<00:01:49.930> probes<00:01:50.260> it's<00:01:50.470> going<00:01:50.590> to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
clean up all those probes it's going to

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.950 
clean up all those probes it's going to
be<00:01:50.710> able<00:01:50.800> to<00:01:50.950> drop<00:01:51.190> just<00:01:51.909> in<00:01:52.030> time<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.659> zealot

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
be able to drop just in time the zealot

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.520 
be able to drop just in time the zealot
comes<00:01:53.170> out<00:01:53.290> and<00:01:53.470> actually<00:01:53.650> gets<00:01:54.070> trapped<00:01:54.490> Oh

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
comes out and actually gets trapped Oh

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.320 
comes out and actually gets trapped Oh
actually<00:01:56.530> gets<00:01:56.950> trapped<00:01:57.220> so<00:01:57.400> it<00:01:57.520> cannot<00:01:57.940> kill

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
actually gets trapped so it cannot kill

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.750 
actually gets trapped so it cannot kill
any<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.720> these<00:01:58.900> SUVs<00:01:59.220> while<00:02:00.220> this<00:02:00.310> planetary

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
any of these SUVs while this planetary

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.430 
any of these SUVs while this planetary
fortresses<00:02:01.240> being<00:02:01.479> made<00:02:01.659> he<00:02:01.869> has<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.140> just<00:02:02.320> go

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
fortresses being made he has to just go

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.499 
fortresses being made he has to just go
and<00:02:02.560> continue<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:03.070> hack<00:02:03.369> away<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.479> course

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
and continue to hack away and of course

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.600 
and continue to hack away and of course
these<00:02:04.750> STDs<00:02:05.259> he<00:02:05.410> has<00:02:05.500> about<00:02:05.680> 100<00:02:06.160> minerals<00:02:06.490> so

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
these STDs he has about 100 minerals so

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.669 
these STDs he has about 100 minerals so
he's<00:02:06.790> going<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.030> be<00:02:07.150> able<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.540> continue<00:02:08.320> to

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
he's going to be able to continue to

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.529 
he's going to be able to continue to
repair<00:02:09.039> this<00:02:09.190> for<00:02:09.399> quite<00:02:09.640> some<00:02:09.910> time<00:02:09.940> looks

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
repair this for quite some time looks

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.090 
repair this for quite some time looks
like<00:02:10.660> SUVs<00:02:11.050> are<00:02:11.080> going<00:02:11.470> for<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.680> probes<00:02:11.950> and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
like SUVs are going for the probes and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.250 
like SUVs are going for the probes and
it<00:02:12.430> actually<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.820> an<00:02:12.970> even<00:02:13.360> battle<00:02:13.750> he<00:02:14.170> was

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
it actually is an even battle he was

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260 
it actually is an even battle he was
able<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.560> kill<00:02:14.709> a<00:02:14.739> few<00:02:14.980> folks<00:02:15.280> at<00:02:16.060> the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
able to kill a few folks at the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.880 
able to kill a few folks at the
beginning<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.930> it's<00:02:17.170> actually<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.530> relatively

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
beginning and it's actually a relatively

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.320 
beginning and it's actually a relatively
even<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.340> course<00:02:18.489> we<00:02:18.580> know<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.850> one<00:02:18.970> probe<00:02:19.180> is

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
even of course we know that one probe is

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.699 
even of course we know that one probe is
actually<00:02:19.720> all<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.989> way<00:02:20.080> across<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.530> other

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
actually all the way across the other

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.800 
actually all the way across the other
side<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.130> map<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.970> first<00:02:22.180> stalker<00:02:22.510> is

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
side of the map so the first stalker is

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.020 
side of the map so the first stalker is
out<00:02:23.050> planetary<00:02:23.620> fortress<00:02:23.980> still<00:02:24.220> almost<00:02:24.489> done

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
out planetary fortress still almost done

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.610 
out planetary fortress still almost done
but<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.600> does<00:02:25.720> look<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.140> SUV<00:02:26.260> we're

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
but it does look like the SUV we're

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.750 
but it does look like the SUV we're
going<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.800> go<00:02:26.860> into<00:02:26.890> repair<00:02:27.280> these<00:02:27.400> probes<00:02:27.640> are

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
going to go into repair these probes are

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.030 
going to go into repair these probes are
going<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.940> try<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.209> take<00:02:28.390> out<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.660> SUV<00:02:29.290> before

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
going to try and take out the SUV before

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.380 
going to try and take out the SUV before
that<00:02:30.130> can<00:02:30.280> happen<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.060> does<00:02:31.180> look<00:02:31.330> like

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
that can happen but it does look like

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.150 
that can happen but it does look like
the<00:02:31.570> planetary<00:02:31.989> fortress<00:02:32.350> shooting<00:02:33.040> out<00:02:33.130> of

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
the planetary fortress shooting out of

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.530 
the planetary fortress shooting out of
the<00:02:33.250> bell<00:02:33.430> okey<00:02:33.820> now<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.090> looks<00:02:34.239> like<00:02:34.330> he's

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
the bell okey now it looks like he's

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.759 
the bell okey now it looks like he's
actually<00:02:34.630> gonna<00:02:34.810> go<00:02:34.989> for<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.200> probes<00:02:35.440> as<00:02:35.650> they

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
actually gonna go for the probes as they

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.050 
actually gonna go for the probes as they
are<00:02:35.980> clumped<00:02:36.310> up<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:36.550> he<00:02:36.610> was<00:02:36.700> able<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.940> kill

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
are clumped up so he was able to kill

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.620 
are clumped up so he was able to kill
three<00:02:37.600> two<00:02:38.110> at<00:02:38.260> once<00:02:38.530> Wow<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.820> all<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.300> these

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
three two at once Wow so all of these

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.960 
three two at once Wow so all of these
probes<00:02:40.959> have<00:02:41.110> done<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.830> fast<00:02:42.100> planetary

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
probes have done so fast planetary

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.340 
probes have done so fast planetary
forces<00:02:43.209> being<00:02:43.540> healed<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.959> zealot<00:02:44.260> is

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
forces being healed the zealot is

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.170 
forces being healed the zealot is
definitely<00:02:44.800> going<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.010> get<00:02:45.100> down<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.640> is

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
definitely going to get down and is

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.330 
definitely going to get down and is
plugging<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.750> be<00:02:46.810> focusing<00:02:47.230> down<00:02:47.440> its<00:02:47.890> pylons

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
plugging to be focusing down its pylons

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.759 
plugging to be focusing down its pylons
next<00:02:48.670> anything<00:02:49.600> of<00:02:49.989> course<00:02:50.140> this<00:02:50.290> STDs

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
next anything of course this STDs

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.500 
next anything of course this STDs
definitely<00:02:51.220> went<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.519> probe<00:02:51.850> don't<00:02:52.360> want

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
definitely went to a probe don't want

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.699 
definitely went to a probe don't want
him<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.690> be<00:02:52.750> able<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.930> mind<00:02:53.110> anything<00:02:53.290> as<00:02:53.620> he

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
him to be able to mind anything as he

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.620 
him to be able to mind anything as he
only<00:02:53.890> has<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.130> hundred<00:02:54.549> minerals<00:02:54.910> he<00:02:55.360> didn't

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
only has a hundred minerals he didn't

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.930 
only has a hundred minerals he didn't
say<00:02:55.810> about<00:02:56.100> knowing<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:57.250> was<00:02:57.430> coming<00:02:57.790> and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
say about knowing this was coming and

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.030 
say about knowing this was coming and
it's<00:02:58.540> always<00:02:58.720> good<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:58.959> say<00:02:59.140> about<00:02:59.170> 400

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
it's always good to say about 400

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.650 
it's always good to say about 400
minerals<00:03:00.310> because<00:03:00.459> he<00:03:01.209> can't<00:03:01.480> move<00:03:01.540> that
