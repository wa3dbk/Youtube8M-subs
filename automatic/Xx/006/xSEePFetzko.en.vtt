here<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.049> fucking<00:02:04.469> bucket

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.919 

eventually<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.879> realized<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.660> he<00:02:09.810> was

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
eventually I realized that he was

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.050 
eventually I realized that he was
actually<00:02:10.080> stuck<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> forklift<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.400> this

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
actually stuck on the forklift and this

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.490 
actually stuck on the forklift and this
is<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.569> first<00:02:12.840> cow

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
is the first cow

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.450 
is the first cow
and<00:02:13.620> many<00:02:13.860> cows<00:02:14.250> down<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.700> line<00:02:14.900> one<00:02:15.900> point

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
and many cows down the line one point

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.450 
and many cows down the line one point
cow<00:02:17.460> bucket<00:02:17.940> that's<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:18.690> point<00:02:19.430> eventually<00:02:20.430> I

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
cow bucket that's one point eventually I

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.610 
cow bucket that's one point eventually I
got<00:02:20.790> more<00:02:21.330> cows<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.170> was<00:02:22.320> just<00:02:22.470> like

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
got more cows in and I was just like

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.980 
got more cows in and I was just like
throwing<00:02:22.920> cows<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.490> here<00:02:23.600> it's<00:02:24.600> really

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
throwing cows in here it's really

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.180 
throwing cows in here it's really
difficult<00:02:25.170> cuz<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.770> can<00:02:25.890> only<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.100> it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
difficult cuz that you can only get it

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.320 
difficult cuz that you can only get it
from<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.400> top<00:02:26.610> side<00:02:26.850> because<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.120> bottom

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
from the top side because the bottom

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.640 
from the top side because the bottom
side<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.540> can't<00:02:27.780> get<00:02:27.900> your<00:02:27.960> forklift<00:02:28.380> over

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
side you can't get your forklift over

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.920 
side you can't get your forklift over
I've<00:02:28.770> actually<00:02:29.250> invented<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:30.000> numbering

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
I've actually invented a numbering

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.020 
I've actually invented a numbering
system<00:02:30.990> for<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.590> cows<00:02:31.860> every<00:02:32.430> cat<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.730> put<00:02:32.910> in

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
system for the cows every cat you put in

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.840 
system for the cows every cat you put in
you<00:02:33.150> get<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.300> point<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.980> have<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.370> keep<00:02:35.520> it

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
you get a point and you have to keep it

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.060 
you get a point and you have to keep it
you<00:02:35.970> got<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.240> get<00:02:36.330> his<00:02:36.420> head<00:02:36.570> in<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.900> make<00:02:37.890> sure

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
you got to get his head in and make sure

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.130 
you got to get his head in and make sure
it's<00:02:38.250> all<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.610> way<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.910> but<00:02:39.360> eventually<00:02:39.900> I

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
it's all the way in but eventually I

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.560 
it's all the way in but eventually I
realized<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.709> wanted<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.310> get<00:02:41.459> two<00:02:41.730> cows<00:02:42.030> in<00:02:42.060> at

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
realized I wanted to get two cows in at

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.100 
realized I wanted to get two cows in at
once<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.980> eventually<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.640> got<00:02:44.940> two<00:02:45.240> cows<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.540> on

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
once so eventually I got two cows in on

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.670 
once so eventually I got two cows in on
one<00:02:46.470> forklift

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
one forklift

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.229 
one forklift
so<00:02:49.680> what<00:02:49.860> I'm<00:02:49.980> thinking<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.580> if<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:50.940> can<00:02:51.120> get

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
so what I'm thinking is if you can get

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.449 
so what I'm thinking is if you can get
two<00:02:51.420> cows<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.690> at<00:02:52.020> once<00:02:52.290> two<00:02:52.709> dead<00:02:52.920> cows<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.340> at

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
two cows in at once two dead cows and at

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.520 
two cows in at once two dead cows and at
once<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:54.300> can<00:02:54.480> get<00:02:54.600> your<00:02:54.780> point<00:02:55.140> totals

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
once you can get your point totals

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.130 
once you can get your point totals
squared<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.280> if<00:02:56.459> there's<00:02:56.640> two<00:02:56.790> cows<00:02:57.030> times<00:02:57.750> two

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
squared so if there's two cows times two

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.320 
squared so if there's two cows times two
so<00:02:58.770> if<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.160> get<00:02:59.310> three<00:02:59.520> cows<00:02:59.700> on<00:02:59.940> work<00:03:00.090> for

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
so if you get three cows on work for

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.420 
so if you get three cows on work for
clip<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.870> can<00:03:01.020> get<00:03:01.200> 3<00:03:01.770> times<00:03:02.459> 3<00:03:03.110> mm<00:03:04.110> oh<00:03:04.739> that's

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
clip you can get 3 times 3 mm oh that's

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.080 
clip you can get 3 times 3 mm oh that's
cute<00:03:06.860> but<00:03:07.860> anyways<00:03:08.250> that's<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.640> point<00:03:08.760> system

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
cute but anyways that's the point system

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.600 
cute but anyways that's the point system
I<00:03:09.150> invented<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:09.950> doesn't<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.010> look<00:03:11.160> cozy

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
I invented but doesn't that look cozy

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.590 
I invented but doesn't that look cozy
oh<00:03:15.800> yeah<00:03:16.800> I<00:03:16.830> just<00:03:17.400> love<00:03:17.790> these<00:03:17.970> cows<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.450> mean

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
oh yeah I just love these cows I mean

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.259 
oh yeah I just love these cows I mean
like<00:03:18.840> after<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.860> while<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.310> can<00:03:20.459> tell<00:03:20.670> how<00:03:20.880> long

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
like after a while you can tell how long

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.940 
like after a while you can tell how long
it<00:03:21.420> took<00:03:21.540> me<00:03:21.600> it's<00:03:21.840> going<00:03:21.989> day<00:03:22.200> at<00:03:22.350> an<00:03:22.470> idea

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
it took me it's going day at an idea

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.560 
it took me it's going day at an idea
yeah<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:23.820> really<00:03:24.120> difficult<00:03:24.299> because

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
yeah this is really difficult because

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.080 
yeah this is really difficult because
when<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.900> turn<00:03:25.170> they<00:03:25.440> slide<00:03:26.070> off<00:03:26.100> they<00:03:26.880> say

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
when you turn they slide off they say

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.370 
when you turn they slide off they say
hey<00:03:27.239> motherfucker<00:03:27.870> fuck<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:29.810> but<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:31.080> had<00:03:31.230> to

hey motherfucker fuck you but you had to

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.660 
hey motherfucker fuck you but you had to
get<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.650> point<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.250> make<00:03:32.370> sure<00:03:32.519> the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
get the point you have to make sure the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.910 
get the point you have to make sure the
head<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.940> all<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.299> way<00:03:33.420> in<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.840> she's<00:03:34.739> very

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
head is all the way in and she's very

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.860

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
comfortable inside of there that what

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.190 
comfortable inside of there that what

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.680 
you need to get the cow on the bucket we
call<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.049> Betsy<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:59.700> bet<00:04:00.299> she<00:04:00.420> gets<00:04:00.540> you

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
call that a Betsy I bet she gets you

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.710 
call that a Betsy I bet she gets you
three<00:04:01.019> boys<00:04:04.579> now<00:04:05.579> if<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.329> I<00:04:06.570> figured

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
three boys now if you can up I figured

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.470 
three boys now if you can up I figured
out<00:04:07.110> that<00:04:07.350> if<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:07.980> for<00:04:08.370> every<00:04:08.760> live<00:04:09.000> Kyle<00:04:09.299> that

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
out that if you for every live Kyle that

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.970 
out that if you for every live Kyle that
you<00:04:09.540> can<00:04:09.660> get<00:04:09.810> in<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.989> same<00:04:10.320> bucket<00:04:10.590> not<00:04:10.890> at

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
you can get in the same bucket not at

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.220 
you can get in the same bucket not at
the<00:04:11.040> same<00:04:11.280> time<00:04:11.549> every<00:04:12.239> in<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.750> same<00:04:12.989> bucket

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
the same time every in the same bucket

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.979 
the same time every in the same bucket
you<00:04:13.829> can<00:04:13.860> get<00:04:14.360> multiplied<00:04:15.360> times<00:04:15.570> each<00:04:15.840> other

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
you can get multiplied times each other

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.539 
you can get multiplied times each other
so<00:04:16.229> it's<00:04:16.410> gonna<00:04:16.500> be<00:04:16.680> three<00:04:16.709> points<00:04:17.220> for<00:04:17.370> one

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
so it's gonna be three points for one

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.030 
so it's gonna be three points for one
and<00:04:17.790> it's<00:04:18.209> gonna<00:04:18.329> be<00:04:18.510> three<00:04:18.780> times<00:04:19.109> three<00:04:19.560> for

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
and it's gonna be three times three for

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.800 
and it's gonna be three times three for
two<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.850> if<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.090> can<00:04:21.180> get<00:04:21.299> three<00:04:21.539> there

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
two and if you can get three there

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.950 
two and if you can get three there
that's<00:04:22.229> gonna<00:04:22.410> be<00:04:22.590> 27<00:04:23.310> points<00:04:23.849> for<00:04:24.330> three<00:04:24.780> live

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960

that's gonna be 27 points for three live
cows<00:04:25.200> in<00:04:25.410> there<00:04:25.560> because<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.830> can<00:04:25.950> tell
