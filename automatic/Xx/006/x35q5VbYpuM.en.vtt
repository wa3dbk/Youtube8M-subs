for having us out today typically when
someone<00:00:21.410> like<00:00:21.980> me<00:00:22.130> comes<00:00:22.369> in<00:00:22.519> who<00:00:22.699> hasn't

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
someone like me comes in who hasn't

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.640 
someone like me comes in who hasn't
necessarily<00:00:23.210> had<00:00:23.779> a<00:00:23.810> lot<00:00:23.990> of<00:00:24.019> experience<00:00:24.589> with

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
necessarily had a lot of experience with

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.149 
necessarily had a lot of experience with
drying<00:00:25.009> how<00:00:25.880> does<00:00:26.060> it<00:00:26.210> normally<00:00:26.329> go<00:00:27.159> well

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:28.159 
drying how does it normally go well

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:29.859 
drying how does it normally go well
we'll<00:00:28.310> just<00:00:28.339> set<00:00:28.939> you<00:00:29.089> up<00:00:29.119> on<00:00:29.329> a<00:00:29.390> little<00:00:29.630> bit<00:00:29.839> of

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
we'll just set you up on a little bit of

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.200 
we'll just set you up on a little bit of
an<00:00:30.050> introductory<00:00:30.499> right<00:00:30.919> and<00:00:31.249> we'll<00:00:31.400> go<00:00:31.999> easy

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
an introductory right and we'll go easy

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.720 
an introductory right and we'll go easy
on<00:00:32.509> you<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.930> first<00:00:33.500> little<00:00:33.680> while<00:00:33.950> later<00:00:34.489> on

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
on you the first little while later on

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.340 
on you the first little while later on
will<00:00:34.940> actually<00:00:35.300> let<00:00:35.420> you<00:00:35.600> experience<00:00:36.020> a

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
will actually let you experience a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.560 
will actually let you experience a
pretty<00:00:37.129> good<00:00:37.340> crash<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:38.000> you<00:00:38.090> can<00:00:38.210> get<00:00:38.300> a<00:00:38.359> good

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
pretty good crash so you can get a good

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.110 
pretty good crash so you can get a good
sensation<00:00:38.870> on<00:00:39.379> on<00:00:39.649> how<00:00:40.129> it<00:00:40.280> actually<00:00:40.460> feels<00:00:40.850> in

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
sensation on on how it actually feels in

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.279 
sensation on on how it actually feels in
the<00:00:41.149> simulator<00:00:41.660> well<00:00:41.870> I'm<00:00:41.930> sure<00:00:42.140> I'll

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
the simulator well I'm sure I'll

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.569 
the simulator well I'm sure I'll
experience<00:00:42.769> that<00:00:42.980> without<00:00:43.160> any<00:00:43.370> help

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
experience that without any help

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.459 
experience that without any help
integrate<00:00:43.940> this<00:00:44.329> all<00:00:44.570> right<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:44.960> who've<00:00:45.440> we

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
integrate this all right so who've we

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:46.959 
integrate this all right so who've we
got<00:00:45.620> behind<00:00:45.859> the<00:00:46.070> wheel<00:00:46.100> here<00:00:46.460> okay<00:00:46.609> right<00:00:46.789> now

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
got behind the wheel here okay right now

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.119 
got behind the wheel here okay right now
we<00:00:47.030> actually<00:00:47.329> have<00:00:47.750> Chris<00:00:48.050> Lobo<00:00:48.469> he's

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
we actually have Chris Lobo he's

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.299 
we actually have Chris Lobo he's
actually<00:00:49.370> our<00:00:49.670> simulator<00:00:50.210> operator<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.309> just

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
actually our simulator operator and just

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.310 
actually our simulator operator and just
so<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:52.910> can<00:00:53.059> see<00:00:53.269> how<00:00:53.449> things<00:00:53.780> work<00:00:54.109> here

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
so that you can see how things work here

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.829 
so that you can see how things work here
we<00:00:54.500> have<00:00:54.649> Chris<00:00:54.949> out<00:00:55.160> on<00:00:55.429> the<00:00:55.670> course<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.179> this

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
we have Chris out on the course and this

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.900 
we have Chris out on the course and this
particular<00:00:57.019> monitor<00:00:57.769> is<00:00:57.980> what<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.370> operator

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
particular monitor is what the operator

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.630 
particular monitor is what the operator
of<00:00:59.149> the<00:00:59.440> simulator<00:01:00.440> looks<00:01:00.739> at<00:01:00.949> we<00:01:01.129> put<00:01:01.399> in<00:01:01.519> a

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
of the simulator looks at we put in a

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.630 
of the simulator looks at we put in a
certain<00:01:01.879> script<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:02.690> then<00:01:03.350> we<00:01:03.589> can<00:01:03.829> watch<00:01:04.370> on

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
certain script and then we can watch on

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.250 
certain script and then we can watch on
this<00:01:04.790> screen<00:01:05.059> here<00:01:05.180> as<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.930> what<00:01:06.080> is<00:01:06.230> actually

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
this screen here as to what is actually

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.980 
this screen here as to what is actually
happening<00:01:06.710> in<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.460> simulation<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.689> then<00:01:08.840> on

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
happening in the simulation and then on

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.230 
happening in the simulation and then on
this<00:01:09.200> screen<00:01:09.439> over<00:01:09.829> here<00:01:09.860> is<00:01:10.310> where<00:01:10.790> we<00:01:10.820> can

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
this screen over here is where we can

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.319 
this screen over here is where we can
isolate<00:01:11.930> different<00:01:12.470> views<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:13.850> at<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.119> same

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
isolate different views so at the same

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.120 
isolate different views so at the same
time<00:01:14.600> here<00:01:14.930> he<00:01:15.079> comes<00:01:15.320> up<00:01:15.530> on<00:01:15.680> different

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
time here he comes up on different

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.499 
time here he comes up on different
hazards<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.729> I<00:01:16.850> can<00:01:17.060> change<00:01:17.360> this

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
hazards and I can change this

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.719 
hazards and I can change this
perspective<00:01:18.079> this<00:01:18.979> is<00:01:19.040> like<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.369> little

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
perspective this is like a little

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.569 
perspective this is like a little
helicopter<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:20.750> yep<00:01:21.560> if<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.159> want<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.430> get<00:01:22.520> a

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
helicopter that yep if you want to get a

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.789 
helicopter that yep if you want to get a
little<00:01:22.759> more<00:01:22.939> of<00:01:23.240> his<00:01:23.450> perspective<00:01:24.259> we<00:01:24.619> can

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
little more of his perspective we can

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.460 
little more of his perspective we can
come<00:01:25.040> around<00:01:25.189> in<00:01:25.579> behind<00:01:26.000> him<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.479> there<00:01:27.290> were

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
come around in behind him and there were

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.170 
come around in behind him and there were
kind<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:27.890> driving<00:01:28.340> right<00:01:28.520> along<00:01:28.790> with<00:01:29.030> them

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
kind of driving right along with them

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.709 
kind of driving right along with them
right<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:29.689> we're<00:01:29.840> seeing<00:01:30.020> what<00:01:30.350> he<00:01:30.560> sees<00:01:31.719> there

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
right so we're seeing what he sees there

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.539 
right so we're seeing what he sees there
you<00:01:32.869> can<00:01:32.930> see<00:01:33.020> an<00:01:33.290> ambulance<00:01:33.740> came<00:01:33.979> out<00:01:34.189> on<00:01:34.399> him

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
you can see an ambulance came out on him

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.789 
you can see an ambulance came out on him
he's<00:01:35.299> not<00:01:35.329> going<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.869> injure<00:01:36.200> himself<00:01:36.380> he's

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
he's not going to injure himself he's

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.350 
he's not going to injure himself he's
not<00:01:36.860> going<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:37.280> injure<00:01:37.610> anybody<00:01:37.820> else<00:01:38.180> he's

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
not going to injure anybody else he's

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.999 
not going to injure anybody else he's
not<00:01:38.420> going<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.930> do<00:01:39.049> any<00:01:39.229> damage<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.860> equipment

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
not going to do any damage to equipment

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.679
