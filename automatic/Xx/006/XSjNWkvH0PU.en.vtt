00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.699
 Hi, everybody today, this one 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.730
 morning we woke up with one 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.400
 nice surprise because apple has 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.640
 in fact finally approved on the app 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.180
 store the developed youtube application 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.420
 from google 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.850
 now if you have followed our blog 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.010
 in recent weeks you will have 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.329
 definitely learned with ios 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.339
 6 apple removed from the beta and then 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.010
 will remove from the final version of the 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:53.640
 firmware your own youtube application 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.789
 this means that unless 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.020
 Please use the web interface 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.609
 youtube application released by 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.420
 google today will be 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.769
 probably the only native software e 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.039
 official that will allow you to 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.440
 use youtube on your iphone or 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.000
 on your ipod touch and at the moment 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.840
 the application is not yet available 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.720
 in fact, for ipad youtube confirms 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.070
 to be at work then compared to 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.229
 classic application that everyone 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.450
 we know this here with 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.890
 the interface very much in style and then 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.399
 we see the most viewed videos with tabs 8 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.399
 search the favorites and the section 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.670
 another the new youtube application 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.830
 much like the graphics of others 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.489
 software developed in the last period 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.830
 from google for example makes me think 

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:49.709
 to the google plus application 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.330
 so we have a tab based navigation 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:56.280
 that gives way to this type 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.750
 display that remembers remembers 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.759
 much is both the application of 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.580
 google google plus both obviously 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.789
 the facebook application then on 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.370
 left we have video categories 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.000
 on the right we have the feed that yes 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.560
 updates automatically both with ours 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.540
 inscriptions then the channels to which 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.069
 we are members who upload new videos 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.579
 both with videos 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:29.620
 suggested by youtube then we open a 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:32.170
 video at random we pause for a moment 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.659
 the reproduction you see we have these 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.810
 three recommended playback tabs e 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.670
 Playback comments allows us to 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.939
 read all the information on the video 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.980
 the title the number of views 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:47.950
 I like the number I don't like 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.010
 upload date and description here 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.959
 we have all this information 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.829
 if we go on recommended instead there 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.540
 refers to that kind of video 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.340
 recommended by youtube those videos 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.250
 correlates that usually come 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.569
 displayed in the web interface 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.879
 so we can scroll here 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.269
 choose other videos that could 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:14.349
 Finally, we are interested in the section 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.239
 comment in this case is empty in which 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.329
 we can practically leave a 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.199
 comment or view what they are 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.400
 been published by other users 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.949
 as for the video instead 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.019
 let's enlarge 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:32.909
 as you can see you can use the 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.290
 player only in landscape mode 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.389
 we therefore have this kind of 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.689
 full screen display 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.310
 very comfortable and then we find at the top a 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:45.879
 left the name of the video just like 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.650
 the native youtube player we have here 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.259
 the play button that allows us to 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.569
 carry on playing 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:54.459
 obviously we can scroll with the 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:59.019
 our finger to move on to a moment 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:02.949
 next of the video we can set 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.959
 I like it on the video obviously in 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:07.689
 in this case login is required with i 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.729
 own data at this time I do not have 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.319
 still done 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:13.590
 we then said we like it not 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.650
 i like sharing button 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:22.360
 sharing on 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.960
 mail twitter here or even google 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.340
 plus 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.340
 obviously all the services supported 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.830
 we still find the possibility of 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:34.689
 add video has the list of 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.039
 those to watch later 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:38.560
 possibility to add your favorites 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.979
 to add a playlist or to 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:46.000
 report it if there are any 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:48.189
 contents we say violent or improper 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.500
 then also very interesting 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:52.960
 search functionality that now beyond 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.979
 to the textual research that was present 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.080
 already in the native application of ios 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.180
 also includes the search feature 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.430
 so we can google voice mail 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.479
 making indirect evidence and see a little 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.479
 how does it work 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:15.340
 iphoneitalia as you see it was 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.860
 recognized the word in this case 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.259
 we have pronounced iphoneitalia and we are 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.779
 just been sent on the channel 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:25.719
 phone italia where we can see i 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:28.509
 videos uploaded in the name of con italia ed 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:30.699
 possibly other channels that 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:34.240
 could match ours 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:37.270
 search we can of course as you can 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.520
 see organize the search by 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:44.259
 relevance of loading number of 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:48.340
 blank views and manage these 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:50.260
 other options precisely to find with 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.860
 without problems the video we are 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.870
 therefore looking for the new application of 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.660
 youtube no longer with navigation tab 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.150
 based but with this swype based like 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.870
 see we can also move into this 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:08.020
 way between the various screens on the 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.000
 left we still find settings 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.820
 that we can modify to ours 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.250
 liking we find the features 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:19.440
 to view popular videos or 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.440
 other types of videos by category 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:27.600
 so this is this app 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:32.639
 practically on ios if it will become almost 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:36.310
 essential if you want to use the 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:39.220
 native interface to play videos 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:42.039
 from youtube in alternative must 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.310
 connect to the web interface that it is 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:48.400
 however good though many 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:51.490
 preferred for certain functions a 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.289
 that of the native application of ios 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.530
 with this new youtube application 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:58.690
 which was really well done 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.220
 there probably wo n't be this anymore 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.110
 need 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.820
 now we just have to wait for the 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.250
 release of the ipad version that 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.580
 surely it will be even more powerful 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.320
 more aesthetically pleasing 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.180
 if you want to know all the others 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.400
 information on the youtube application 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.560
 issued on the day of 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:21.820
 today from google on app store we invite you 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:24.550
 to visit iphoneitalia.com also for 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:27.150
 today everything is a greeting from andrea cervone 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.150
 to the next
