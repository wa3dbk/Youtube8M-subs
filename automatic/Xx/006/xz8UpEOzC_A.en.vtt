00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.839
 hi everyone with you Dima proud 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.730
 and in today's release I want you 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.250
 suggest such an interesting topic for 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.290
 reasoning which is small yet no one 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.570
 raised but at least i'm like 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.170
 video did not meet this is not to this regular 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.590
 embracing something else in general i want 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.269
 confused to tell you about the structure of bmx 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.820
 another feature is max skating and 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.220
 how related discipline is between the plan 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.230
 let's start to understand if to generalize 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.570
 then cycling is possible 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.050
 subdivide into different skills not 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.590
 tricks 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.000
 namely skills and so the first thing why 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.969
 starts everything mixers 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.829
 this is riding on the ground here can be attributed 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.039
 all table flank and all all all that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.629
 connected with skip second this skill 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.690
 ride various tackles 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.210
 pyramid kicker them and so on here 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.949
 can be attributed not even to a fraction and in general 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.710
 all that is connected with the use of tricks on 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.600
 flat figures the third is your skills 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.019
 use all kinds of boxes you 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.630
 soldered all art of st hitting and so on 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.930
 all that is associated with spans from radius 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.290
 departures fourth is all sorts 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.290
 grindas 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.950
 5 is balance and - change of pansies 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.680
 use peck and things like that 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.680
 sixth stage jam , etc. 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.469
 the seventh is your ability to fly out 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.659
 different radii 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:37.659
 This can include such discipline as 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:41.310
 up and 8 and you would like to note this 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.310
 Your mastery of the Volrayders 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.520
 Of course the skills are endless 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.070
 I'll highlight roughly 8 core in my 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.870
 opinion and I want to draw such an analogy with 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.830
 learning foreign languages to 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.400
 understand what I'm driving 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.880
 so in any language have their own tables 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.010
 circuit times and so on in general there are 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.470
 its own structure model on which 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.340
 keeps the whole language and there is a stupid vocabulary 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.350
 stock so here you mix also have your 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.600
 control skills 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.690
 mastery of these little ones 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.630
 bike there is a separate set of tricks 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.209
 here this set of tricks is like a vocabulary 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.720
 stock languages ​​you can learn here the whole 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.760
 vocabulary 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.640
 but you will still say so 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.920
 very broken and incomprehensible can study 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.100
 structure of the language understand how it works and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.780
 then when will you learn new 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.750
 words for yourself you can easily 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.300
 add to your lexicon understand you we are 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.430
 still worth getting started 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.030
 all sorts of skills and not get hung up 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.090
 on tricks 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.500
 you will learn in a bunch of tricks of it all night 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.750
 can not and where to use 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.060
 so will you make them sit on the table 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.890
 or tackle and in fact if you have 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.239
 good bike that what 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.190
 only you will learn what kind of new 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.470
 trick right there you can use in 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.470
 ride your ride and grind 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.530
 and in flight nadir then fuji dance 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.190
 and so on Molotov all these skills 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.130
 disciplines they are also related 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.940
 directly and not directly 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.680
 I will do for example 360 will give 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.620
 you more confidence 60 for example 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.830
 straight from the big steps and skills 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.019
 gwindow will help you control naf y 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.630
 jam and so on such examples can 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.880
 lead set competently and riders 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.330
 develops evenly over all over 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.350
 a little bit 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.209
 and stupid say for example and wit, and I 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.710
 just roll my park my fuck not 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.840
 need 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.900
 same parker and they say i ride only 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.690
 in radius I twist and twist and it’s worth not at all 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.330
 stand it is not right to develop 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.830
 control bike you need to completely 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.230
 at least at the beginner level for sure 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.630
 because if you dive curator into one 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.550
 discipline sooner or later you will reach 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.290
 there is such a moment when you progress 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.800
 will stop or will go very 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.440
 slow 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.630
 if you reach that point then 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.760
 look around can you really 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.790
 get stuck on one thing and you should 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.270
 develop other skills too my advice 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.580
 for beginners 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.830
 if you want to progress then 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.380
 ride whenever possible a 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.900
 Further, as they say the Chinese engine 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.670
 towards my closest development I 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.030
 I understand that keep the park from not all 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.530
 but this is another topic that will 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.400
 tell how to build something from 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.280
 improvised means 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.450
 for now just think about it 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.120
 on your own skating 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.520
 find your weak points and i think you 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.640
 still it is worth starting to fill these 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.250
 spaces the topic of the next video yet 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.160
 unknown it will be or basic tricks 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.980
 on the launcher or nevertheless tutorial under the back 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.300
 I think it will be better if you decide 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:54.260
 what will be all this was the fourth edition 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.840
 schools will be their online both structure and 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.680
 disciplines see you in the following videos 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.680
 until
