what<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.179> can<00:00:15.299> see<00:00:15.360> here<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.049> broadside<00:00:16.680> by

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
what you can see here is a broadside by

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.830 
what you can see here is a broadside by
two<00:00:16.980> ships<00:00:17.520> we've<00:00:17.699> got<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> red<00:00:18.150> ship<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
two ships we've got the red ship and the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.290 
two ships we've got the red ship and the
blue<00:00:19.020> ship<00:00:19.289> have<00:00:19.529> facing<00:00:19.920> off<00:00:20.070> side<00:00:20.699> by<00:00:20.939> side

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
blue ship have facing off side by side

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.599 
blue ship have facing off side by side
in<00:00:21.570> quite<00:00:22.050> an<00:00:22.199> unrealistic<00:00:22.619> scenario<00:00:22.980> but<00:00:23.550> you

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
in quite an unrealistic scenario but you

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.310 
in quite an unrealistic scenario but you
can<00:00:23.820> see<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.420> sort<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.720> damage<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.080> these

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
can see the sort of damage that these

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320 
can see the sort of damage that these
large<00:00:25.619> ship<00:00:25.920> rockets<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.430> do<00:00:26.640> when<00:00:27.180> they

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
large ship rockets can do when they

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.660 
large ship rockets can do when they
fired<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.779> bulk<00:00:28.050> against<00:00:28.800> each<00:00:28.890> other<00:00:29.189> now<00:00:29.369> you

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
fired in bulk against each other now you

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.160 
fired in bulk against each other now you
probably<00:00:29.880> know<00:00:30.119> I'll<00:00:30.269> give<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.990> is

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
probably know I'll give you that this is

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.560 
probably know I'll give you that this is
quite<00:00:31.410> an<00:00:31.560> 18th<00:00:31.920> century<00:00:32.070> sort<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> technology

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
quite an 18th century sort of technology

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.479 
quite an 18th century sort of technology
of<00:00:33.660> broadsiding<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.070> see<00:00:35.250> how<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
of broadsiding you can just see how the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.160 
of broadsiding you can just see how the
missiles<00:00:35.940> are<00:00:36.120> impacting<00:00:36.630> each<00:00:36.750> other<00:00:37.020> and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
missiles are impacting each other and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.600 
missiles are impacting each other and
have<00:00:37.260> little<00:00:37.410> bubbles<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:37.950> caused<00:00:38.129> when<00:00:38.160> two

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
have little bubbles are caused when two

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.520 
have little bubbles are caused when two
missiles<00:00:39.000> from<00:00:39.120> both<00:00:39.360> ships<00:00:39.660> are<00:00:40.200> actually

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
missiles from both ships are actually

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.830 
missiles from both ships are actually
hitting<00:00:40.739> themselves<00:00:41.059> head-on<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.629> looks

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
hitting themselves head-on it looks

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.540 
hitting themselves head-on it looks
absolutely<00:00:43.290> amazing<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> Rockets<00:00:44.460> are

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
absolutely amazing as the Rockets are

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.279 
absolutely amazing as the Rockets are
flying<00:00:44.760> out<00:00:44.969> each<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.480> ships<00:00:45.750> these<00:00:45.899> parts

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
flying out each of ships these parts

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.380 
flying out each of ships these parts
coming<00:00:46.590> off<00:00:46.739> its<00:00:47.250> explosions<00:00:47.820> these<00:00:47.969> fighters

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
coming off its explosions these fighters

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
coming off its explosions these fighters
trying<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> fly<00:00:48.930> by<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.129> imagine<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
trying to fly by and you can imagine a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.790 
trying to fly by and you can imagine a
larger<00:00:51.180> battle<00:00:51.360> maybe<00:00:51.930> between<00:00:52.199> even<00:00:52.620> just

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
larger battle maybe between even just

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.560 
larger battle maybe between even just
two<00:00:52.980> ships<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.460> fighters<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.030> fast<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
two ships with fighters going fast and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.610 
two ships with fighters going fast and
things<00:00:54.780> trying<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> blow<00:00:55.260> each<00:00:55.289> other<00:00:55.440> up

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
things trying to blow each other up

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.170 
things trying to blow each other up
everyone<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.219> their<00:00:56.370> own<00:00:56.489> little<00:00:56.699> missions

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
everyone on their own little missions

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.240 
everyone on their own little missions
just<00:00:57.809> how<00:00:57.960> amazing<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.559> will<00:00:58.680> be<00:00:58.859> obviously

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
just how amazing that will be obviously

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.010 
just how amazing that will be obviously
early<00:00:59.430> stages<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.300> course<00:01:00.510> quite<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> lot

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
early stages then of course quite a lot

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.930 
early stages then of course quite a lot
of<00:01:01.109> lag<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.100> quite<00:01:02.340> tough<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
of lag it's going to be quite tough to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.640 
of lag it's going to be quite tough to
actually<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.480> something<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
actually do something like this on the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.070 
actually do something like this on the
server<00:01:04.890> side<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.939> moment<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:06.930> see

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
server side at the moment you just see

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.600 
server side at the moment you just see
the<00:01:07.170> stream<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.710> rockets<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> absolute

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the stream of rockets the absolute

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.370 
the stream of rockets the absolute
destruction<00:01:09.000> coming<00:01:09.659> from<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> blue<00:01:10.110> ship

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
destruction coming from the blue ship

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.469 
destruction coming from the blue ship
into<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.770> red<00:01:11.130> ship<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> red<00:01:12.240> ships

ones coming from the blue ship and it's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.090 
ones coming from the blue ship and it's
causing<00:01:18.240> absolute<00:01:18.900> destruction<00:01:19.259> even<00:01:20.009> though

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
causing absolute destruction even though

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.980 
causing absolute destruction even though
it<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> quite<00:01:20.850> low<00:01:21.030> frame<00:01:21.299> rate<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.750> still

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it is a quite low frame rate is still

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.859 
it is a quite low frame rate is still
awesome<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:23.280> moving<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.850> we've<00:01:24.509> got<00:01:24.750> these

new automated mini guns and a question
that<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.479> had<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:27.960> soon<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.259> came<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.560> what

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that I had as soon as they came out what

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380 
that I had as soon as they came out what

sort of effect will they have on

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.260 
sort of effect will they have on
fighters<00:01:30.930> now<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.920> pretty<00:01:32.280> good<00:01:32.460> engage<00:01:33.090> in

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.770 
quite a fast fighter they tend to miss
and<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.009> very<00:01:38.250> effective<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:39.360> being<00:01:39.659> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
and this is very effective for being in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.719 
and this is very effective for being in
a<00:01:39.840> fighter<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.650> turn<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.490> fly

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
a fighter because if you turn you fly

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.880 
a fighter because if you turn you fly
quite<00:01:42.000> erratically<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:43.079> find<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.409> very<00:01:43.649> hard

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
quite erratically they find it very hard

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.350 
quite erratically they find it very hard
to<00:01:44.009> hit<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.759> see<00:01:44.939> from<00:01:45.090> some<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
to hit you and you can see from some of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.490 
to hit you and you can see from some of
the<00:01:45.420> maneuvers<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.990> these<00:01:46.110> guys<00:01:46.320> are<00:01:46.470> doing

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the maneuvers that these guys are doing

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.289 
the maneuvers that these guys are doing
here<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.340> they're<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.700> struggling<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
here but they're really struggling to

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.030 
here but they're really struggling to
get<00:01:48.540> hit<00:01:48.810> by<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.020> turrets<00:01:49.560> even<00:01:49.920> though

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
get hit by the turrets even though

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.710 
get hit by the turrets even though
they're<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:50.549> annoying<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.180> they're

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
they're really annoying and they're

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.060 
they're really annoying and they're
actually<00:01:51.840> hitting<00:01:52.140> them<00:01:52.409> every<00:01:52.649> now<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.979> then

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
actually hitting them every now and then

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.230 
actually hitting them every now and then
they're<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.399> doing<00:01:53.670> enough<00:01:53.729> damage<00:01:53.909> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
they're not doing enough damage to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.270 
they're not doing enough damage to
severely<00:01:54.840> cripple<00:01:55.350> their<00:01:55.710> little<00:01:56.040> fighter

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
severely cripple their little fighter

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.310 
severely cripple their little fighter
and<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.090> simply<00:01:57.390> maneuver<00:01:57.810> around<00:01:57.899> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and they can simply maneuver around it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.980 
and they can simply maneuver around it
now<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.579> see<00:01:59.729> as<00:01:59.880> he's<00:02:00.030> heading<00:02:00.450> straight

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
now you can see as he's heading straight

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.389 
now you can see as he's heading straight
on<00:02:01.170> against<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.590> jury<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.950> actually<00:02:02.280> took

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
on against that jury that actually took

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.859 
on against that jury that actually took
his<00:02:02.520> cockpit<00:02:02.790> out<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.329> he's<00:02:03.750> actually

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
his cockpit out and he's actually

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.080 
his cockpit out and he's actually
managed<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> flow<00:02:04.530> off<00:02:04.740> there<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:05.670> can<00:02:05.909> be

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
managed to flow off there so they can be

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.459 
managed to flow off there so they can be
quite<00:02:06.329> dangerous<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.960> you're<00:02:07.110> not<00:02:07.259> careful

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
quite dangerous if you're not careful

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.589 
quite dangerous if you're not careful
you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:08.459> another<00:02:08.729> fighter<00:02:09.060> there<00:02:09.300> trying

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
you can see another fighter there trying

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.630 
you can see another fighter there trying
to<00:02:09.629> use<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.080> ship<00:02:10.319> fly<00:02:10.560> as<00:02:10.709> close<00:02:10.950> as<00:02:11.160> possible

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
to use the ship fly as close as possible

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.360 
to use the ship fly as close as possible
so<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> guns<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:12.540> actually<00:02:12.810> struggling

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
so the guns are actually struggling

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.059 
so the guns are actually struggling
to<00:02:13.670> fire<00:02:13.849> on<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.299> target<00:02:14.599> but<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.650> very

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
to fire on that target but is a very

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.979 
to fire on that target but is a very
nice<00:02:16.340> how<00:02:16.640> they've<00:02:16.790> done<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.540> see<00:02:17.750> here

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
nice how they've done it you see here

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.990 
nice how they've done it you see here
I'll<00:02:18.170> be<00:02:18.319> piloting<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:19.069> nice<00:02:19.220> sauce<00:02:19.489> circle

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
I'll be piloting a nice sauce circle

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.490 
I'll be piloting a nice sauce circle
strafing<00:02:20.269> pattern<00:02:20.720> around<00:02:20.810> attack<00:02:21.200> trying<00:02:21.379> to

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
strafing pattern around attack trying to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.080 
strafing pattern around attack trying to
engage<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:21.950> machine-gun<00:02:22.459> but<00:02:22.879> they're<00:02:23.000> just

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
engage that machine-gun but they're just

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.690 
engage that machine-gun but they're just
so<00:02:23.209> hard<00:02:23.659> to<00:02:23.780> hit<00:02:24.110> now<00:02:24.890> if<00:02:25.129> we<00:02:25.310> move<00:02:25.489> on<00:02:25.640> a

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
so hard to hit now if we move on a

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.369 
so hard to hit now if we move on a
little<00:02:25.940> bit<00:02:26.150> we<00:02:26.330> have<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.480> fighter<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.230> can

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
little bit we have a fighter and you can

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.080 
little bit we have a fighter and you can
see<00:02:27.500> that<00:02:27.650> green<00:02:27.890> lock<00:02:28.190> turned<00:02:28.670> into<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.849> red

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
see that green lock turned into a red

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.490 
see that green lock turned into a red
lock<00:02:29.360> so<00:02:29.569> that<00:02:29.599> means<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.079> machines<00:02:30.349> are

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
lock so that means that the machines are

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.170 
lock so that means that the machines are
getting<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.799> fire<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.549> can<00:02:31.670> see<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
getting to fire and you can see that the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.850 
getting to fire and you can see that the
missile<00:02:32.540> not<00:02:33.049> the<00:02:33.110> missiles<00:02:33.409> but<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.620> machine

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
missile not the missiles but the machine

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.160 
missile not the missiles but the machine
will<00:02:34.010> fire<00:02:34.159> is<00:02:34.280> coming<00:02:34.400> directly<00:02:34.730> behind<00:02:35.209> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
will fire is coming directly behind the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.170 
will fire is coming directly behind the
sort<00:02:36.409> of<00:02:36.500> craft<00:02:36.829> it's<00:02:37.310> only<00:02:37.489> when<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:37.849> get<00:02:38.030> to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
sort of craft it's only when you get to

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.610 
sort of craft it's only when you get to
a<00:02:38.209> certain<00:02:38.450> closer<00:02:39.079> sort<00:02:39.409> of<00:02:39.470> perspective

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
a certain closer sort of perspective

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.710 
a certain closer sort of perspective
that<00:02:40.069> it<00:02:40.159> becomes<00:02:40.459> accurate<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.360> it's<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.540> very

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
that it becomes accurate so it's a very

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.270 
that it becomes accurate so it's a very
good<00:02:41.900> deterrent<00:02:42.409> for<00:02:42.560> pirates<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.099> other

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
good deterrent for pirates and other

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.009 
good deterrent for pirates and other
things<00:02:43.519> at<00:02:44.150> distance<00:02:44.569> because<00:02:44.900> they

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
things at distance because they

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.809 
things at distance because they
necessarily<00:02:45.260> won't<00:02:45.739> destroy<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.250> but<00:02:46.579> they'll

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
necessarily won't destroy it but they'll

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.520 
necessarily won't destroy it but they'll
send<00:02:47.090> them<00:02:47.209> running<00:02:47.420> tell<00:02:48.109> you<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.230> truth<00:02:48.410> you

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
send them running tell you the truth you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.869 
send them running tell you the truth you
can<00:02:48.650> see<00:02:48.769> how's<00:02:48.980> my<00:02:49.129> engines<00:02:49.459> are<00:02:49.549> starting<00:02:49.790> to

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
can see how's my engines are starting to

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.640 
can see how's my engines are starting to
smoke<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.420> pass<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:50.750> standard<00:02:51.109> ship<00:02:51.290> off<00:02:51.470> as

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
smoke and pass the standard ship off as

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.430 
smoke and pass the standard ship off as
they<00:02:52.190> actually<00:02:52.489> start<00:02:52.730> nailing<00:02:53.599> to<00:02:53.959> my<00:02:54.079> armor

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
they actually start nailing to my armor

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.990 
they actually start nailing to my armor
and<00:02:54.470> take<00:02:54.739> out<00:02:54.980> them<00:02:55.190> key<00:02:55.430> elements<00:02:55.849> such<00:02:55.970> as

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
and take out them key elements such as

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.569 
and take out them key elements such as
my<00:02:56.209> engines<00:02:56.599> and<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:56.959> on<00:02:57.109> anyway<00:02:57.950> let's<00:02:58.370> move

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
my engines and so on anyway let's move

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.449 
my engines and so on anyway let's move
on<00:02:58.900> now<00:02:59.900> the<00:02:59.959> next<00:03:00.290> question<00:03:00.409> I<00:03:00.709> had<00:03:00.920> was<00:03:01.190> how

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
on now the next question I had was how

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.979 
on now the next question I had was how
effective<00:03:02.209> would<00:03:02.390> they<00:03:02.540> be<00:03:02.659> against

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
effective would they be against

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.110 
effective would they be against
torpedoes<00:03:03.560> like<00:03:03.859> launched<00:03:04.250> like<00:03:04.819> we've<00:03:04.970> been

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
torpedoes like launched like we've been

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.849 
torpedoes like launched like we've been
launching<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.629> tested<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.079> past<00:03:06.109> and<00:03:06.560> now

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
launching and tested in the past and now

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.819 
launching and tested in the past and now
these<00:03:07.849> are<00:03:07.909> extremely<00:03:08.690> dangerous<00:03:09.049> I<00:03:09.590> mean<00:03:09.739> the

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
these are extremely dangerous I mean the

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.520 
these are extremely dangerous I mean the
torpedoes<00:03:10.400> can't<00:03:10.790> even<00:03:11.090> get<00:03:11.269> close<00:03:11.629> so<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
torpedoes can't even get close so the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.559 
torpedoes can't even get close so the
thing<00:03:12.709> is<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:13.609> probably<00:03:13.879> asked<00:03:14.060> him<00:03:14.239> as<00:03:14.329> well

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
thing is you probably asked him as well

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.990 
thing is you probably asked him as well
is<00:03:14.780> why<00:03:15.109> is<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.769> damn<00:03:15.950> little<00:03:16.159> decoy<00:03:16.579> cubes<00:03:16.879> on

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
is why is the damn little decoy cubes on

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.970 
is why is the damn little decoy cubes on
the<00:03:17.030> top<00:03:17.269> Eidos<00:03:17.569> well<00:03:17.780> when<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.319> factions<00:03:18.769> get

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
the top Eidos well when the factions get

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.220 
the top Eidos well when the factions get
implemented<00:03:19.400> each<00:03:20.299> little<00:03:20.660> block<00:03:20.930> will<00:03:21.109> be

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
implemented each little block will be

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.809 
implemented each little block will be
assigned<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.829> faction<00:03:22.250> once<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:22.579> built

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
assigned to that faction once you built

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.360 
assigned to that faction once you built
it<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:23.450> it'll<00:03:23.810> be<00:03:23.989> like<00:03:24.200> having<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:24.650> decoy<00:03:25.040> and

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
it so it'll be like having a decoy and

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.860 
it so it'll be like having a decoy and
since<00:03:25.669> this<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:25.910> an<00:03:26.000> enemy<00:03:26.329> sort<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.630> block

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
since this is an enemy sort of block

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.750 
since this is an enemy sort of block
it'll<00:03:27.440> be<00:03:27.590> automatically<00:03:28.069> locked<00:03:28.340> on<00:03:28.549> and

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
it'll be automatically locked on and

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.210 
it'll be automatically locked on and
shut<00:03:28.970> up<00:03:29.180> if<00:03:29.480> it's<00:03:30.019> been<00:03:30.200> well<00:03:30.769> programmed

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
shut up if it's been well programmed

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.890 
shut up if it's been well programmed
into<00:03:31.370> little<00:03:31.730> torii<00:03:31.940> from<00:03:32.180> inside<00:03:32.510> so<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:32.840> can

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
into little torii from inside so you can

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.150 
into little torii from inside so you can
just<00:03:33.079> see<00:03:33.230> how<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.349> nail<00:03:33.680> in<00:03:33.859> there<00:03:34.040> they

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
just see how the nail in there they

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.710 
just see how the nail in there they
won't<00:03:34.250> even<00:03:34.370> let<00:03:34.579> them<00:03:34.730> turrets<00:03:35.150> get<00:03:35.359> as<00:03:35.450> close

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
won't even let them turrets get as close

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.619 
won't even let them turrets get as close
to<00:03:36.410> do<00:03:36.620> any<00:03:36.769> damage<00:03:36.950> now<00:03:37.579> we<00:03:37.639> move<00:03:37.879> on<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.150> large

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
to do any damage now we move on to large

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.110 
to do any damage now we move on to large

ship 19 missile rocket pods now these

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.689 
ship 19 missile rocket pods now these
things<00:03:41.359> are<00:03:41.569> badass<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:43.099> problem<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.519> though

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
things are badass the problem is though

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.330 
things are badass the problem is though
you<00:03:43.760> tend<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.180> Ram<00:03:44.510> people<00:03:44.989> transuranic<00:03:45.739> get

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
you tend to Ram people transuranic get

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.030 
you tend to Ram people transuranic get
an<00:03:46.459> accurate<00:03:46.849> shot<00:03:46.879> it's<00:03:47.540> very<00:03:47.810> hard<00:03:48.109> now<00:03:48.769> this

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
an accurate shot it's very hard now this

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.860 
an accurate shot it's very hard now this
is<00:03:49.190> sage<00:03:49.400> ships<00:03:49.760> I'd<00:03:50.030> shipped<00:03:50.299> went<00:03:50.569> with<00:03:50.720> more

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
is sage ships I'd shipped went with more

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.629 
is sage ships I'd shipped went with more
the<00:03:50.959> heavy<00:03:51.169> armor<00:03:51.440> design<00:03:51.829> a<00:03:51.859> bulky<00:03:52.340> sort<00:03:52.549> of

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
the heavy armor design a bulky sort of

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.069 
the heavy armor design a bulky sort of
ship<00:03:52.819> and<00:03:53.000> you<00:03:53.060> had<00:03:53.389> this<00:03:53.540> really<00:03:53.750> nice

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
ship and you had this really nice

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.680 
ship and you had this really nice
interior<00:03:54.500> cockpit<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.699> he<00:03:55.849> went<00:03:56.090> with<00:03:56.269> them<00:03:56.419> I

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
interior cockpit and he went with them I

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.210 
interior cockpit and he went with them I
think<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:56.930> was<00:03:57.019> for<00:03:57.290> rocket<00:03:57.650> pods<00:03:57.859> on<00:03:58.099> each

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
think it was for rocket pods on each

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.369 
think it was for rocket pods on each
wing<00:03:58.489> and<00:03:58.699> then<00:03:59.090> tazzy<00:03:59.480> went<00:03:59.720> with<00:03:59.840> sort<00:04:00.109> of<00:04:00.199> a

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
wing and then tazzy went with sort of a

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.619 
wing and then tazzy went with sort of a
civilian<00:04:00.889> transport<00:04:01.069> with<00:04:01.639> a<00:04:01.669> light<00:04:02.090> rocket

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
civilian transport with a light rocket

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.479 
civilian transport with a light rocket
sort<00:04:02.870> of<00:04:02.989> setup<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.829> they<00:04:03.980> both<00:04:04.190> worked

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
sort of setup and they both worked

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.909 
sort of setup and they both worked
extremely<00:04:04.910> well<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.629> the<00:04:06.139> machine<00:04:06.470> guns<00:04:06.709> from

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
extremely well and the machine guns from

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.229 
extremely well and the machine guns from
the<00:04:07.099> other<00:04:07.220> ship<00:04:07.519> when<00:04:07.669> they<00:04:07.760> locked<00:04:08.000> on

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
the other ship when they locked on

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.360 
the other ship when they locked on
didn't<00:04:08.690> do<00:04:08.780> too<00:04:08.989> much<00:04:09.139> damage<00:04:09.199> now<00:04:10.069> there's<00:04:10.310> a

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
didn't do too much damage now there's a

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.009 
didn't do too much damage now there's a
final<00:04:10.699> test<00:04:10.910> that<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.180> wanted<00:04:11.359> to<00:04:11.419> show<00:04:11.629> you<00:04:11.660> now

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
final test that I wanted to show you now

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.089 
final test that I wanted to show you now
you<00:04:12.079> can<00:04:12.260> see<00:04:12.440> how<00:04:12.590> there's<00:04:12.769> two<00:04:12.919> layers

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
you can see how there's two layers

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.220 
you can see how there's two layers
they're<00:04:13.699> deep<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.269> decoy<00:04:14.629> block<00:04:14.870> is<00:04:15.049> on<00:04:15.169> the

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
they're deep the decoy block is on the

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.689 
they're deep the decoy block is on the
layer<00:04:15.379> behind<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.980> it<00:04:16.070> can't<00:04:16.310> actually<00:04:16.459> be

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
layer behind and it can't actually be

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.560 
layer behind and it can't actually be
seen<00:04:16.940> by<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.239> turret<00:04:17.769> now<00:04:18.940> as<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.060> can<00:04:20.180> see<00:04:20.239> it

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
seen by the turret now as you can see it

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.110 
seen by the turret now as you can see it
can<00:04:20.810> see<00:04:21.019> a<00:04:21.199> very<00:04:21.590> narrow<00:04:22.039> little<00:04:22.610> passage<00:04:23.030> so

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
can see a very narrow little passage so

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.670 
can see a very narrow little passage so
if<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.300> just<00:04:23.450> caught<00:04:23.630> this<00:04:23.719> one<00:04:23.990> block<00:04:24.260> away<00:04:24.320> and

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
if I just caught this one block away and

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.450 
if I just caught this one block away and
it's<00:04:24.800> able<00:04:25.099> to<00:04:25.190> get<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.340> sight<00:04:25.580> on<00:04:25.729> it'll<00:04:25.969> use

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
it's able to get a sight on it'll use

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.120 
it's able to get a sight on it'll use
a little<00:04:26.729> wrong<00:04:26.940> block<00:04:27.270> gap<00:04:27.569> now<00:04:28.289> the<00:04:28.770> decoy

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
a little wrong block gap now the decoy

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.400 
a little wrong block gap now the decoy
block<00:04:29.400> is<00:04:29.910> effects<00:04:30.360> whatever<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:31.050> actually

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
block is effects whatever it actually

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.350 
block is effects whatever it actually
touches<00:04:31.979> as<00:04:32.160> you<00:04:32.310> can<00:04:32.460> see<00:04:32.580> if<00:04:32.759> I<00:04:32.880> touch<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.270> on

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
touches as you can see if I touch it on

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.490 
touches as you can see if I touch it on
this<00:04:33.479> block<00:04:33.750> even<00:04:33.930> though<00:04:34.139> you<00:04:34.229> can<00:04:34.410> actually

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
this block even though you can actually

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.439 
this block even though you can actually
see<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.949> decoy<00:04:35.340> it's<00:04:35.910> still<00:04:36.060> going<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.270> fire

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
see the decoy it's still going to fire

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.790 
see the decoy it's still going to fire
through<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.960> panel<00:04:37.319> because<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:37.650> can

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
through that panel because you can

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.040 
through that panel because you can
actually<00:04:37.889> see<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.789> play<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:39.479> if<00:04:39.569> I<00:04:39.690> do<00:04:39.750> this

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
actually see that play so if I do this

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.460 
actually see that play so if I do this
here

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
here

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.820 
here
now<00:04:41.160> what<00:04:41.699> I<00:04:41.729> want<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.060> test<00:04:42.270> out<00:04:42.479> here<00:04:42.720> is<00:04:42.960> what

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
now what I want to test out here is what

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.469 
now what I want to test out here is what
your<00:04:43.949> target<00:04:44.550> if<00:04:44.729> they're<00:04:44.940> all<00:04:45.090> at<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.300> same

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
your target if they're all at the same

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.969 
your target if they're all at the same
distance<00:04:45.990> away<00:04:46.139> from<00:04:46.259> it<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:46.650> you<00:04:46.710> can<00:04:46.860> see

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
distance away from it and you can see

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.469 
distance away from it and you can see
what<00:04:47.160> it<00:04:47.220> does<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.490> jumps<00:04:47.849> between<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.270> little

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
what it does it jumps between the little

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.330 
what it does it jumps between the little
targets<00:04:48.900> doing<00:04:49.259> equal<00:04:49.530> damage<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.009> them<00:04:50.160> all

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
targets doing equal damage to them all

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.360 
targets doing equal damage to them all
and<00:04:50.550> it's<00:04:51.270> very<00:04:51.630> nice<00:04:51.840> very<00:04:52.169> effective<00:04:52.800> even

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
and it's very nice very effective even

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.650 
and it's very nice very effective even
though<00:04:53.430> all<00:04:53.639> them<00:04:53.819> targets<00:04:54.240> at<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.449> same

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
though all them targets at the same

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.270 
though all them targets at the same
distance<00:04:54.870> so<00:04:55.169> thanks<00:04:55.410> for<00:04:55.500> watching<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:56.160> I'll

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
distance so thanks for watching and I'll

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.819 
distance so thanks for watching and I'll
see<00:04:56.310> you<00:04:56.490> next<00:04:56.699> time
