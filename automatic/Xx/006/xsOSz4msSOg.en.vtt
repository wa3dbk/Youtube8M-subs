00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.830 
applying it starting off it goes on a
little<00:03:11.920> bit<00:03:12.129> matte<00:03:12.400> but<00:03:13.000> once<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.450> finished

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
little bit matte but once I finished

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.449 
little bit matte but once I finished
applying<00:03:14.139> it<00:03:14.379> to<00:03:14.530> my<00:03:14.650> full<00:03:14.920> face

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
applying it to my full face

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.399 
applying it to my full face
I<00:03:15.489> did<00:03:15.730> notice<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.359> saw<00:03:16.659> a<00:03:16.689> little<00:03:16.930> bit<00:03:17.109> of<00:03:17.200> oil

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
I did notice I saw a little bit of oil

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.610 
I did notice I saw a little bit of oil
through<00:03:18.150> like<00:03:19.150> my<00:03:19.359> cheekbone<00:03:19.840> area<00:03:20.079> so<00:03:20.530> I'll

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
through like my cheekbone area so I'll

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.289 
through like my cheekbone area so I'll
probably<00:03:20.769> go<00:03:21.099> in<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.489> set<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.849> with<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.269> powder

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
probably go in and set it with a powder

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.690 
probably go in and set it with a powder

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:10.479 
always look for foundations that tend to

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.210 
always look for foundations that tend to
have<00:04:10.629> pumps<00:04:11.019> because<00:04:11.169> I<00:04:11.590> don't<00:04:11.769> like<00:04:11.889> to<00:04:12.040> waste
