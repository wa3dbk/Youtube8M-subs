motion<00:02:11.849> small

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
motion small

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.580 
motion small
circles<00:02:14.510> putting<00:02:15.510> on<00:02:15.659> their<00:02:15.989> getting<00:02:16.439> in

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
circles putting on their getting in

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.039 
circles putting on their getting in
every<00:02:17.010> little<00:02:17.430> area<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.480> can<00:02:18.629> get<00:02:18.870> in

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
every little area that you can get in

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:26.569 
every little area that you can get in
basically<00:02:21.829> no<00:02:23.629> particular<00:02:24.629> method<00:02:25.549> but<00:02:26.549> I

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
basically no particular method but I

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.179 
basically no particular method but I
like<00:02:26.939> to<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.390> use<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.170> know<00:02:28.290> swirling<00:02:29.069> it

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
like to just use you know swirling it

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.920 
like to just use you know swirling it
around<00:02:29.250> sort<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.909> like<00:02:30.030> if<00:02:30.209> you're<00:02:30.359> bopping<00:02:30.840> a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
around sort of like if you're bopping a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.089 
around sort of like if you're bopping a
car<00:02:32.599> like<00:02:33.599> I<00:02:33.750> said<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.019> used<00:02:34.290> quite<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.680> bit<00:02:34.799> on

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
car like I said I used quite a bit on

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.140 
car like I said I used quite a bit on
this<00:02:35.310> one<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:38.250> actually<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.849> turned

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
this one and and it actually it turned

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.039 
this one and and it actually it turned
out<00:02:39.239> really<00:02:39.299> well

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.259 

the<00:02:43.950> biggest<00:02:44.400> thing<00:02:44.639> you're<00:02:44.790> gonna<00:02:44.939> want<00:02:45.180> to

the biggest thing you're gonna want to

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.449 
the biggest thing you're gonna want to
look<00:02:45.480> for<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:46.079> make<00:02:46.319> sure<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.709> get<00:02:46.889> every

look for is make sure you get every
little<00:02:47.909> area<00:02:48.419> on<00:02:49.609> the<00:02:50.609> fog<00:02:50.939> light<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.659> could

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
little area on the fog light you could

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.379 
little area on the fog light you could
do<00:02:52.109> it<00:02:52.319> just<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.069> little<00:02:53.370> bit<00:02:53.519> at<00:02:53.669> a<00:02:53.700> time<00:02:53.819> but

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
do it just a little bit at a time but

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.129 
do it just a little bit at a time but
since<00:02:54.569> this<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.019> such<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> small<00:02:55.739> light<00:02:57.139> you

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
since this is such a small light you

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.629 
since this is such a small light you
know<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.349> might<00:02:58.709> as<00:02:58.919> well<00:02:58.950> do<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.609> whole

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
know you might as well do the whole

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.479 
know you might as well do the whole
thing<00:03:00.060> at<00:03:00.180> once<00:03:00.209> now<00:03:01.200> yeah<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.980> works<00:03:02.250> for

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
thing at once now yeah this works for

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.890 
thing at once now yeah this works for
fog<00:03:02.819> lights<00:03:03.799> headlights<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:05.609> mean<00:03:06.419> for<00:03:06.629> tail

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
that's when you're gonna have to buff it

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.710 
that's when you're gonna have to buff it
a<00:04:01.199> little<00:04:01.379> harder<00:04:01.859> and<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:03.060> can<00:04:03.239> actually

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
a little harder and you can actually

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.390 
a little harder and you can actually
you'll<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:04.109> keep<00:04:04.319> buffing<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.889> till<00:04:05.129> the

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
you'll just keep buffing it till the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.770 
you'll just keep buffing it till the
toothpaste<00:04:06.030> comes<00:04:06.389> out<00:04:06.659> which<00:04:07.229> gets<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.829> little

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
toothpaste comes out which gets a little

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.469 
toothpaste comes out which gets a little
tiresome<00:04:09.780> because<00:04:10.909> it<00:04:11.909> doesn't<00:04:12.299> come<00:04:12.449> off

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479 
tiresome because it doesn't come off

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:17.360 
tiresome because it doesn't come off
super<00:04:13.169> easy<00:04:13.879> so<00:04:14.900> it's<00:04:15.900> not<00:04:16.169> it's<00:04:16.650> not<00:04:16.829> gonna<00:04:17.159> be

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
super easy so it's not it's not gonna be

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.409 
super easy so it's not it's not gonna be
soft<00:04:17.909> the<00:04:18.150> whole<00:04:18.299> time<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:19.549> could<00:04:20.549> imagine<00:04:20.880> if

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
soft the whole time I could imagine if

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.209 
soft the whole time I could imagine if
it<00:04:21.659> gets<00:04:21.870> too<00:04:22.139> hard<00:04:22.409> you're<00:04:22.770> just<00:04:22.979> like

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
it gets too hard you're just like

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.550 
it gets too hard you're just like
whatever<00:04:23.789> I<00:04:23.969> want<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.690> get<00:04:24.840> this<00:04:24.990> stuff<00:04:25.169> off<00:04:25.349> my

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
whatever I want to get this stuff off my

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.540 
whatever I want to get this stuff off my
light<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.979> could<00:04:26.070> just<00:04:26.279> spray

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
light you could just spray

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.399 
light you could just spray
like<00:04:26.819> detail<00:04:27.240> or<00:04:27.449> even<00:04:27.720> water<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.229> just<00:04:28.319> wipe

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.409 
like detail or even water and just wipe

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.700 
like detail or even water and just wipe
it<00:04:28.740> off<00:04:28.889> and<00:04:29.129> it<00:04:29.909> probably<00:04:30.720> could<00:04:30.900> be<00:04:30.930> okay<00:04:31.409> I

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
it off and it probably could be okay I

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.279 
it off and it probably could be okay I
haven't<00:04:32.310> done<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.520> yet<00:04:32.970> but<00:04:33.690> right<00:04:34.050> there

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
haven't done that yet but right there

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.379 
haven't done that yet but right there
you<00:04:34.530> can<00:04:34.650> see<00:04:34.889> it's<00:04:35.190> starting<00:04:35.759> to<00:04:35.789> get<00:04:36.030> cleared

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
you can see it's starting to get cleared
