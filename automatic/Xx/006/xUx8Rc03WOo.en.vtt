dollars<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.500> year<00:01:11.000> but<00:01:12.000> that's<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
dollars a year but that's just the the

dollars a year but that's just the the
development<00:01:13.500> stage<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:14.130> once<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
development stage because once the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.280 
development stage because once the
technology<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.119> adopted<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.750> course<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.080> costs

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
technology is adopted of course it costs

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.469 
technology is adopted of course it costs
considerably<00:01:16.650> more<00:01:17.130> wins<00:01:17.400> put<00:01:18.150> into<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
considerably more wins put into the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.660 
considerably more wins put into the
military<00:01:18.689> industrial<00:01:19.049> complex<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:21.479> have

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
military industrial complex so we have

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.700

fact some suspect that military
technology<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.460> actually<00:01:50.880> 50<00:01:51.119> years<00:01:51.509> in

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
technology is actually 50 years in

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.310 
technology is actually 50 years in
advance<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.439> what<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:53.579> publicly<00:01:54.570> now<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
advance of what we see publicly now and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.740 
advance of what we see publicly now and
I<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.979> no<00:01:56.159> reason<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.820> believe<00:01:57.329> that

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
I have no reason not to believe that

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.020 
I have no reason not to believe that
considering<00:01:58.229> how<00:01:58.950> long<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.399> stealth<00:01:59.729> bomber

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
considering how long the stealth bomber

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.940 
considering how long the stealth bomber
was<00:02:00.420> kept<00:02:00.689> under<00:02:00.930> wraps<00:02:00.960> before<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.799> was

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
was kept under wraps before that was

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.980 
was kept under wraps before that was
revealed<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.180> course<00:02:03.390> now<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
revealed and of course now we have a

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.550 
revealed and of course now we have a
whole<00:02:04.350> panorama<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.640> stealth<00:02:06.229> technology<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
whole panorama of stealth technology and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.650 
whole panorama of stealth technology and
stealth<00:02:08.129> equipment<00:02:08.700> stealth<00:02:09.030> planes<00:02:09.390> and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
stealth equipment stealth planes and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.680 
stealth equipment stealth planes and
tanks<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:11.459> now<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.940> technology<00:02:12.660> is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
tanks and so now that technology is

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.830 
tanks and so now that technology is
completely<00:02:13.140> revealed<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.489> today<00:02:15.180> DARPA's

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
completely revealed so today DARPA's

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.860 
completely revealed so today DARPA's
mission<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.349> still<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.790> prevent

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
mission is still to prevent

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.470 
mission is still to prevent
technological<00:02:18.870> surprise<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.010> US<00:02:20.459> but<00:02:21.330> it

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
technological surprise on the US but it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.510 
technological surprise on the US but it
also<00:02:21.660> has<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.080> create<00:02:22.520> technological

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
also has to create technological

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.900 
also has to create technological
surprise<00:02:23.940> for<00:02:24.450> our<00:02:24.660> enemies<00:02:24.930> and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
surprise for our enemies and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.059 
surprise for our enemies and
interestingly<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.480> was<00:02:27.660> established<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.379> 1958

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
interestingly it was established in 1958

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.610 
interestingly it was established in 1958
in<00:02:29.459> response<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.480> Russians<00:02:31.230> putting

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
in response to the Russians putting

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.710 
in response to the Russians putting
these<00:02:31.860> first<00:02:32.190> satellites<00:02:32.879> may<00:02:33.150> split<00:02:33.480> Nick

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
these first satellites may split Nick

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.170 
these first satellites may split Nick
and<00:02:36.620> we<00:02:37.620> didn't<00:02:37.980> we<00:02:38.340> were<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:38.580> surprised<00:02:39.000> by

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
and we didn't we were so surprised by

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.910 
and we didn't we were so surprised by
their<00:02:39.390> technological<00:02:39.840> advance<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.800> we

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
their technological advance that we

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.470 
their technological advance that we
wanted<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.430> make<00:02:41.580> sure<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.760> never<00:02:42.060> happened

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
wanted to make sure that never happened

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.360 
wanted to make sure that never happened
again<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.349> think<00:02:43.739> one<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> funniest

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
again so I think one of the funniest

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.820 
again so I think one of the funniest
things<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.940> me<00:02:45.060> about<00:02:45.209> DARPA<00:02:46.200> if<00:02:46.530> there's

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
things to me about DARPA if there's

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.320 
things to me about DARPA if there's
anything<00:02:47.099> funny<00:02:47.459> about<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:48.000> fact<00:02:48.180> that

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
anything funny about is the fact that

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.729 
anything funny about is the fact that
they<00:02:48.650> drop<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.860> defense<00:02:50.310> part<00:02:50.849> of<00:02:51.060> their<00:02:51.239> name

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
they drop the defense part of their name

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.190 
they drop the defense part of their name
over<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.830> years<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.280> then<00:02:53.430> gone<00:02:53.670> back<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:54.239> so

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
over the years and then gone back to so

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.710 
over the years and then gone back to so
a<00:02:55.590> few<00:02:56.340> times<00:02:56.640> in<00:02:56.940> its<00:02:57.120> history<00:02:57.209> it's<00:02:57.599> been

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
a few times in its history it's been

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.540 
a few times in its history it's been
known<00:02:57.900> as<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.200> Advanced<00:02:58.650> Research<00:02:58.709> Projects

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
known as the Advanced Research Projects

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.339 
known as the Advanced Research Projects
Agency<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.599> then<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.810> goes<00:03:00.900> back<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
Agency and then it goes back to the

Defense Advanced Research Project agency

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.110 
Defense Advanced Research Project agency
and<00:03:04.050> then<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.620> goes<00:03:04.739> back<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.250> Advanced

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
Research Projects Agency and now again

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.820 
Research Projects Agency and now again
it's<00:03:09.360> back<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.840> Defense<00:03:10.379> Advanced

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
Research Project agency for some reason

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.229 
Research Project agency for some reason
they<00:03:13.620> get<00:03:13.890> more<00:03:14.040> self-conscious<00:03:14.519> about<00:03:14.819> using

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
they get more self-conscious about using

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.970 
they get more self-conscious about using
the<00:03:15.330> word<00:03:15.510> defense<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.200> over<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.620> years<00:03:16.769> but

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
the word defense and over the years but

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.160 
the word defense and over the years but
that<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.790> nature<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.480> government<00:03:18.750> I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
that is the nature of government I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.309 
that is the nature of government I
suppose<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:22.159> they<00:03:23.159> have<00:03:23.459> six<00:03:24.060> basic<00:03:24.750> programs

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
suppose and they have six basic programs

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.640 
suppose and they have six basic programs
they<00:03:25.739> have<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:26.280> one<00:03:27.150> which<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.599> the<00:03:27.780> adaptive

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
they have the one which is the adaptive

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.320 
they have the one which is the adaptive
executive<00:03:29.720> which<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.970> coming<00:03:32.970> up<00:03:33.120> with

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
executive which is the coming up with

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.930 
executive which is the coming up with
more<00:03:33.739> interesting<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.010> innovative<00:03:35.340> ways

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
more interesting and innovative ways

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.369 
more interesting and innovative ways
using<00:03:36.420> new<00:03:36.720> technologies<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:38.659> manage<00:03:39.659> the

using new technologies to manage the

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.460 
using new technologies to manage the
battlefield<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.430> then<00:03:42.420> we<00:03:42.569> have<00:03:42.750> their

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
battlefield and then we have their

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.680 
battlefield and then we have their
second<00:03:43.950> program<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.519> defense<00:03:45.120> sciences

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
second program is the defense sciences

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.559 
second program is the defense sciences
which<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.170> course<00:03:46.200> is<00:03:46.500> all<00:03:46.709> sorts<00:03:47.099> of<00:03:47.569> weapons

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
which of course is all sorts of weapons

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.630 
which of course is all sorts of weapons
including<00:03:49.019> on<00:03:49.470> lethal<00:03:50.069> weapons<00:03:50.489> like

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
including on lethal weapons like

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.890 
including on lethal weapons like
microwave<00:03:51.239> episode<00:03:51.950> particle<00:03:52.950> beams<00:03:53.159> and

microwave episode particle beams and

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.149 
microwave episode particle beams and
number<00:03:54.900> their<00:03:55.230> third<00:03:55.500> program<00:03:55.830> is<00:03:56.129> the

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
number their third program is the

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.300 
number their third program is the
information<00:03:57.000> innovation<00:03:57.890> which<00:03:58.890> essentially

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
information innovation which essentially

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.250 
information innovation which essentially
is<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.549> way<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.090> create<00:04:01.250> cognitive<00:04:02.250> dissonance

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
is a way to create cognitive dissonance

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.830 
is a way to create cognitive dissonance
to<00:04:04.260> use<00:04:04.590> information<00:04:05.370> on<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.209> battlefield

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
to use information on the battlefield

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.890 
to use information on the battlefield
and<00:04:07.340> then<00:04:08.340> we<00:04:08.489> have<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:09.420> number<00:04:09.750> for

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
and then we have the number for

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.229 
and then we have the number for
programmers<00:04:10.620> Microsystems<00:04:11.610> technology

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
which of course is everything involved

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.740 
which of course is everything involved
in<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.689> nuts<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:16.199> bolts<00:04:16.699> daily<00:04:17.720> running<00:04:18.720> of

in the nuts and bolts daily running of
the<00:04:19.650> military<00:04:20.100> machine<00:04:20.600> then<00:04:21.600> we<00:04:21.720> have<00:04:21.900> number

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
the military machine then we have number

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.379 
the military machine then we have number
five<00:04:22.620> as<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.070> strategic<00:04:23.729> technology

so so this is an important organization
to<00:07:11.910> know<00:07:12.060> about<00:07:12.210> DARPA<00:07:13.110> and<00:07:13.290> I'll<00:07:14.040> put<00:07:14.220> a<00:07:14.250> bunch

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
to know about DARPA and I'll put a bunch

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.430 
to know about DARPA and I'll put a bunch

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 
we have a lot of military technology

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.409 
we have a lot of military technology
that's<00:07:29.280> being<00:07:29.430> developed<00:07:29.730> it's<00:07:30.180> very

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 
that's being developed it's very

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:35.360 
that's being developed it's very
innovative<00:07:30.720> very<00:07:32.120> futuristic<00:07:34.100> very<00:07:35.100> much

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.370 
innovative very futuristic very much

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.150 
innovative very futuristic very much
under<00:07:35.760> wraps<00:07:36.000> and<00:07:36.450> in<00:07:37.080> the<00:07:37.290> future<00:07:37.500> a<00:07:37.710> lot<00:07:37.890> of

under wraps and in the future a lot of

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.310 
under wraps and in the future a lot of
this<00:07:38.280> technology<00:07:38.640> can<00:07:39.120> be<00:07:39.240> used<00:07:39.270> for<00:07:39.630> civilian

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:40.320 
this technology can be used for civilian

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.940 
this technology can be used for civilian
use<00:07:40.350> as<00:07:40.680> well<00:07:41.400> and<00:07:41.760> so<00:07:42.120> we'll<00:07:42.300> see<00:07:42.450> a<00:07:42.480> lot<00:07:42.630> of<00:07:42.690> a

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:42.950 
use as well and so we'll see a lot of a

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.290 
use as well and so we'll see a lot of a
great<00:07:43.950> developments<00:07:44.520> come<00:07:44.669> out<00:07:44.790> of<00:07:44.910> this<00:07:45.060> but

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 
great developments come out of this but

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.690 
great developments come out of this but
as<00:07:45.540> usual<00:07:45.900> there's<00:07:46.380> a<00:07:46.440> very<00:07:46.650> dark<00:07:47.250> side<00:07:47.550> to

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:47.700 
as usual there's a very dark side to

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.570 
as usual there's a very dark side to
what<00:07:47.850> DARPA<00:07:48.270> does<00:07:48.510> and<00:07:49.580> developing

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580 
what DARPA does and developing

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.740 
what DARPA does and developing
futuristic<00:07:51.480> military<00:07:52.220> technology<00:07:53.220> and

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:53.750 
futuristic military technology and

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.600 
futuristic military technology and
police<00:07:54.750> surveillance<00:07:55.080> date<00:07:55.470> technology<00:07:55.680> so<00:07:56.580> a

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:56.610 
police surveillance date technology so a

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.550 
police surveillance date technology so a
mixed<00:07:57.060> blessing<00:07:57.180> like<00:07:57.660> everything<00:07:58.229> we<00:07:58.320> did<00:07:58.410> we

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 
mixed blessing like everything we did we

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.010 
mixed blessing like everything we did we
get<00:07:58.710> from<00:07:58.860> the<00:07:59.010> government<00:07:59.430> I'm<00:08:00.270> useful<00:08:00.750> idiot

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.020 
get from the government I'm useful idiot

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.220 
get from the government I'm useful idiot
don't<00:08:01.470> you<00:08:01.590> be<00:08:01.800> 12
