56<00:00:10.550> now<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.849> thought<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.330> myself<00:00:12.360> if<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.049> were<00:00:13.200> to

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
56 now I thought to myself if I were to

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.620 
56 now I thought to myself if I were to
take<00:00:13.410> these<00:00:13.590> same<00:00:13.799> coordinates<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.630> plug

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
take these same coordinates and plug

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.000 
take these same coordinates and plug
them<00:00:15.780> into<00:00:16.730> google<00:00:17.730> earth<00:00:17.880> sky<00:00:18.560> if<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.770> may

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
them into google earth sky if I may

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.519 
them into google earth sky if I may
possibly<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> same<00:00:21.000> image<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:22.170> see<00:00:22.350> how

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
possibly get the same image you see how

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.029 
possibly get the same image you see how
that<00:00:22.590> these<00:00:22.890> images<00:00:23.369> were<00:00:23.580> taking<00:00:24.000> taken<00:00:24.869> in

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
that these images were taking taken in

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.790 
that these images were taking taken in
2007<00:00:26.570> around<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.720> time<00:00:27.930> here<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.439> right

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
2007 around that time here it right

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.279 
2007 around that time here it right
after<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.580> South<00:00:29.910> Pole<00:00:30.090> telescope<00:00:30.269> was<00:00:30.689> first

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
after the South Pole telescope was first

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.250 
after the South Pole telescope was first
opened<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.920> google<00:00:32.850> earth<00:00:32.969> sky<00:00:33.300> originated

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
opened and google earth sky originated

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.900 
opened and google earth sky originated
in<00:00:34.880> 2007<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.059> thought<00:00:36.930> there<00:00:37.110> might<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.260> some

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
in 2007 I thought there might be some

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.880 
in 2007 I thought there might be some
possible<00:00:38.910> similarities<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.750> pictures<00:00:40.079> so

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
possible similarities in the pictures so

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.260 
possible similarities in the pictures so
let<00:00:41.010> me<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.219> open<00:00:41.340> up<00:00:41.610> Google<00:00:41.940> Earth<00:00:42.059> here

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
let me just open up Google Earth here

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.500 
let me just open up Google Earth here
and<00:00:42.600> I'll<00:00:42.870> show<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.440> found

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.759 

now<00:00:48.500> if<00:00:48.679> we<00:00:48.769> just<00:00:48.920> go<00:00:49.039> to<00:00:49.100> view<00:00:50.589> explore<00:00:51.589> and

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
now if we just go to view explore and

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.490 
now if we just go to view explore and
switch<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.160> sky

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.880 

now<00:00:55.100> I<00:00:55.430> took<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:56.120> same<00:00:56.360> coordinates<00:00:56.900> if<00:00:57.740> i

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
now I took the same coordinates if i

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.470 
now I took the same coordinates if i
will<00:00:58.040> show<00:00:58.220> you<00:00:58.280> here<00:01:00.610> five<00:01:01.610> hours<00:01:01.970> 43<00:01:02.210> minutes

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
will show you here five hours 43 minutes

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.650 
will show you here five hours 43 minutes
27<00:01:03.140> seconds<00:01:03.650> negative<00:01:04.460> 6<00:01:04.729> 10<00:01:04.970> 58<00:01:06.070> now<00:01:07.070> i<00:01:07.660> will

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
27 seconds negative 6 10 58 now i will

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.560 
27 seconds negative 6 10 58 now i will
take<00:01:08.810> those<00:01:09.020> coordinates

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.860 

here

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.190 

let's<00:01:17.620> begin<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:18.010> search<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:20.050> I<00:01:20.140> think

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
let's begin the search and I think

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.570 
let's begin the search and I think
you'll<00:01:20.440> be<00:01:20.470> pretty<00:01:20.770> amazed<00:01:21.070> what<00:01:21.400> you<00:01:21.460> find

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.010 

looks<00:01:27.580> there<00:01:27.790> that<00:01:27.940> we<00:01:28.000> went<00:01:28.180> into<00:01:28.300> a<00:01:28.450> big<00:01:28.750> big

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
looks there that we went into a big big

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.720 
looks there that we went into a big big
dark<00:01:29.290> hole<00:01:29.530> now<00:01:29.800> as<00:01:30.130> you<00:01:30.250> can<00:01:30.370> see<00:01:30.520> there's<00:01:30.670> no

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
dark hole now as you can see there's no

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.250 
dark hole now as you can see there's no
stars<00:01:31.120> around<00:01:31.390> or<00:01:31.570> anything<00:01:31.630> in<00:01:31.990> this<00:01:32.050> image

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
stars around or anything in this image

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.840 
stars around or anything in this image
but<00:01:33.190> if<00:01:33.280> we<00:01:33.430> slowly<00:01:34.030> back<00:01:34.540> out<00:01:35.460> you'll<00:01:36.460> notice

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
but if we slowly back out you'll notice

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.780 
but if we slowly back out you'll notice
that<00:01:36.880> in<00:01:37.240> this<00:01:37.270> exact<00:01:37.750> image<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:39.400> was<00:01:39.520> just

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
that in this exact image there was just

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.860 
that in this exact image there was just
a<00:01:39.970> cropped<00:01:40.420> out<00:01:40.690> circle<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:42.010> square

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
a cropped out circle and square

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.080 
a cropped out circle and square
absolutely<00:01:43.870> nothing<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:45.610> is<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.910> only

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
absolutely nothing this is the only

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.219 
absolutely nothing this is the only
image<00:01:46.690> found<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.470> google<00:01:47.710> or<00:01:47.830> sky<00:01:49.170> where<00:01:50.170> it

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
image found the google or sky where it

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.430 
image found the google or sky where it
is<00:01:50.320> completely<00:01:50.890> completely<00:01:51.490> blocked<00:01:51.970> out<00:01:52.440> now

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
is completely completely blocked out now

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.400 
is completely completely blocked out now
if<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.580> zoom<00:01:54.610> in<00:01:55.080> really<00:01:56.080> close<00:01:57.000> really<00:01:58.000> close

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
if you zoom in really close really close

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.630 
if you zoom in really close really close
there's<00:01:59.410> proof<00:01:59.740> here<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.100> this<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.369> not<00:02:00.610> just

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
there's proof here that this is not just

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.340 
there's proof here that this is not just
a<00:02:01.060> false<00:02:01.330> image<00:02:01.540> you<00:02:01.780> see<00:02:01.990> here<00:02:02.200> this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
a false image you see here this

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.120 
a false image you see here this
background<00:02:02.619> star<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:04.300> star<00:02:04.360> is<00:02:04.899> cut<00:02:05.229> directly

in<00:02:06.430> half<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:08.170> pier<00:02:08.380> there's<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.649> little

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
in half and the pier there's a little

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.540 
in half and the pier there's a little
information<00:02:09.429> tab<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.179> when<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.420> click<00:02:10.570> on<00:02:10.780> it

information tab and when you click on it
what<00:02:12.550> comes<00:02:12.730> up<00:02:12.940> I'm<00:02:13.090> not<00:02:13.270> sure<00:02:13.360> if<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.600> see

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
what comes up I'm not sure if you see

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.530 
what comes up I'm not sure if you see
that<00:02:14.280> but

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
that but

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.020 
that but
all<00:02:17.049> it<00:02:17.290> says<00:02:17.469> is<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.219> don't<00:02:18.790> know<00:02:18.909> what

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
all it says is this I don't know what

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.589 
all it says is this I don't know what
this<00:02:19.150> means<00:02:19.390> i<00:02:19.719> clicked<00:02:19.989> on<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.489> but<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:22.540> just

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
this means i clicked on it but it just

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.190 
this means i clicked on it but it just
went<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.109> a<00:02:23.140> dead<00:02:23.680> link<00:02:24.659> well<00:02:25.659> folks<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.109> you

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
went to a dead link well folks that you

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.160 
went to a dead link well folks that you
have<00:02:26.409> it<00:02:26.560> there<00:02:26.920> is<00:02:27.099> more<00:02:27.340> proof<00:02:27.609> that<00:02:28.170> maybe

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
have it there is more proof that maybe

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.099 
have it there is more proof that maybe
ever<00:02:29.439> possibly<00:02:29.950> does<00:02:30.159> exist<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.989> there's<00:02:31.989> a

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
ever possibly does exist and there's a
