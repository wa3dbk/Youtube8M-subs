will you'll have hard time finding parts
you'll<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.490> hard<00:01:47.790> time<00:01:48.000> finding<00:01:48.270> people

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you'll have hard time finding people

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.270 
you'll have hard time finding people
that<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:48.990> service<00:01:49.290> them<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.799> take<00:01:49.950> care<00:01:50.159> of

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
that will service them and take care of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.630 
that will service them and take care of
them

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
them

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
them
well<00:01:50.970> where<00:01:51.390> Mike<00:01:51.630> will<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:52.229> yeah

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
well where Mike will do that here yeah

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.030 
well where Mike will do that here yeah
he's<00:01:53.040> such<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> good<00:01:53.640> guy<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:53.850> 199<00:01:54.710> starting<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
he's such a good guy so 199 starting and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.679 
he's such a good guy so 199 starting and
you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.759> great<00:01:57.030> basic<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
you can get a really great basic and

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.209 
you can get a really great basic and
then<00:01:58.049> you've<00:01:58.170> got<00:01:58.350> some<00:01:58.380> around<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.979> way

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
then you've got some around this way

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.550 
then you've got some around this way
let's<00:01:59.460> walk<00:01:59.640> over<00:01:59.939> here<00:02:00.119> you've<00:02:00.299> got<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.560> 300

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
let's walk over here you've got a 300

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.310 
let's walk over here you've got a 300
series<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.219> guess<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:02.610> came<00:02:02.939> out

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
this I bought my first machine when I

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.850 
this I bought my first machine when I
was<00:02:24.250> 18<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:25.000> still<00:02:25.299> shows<00:02:25.720> beautifully<00:02:26.290> I

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.309 
do have a new one now but they are great
long-term<00:02:30.160> machines<00:02:31.000> maybe<00:02:31.660> for<00:02:32.019> somebody

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
long-term machines maybe for somebody

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.680 
long-term machines maybe for somebody
like<00:02:32.440> me<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.920> know<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.220> their<00:02:33.400> 50s<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:34.269> wants

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
like me you know in their 50s that wants

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.600 
like me you know in their 50s that wants
to<00:02:34.720> have<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.019> good<00:02:35.319> solid<00:02:35.530> machine<00:02:35.799> maybe<00:02:36.220> not

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
to have a good solid machine maybe not

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.970 
to have a good solid machine maybe not
just<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.239> 199<00:02:38.110> won<00:02:38.319> beginner<00:02:38.650> over<00:02:38.830> there

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
just that 199 won beginner over there

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.530 
just that 199 won beginner over there
because<00:02:39.069> if<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.340> wanted<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.730> really<00:02:40.030> get<00:02:40.239> into

because if I wanted to really get into

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.970 
because if I wanted to really get into
it<00:02:40.569> this<00:02:40.870> might<00:02:41.110> be<00:02:41.260> my<00:02:41.410> first<00:02:41.680> choice

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980
