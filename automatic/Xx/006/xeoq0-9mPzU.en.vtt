 the reindeer woodpecker a decade ago as bets 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.700
 petraccone passion 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.219
 in the sense that none of us think of arriving where we obviously arrived 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.150
 with all the love I have by chance because we are absolutely not 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.869
 having arrived anywhere 24 I care 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.039
 actually and so the top page 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.050
 orbea little m 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.419
 as a replica of a pizzeria in 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.189
 10003 street 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.329
 we have crossed our history with engineer giotto 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.329
 bizzarrini poised wonderful giotto bizzarrini 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.490
 you changed the rot into something professional ebay launched the idea of 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.560
 why not do race cars 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 which however can be added together by road car 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.560
 that for us has always remained a bit of the sport of his life 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.230
 and therefore a company that has built prototypes of prototype so here is car 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.020
 corsair you blankets because 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.210
 from these medical lists what v 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.070
 win the car 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.160
 single-seat wgallery road cars, of course 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.520
 when hardly 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.650
 they can be given as gifts 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.230
 I'm not bothered by an interesting one because at the beginning we were born as and 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.520
 ecological columns with experts from the northern sector 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.200
 we were some very young every day 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.410
 new every time I need something we have to pay a lot 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.600
 and not only that but sometimes the advice is one of the three contradictions of 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.490
 straw 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.000
 pon project we had some courage to read what age if need be 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.040
 make mistakes I make ascoli 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.330
 what the best young brains started hunting was 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.290
 of the area 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.689
 which means and was john engineer or like 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.640
 therefore it is confcommercio fandango ingenieur degree of but that magia ciad 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.210
 I create not a very brilliant school curriculum that we have on these 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.430
 started betting tanned works 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.420
 we taught them 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.500
 to use specific software tools to adapt strumed automation tools 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.970
 quiz regard-ii are all things huge disuse the car site 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.109
 we did it one way 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:10.339
 interesting random cox 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.449
 since we didn't know how to do anything 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:16.689
 but does not know m have we knew races we have traveled the roads that of the 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.299
 times have proved particularly innovative 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.619
 shouting we didn't know what the years were doing 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.119
 and therefore as such 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.299
 we are a little bit out of the chorus definitely our machines 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.369
 when they want to be criticized 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:30.269
 admit the truth seems not 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.859
 they are definitely out of the box they are certainly original and innovative 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.399
 I also hope beautiful 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.229
 when they were driven by pilots worthy of the name they also did 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.319
 results the record is still unbeaten 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.539
 unfortunately we do not sell the machines &amp; noble I call you directly 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.489
 according to our customers it is a dictionary 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.909
 but the most beautiful result that has messina - to have raised a brood of 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.779
 young technicians 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:59.180
 I think they are really wonderful not only from intellectual communists but from 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.689
 passion that 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.119
 apply to do this job 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:05.689
 in all people 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.479
 because mÃ©moire de not even 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:11.519
 too albino when they earn at work time I look for meter towards 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.069
 a racing car factory 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.079
 because I've always said all that 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.339
 with a metal fabrication factory a condom brown factory of 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:19.019
 racing car 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.319
 then the contest took place 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.929
 they build themselves 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:24.139
 what's this - 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.809
 that looks a lot like the person has no voice a carat a beauty a way of 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:29.669
 do and therefore as such 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:30.939
 it cannot be treated with atm
