 Western rhetoric and factual errors

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.950
 pays attention to those who watched 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.590
 final news releases on major

 federal channels but special attention 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.820
 viewers of course chained lead 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.739
 to lead Dmitry Kiselev to the news from 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.840
 Kiev, he moved not immediately at first 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.780
 told the death of actor Yuri Yakovlev 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.940
 Well, after that, of course, and Putin 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.360
 president three days wednesday thursday and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.829
 Friday conducted a full audit 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.870
 retooling our troops and in fact 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.989
 the state of our defenses 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.309
 countries supreme commander 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.960
 checked how funds are spent on 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.710
 maintaining his readiness 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.110
 well new submarine new missiles that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.659
 can get around any promising 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.420
 system about already hints Kiselev from the first 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.670
 the plot begins to threaten the Swede soon 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.070
 Poltava we already speak directly and here 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.200
 when it comes to Ukraine 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.000
 federal channel presenter compares 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.030
 summit in vilnius where ukraine 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.619
 could sign an association congress 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.600
 events that actually led to 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.860
 Hitler's power 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.030
 while in Vilnius on the Eastern summit 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.479
 partnerships with 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.460
 dramatic events were played out 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.670
 the European Union with the support of the us did everything there 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.729
 to reshape the continent in that sense 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.630
 vilnius 13 could be the equivalent of munich 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.090
 33 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.880
 the only difference is that today's goal 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.659
 deprive Russia of allies above all 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.180
 to tear off the number of Ukraine did not pass 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.159
 as is the case with preventing global 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.829
 crisis in Syria as the case with 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.840
 a historic breakthrough on Iran Putin 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.289
 built in advance such 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.480
 international combination which 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.930
 naturally resolved by 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.290
 favorable russia and ukraine scenario but 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.780
 Oksidov sure that Putin will do well 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.459
 how sure Kiselev offer from Kiev 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.680
 which he cannot refuse and 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.290
 will help economically to the European Union 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.720
 will help because the wrong way 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.150
 Putin is better to be honest better friends 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.220
 says Kiselev all then let 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.900
 after that Kiselev designates the main ones 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.750
 enemies who want to quarrel 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:44.150
 Moscow and Kiev so sweden poland lithuania 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.980
 nothing resembles the kingdom of sweden 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.010
 Great Polish Principality 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.540
 Lithuanian that's exactly the union with which 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.720
 Peter the Great gloriously fought under Poltava in 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.720
 1709 this week new old 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.599
 the coalition showed itself to its full height 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.439
 funny but it looked like thirst 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.819
 revenge for Poltava is interesting that many 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.280
 bloggers have already paid attention to 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.040
 actual lead error follows 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.470
 take into account that the principality of Lithuania as 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.239
 independent state in 1709 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.079
 no longer existed since she 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.849
 united with poland for the union of lublin 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.859
 1569 to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.019
 Commonwealth speech would be the second 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.900
 Russia war against Sweden for what 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.400
 swedish king karl the twelfth 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.560
 invading Polish lands forced him 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.569
 renounce the Polish throne in favor 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.519
 flick of Polish magnate Stanislav 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.129
 Leschinsky so recognized Polish 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.239
 gentry part of the Lithuanian feudal lords 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.430
 supported the Swedes but the bulk 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.859
 under the guidance of Grigory Agency 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.139
 waged a bitter struggle with the Swedes so 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.729
 way the anti-Russian coalition of the kingdom 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.169
 sweden speech pospolita and great 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:53.569
 principality of lithuania 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.609
 I canâ€™t notice those who 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.680
 drew attention to the error lead in 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.129
 the rest is all true Poltava battle 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.829
 really was in 1709 and Peter in 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.739
 she beat her by the way to prove 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.109
 how awful is everything in the European Union where 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.389
 enemies and lure Ukraine Kiselev even 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.750
 showed a part of a foreign nursery 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.750
 gears 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.180
 Well, such a song navel very much 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.190
 outraged Kiseleva but no less bright 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.169
 turned out to be a news release on the first 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.949
 the channel there the first violin was irad 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.810
 Zeinalov authorities convince the audience 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.940
 behave within the law but are willing 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.100
 urgently become europeans to hear these 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.169
 appeals not ready and explanation 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.110
 why cues not signed bonded for 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.060
 Ukraine has agreed with Europe while at the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.130
 the first were also actual errors 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.410
 who had to celebrate right in 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.430
 live broadcast 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.590
 so it was like here the day before 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.590
 in but on saturday night in response to 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.630
 police request to disperse into fighters 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.330
 special forces flew stones bottles 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.880
 and burning logs in response to the fighter and 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.830
 used force in the end a few 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.960
 dozens dead and then loud 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.720
 opposition statements from conscription 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:26.449
 early presidential elections and 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:30.150
 Parliament to suffer and by 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:33.330

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.389
 no collisions well how do you see everything 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.009
 federal channels do better 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.530
 talk about such events that 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:07.199
 Now happens in Ukraine when all 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.050
 such plots are prepared in advance however 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.550
 and sometimes small bugs invade 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.289
 how did you hear that well in those 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.069
 materials which for example 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.949
 Dmitry Kiselev prepared on the news 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:21.990
 Caliber Minsk about how Dmitry Kiselev 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:25.430
 returned to resurrected mor to say a speech 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:29.039
 pospolitu decided that 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.460
 American apologize ukrainian 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.469
 children better watch the testicle song in 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.219
 Elena's program to the baby than to listen 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.440
 pop music 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:41.090
 hostile by the Swedes tour 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.090
