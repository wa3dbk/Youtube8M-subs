00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello with you on my daughter turned 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.350
 6 months and I began to give her lure in 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.519
 I chose as the first feeding 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.800
 home cottage cheese 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.259
 I cook it myself very simply very 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.450
 quickly see how I do it to 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.840
 I need to cook baby milk 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.859
 and I cook baby kefir 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.840
 enamelled 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.449
 cups this cup is special for 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.119
 cooking my daughter more 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.680
 I don't cook anything in this cup 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.040
 cook for 1 cottage cheese 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.170
 one tablespoon from the calculation to 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.309
 it turned out one tablespoon of finished 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.660
 I will need a third of this product 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.719
 a pack of milk here is 250 milliliters this 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.399
 very quickly preparing just literally 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.420
 in two seconds we have to bring my o 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.940
 such boil it warm up 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.969
 so she curled up with us we need 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.620
 will make an acidic environment here 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.159
 acidic environment we will do by 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 kefir adding kefir i use that 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.270
 same baby kefir 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.640
 he is not so sour and I add 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.280
 kefir I quite a bit the more 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.500
 kefir you add 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.330
 so sour curd you get 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.310
 for example my daughter doesn't like sour 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.040
 cottage cheese so I add kefir and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.560
 a little bit such a small amount 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.939
 kefir has already done its work milk 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.570
 curdle and turn cottage we 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:38.800
 all our food boils 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:42.790
 and if you can see on the surface 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.580
 we begin to accumulate such grains 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:51.790
 this is the curd 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.840
 he starts to float this way our 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.160
 the milk is curled up 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.180
 and split into two factions, the liquid is 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.190
 serum 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.460
 and the grain is the curd itself all 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.410
 enough to bring to a boil and 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.630
 turn off 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.890
 Now I will give time 15 minutes to my 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.400
 the curd was well settled down then I 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.530
 rub it through the mirc fine clean sieve 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.680
 and to 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.650
 my baby was tastier I still add 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.100
 spoon of carrot puree or pumpkin 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.670
 mashed potatoes 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.160
 we like this lunch very tasty to us 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.040
 enjoy your meal 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.040
