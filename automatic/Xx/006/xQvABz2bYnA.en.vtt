00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.730
 these motorcyclists opined about the 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.520
 warmth of veracruz the landscapes and about 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.799
 this passion for motorcycles 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.450
 the roads there are some parts that are 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.429
 arranging but there are no signs 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.320
 then they were funnier one 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.750
 a little bit dangerous but everything else 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.820
 very parents the landscapes here are 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.390

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.490

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.219
 I had not met him I had only 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.490
 passed through orizaba córdoba towards the 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.619
 southeast to cancún city of carmen but 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.950

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.709
 I went really is beautiful lovely 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.930
 precious I think it's more beautiful than 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:13.730
 mazatlán I believe from my point of view 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.890
 We met Rio mouth too 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.690
 beautiful pretty 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.410
 the good thing we already know 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.020
 we are at sea level and the pressure 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.110
 It goes up and it's hot but leave out 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.069
 everything very nice I would recommend them to 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.030
 all the people who drive motorcycle 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.850
 first that 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.890
 you should not drink alcohol above the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.819
 motorcycle or before riding the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:45.060
 motorcycle second not to exceed the limit 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.660
 of safety that the motorcycle allows us 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.530
 handle because if one breaks that rule or 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.959
 it is at that point there is no return they are 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.190
 seconds between life and death like this 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.350
 the one who uses everything he likes 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.750
 motorcycling that remains with all 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.110
 security measures without zero alcohol 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.570
 zero drugs and this especially that they use 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.420
 their protective helmets their jackets 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.820
 of protection and that they always do so with 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.769
 everything with all the caution is that this 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.650
 sport is misunderstood is a passion 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.599
 that's what he has to like from 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.760
 I do not know how to explain is a passion 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.200
 it's just a passion and you have to 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.360
 do with great caution because 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.640
 and a fall here can change your life 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.769
 completely and lovers of 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.680
 speed they enjoyed endless 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.459
 activities and of course not the official photo 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.459
 I could miss 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.290
 during your stay in veracruz 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.480
 They visited the beaches of Chachalacas to 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.900
 subsequently start their engines and 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.900
 split 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.430
