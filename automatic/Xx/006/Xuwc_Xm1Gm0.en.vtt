cooking

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.529 

if<00:01:14.560> you're<00:01:14.829> using<00:01:15.069> one<00:01:15.579> planting<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.299> will<00:01:16.420> be

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
if you're using one planting you will be

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.510 
if you're using one planting you will be
able<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.810> cut<00:01:17.109> it<00:01:17.200> into<00:01:17.409> eight<00:01:17.649> thin<00:01:18.009> slices

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
and so this is how you should cut it so

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.599 
and so this is how you should cut it so
next<00:01:21.399> let's<00:01:21.789> make<00:01:21.969> big<00:01:22.240> batter<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:24.250> making

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
next let's make big batter for making

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.849 
next let's make big batter for making
the<00:01:24.729> batter<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:25.359> a<00:01:25.390> bowl<00:01:25.659> add<00:01:25.899> one<00:01:26.619> cup

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859

turmeric powder so this will give a nice
yellow<00:01:41.049> color<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:41.709> plantain<00:01:42.130> fritters<00:01:42.520> so

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
yellow color to the plantain fritters so

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.959 
yellow color to the plantain fritters so
I'm<00:01:42.880> gonna<00:01:43.060> add<00:01:43.270> this<00:01:44.310> now<00:01:45.310> combine<00:01:45.789> these

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
I'm gonna add this now combine these

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:58.369 
I'm gonna add this now combine these
well<00:01:46.270> using<00:01:46.569> a<00:01:46.780> whisk<00:01:47.049> to<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.810> add<00:01:53.020> one<00:01:53.739> egg

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:58.379 

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:02.810 

fine<00:01:59.379> as<00:01:59.530> well

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.930 

and<00:02:03.820> add<00:02:04.540> around<00:02:05.170> 1/2<00:02:05.500> cup<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:05.890> water<00:02:08.789> mix<00:02:09.789> it

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
and add around 1/2 cup of water mix it

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.520 
and add around 1/2 cup of water mix it
well<00:02:10.179> using<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.110> whisk<00:02:16.140> combine<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.319> well

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
well using the whisk combine it well

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.920 
well using the whisk combine it well
without<00:02:17.709> any<00:02:18.099> lumps<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:19.209> this<00:02:19.390> is<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.630> kind<00:02:19.870> of

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
without any lumps so this is the kind of

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.589 
without any lumps so this is the kind of
consistency<00:02:20.560> we<00:02:20.860> want<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:22.000> batter<00:02:22.180> shouldn't

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
consistency we want the batter shouldn't

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.650 
consistency we want the batter shouldn't
be<00:02:22.720> too<00:02:22.959> thick<00:02:23.230> nor<00:02:23.620> too<00:02:23.680> thin<00:02:24.489> so<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.390> looks

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
be too thick nor too thin so this looks

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.100 
be too thick nor too thin so this looks
perfect<00:02:27.300> after<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.599> made<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.930> batter

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
perfect after you have made the batter

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.990 
perfect after you have made the batter
so<00:02:29.470> next<00:02:29.709> step<00:02:29.890> will<00:02:30.099> be<00:02:30.130> heating<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.670> frying

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
so next step will be heating a frying

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.360 
so next step will be heating a frying
pan<00:02:31.120> over<00:02:31.690> medium<00:02:32.080> heat<00:02:32.319> let<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.800> turn<00:02:33.040> hot

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
pan over medium heat let it turn hot

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.539 
pan over medium heat let it turn hot
then<00:02:34.030> we<00:02:34.269> are<00:02:34.330> gonna<00:02:34.510> add<00:02:34.780> oil<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:36.220> can<00:02:36.400> add

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
then we are gonna add oil you can add

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:45.259 
then we are gonna add oil you can add
vegetable<00:02:37.120> oil<00:02:37.239> or<00:02:37.480> canola<00:02:37.690> oil<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.519> 40<00:02:40.030> fry

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.770 

so<00:02:46.269> let<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.600> oil<00:02:46.780> turn<00:02:47.200> hot<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:49.360> order<00:02:49.630> to

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
so let the oil turn hot in order to

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.020 
so let the oil turn hot in order to
check<00:02:49.989> if<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.440> oil<00:02:50.470> has<00:02:50.830> turned<00:02:51.130> hot<00:02:51.430> what<00:02:52.000> I

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
check if the oil has turned hot what I

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.080 
check if the oil has turned hot what I
do<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.660> pour<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.319> small<00:02:53.680> drop<00:02:54.069> of<00:02:54.280> batter<00:02:54.700> into

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
do is I pour a small drop of batter into

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.190 
do is I pour a small drop of batter into
the<00:02:55.209> oil<00:02:57.060> now<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.180> can<00:02:58.450> see<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.780> there<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.170> a
