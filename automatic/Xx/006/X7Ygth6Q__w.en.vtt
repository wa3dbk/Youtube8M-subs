work with one group without having to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.390 
work with one group without having to
stop<00:01:57.840> instruction<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.710> monitor<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.280> behavior

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
students because the sounds of the
