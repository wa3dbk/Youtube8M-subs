 order for the oil and gas industry 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.010
 drifts a meter high for him not 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.010
 block 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:46.190

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.020
 in place 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.660
 of course on google's deep shadow 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.810
 on the sand is a choice we 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.500
 problematic but with a slight minimum 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.590
 radius will shake yes yes they will now 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.989
 fur products is 15 tons and I Makhina

 so for the rest are presented 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.300
 practically produced somewhere like 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.440
 passionate regions of the Russian Federation 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.850
 foreign development but why are they 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:30.140
 just not like geologists 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.760
 various kinds of lifeguards i 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.790
 tell everyone who does it 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.370
 subsoil development and so on and for 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.320
 question let's say so those mortals 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.040
 people who love to go looking for and 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.200
 all terrain vehicle

 cross country snow 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.070
 dirt and how are we 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.200
 Father is spring here, but a real mini 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.790
 tank judging by the size of this children's 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.490
 model at least climb it with 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.970
 the first time it will turn out on them only 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.060
 baby I do not have too went well 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.020
 tell me what it is this all-terrain vehicle 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.240
 amphibian max 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.369
 which was invented by the fifty-ninth 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.450
 year is the ancestor of all persons 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.490
 from them departed 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.759
 that is, she also knows how to do it in Tyumen 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.610
 to swim 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.200
 if Americans became a challenge for their 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.090
 armed forces which make the car 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.870
 it would be very easy to pass 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.870
 very reliable 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.940
 to find out but because of them you need everything 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.400
