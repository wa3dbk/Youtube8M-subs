 third generation and less than a year 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.969
 because I did in May last year 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.010
 then there was a nice Christmas now 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.950
 this is the third few months so how 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.440
 of sunken seeds so very similar 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.079
 to others the way that concert that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.170
 then 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.659
 is a top-of-the-range smartphone so at 11 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.859

00:00:52.659 --> 00:01:00.549
 hd the qualcomm snapdragon 600 processor 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:03.939
 7 gigabytes of holy ram fit together 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:06.250
 gb 64 gigabytes of camera storage 3 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:08.110
 megapixel and a thick saliva 3 mm is 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.770
 nice cast tables that also sees light 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.539
 brothers and is a bit in my hand never has me 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.420
 taken away because only now even 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.619
 we do n't know when in the final 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.179
 but it also seems to be of those of 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.619
 usually it is well done because it is 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.159
 the features this is it 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.380
 smartphone 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.080
 then one thing also happens the docking 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.569
 station is exactly a tablet 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.009
 is basically a tablet has a tablet from 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:35.649
 10 inches always in full hd on the back 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.830
 the room to house charity because of it 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.200
 just does not light work wrong 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.720
 because he needs this book like 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.130
 how to turn the corner 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.239
 enter viva and switch to exact 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.429
 android this time in tablet format 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:57.099
 so you could have undamaged applications 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.120
 on which to establish was working with the 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:00.910
 community 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.280
 the 10-inch spread some 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.590
 features of the tablet they have 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:11.800
 spent as a group unless it happens 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.540
 open the heart this story of the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.300
 bluntly that is a monitor that 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.990
 view reviewing the interface as 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.870
 can be noted 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.600
 here you are to say my luck le 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.270
 should go to anzola in some 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.640
 shop 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.590
 for the institution to buy it how much of 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.670
 these rules 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.709
 and it would cost you to stay in the euro 990 la 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.180
 decision to follow moratti as a means 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.099
 century bieticola boys and pink 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.010
 of the art this moment I say one thing 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:46.580
 when so how do you respond 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.830
 phone calls is a chat and yes 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.209
 off he must show and it was not one 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.040
 beat 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.200
 if someone leans he did 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.330
 a carpet in by then is that not asus 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.569
 case in this case so a jane 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.970
 days all or a headset 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.430
 anything light yet strain it 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.370
 smartphone and this is another that is 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.750
 true is very beautiful beautiful beautiful 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.790
 maybe we can't get them caught 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.150
 artistic performances are material 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.250
 be weak done well on this track 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.090
 shell in satined metal and very much 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.079
 beautiful very beautiful 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.790
 certainly came a challenging price there 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.269
 sum let's say a smartphone of the end 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.349
 high that we are around 700 euros that 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.480
 however it has the features for 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.920
 post those we talk to a tablet 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.400
 however less than 3 400 euros 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:44.700
 and then so also some avoidable with 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:47.610
 I'm absolute, that's fine 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.290
 sorry, yes, but philosophy is actually 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.640
 true that they are not independent and therefore 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.370
 a need for high philosophy 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.290
 is what you have on your smartphone 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.180
 you also have it automatically on 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.739
 tablet and vice versa at once 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.150
 everything seems to have an application installed 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.349
 on your smartphone you don't have to stay at 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.690
 reinstall on the tablet and in the long run 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.180
 however, things are what a weight it is 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.709
 chosen this choice chain choice 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.750
 constructive and also of philosophy in the 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.930
 sense to have two tools dependent on 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.079
 n 1 which does everything is interesting to see 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.739
 if there will always be more traction 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.810
 between two worlds 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.419
 so this is already an example of how 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.440
 we can say for now the market 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.570
 listen let's say any nation 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.729
 concepts we have professed as a buffet of 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.340
 evening probably because the expense of the 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.040
 drugs which has to pay before the 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.930
 phone that really still does a lot 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.060
 forward with respect to the light type 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.620
 let's make the smartphone as two 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.270
 tablet therefore necessary effective 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.500
 so then we'll see what happens second 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.290
 me is interested 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.990
 and interestingly we have three now 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.430
 platinum 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.130
 with a lot of output by three outputs 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.510
 scheduled for the 2300 okay we close 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:01.830
 making to see what television 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.720
 this Indian we greet you with 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.820
 we greet you this bye bye from 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.240
 luca sociale da christian hello hello hello
