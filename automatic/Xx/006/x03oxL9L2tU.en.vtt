00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
sophisticated yeah let's talk about high

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.140 
sophisticated yeah let's talk about high
dynamic<00:01:16.439> range<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.670> demo<00:01:17.909> we're

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
dynamic range and so for this demo we're

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.880 
dynamic range and so for this demo we're
going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> go<00:01:18.420> ahead<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.630> compare<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
going to go ahead and compare it to a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.520 
going to go ahead and compare it to a
three<00:01:20.220> year<00:01:20.490> old<00:01:20.610> core<00:01:20.820> 2<00:01:20.939> duo<00:01:20.970> system<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.810> not

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
three year old core 2 duo system and not

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.080 
three year old core 2 duo system and not
go<00:01:22.619> ahead<00:01:22.799> not<00:01:22.950> equate<00:01:23.340> let<00:01:23.670> me<00:01:23.759> go<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:23.909> get<00:01:24.030> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
go ahead not equate let me go and get it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.310 
go ahead not equate let me go and get it
started<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:24.960> explain<00:01:25.259> what

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
started and then we can explain what

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.429 
started and then we can explain what
we're<00:01:25.590> actually<00:01:25.680> doing<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:27.330> I've<00:01:27.720> got<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> photo

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.569 
have with HDR you can actually take
three<00:01:40.390> images<00:01:40.659> combined<00:01:41.469> those<00:01:41.649> together<00:01:41.890> to

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
three images combined those together to

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.429 
three images combined those together to
create<00:01:42.729> a<00:01:42.850> machine<00:01:43.000> which<00:01:43.420> is<00:01:43.600> if<00:01:43.869> it<00:01:44.020> expose

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
create a machine which is if it expose

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.469 
create a machine which is if it expose
your<00:01:44.619> whatever<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.429> did<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:45.700> lid<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.000> computer

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
your whatever it did a lid the computer

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.929 
your whatever it did a lid the computer
combined<00:01:46.929> with<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.350> images<00:01:47.859> and<00:01:48.069> try<00:01:48.609> to<00:01:48.670> give

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
combined with the images and try to give

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.550 
combined with the images and try to give
it<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.270> best<00:01:49.299> image<00:01:49.929> of<00:01:50.110> so<00:01:50.289> this<00:01:50.439> is<00:01:50.500> an

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
it the best image of so this is an

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.069 
it the best image of so this is an
example<00:01:50.649> we<00:01:51.069> take<00:01:51.280> three<00:01:51.789> images<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:52.569> did<00:01:52.959> the

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
example we take three images it did the

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.929 
example we take three images it did the
computer<00:01:53.469> need<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.770> do<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.009> hard<00:01:54.189> work<00:01:54.280> real

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
computer need to do the hard work real

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.029 
computer need to do the hard work real
time<00:01:55.209> yeah<00:01:55.630> but<00:01:55.990> what<00:01:56.140> shows<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.619> results

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
time yeah but what shows the results

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.740 
time yeah but what shows the results
when<00:01:57.189> the<00:01:57.280> computer<00:01:57.429> is<00:01:57.700> trying<00:01:57.969> to<00:01:58.090> do<00:01:58.179> it<00:01:58.329> so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
when the computer is trying to do it so

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.419 
when the computer is trying to do it so
there<00:01:58.899> we<00:01:59.020> just<00:01:59.140> finished<00:01:59.500> actually<00:01:59.709> on<00:02:00.159> our

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
there we just finished actually on our

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.300 
there we just finished actually on our
system<00:02:00.909> here<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.649> let's<00:02:02.649> just<00:02:02.740> go<00:02:03.009> ahead<00:02:03.130> and

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
system here and let's just go ahead and

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.980 
system here and let's just go ahead and
take<00:02:03.609> a<00:02:03.640> look<00:02:03.850> at<00:02:04.060> all<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.869> different

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
take a look at all the different

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.870 
take a look at all the different
examples<00:02:05.679> that<00:02:05.799> we<00:02:05.950> have<00:02:06.159> here<00:02:06.399> let<00:02:06.640> me<00:02:06.729> go

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
examples that we have here let me go

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.289 
examples that we have here let me go
ahead<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.410> pull<00:02:08.410> up<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:09.030> variety<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.090> different

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
ahead and pull up a variety of different

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.380 
ahead and pull up a variety of different
examples<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:11.260> we<00:02:11.410> can<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.680> H<00:02:11.860> do<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.549> half<00:02:12.780> yeah

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
examples and we can of H do it half yeah

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.750 
examples and we can of H do it half yeah
these<00:02:16.390> are<00:02:16.450> picture<00:02:16.900> before<00:02:17.430> these<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.579> pichu

an<00:02:19.209> optimum<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:20.200> can<00:02:20.379> see<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.769> difference<00:02:21.220> of

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
an optimum you can see the difference of

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.089
