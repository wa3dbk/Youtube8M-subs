00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.469
 what is the new album different to 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.269
 we 're going to launch this they gave us a lot 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.650
 more time to record the songs we 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.020
 we learned the songs before you should 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.490
 record in the studio on the first disc 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.340
 we recorded the songs in three days 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.610
 were 16 songs in three days without 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.680
 experience without knowing anything and during 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.780
 all that time that we last with him with 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.610
 the record with the head up we had 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.430
 a lot of learning we learned a lot 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.320
 we improve a lot locally and for the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.780
 second album and I felt more confident 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.979
 in having recorded it and the truth that what 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.769
 I really enjoyed having it recorded at 

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:42.899
 same because I felt confident I felt 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.479
 the music felt the lyrics what 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.729
 they said the songs and I enjoyed it 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.809
 very much just tell me that there is a great 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:50.809
 difference between the two ready 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.040
 I want to be your owner 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.110
 it's a song and it's based on a 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.970
 story that really happened with a 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.930
 girl that I met when 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.600
 concerts this girl was going to support me 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.130
 and I was very inspired by the story that 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.440
 we lived was short the time we lived 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.010
 this knowing about this leaving it 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.550
 know about each other's life but that 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.620
 song there looks like girl and 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.110
 little bit among all the songs 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.330
 to be able to account for who the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.690
 girl that I mean I want to be 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.580
 your baby 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.760
 when we are where my authorship is 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.610
 three themes of my authorship in this in this 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.340
 next album I want to be your owner 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.960
 they are really stories that I lived 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.770
 songs with which I was inspired by 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.760
 stories that I've lived before before and the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.290
 truth that I say that there are many 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.140
 people now to identify with those 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.580
 songs I made from my heart or from 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.800
 what I felt about what I experienced 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.920
 He said that's why several people go to 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.130
 to be able to place there is a position where I 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.130
 I was 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.580
 can you say then what are you going to enjoy 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.920

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.680
 a lot of passion with a lot of love flashes 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.590
 I already heard about the issues and I say wow it's 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.430
 a big difference 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.439
 is something 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.859
 something nice to know that people 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:19.829

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.359
 that smile on their faces that's why those 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.519
