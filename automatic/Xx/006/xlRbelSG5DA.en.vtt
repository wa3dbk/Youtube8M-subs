00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.760 

I<00:00:10.730> remember<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.760> lot<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.120> these<00:00:12.450> musicians<00:00:13.380> from

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
I remember a lot of these musicians from

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.039 
I remember a lot of these musicians from
previous<00:00:14.430> times<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:15.000> worked<00:00:15.240> together

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
previous times we worked together

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.710 
previous times we worked together
so<00:00:16.109> even<00:00:16.769> though<00:00:17.099> there<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.400> new<00:00:17.580> faces<00:00:17.759> there

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
so even though there are new faces there

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
so even though there are new faces there
are<00:00:18.779> also<00:00:18.900> people<00:00:19.349> I<00:00:19.710> know<00:00:20.070> from<00:00:20.460> before<00:00:20.880> and

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
are also people I know from before and

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.400 
are also people I know from before and
whenever<00:00:23.119> even<00:00:24.119> one<00:00:24.390> or<00:00:24.419> two<00:00:24.570> people<00:00:24.960> change

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
whenever even one or two people change

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.529 
whenever even one or two people change
in<00:00:25.590> an<00:00:25.710> orchestra<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.489> can<00:00:26.759> change<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.300> feel

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
in an orchestra it can change the feel

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.229 
in an orchestra it can change the feel
of<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.899> whole<00:00:28.079> group<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.820> also<00:00:29.820> everything

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
of the whole group and also everything

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.179 
of the whole group and also everything
that<00:00:30.419> they<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> course<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> concert

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
that they do in the course of a concert

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.329 
that they do in the course of a concert
season<00:00:32.460> adds<00:00:32.909> to<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.420> group<00:00:33.860> knowledge<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:35.339 
season adds to the group knowledge the

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:36.880 
season adds to the group knowledge the
experience<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.909> they<00:00:36.030> all<00:00:36.180> bring<00:00:36.420> together

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
experience that they all bring together

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.160 
experience that they all bring together
so<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.720> think<00:00:39.720> I<00:00:40.670> think<00:00:41.670> with<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.870> any

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so I think I think with with any

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.790 
so I think I think with with any
collaboration<00:00:44.269> the<00:00:45.269> people<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.960> stage<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
collaboration the people on stage and

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.959 
collaboration the people on stage and
their<00:00:47.309> experiences<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.989> an<00:00:49.170> impact<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.969> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
their experiences have an impact on the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.689 
their experiences have an impact on the
interpretation<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:53.070> case<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
interpretation so in the case of the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
interpretation so in the case of the
Beethoven<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:55.050> has<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> lot<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:56.780> open<00:00:57.780> space<00:00:58.170> in

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
Beethoven it has a lot of open space in

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.599 
Beethoven it has a lot of open space in
it<00:00:58.769> it's<00:00:59.010> not<00:00:59.899> lots<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.079> layers<00:01:01.609> very

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it it's not lots of layers very

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.460 
it it's not lots of layers very
complicated<00:01:03.300> over<00:01:03.690> each<00:01:03.809> other<00:01:04.050> and<00:01:04.289> that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
complicated over each other and that

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.440 
complicated over each other and that
exposed<00:01:05.300> aspect<00:01:06.300> with<00:01:07.009> constant<00:01:08.450> imaginative

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
exposed aspect with constant imaginative

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.180 
exposed aspect with constant imaginative
gestures<00:01:10.259> and<00:01:11.840> decoration<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.920> theme

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
gestures and decoration of the the theme

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.520 
gestures and decoration of the the theme
and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.759> very<00:01:15.200> straightforward<00:01:16.200> themes

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and then the very straightforward themes

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.719 
and then the very straightforward themes
that<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.460> any<00:01:17.610> direction

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that can go in any direction

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.900 
that can go in any direction
interpretive<00:01:18.720> Lee<00:01:18.929> I<00:01:19.170> think<00:01:19.649> that<00:01:20.190> that

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
interpretive Lee I think that that

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.660 
interpretive Lee I think that that
combination<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.720> things<00:01:22.130> with<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.160> openness

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
combination of things with that openness

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.419 
combination of things with that openness
leaves<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.270> lot<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> room<00:01:24.690> for<00:01:25.429> individual

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
leaves a lot of room for individual

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.180 
leaves a lot of room for individual
musicians<00:01:26.910> to<00:01:27.300> make<00:01:27.690> a<00:01:27.899> difference<00:01:28.380> this

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
musicians to make a difference this

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.059 
musicians to make a difference this
concerto<00:01:29.550> has<00:01:29.819> large<00:01:30.360> 2d<00:01:30.810> sections<00:01:31.229> where<00:01:31.739> I

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
concerto has large 2d sections where I

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.559 
concerto has large 2d sections where I
don't<00:01:32.220> play<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> orchestra<00:01:33.470> shapes<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
don't play in the orchestra shapes the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.910 
don't play in the orchestra shapes the
the<00:01:36.569> interpretation<00:01:37.289> of<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:37.500> very<00:01:37.679> large

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the interpretation of a very large

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.380 
the interpretation of a very large
section<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.910> conductor<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.660> then<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
section with the conductor and then that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.330 
section with the conductor and then that
influences<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.750> play<00:01:43.110> next<00:01:43.530> because<00:01:44.009> it's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
influences what I play next because it's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.010 
influences what I play next because it's
not<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.700> they<00:01:44.940> play<00:01:45.209> and<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.629> okay<00:01:45.869> that

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
not like they play and that okay that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.499 
not like they play and that okay that
piece<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.379> over<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.890> now<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.039> play<00:01:47.369> my<00:01:47.399> thing<00:01:47.789> no

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
piece is over and now I play my thing no

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.350 
piece is over and now I play my thing no
I<00:01:48.539> come<00:01:48.929> out<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.890> they<00:01:50.069> did<00:01:50.129> and<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.090> try<00:01:51.330> to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
I come out of what they did and I try to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.650 
I come out of what they did and I try to
lead<00:01:51.660> into<00:01:52.319> the<00:01:52.560> next<00:01:52.830> thing<00:01:53.069> that<00:01:53.099> they<00:01:53.310> do

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
lead into the next thing that they do

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.270 
lead into the next thing that they do
even<00:01:54.660> though<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.440> always<00:01:55.679> a<00:01:55.800> big<00:01:56.009> arc

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
even though it's it's always a big arc

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.699 
even though it's it's always a big arc
so<00:01:56.819> it<00:01:57.330> definitely<00:01:57.569> makes<00:01:58.050> a<00:01:58.170> big<00:01:58.319> difference

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
so it definitely makes a big difference

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.589 
so it definitely makes a big difference
who<00:01:58.979> I'm<00:01:59.160> working<00:01:59.520> with<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.209> what<00:02:00.479> we're

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
who I'm working with and what we're

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:05.450 
who I'm working with and what we're
trying<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.869> do

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.020 

I<00:02:05.540> used<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.960> try<00:02:07.290> very<00:02:07.770> hard<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.160> stick<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.789> a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
I used to try very hard to stick to a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.500 
I used to try very hard to stick to a
set<00:02:09.750> routine<00:02:10.160> for<00:02:11.160> concerts<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.940> tour<00:02:12.180> and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
set routine for concerts on tour and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.720 
set routine for concerts on tour and
then<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.750> realized<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.710> actually<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
then I realized that actually the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.580 
then I realized that actually the
routine<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.390> priorities<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.230> have

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
routine is the priorities that you have

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.830 
routine is the priorities that you have
and<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.340> try<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.670> make<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.030> priorities<00:02:18.540> work

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
and you try to make the priorities work

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.120 
and you try to make the priorities work
with<00:02:19.560> whatever<00:02:19.770> schedule<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:21.210> day<00:02:21.240> offers

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
with whatever schedule that day offers

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.949 
with whatever schedule that day offers
and<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.940> my<00:02:24.300> priorities<00:02:24.810> are<00:02:24.920> sleeping

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
and so my priorities are sleeping

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.890 
and so my priorities are sleeping
warming<00:02:27.959> up<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.580> playing<00:02:29.580> comfortably<00:02:30.480> so

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
warming up and playing comfortably so

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.290 
warming up and playing comfortably so
that<00:02:31.080> I'm<00:02:31.380> not<00:02:31.440> starting<00:02:32.340> cold<00:02:32.760> when<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.270> a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300
