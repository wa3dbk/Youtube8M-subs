00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.129
 Necessary we need science for 0.9 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.190
 alphaville 11 the abundant understood not 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.049
 I know if it works for good and for 9 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.869
 nor for 12 the 12 does not work that yes 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.330
 nothing else I say and well while I 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.160
 I will put point zero to favor 11 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.289
 below I leave a description and block 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.080
 launcher the version that is compatible 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.179
 with the tail 0.9 carbajo also let them 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.880
 the description the download link and 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.890
 well now I will also leave in the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.800
 credits to the creator who created the 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.390
 mod or that did not change and also left the 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.550
 which is the download link of the world 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.610
 from mediafire as I usually upload it 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.289
 sorry the download link of the mod del 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.510
 creator but where I was I did not think that 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.280
 they were maps 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.200
 of the creator of the world so I'm going to 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.890
 leave your download link as good 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.530
 now yes up here we see a little eyelash 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.990
 or a visit we give there we give 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.910
 we manage scripts now if you 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.490
 this from here on top 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.680
 right they will have themselves what camps what 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.450
 will have on do not put it on yourself now 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.460
 we are simply going to import 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.340
 storage as a local and look for where 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.530
 they downloaded the mod that almost always 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.860
 that's the options in the folder 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.810
 downloads now when they have 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.670
 imported mode they simply give 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.170
 local storage seek the riot to 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.879
 hand touches in this case I imported it 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.550
 but that one is imported does not have 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.330
 nothing now that would be all for the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.220
 installation of the mod 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.290
 for some reason it did not work it can be 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.629
 for the following because they have 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.580
 activated the safe mode have to give 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.890
 here a sure way has to be us 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.269
 in administering patches in the mister 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.819
 add-ons that do not have activate 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.010
 support for scripts and good on 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.380
 so they leave all this I have the rest 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.660
 well and good that has been all for 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.930
 the installation we go with the review of 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.930
 engine 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.110
 but we are already here the engine review 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.760
 as you can see I am here in a 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.370
 world creates me a survival world in 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.760
 importance is any world 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.250
 and well I'm here referring when 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.959
 you open for the first time or the inventory 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.909
 where the three little dots here gives you 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.650
 an achievement as you can see already what 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.769
 I have done that is the Teiken inventor 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.959
 and already accomplice managed to open your inventory to 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.519
 who gets wood and now they follow us 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.159
 go on and on 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.310
 another achievement that is benchmarking 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:21.489
 craft awards whiteford looks off line it 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.390
 requires is wood we have to kraft 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.390
 and ar in a few words 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.870
 how a few words are called 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.420
 you have to trust is not an example 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.400
 a stick and with this ball draped this 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.350
 I think I do not understand English very well 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.730
 you have to know English to train or 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.100
 simply to have judged 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.680
 plants 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.320
 I do not understand why this can be 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.770
 time to undermine a simple the fact of 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.450
 make a spike and you get an achievement to see 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.450
 I'm going to take more wood 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.069
 to catch wood 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.400
 to pick up a little bag, I know it's a mod that 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.160
 let's say even if it clicked but it 's a way that 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.530
 good makes you have what is a 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.900
 minecraft poc edition with more than pc 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.730
 few words and well then I can not 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.270
 create the peak now outside mine example 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.090
 around here a sheet like in a cave 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.840
 rather and if I take 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.580
 this 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.680
 I think they give me an accomplishment unless 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.180
 I have to do it first of 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.430
 richter to me but as I do not understand 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.990
 English I do not know what is boys so 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.100
 Well they will forgive me but here they are 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.930
 the achievements that we must fulfill 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.490
 simply that is in English as 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.639
 want and be a Spanish version 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.290
 he passed them here you are required to have 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.400
 done if it requires first having done 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.860
 this but like the time only 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:53.159
 winter kraft and a job page 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.469
 william for blogs blanks block these 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:58.009
 blocks of plants is not the mere truth 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:05:00.120
 I do not know why I'm being stupid, so 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.219
 you try to understand the way 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.319
 you just have to translate or if 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:06.120
 you know English you already did it to fulfill 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:08.219
 all the challenges and good has been everything 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.449
 dismissal thank you very much for seeing life of 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:11.449
 motorcycles by boys
