00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
countries has improved as well so it I

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.240 
countries has improved as well so it I
mean<00:00:31.930> right<00:00:32.050> now<00:00:32.110> we're<00:00:32.380> sitting<00:00:32.529> we<00:00:33.130> have

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
mean right now we're sitting we have

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.400 
mean right now we're sitting we have
first<00:00:33.489> place<00:00:33.880> ranking<00:00:34.090> for<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.020> last<00:00:35.200> bowl

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
first place ranking for the last bowl

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.060 
first place ranking for the last bowl
cut<00:00:35.650> I<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.910> that<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:38.410> can't<00:00:38.680> go<00:00:38.800> into<00:00:38.950> a

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
cut I think that you can't go into a

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.640 
cut I think that you can't go into a
tournament<00:00:39.750> not<00:00:40.750> at<00:00:40.930> least<00:00:41.050> believing<00:00:41.559> that

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
tournament not at least believing that

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.689 
tournament not at least believing that
you<00:00:41.770> have<00:00:42.100> what<00:00:42.489> it<00:00:42.520> takes<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:42.850> win<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.460> girls

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
you have what it takes to win the girls

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.340 
you have what it takes to win the girls
want<00:00:46.000> to<00:00:46.059> break<00:00:46.239> that<00:00:46.269> at<00:00:46.600> least<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.960> podium

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
want to break that at least the podium

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.990 
want to break that at least the podium
they<00:00:47.769> want<00:00:47.949> to<00:00:48.040> break<00:00:48.160> into<00:00:48.340> that<00:00:48.460> top<00:00:48.699> three

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
they want to break into that top three

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.820 
they want to break into that top three
and<00:00:49.210> on<00:00:49.780> any<00:00:49.930> given<00:00:50.050> day<00:00:50.320> I<00:00:50.830> think<00:00:51.640> it's<00:00:51.820> I

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
and on any given day I think it's I

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.470 
and on any given day I think it's I
think<00:00:53.830> our<00:00:54.220> girls<00:00:54.460> have<00:00:54.610> what<00:00:54.940> it<00:00:55.030> takes<00:00:55.239> and

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
think our girls have what it takes and

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.700 
think our girls have what it takes and
it's<00:00:55.899> just<00:00:56.079> a<00:00:56.140> matter<00:00:56.290> of<00:00:56.410> putting<00:00:56.590> it

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
it's just a matter of putting it

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.500 
it's just a matter of putting it
together<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.430> seeing<00:00:58.180> what<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.390> other

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
together and and seeing what the other

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.900 
together and and seeing what the other
teams<00:00:58.750> come<00:00:58.930> out<00:00:59.050> with<00:00:59.230> so<00:00:59.530> i<00:00:59.800> think<00:01:00.280> it's<00:01:00.579> i

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
teams come out with so i think it's i

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:34.060 
teams come out with so i think it's i
think<00:01:01.899> it'll<00:01:02.170> be<00:01:02.260> a<00:01:02.290> great<00:01:02.469> tournament

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:47.470 

boys<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.940> don't<00:01:36.150> see

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.090 

I<00:01:48.670> think<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.760> strength<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:50.750> team<00:01:51.100> has

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
I think the strength of this team has

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.380 
I think the strength of this team has
developed<00:01:52.430> into<00:01:53.080> speed<00:01:54.880> I'm<00:01:55.880> not<00:01:56.120> the<00:01:56.270> only

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
developed into speed I'm not the only

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.510 
developed into speed I'm not the only
set<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.690> wheels<00:01:56.840> out<00:01:57.050> there<00:01:57.260> leave<00:01:58.070> her<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.250> lot

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
set of wheels out there leave her a lot

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.100 
set of wheels out there leave her a lot
of<00:01:58.550> really<00:01:58.910> fast<00:01:59.120> players<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.660> I<00:01:59.810> think<00:01:59.990> that

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
of really fast players and I think that

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.200 
of really fast players and I think that
that's<00:02:00.200> what<00:02:00.440> our<00:02:00.560> team<00:02:00.860> is<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:04.090> focusing<00:02:05.090> on

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
that's what our team is is focusing on

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.960 
that's what our team is is focusing on
or<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:05.480> using<00:02:05.840> either<00:02:05.990> strength<00:02:06.790> but<00:02:07.790> that

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
or is using either strength but that

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.120 
or is using either strength but that
being<00:02:08.150> said<00:02:08.240> we've<00:02:09.170> also<00:02:09.350> now<00:02:09.680> developed<00:02:10.070> a

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
being said we've also now developed a

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.670 
being said we've also now developed a
lot<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.430> speed<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:10.700> our<00:02:10.910> forwards<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.680> really

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
lot of speed in our forwards and really

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.310 
lot of speed in our forwards and really
really<00:02:12.920> effective<00:02:13.840> players<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.260> units<00:02:16.250> and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
really effective players and units and

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.840 
really effective players and units and
transition<00:02:18.320> between<00:02:18.530> units<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.100> think<00:02:19.730> it's

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
transition between units I think it's

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.280 
transition between units I think it's
got<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.000> phenomenal<00:02:20.420> team<00:02:20.600> here<00:02:20.810> we've<00:02:21.260> got

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.150 
the inside but it was fun and it was
rough<00:05:53.720> around<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.990> edges<00:05:54.050> some<00:05:54.680> of<00:05:54.800> it<00:05:54.890> wasn't

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
rough around the edges some of it wasn't

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.430 
rough around the edges some of it wasn't
pretty<00:05:55.280> but<00:05:55.720> it's<00:05:56.720> definitely<00:05:56.990> what<00:05:57.350> we

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
pretty but it's definitely what we

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.140 
pretty but it's definitely what we
needed<00:05:57.620> to<00:05:57.770> start<00:05:57.920> off<00:05:58.040> the<00:05:58.130> tournament<00:05:58.490> it
