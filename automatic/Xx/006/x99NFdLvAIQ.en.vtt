00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 speech and benjamin netanyahu will become 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.509
 final on the UN General Assembly 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.910
 however the rhetoric of the Israeli prime minister 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.830
 It is unlikely to be as euphonic as 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.280
 Iranian president's last speech 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.349
 a week 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.170
 Netanyahu appeal to the world 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.760
 community scheduled today for 2 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.430
 half a day and it is expected that he 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.720
 will try to prove that Israel and everything 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.970
 the world needs to stay alert 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.250
 Iran's nuclear program and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.130
 maybe even insist on further 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.199
 international sanctions that harm 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.079
 Iran's economy a week ago the leader of Iran 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.660
 Hassan Rowhani first gave a speech 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.700
 before the UN General Assembly stating that its 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.860
 the government is ready to dispel everything 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.079
 nuclear concerns 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.390
 countries he even promised to lead more 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.399
 open and active cooperation with the United States 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.469
 on Monday during the meeting with 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.780
 US president barrack Obama in white 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.430
 home of the israeli prime minister insisted 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 on the fact that iran should go on 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.690
 immediate concessions to stop nuclear 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.340
 projects otherwise on him 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.160
 there must be more pressure 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.110
 from the world community obama 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.570
 assured netanyahu that is not excluded either 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.760
 one way to solve the problem including 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.330
 hostilities if it comes to 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.530
 defending US interests in the Middle East 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.570
 I hope that we can solve this 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.460
 problem diplomatically but how 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.409
 United States President I already said that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.850
 repeat without excluding any of 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.560
 options including military action 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.110
 Netanyahu's visit took place later. 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.840
 a few days after the historic 15 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.549
 minute telephone conversation between 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.250
 President Obama Rowhani it was 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.640
 first talk of the leaders of the two countries for 34 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.680
 of the year 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.159
 last year in his speech on 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.939
 UN General Assembly Prime Minister of Israel 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.159
 demonstrated the chart as 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.369
 drawn bombs stating that already to 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.590
 the middle of 2013 iran get closer to 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.540
 the final stages of creating a nuclear 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.700
 weapons since israel tried 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.680
 to steer clear of this statement 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.960
 however while tel aviv beats 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.790
 worried about the alleged nuclear 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.979
 tehran programs at the same time 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.200
 ignores calls of iran syria and others 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.420
 countries to join the treaty 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.789
 nuclear nonproliferation target 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.860
 whose liberation of the middle east 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.780
 from weapons of mass destruction 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.510
 besides israel is still not 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.950
 confirmed and did not deny availability 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.870
