hi this is gender wolf in this video I'm
going<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.550> talk<00:00:02.730> about<00:00:02.790> oncologic

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
going to talk about oncologic

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.840 
going to talk about oncologic
emergencies<00:00:04.110> now<00:00:04.560> if<00:00:04.680> you<00:00:04.830> remember<00:00:04.980> when<00:00:05.759> we

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
emergencies now if you remember when we

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.330 
emergencies now if you remember when we
talked<00:00:06.180> about<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.750> effects<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.259> cancer<00:00:08.099> on

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
talked about the effects of cancer on

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.459 
talked about the effects of cancer on
patients<00:00:09.240> we<00:00:09.330> talked<00:00:09.599> about<00:00:09.870> sort<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.139> five

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
patients we talked about sort of five

now with oncological II sort of three of

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.430 
now with oncological II sort of three of
these<00:00:41.329> effects<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.480> involved<00:00:42.989> now<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
these effects are involved now the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.029 
these effects are involved now the
aberrant<00:00:43.920> proteins<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> very

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
aberrant proteins have a very

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.119 
aberrant proteins have a very
significant<00:00:47.059> involvement<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:49.500> oncologic

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
significant involvement in in oncologic

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.840 
significant involvement in in oncologic
emergencies<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.170> particular<00:00:52.800> these<00:00:53.430> are

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
emergencies so in particular these are

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.950 
emergencies so in particular these are
responsible<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:55.760> what<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.910> known<00:00:57.329> as<00:00:57.629> the

responsible for what are known as the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.939 
responsible for what are known as the
paraneoplastic<00:00:58.699> syndromes<00:01:00.800> and

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.560 

paraneoplastic<00:01:04.949> syndromes<00:01:05.909> are<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.450> know

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
paraneoplastic syndromes are you know

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.940 
paraneoplastic syndromes are you know
sort<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.930> whole<00:01:07.080> host<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.500> syndromes<00:01:07.920> that

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
sort of a whole host of syndromes that

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.969 
sort of a whole host of syndromes that
are<00:01:08.150> caused<00:01:09.150> by<00:01:09.510> these<00:01:09.570> aberrant<00:01:10.560> proteins

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
are caused by these aberrant proteins

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.620 
are caused by these aberrant proteins
that<00:01:11.220> float<00:01:11.460> around<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> bloodstream<00:01:12.090> as

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
that float around in the bloodstream as

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.219 
that float around in the bloodstream as
or<00:01:13.409> wreak<00:01:13.650> havoc<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> body<00:01:14.250> by<00:01:15.229> because

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
or wreak havoc in the body by because

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.820 
or wreak havoc in the body by because
these<00:01:16.380> proteins<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:17.070> mimicking<00:01:17.670> hormones<00:01:18.390> or

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
these proteins are mimicking hormones or

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.980 
these proteins are mimicking hormones or
even<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.950> some<00:01:20.100> cases<00:01:20.509> neurotransmitters<00:01:21.509> now

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
even in some cases neurotransmitters now

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.289 
even in some cases neurotransmitters now
the<00:01:22.049> aberrant<00:01:22.470> proteins<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.400> also<00:01:23.780> lead<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
the aberrant proteins can also lead to

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:33.310 
the aberrant proteins can also lead to
issues<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:28.159> hypercoagulable<00:01:29.180> states

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.160 

and<00:01:34.970> again<00:01:35.970> some<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.330> proteins<00:01:36.750> involved

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
and again some of the proteins involved

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.070 
and again some of the proteins involved
here<00:01:37.730> with<00:01:38.730> the<00:01:38.850> paraneoplastic<00:01:39.210> syndromes

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
here with the paraneoplastic syndromes

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.160 
here with the paraneoplastic syndromes
are<00:01:40.320> sort<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.370> things<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:41.700> look<00:01:42.030> like

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
are sort of things that look like

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.010 
are sort of things that look like
hormones<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.150> it<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.810> cause

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
hormones so you know it can cause

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.820 
hormones so you know it can cause
syndrome<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.650> inappropriate<00:01:48.830> antidiuretic

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.930 
syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic
hormone<00:01:50.900> or<00:01:51.900> it<00:01:52.260> can<00:01:52.410> cause<00:01:52.620> hypercalcemia

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.490 

due<00:01:56.940> to<00:01:57.180> parathyroid<00:01:58.670> like<00:01:59.670> hormones<00:02:00.150> and

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
due to parathyroid like hormones and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.210 
due to parathyroid like hormones and
hypercoagulable<00:02:01.500> states<00:02:02.220> are<00:02:02.400> caused<00:02:02.580> by

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
hypercoagulable states are caused by

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.840 
hypercoagulable states are caused by
proteins<00:02:05.220> like<00:02:05.460> tissue<00:02:05.850> factor<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:08.520> are

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
proteins like tissue factor that are

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.260 
proteins like tissue factor that are
produced<00:02:09.300> by<00:02:09.510> fine<00:02:10.470> tumors<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.270> mutated

produced by fine tumors and mutated

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.540 
produced by fine tumors and mutated
cancer<00:02:12.840> cell<00:02:13.020> now<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.470> second<00:02:13.950> major<00:02:14.130> thing

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
cancer cell now the second major thing

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.170 
cancer cell now the second major thing
of<00:02:15.680> issue<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:17.240> causes<00:02:20.180> oncological

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
of issue that causes oncological

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.740 
of issue that causes oncological
urgencies<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.170> mass<00:02:22.410> effect<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.520> again<00:02:24.420> this

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
urgencies is mass effect and again this

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.010 
urgencies is mass effect and again this
can<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.920> effect<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.940> growing<00:02:27.420> tumor

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
can be the effect of a growing tumor

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.449 
can be the effect of a growing tumor
itself<00:02:28.910> or<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.750> fluids<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:32.070> secreted

creats or the bleeding that this causes

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.990 
creats or the bleeding that this causes
and<00:02:37.100> examples<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.519> would<00:02:39.150> include

compressing the chambers of the heart

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.809 
compressing the chambers of the heart
and<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.569> can<00:02:54.690> cause<00:02:55.040> spinal<00:02:56.040> cord<00:02:56.400> compression

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
and it can cause spinal cord compression

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.970 
and it can cause spinal cord compression
when<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.510> have<00:02:57.659> a<00:02:57.690> mass<00:02:58.019> that's<00:02:58.319> compressing

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
when you have a mass that's compressing

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.680 
when you have a mass that's compressing
in<00:02:59.250> on<00:02:59.549> the<00:03:00.090> spinal<00:03:00.390> cord

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.780 

another<00:03:03.690> example<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.530> superior<00:03:05.370> vena<00:03:05.670> cava

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
another example is superior vena cava

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.740 
another example is superior vena cava
syndrome<00:03:06.120> or<00:03:06.540> SVC<00:03:07.049> should<00:03:07.290> syndrome<00:03:11.360> okay<00:03:12.360> and

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
syndrome or SVC should syndrome okay and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.319 
syndrome or SVC should syndrome okay and
then<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.680> third<00:03:14.250> major<00:03:14.489> causes<00:03:14.909> cause<00:03:15.810> of

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
then the third major causes cause of

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.080 
then the third major causes cause of
oncological<00:03:18.329> urgencies<00:03:19.170> are<00:03:19.849> due<00:03:20.849> to

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
oncological urgencies are due to

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.770 
oncological urgencies are due to
treatment<00:03:22.019> side<00:03:22.470> effects<00:03:24.319> and<00:03:26.569> really<00:03:27.569> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
treatment side effects and really the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.349 
treatment side effects and really the
most<00:03:28.140> significant<00:03:28.890> oncologic<00:03:29.310> emergency<00:03:30.060> do

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
most significant oncologic emergency do

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.470 
most significant oncologic emergency do
to<00:03:30.510> do<00:03:30.959> treatment<00:03:31.920> side<00:03:32.129> effect<00:03:32.489> would<00:03:33.450> be

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
to do treatment side effect would be

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.820 
to do treatment side effect would be
neutropenic<00:03:34.170> fevers

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.810 

and<00:03:39.890> infections<00:03:41.960> due<00:03:42.960> to<00:03:43.310> neutropenia<00:03:44.310> and

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
and infections due to neutropenia and

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.160 
and infections due to neutropenia and
the<00:03:44.910> immunosuppression<00:03:45.570> that's<00:03:45.930> caused<00:03:46.140> by

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
the immunosuppression that's caused by

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.550 
the immunosuppression that's caused by
neutropenia<00:03:46.880> is<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.420> number<00:03:48.780> one<00:03:48.990> cause<00:03:49.530> of

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
neutropenia is the number one cause of

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.670 
neutropenia is the number one cause of
death<00:03:49.970> for<00:03:50.970> cancer<00:03:51.480> patients

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.759 

so<00:03:54.430> really<00:03:54.939> of<00:03:55.180> all<00:03:55.569> of<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.349> oncologic

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
so really of all of the oncologic

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.190 
so really of all of the oncologic
emergencies<00:03:57.549> that<00:03:58.060> we're<00:03:58.689> going<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.989> talk

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
emergencies that we're going to talk

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.940 
emergencies that we're going to talk
about<00:03:59.230> here<00:03:59.860> this<00:04:00.819> is<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.360> one<00:04:01.569> that<00:04:02.110> is<00:04:02.560> most

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
about here this is the one that is most

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.500 
about here this is the one that is most
likely<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.750> lead<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:05.049> death<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.379> patients

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
likely to lead to the death of patients

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.670 
likely to lead to the death of patients
okay<00:04:07.510> so<00:04:07.569> after<00:04:07.810> this<00:04:08.019> video<00:04:08.170> I'm<00:04:08.409> going<00:04:08.560> to
