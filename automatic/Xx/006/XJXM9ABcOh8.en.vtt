00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
what we are going to show you here is a

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.979 
what we are going to show you here is a
typical<00:02:16.519> seen<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.269> in<00:02:17.360> our<00:02:17.450> context<00:02:17.780> might

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
typical seen that in our context might

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.750 
typical seen that in our context might
be<00:02:18.140> working<00:02:18.319> with<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.799> an<00:02:18.950> indoor<00:02:19.340> saying

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
be working with this is an indoor saying

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.930 
be working with this is an indoor saying
and<00:02:20.120> what<00:02:21.049> they<00:02:21.140> want<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.380> do<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.650> have<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.160> photo

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
and what they want to do is have a photo

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.559 
and what they want to do is have a photo
real<00:02:23.680> experience<00:02:24.680> for<00:02:25.130> their<00:02:25.569> important

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
real experience for their important

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.630 
real experience for their important
staple<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:27.019> it's<00:02:27.140> coming<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.500> beat<00:02:28.069> them<00:02:28.310> so

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
staple that it's coming to beat them so

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.300 
staple that it's coming to beat them so
they've<00:02:28.790> hit<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.060> rendering<00:02:29.420> button<00:02:29.750> and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
they've hit the rendering button and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.530 
they've hit the rendering button and
this<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.700> first<00:02:31.730> thing<00:02:32.060> you<00:02:32.150> do<00:02:32.299> is<00:02:32.330> you

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
this is the first thing you do is you

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.400 
this is the first thing you do is you
simulate<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:33.769> capture<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.900> 3d<00:02:35.900> scene<00:02:36.230> the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
simulate you capture the 3d scene the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.440 
simulate you capture the 3d scene the
geometry<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.160> sea<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:38.209> course<00:02:38.269> you

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
geometry of the sea and of course you

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.440 
geometry of the sea and of course you
have<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.930> place<00:02:39.530> onto<00:02:39.769> a<00:02:39.920> textures<00:02:40.519> and<00:02:40.880> you

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
have to place onto a textures and you

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.880 
have to place onto a textures and you
gotta<00:02:41.600> programs<00:02:42.049> we've<00:02:42.230> got<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.410> dress<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.769> up

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
gotta programs we've got to dress it up

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.910 
gotta programs we've got to dress it up
dress<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.989> know<00:02:45.079> it<00:02:45.200> comes<00:02:45.380> from<00:02:45.560> tools

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
dress it I you know it comes from tools

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.310 
dress it I you know it comes from tools
like<00:02:46.130> rabbit<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.609> autocad<00:02:47.090> or<00:02:47.359> inventor<00:02:48.290> of

bringing<00:02:48.680> all<00:02:48.799> this<00:02:48.950> data<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:50.299> then<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.540> 3s

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
bringing all this data in and then in 3s

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.259 
bringing all this data in and then in 3s
max<00:02:51.230> you<00:02:51.440> aggregate<00:02:51.829> it<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.340> dress<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.910> up<00:02:53.030> and

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
max you aggregate it and dress it up and

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.750 
max you aggregate it and dress it up and
create<00:02:53.780> something<00:02:54.109> more<00:02:55.010> real<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.609> don't

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
create something more real you don't

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.810 
create something more real you don't
bring<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.510> person<00:02:56.989> into<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.680> design<00:02:58.040> through

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
bring the person into the design through

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.430 
bring the person into the design through
photo<00:02:59.090> realism<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.720> at<00:02:59.870> some<00:03:00.079> point<00:03:00.320> you're

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
photo realism and at some point you're

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.790 
photo realism and at some point you're
happy<00:03:00.620> with<00:03:00.799> your<00:03:00.920> design

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
happy with your design

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.950 
happy with your design
okay<00:03:02.100> yeah<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:02.730> you're<00:03:03.210> still<00:03:03.420> not<00:03:03.480> sure<00:03:03.630> you

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
okay yeah but you're still not sure you

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.410 
okay yeah but you're still not sure you
just<00:03:04.080> want<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.260> preview<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:05.010> as<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:06.210> see

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
just want to preview it and as a to see

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.700 
just want to preview it and as a to see
what<00:03:06.600> it's<00:03:06.720> really<00:03:06.810> going<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.200> look<00:03:07.350> like<00:03:07.380> it

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
what it's really going to look like it

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.570 
what it's really going to look like it
so<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.890> have<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.100> do<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.220> float<00:03:08.460> across

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
so you have to do a float across

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.850 
so you have to do a float across
realistic<00:03:09.450> render<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:10.440> back<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.710> the<00:03:10.770> good

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
realistic render and so back in the good

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.890 
realistic render and so back in the good
old<00:03:10.980> days<00:03:11.040> we<00:03:11.790> would<00:03:11.820> even<00:03:12.090> either<00:03:12.480> look<00:03:12.660> at<00:03:12.780> it

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
old days we would even either look at it

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.780 
old days we would even either look at it
like<00:03:13.020> this<00:03:13.080> in<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.470> wireframe<00:03:13.680> mode<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:14.340> then

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
like this in a wireframe mode and then

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.340 
like this in a wireframe mode and then
of<00:03:14.910> course<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.420> some<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.930> our<00:03:16.020> earlier

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
of course in some of our earlier

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.530 
of course in some of our earlier
collaborations<00:03:17.040> we<00:03:17.550> could<00:03:17.700> actually<00:03:17.850> render

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
collaborations we could actually render

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.610 
collaborations we could actually render
this<00:03:19.010> with<00:03:20.010> textures<00:03:20.460> and<00:03:20.790> shading<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.960> but

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
this with textures and shading and but

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.840 
this with textures and shading and but
it's<00:03:22.740> not<00:03:22.860> photo<00:03:23.070> realistic<00:03:23.310> as<00:03:23.610> about<00:03:23.790> as

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
it's not photo realistic as about as

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.910 
it's not photo realistic as about as
photo<00:03:24.150> realistic<00:03:24.390> as<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.690> game<00:03:24.900> right<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.560> so

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
photo realistic as a game right and so

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.710 
photo realistic as a game right and so
we<00:03:26.100> know<00:03:26.190> it's<00:03:26.310> not<00:03:26.400> photo<00:03:26.700> realistic<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.300> at

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
we know it's not photo realistic and at

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.960 
we know it's not photo realistic and at
some<00:03:27.900> point<00:03:28.140> mental<00:03:28.500> ray<00:03:28.650> was<00:03:29.250> incorporated

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
some point mental ray was incorporated

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.120 
some point mental ray was incorporated
into<00:03:30.330> 3ds<00:03:30.780> max<00:03:31.050> so<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.770> could<00:03:31.950> do<00:03:32.100> that

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
into 3ds max so that you could do that

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.450 
into 3ds max so that you could do that
photorealistic<00:03:33.000> rendering<00:03:33.210> using<00:03:34.200> using<00:03:35.160> a

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
photorealistic rendering using using a

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.810 
photorealistic rendering using using a
ray<00:03:35.730> tracer<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:38.130> think<00:03:38.550> Michael

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
ray tracer and so so I I think Michael

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.250 
ray tracer and so so I I think Michael
you're<00:03:38.940> going<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.120> show<00:03:39.240> us<00:03:39.390> now<00:03:39.570> which<00:03:40.230> is

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
you're going to show us now which is

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.380 
you're going to show us now which is
popped<00:03:40.650> up<00:03:40.770> earlier<00:03:41.100> that's<00:03:41.820> mental<00:03:42.210> ray

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
popped up earlier that's mental ray

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.960 
popped up earlier that's mental ray
doing<00:03:42.690> ray<00:03:43.020> tracer<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.460> started<00:03:44.880> this

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
doing ray tracer and I started this

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.820 
doing ray tracer and I started this
process<00:03:45.240> at<00:03:45.900> beginning<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.500> keynote

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
process at beginning of the keynote

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.230 
process at beginning of the keynote
about<00:03:47.040> an<00:03:47.280> hour<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.980> simulating<00:03:50.550> reality<00:03:50.940> is

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
about an hour so simulating reality is

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.590 
about an hour so simulating reality is
very<00:03:51.930> computationally<00:03:52.490> intense<00:03:53.490> problem<00:03:54.390> and

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
very computationally intense problem and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.770 
very computationally intense problem and
customers<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:56.730> only<00:03:56.940> solution<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.660> has

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
customers the only solution to it has

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.810 
customers the only solution to it has
been<00:03:57.900> in<00:03:58.020> the<00:03:58.110> past<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:59.070> we<00:03:59.310> have<00:03:59.460> to<00:03:59.580> cheat

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
been in the past that we have to cheat

been in the past that we have to cheat
we<00:04:00.120> have<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.420> figure<00:04:00.570> out<00:04:00.660> ways<00:04:00.960> of

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
we have to figure out ways of

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.280 
we have to figure out ways of
simplifying<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.910> process<00:04:03.290> doing

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
simplifying the process doing

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
speaking of speaking of us you've used

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.430 
speaking of speaking of us you've used
at<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.000> moment<00:04:12.390> you're<00:04:12.660> currently<00:04:12.989> rendering

is<00:04:17.370> this<00:04:17.700> would<00:04:17.880> be<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.000> typical<00:04:18.209> workstation

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
is this would be a typical workstation

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.830 
is this would be a typical workstation
that<00:04:19.830> our<00:04:20.070> users<00:04:20.430> would<00:04:20.580> have<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:21.120> has<00:04:21.480> two

that our users would have it has two
dual<00:04:22.530> quad-core<00:04:24.230> processors<00:04:25.230> so<00:04:25.919> you<00:04:26.190> know

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
dual quad-core processors so you know

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.310 
dual quad-core processors so you know
that's<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.700> lot<00:04:26.880> of<00:04:26.910> horsepower<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:28.050> it's

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
that's a lot of horsepower and it's

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.860 
that's a lot of horsepower and it's
required<00:04:28.770> even<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.340> get<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.940> know<00:04:30.060> simulate

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
required even to get you know simulate

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.930 
required even to get you know simulate
reality<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.680> in<00:04:31.800> fact<00:04:31.950> rendering<00:04:32.340> is<00:04:32.520> one<00:04:32.790> of

yes<00:04:39.639> so<00:04:40.149> this<00:04:40.330> is<00:04:40.479> this<00:04:40.689> is<00:04:40.869> a<00:04:40.959> mental<00:04:41.199> ray<00:04:41.439> this

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:41.589 
yes so this is this is a mental ray this

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:44.209 
yes so this is this is a mental ray this
is<00:04:41.649> a<00:04:41.770> product<00:04:42.069> that<00:04:42.189> that<00:04:42.969> was<00:04:43.179> a<00:04:43.209> was

the world's first great races photo
realistic<00:04:55.269> great<00:04:55.629> tradesmen<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.889> so<00:04:57.459> so<00:04:57.909> I

00:04:57.929 --> 00:04:57.939 
realistic great tradesmen and so so I

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:59.879 
realistic great tradesmen and so so I
you<00:04:58.479> said<00:04:58.869> it<00:04:58.989> earlier<00:04:59.289> but<00:04:59.469> I<00:04:59.559> wonder<00:04:59.769> if

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
you said it earlier but I wonder if

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.499 
you said it earlier but I wonder if
everybody<00:05:00.129> picked<00:05:00.309> it<00:05:00.399> up<00:05:00.489> you<00:05:00.999> launched

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
everybody picked it up you launched

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.379 
everybody picked it up you launched
mental<00:05:02.289> ray<00:05:02.469> to<00:05:03.069> render<00:05:03.399> that<00:05:03.580> scene<00:05:03.879> render

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
mental ray to render that scene render

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.959 
mental ray to render that scene render
one<00:05:04.569> frame<00:05:04.889> an<00:05:05.889> hour<00:05:06.099> at<00:05:06.339> the<00:05:06.459> beginning<00:05:06.879> of

one frame an hour at the beginning of

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:08.699 
one frame an hour at the beginning of
our<00:05:07.119> the<00:05:07.599> beginning<00:05:07.839> race<00:05:08.019> as<00:05:08.289> you<00:05:08.409> can<00:05:08.559> see

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:08.709 
our the beginning race as you can see

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:10.829 
our the beginning race as you can see
it's<00:05:08.889> working<00:05:09.069> on<00:05:09.399> 16<00:05:09.849> cores<00:05:10.179> one<00:05:10.599> hundred

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:10.839 
it's working on 16 cores one hundred

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:13.169 
it's working on 16 cores one hundred
percent<00:05:10.869> of<00:05:11.229> the<00:05:11.289> time<00:05:11.379> and<00:05:11.919> it<00:05:12.729> just<00:05:12.939> filled

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:13.179 
percent of the time and it just filled

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:15.480 
percent of the time and it just filled
in<00:05:13.330> another<00:05:13.569> piece<00:05:13.959> of<00:05:14.169> information<00:05:14.709> uh-huh

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
in another piece of information uh-huh

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.480 
in another piece of information uh-huh
but<00:05:16.029> mental<00:05:16.689> ray<00:05:16.809> even<00:05:17.199> in<00:05:17.439> this<00:05:18.009> case<00:05:18.249> is

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
but mental ray even in this case is

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.519 
but mental ray even in this case is
using<00:05:18.939> interpolation<00:05:19.389> and<00:05:19.839> other<00:05:20.050> other

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:20.529 
using interpolation and other other

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.820 
using interpolation and other other
approaches<00:05:21.369> to<00:05:21.699> to<00:05:22.569> sort<00:05:22.990> of<00:05:23.169> fake<00:05:23.349> reality

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
approaches to to sort of fake reality

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.709 
approaches to to sort of fake reality
it's<00:05:24.249> not<00:05:24.369> doing<00:05:24.610> real<00:05:24.909> physical<00:05:25.360> well<00:05:25.509> if<00:05:25.629> you

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719 
it's not doing real physical well if you

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.059 
it's not doing real physical well if you
had<00:05:25.839> to<00:05:25.929> fake<00:05:26.139> reality<00:05:26.319> everybody<00:05:26.889> would<00:05:27.039> want

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
had to fake reality everybody would want

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.949 
had to fake reality everybody would want
to<00:05:27.339> fake<00:05:27.519> it<00:05:27.669> differently<00:05:28.119> right<00:05:28.330> so<00:05:28.569> you<00:05:28.719> guys

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:28.959 
to fake it differently right so you guys

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:30.689 
to fake it differently right so you guys
probably<00:05:29.169> give<00:05:29.409> it<00:05:29.439> give<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:30.099> user<00:05:30.279> a<00:05:30.399> lot<00:05:30.610> of

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
probably give it give the user a lot of

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.819 
probably give it give the user a lot of
control<00:05:31.059> right<00:05:31.300> is<00:05:31.689> that<00:05:31.869> what<00:05:31.990> you<00:05:32.079> guys<00:05:32.199> yes

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:32.829 
control right is that what you guys yes

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:34.889 
control right is that what you guys yes
another<00:05:33.490> big<00:05:33.759> problem<00:05:34.059> when<00:05:34.389> you<00:05:34.509> want<00:05:34.719> to

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:34.899 
another big problem when you want to

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:37.049 
another big problem when you want to
simulate<00:05:35.769> reality<00:05:36.069> has<00:05:36.459> been<00:05:36.729> in<00:05:36.969> these

00:05:37.049 --> 00:05:37.059 
simulate reality has been in these

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:38.429 
simulate reality has been in these
rendering<00:05:37.599> systems<00:05:37.929> because<00:05:38.169> they<00:05:38.289> use

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:38.439 
rendering systems because they use

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.169 
rendering systems because they use
interpolation<00:05:39.309> different<00:05:39.669> techniques<00:05:40.029> to

interpolation different techniques to

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:42.929 
interpolation different techniques to
accelerate<00:05:40.779> things<00:05:40.929> they<00:05:41.679> have<00:05:41.949> a<00:05:41.979> command

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:42.939

panel that looks like you're flying a
747<00:05:45.969> I<00:05:46.059> mean<00:05:46.179> if<00:05:46.269> there's<00:05:46.419> so<00:05:46.749> many<00:05:46.869> dials<00:05:47.349> and

00:05:47.549 --> 00:05:47.559 
747 I mean if there's so many dials and

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:50.790 
747 I mean if there's so many dials and
settings<00:05:47.979> and<00:05:48.309> parameters<00:05:49.089> that<00:05:49.599> you<00:05:50.439> can<00:05:50.619> use

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
settings and parameters that you can use

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.419 
settings and parameters that you can use
to<00:05:50.829> adjust<00:05:51.779> the<00:05:52.779> faking<00:05:53.289> of<00:05:53.469> the<00:05:53.679> reality<00:05:54.249> so

actly yes right and so so I in order to
use<00:06:05.169> mental<00:06:05.469> ray<00:06:05.619> you<00:06:05.679> have<00:06:05.829> to<00:06:05.979> be<00:06:06.099> familiar

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
use mental ray you have to be familiar

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.759 
use mental ray you have to be familiar
with<00:06:06.969> computer<00:06:07.389> graphics<00:06:07.419> enough<00:06:07.959> to<00:06:08.529> be<00:06:08.679> able

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:08.769 
with computer graphics enough to be able

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:11.069 
with computer graphics enough to be able
to<00:06:08.979> enter<00:06:09.369> this<00:06:09.879> panel<00:06:10.300> yeah<00:06:10.749> these

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:11.079 
to enter this panel yeah these

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:14.459 
to enter this panel yeah these
parameters<00:06:11.369> and<00:06:12.369> it's<00:06:12.610> very<00:06:12.939> it's<00:06:13.539> a<00:06:13.629> it's<00:06:14.289> a

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
parameters and it's very it's a it's a

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:15.660 
parameters and it's very it's a it's a
science<00:06:14.979> that<00:06:15.039> they<00:06:15.219> don't

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
science that they don't

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.200 
science that they don't
learn<00:06:15.940> so<00:06:16.750> what's<00:06:16.990> unique<00:06:17.680> about<00:06:17.940> including<00:06:18.940> I

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
learn so what's unique about including I

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.070 
learn so what's unique about including I
Reagan<00:06:19.570> 3ds<00:06:19.870> max<00:06:20.290> is<00:06:20.970> the<00:06:21.970> setup<00:06:22.210> so<00:06:22.630> if<00:06:22.780> we<00:06:22.900> can

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
Reagan 3ds max is the setup so if we can

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.830 
Reagan 3ds max is the setup so if we can
switch<00:06:23.470> our<00:06:24.280> rendering<00:06:24.700> so<00:06:25.450> we're<00:06:25.660> going<00:06:25.750> to

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
switch our rendering so we're going to

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.930 
switch our rendering so we're going to
switch<00:06:26.050> from<00:06:26.320> mental<00:06:26.740> ray<00:06:26.950> and<00:06:27.700> we're<00:06:27.850> gonna

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
switch from mental ray and we're gonna

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.830 
switch from mental ray and we're gonna
switch<00:06:28.150> over<00:06:28.390> to<00:06:28.930> I<00:06:29.800> ray<00:06:30.310> and<00:06:30.640> so<00:06:31.000> so<00:06:31.540> this<00:06:31.660> is

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
switch over to I ray and so so this is

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.130 
switch over to I ray and so so this is
something<00:06:32.020> that<00:06:32.140> that<00:06:32.650> some<00:06:33.040> of<00:06:33.100> the<00:06:33.190> audience

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
something that that some of the audience

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.230 
something that that some of the audience
but<00:06:35.140> run<00:06:35.590> yep<00:06:36.220> this<00:06:36.400> is<00:06:36.460> something<00:06:36.940> some<00:06:37.150> of

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
but run yep this is something some of

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.150 
but run yep this is something some of
the<00:06:37.300> audience<00:06:37.600> that<00:06:37.750> I've<00:06:38.020> heard<00:06:38.200> about<00:06:38.290> it's

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
the audience that I've heard about it's

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.730 
the audience that I've heard about it's
a<00:06:39.280> technology<00:06:39.760> called<00:06:39.940> I<00:06:40.270> ray<00:06:41.080> it<00:06:41.500> is<00:06:41.620> the
