fascinating connection to cancer here

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.080 
fascinating connection to cancer here
because<00:02:20.620> people<00:02:20.950> with<00:02:21.130> neurologic<00:02:21.730> diseases

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
because people with neurologic diseases

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.820 
because people with neurologic diseases
have<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> very<00:02:23.080> low<00:02:23.410> in

biggest risk factor for glaucoma which

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.970 
biggest risk factor for glaucoma which
is<00:03:22.480> just<00:03:22.720> Alzheimer's<00:03:22.990> disease<00:03:23.650> of<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:23.950> eye

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
is just Alzheimer's disease of the eye

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.520 
is just Alzheimer's disease of the eye
and<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:25.150> course<00:03:25.360> when<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.630> comes<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.990> cognitive

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
and of course when it comes to cognitive

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.790 
and of course when it comes to cognitive
effects<00:03:26.920> use<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.850> or<00:03:27.970> lose<00:03:28.300> it<00:03:28.330> applies<00:03:29.019> so<00:03:29.709> you

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
effects use it or lose it applies so you

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.560 
effects use it or lose it applies so you
