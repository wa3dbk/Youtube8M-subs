00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.160
 Finally, we would like to present a series of reflections 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.469
 on a personal level and is in the group herald consensus by all of what has 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.810
 meant the development of extended and specifically this fox project 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.499
 the first place to highlight the parallelism between what the realization 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.560
 of the reservoir the objective of the referred project to reflect 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.859
 we think it's good 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.729
 for all of us p 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.989
 and grabbed a before and after the realist who are going on a personal level 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.920
 It has meant a lot of reflections that we have taken personally and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.540
 that we have later transferred to the project 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.160
 and from the beginning it supposed a personal catharsis I can say it own voice 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.300
 by the way is that nacho question me many things not 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.130
 this idea already existed from the beginning and of course we have transferred it in 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.090
 all its content to what the mythology of this project is not the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.340
 importance that you have today 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.300
 to reflect after seeing to overcome the inertia that they are leading and 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.790
 some way renfearse certain things and recover values ​​that have been 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.070
 lost 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.280
 secondly, the rigor with which it has been developed to the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.010
 methodology of work and systematics we want applied 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.380
 that is why it has made the way we have worked 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.580
 very fruitful and 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.080
 and beyond 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.950
 ayala place aa to materialize this this project 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.719
 in third place 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.709
 the enrichment of the high productivity that has involved working 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:39.030
 within a group with such diverse professional profiles and 

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:42.220
 complementary not each one we come from a different branch 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.550
 and in everyone's voice you can say that it has been through your mind that you cemented 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.710
 So we've all learned a lot from each other 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.110
 I for example had never worked in management procedures which 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 It seems that I have lived in another world until this day 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.450
 the achievement of initial objectives set from the beginning 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.630
 of the crankcase project have been achieved despite the complexity of providing a 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.220
 project of these characteristics 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.819
 an earlier project of 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.729
 to think about stopping to take out new ideas 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.169
 of materializing the methodology 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:17.029
 I to us we bet for her but we had many doubts during all the 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:20.129
 litigation that we could get to the hill 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.430
 the implementation of the lessons learned in the master throughout the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.639
 development of the joint project that tell us that every day that 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.519
 we came back from a class because we tried to put 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.670
 the manifesto that is teaching us from the management of 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.920
 of the meeting is the internal communication the mythology have it the 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.890
 quality control systems m the others all the financial resources that 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.999
 they have given us to see the viability of the project 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.149
 Finally, everything that you have taught us 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:51.229
 p 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.409
 I repeat again 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.930
 the importance of analyzing reflect that relativize it constantly 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.679
 in the day to day of our work, not only has there been personal work 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:05.090
 that we did to him in group and a personal work that we do at home but that 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.620
 of meeting the meeting continuously there is a reflection is that they made us 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.620
 raise many things of a meeting for others not 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.099
 what to say about the need to use a work methodology 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.909
 of management procedures in this case we mustélido alter ego 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.569
 it cost us a lot of synthesizes in getting to understand it but the truth is that 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:27.359
 in the end, demóstenes has made the job much easier 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.169
 and finally the importance of listening to the voice of the client and making a 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.569
 prototype because really what we have come to do is a prototype that 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.999
 we have been able to implement within one of our potential clients 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.879
 and see that what we have done is actually a tool that has 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.859
 viability 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.050
 the city council of Sopelana was surprised 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.780
 the possibilities that they had 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.020
 even from the meeting we did, they drew conclusions that will be 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.509
 valid from that moment only for presenting the methodology 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:58.729
 They were very satisfied and with the intention of knowing the future 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:59.669
 might 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.499
 they could go to inns to acquire it 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:07.200
 When, in the end, this has been a fundamental process, listen to the voice of the 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.829
 client and put it into practice 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.979
 finally the markets the thanks altuna the teachers besides 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.029
 finance to all mates 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:21.159
 Well, if someone wants to delve deeper into this project, they have to enter 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.309
 www focus biz point 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:24.570
 and there you are 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.000
 much more than what here in 30 minutes could expose us many thanks
