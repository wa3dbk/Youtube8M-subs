00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.120 

today<00:00:15.960> we're<00:00:16.139> just<00:00:16.230> deciding<00:00:16.560> whether<00:00:17.039> we're

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
today we're just deciding whether we're

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.970 
today we're just deciding whether we're
going<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> go<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> four-door<00:00:17.970> reversed<00:00:18.449> or

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
going to go for a four-door reversed or

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.650 
going to go for a four-door reversed or
lay<00:00:19.980> my<00:00:20.130> wing<00:00:20.340> out<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.730> if<00:00:21.240> there's<00:00:21.359> enough

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
lay my wing out and if there's enough

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.080 
lay my wing out and if there's enough
wind<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.170> inflate<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.070> wing<00:00:23.279> without<00:00:23.760> any

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
wind to inflate the wing without any

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.450 
wind to inflate the wing without any
motor<00:00:24.359> units<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:24.869> right<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:26.010> if<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.340> get

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
motor units on right so if I just get

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.160 
motor units on right so if I just get
hold<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.820> my<00:00:27.029> my<00:00:32.630> it<00:00:33.630> looks<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.050> have

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
hold of my my it looks like we have

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.020 
hold of my my it looks like we have
enough<00:00:34.350> wind<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> reverse<00:00:35.130> box<00:00:35.399> next<00:00:35.910> thing

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
enough wind for a reverse box next thing

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.020 
enough wind for a reverse box next thing
is<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.270> determine<00:00:37.250> which<00:00:38.250> trim<00:00:38.579> setting<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
is to determine which trim setting the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.420 
is to determine which trim setting the
dirty<00:00:39.239> when<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> buckle<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.800> pulled<00:00:41.100> all<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
dirty when the buckle is pulled all the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.459 
dirty when the buckle is pulled all the
way<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.730> that's<00:00:41.940> fully<00:00:42.420> slow<00:00:42.780> position<00:00:43.320> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
way in that's fully slow position and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.910 
way in that's fully slow position and
that<00:00:43.950> should<00:00:44.129> really<00:00:44.370> only<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.579> used<00:00:44.910> on

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
that should really only be used on

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.240 
that should really only be used on
landings<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.219> very<00:00:48.090> very<00:00:48.270> light<00:00:48.539> or<00:00:48.690> nil<00:00:48.960> winds

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
landings in very very light or nil winds

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.400 
landings in very very light or nil winds
or<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.430> you're<00:00:50.610> if<00:00:51.059> you're<00:00:51.120> thermally<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:52.170> tend

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
or if you're if you're thermally we tend

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.860 
or if you're if you're thermally we tend
not<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> use<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.160> fully<00:00:53.370> slow<00:00:53.610> position<00:00:54.090> for

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
not to use the fully slow position for

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.799 
not to use the fully slow position for
any<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.770> our<00:00:55.860> takeoffs<00:00:56.340> even<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
any of our takeoffs even in the the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.959 
any of our takeoffs even in the the
lightest<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.350> winds<00:00:58.559> or<00:00:58.739> nil<00:00:58.949> winds<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.850> will

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
lightest of winds or nil winds we will

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.689 
lightest of winds or nil winds we will
go<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.420> takeoff<00:01:01.109> trim<00:01:01.469> position<00:01:01.859> which<00:01:02.520> is

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
go to the takeoff trim position which is

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.940 
go to the takeoff trim position which is
about<00:01:02.910> two<00:01:03.180> inches<00:01:03.559> out<00:01:04.559> from<00:01:05.030> fully<00:01:06.030> slow<00:01:06.330> and

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
about two inches out from fully slow and

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.380 
about two inches out from fully slow and
if<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.159> wind<00:01:08.400> conditions<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:08.939> slightly

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
if the wind conditions are slightly

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.630 
if the wind conditions are slightly
stronger<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.650> will<00:01:10.830> move<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.430> trim

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
stronger then we will move the trim

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.890 
stronger then we will move the trim
position<00:01:12.299> more<00:01:12.990> towards<00:01:13.939> any<00:01:14.939> further<00:01:15.299> out

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
position more towards any further out

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.970 
position more towards any further out
for<00:01:16.409> mutual<00:01:16.799> then<00:01:16.979> maybe<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.580> too<00:01:17.729> strong
