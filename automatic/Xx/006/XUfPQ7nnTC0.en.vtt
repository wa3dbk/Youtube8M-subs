00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.269
 I got this final pause of 87 and good one 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.620
 which I was very proud of and was 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.089
 definite to get in Sao Paulo was 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.220
 that I went to the Brazilian team to 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.350
 first time of the boot of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.820
 black grove for selection 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.680
 we play a tournament in europe then it 's the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.769
 pan american we were champions 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.840
 between these two tournaments the São Paulo 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.630
 came actually the leaders 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.410
 representatives and had practically already 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.510
 closed the agreement and are paulo at the time né 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.460
 always was at that time even more 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.540
 any athlete's dream is not in the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.340
 club 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.469
 It's a bad fact that I got there. 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.980
 I was bruised and I had a 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.350
 thigh stretch could not debut was 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.780
 an injury that has been going on for 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.440
 almost 23 months stopped and I arrived in 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.180
 São paulo so the darío pereyra, or 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.730
 Welcome to a difficult time. 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.350
 joined the adaptation not conclusion 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.650
 I hoped to be received like this 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.369
 so caring then receptive way 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.890
 I was sure that was my place. 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:19.080
 in 88 was in the year of adjustment does not 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.320
 It's just that I feel better but the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.060
 89 was the first title and we went 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.400
 Brazilian vice champions 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.430
 I felt that something was missing 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.409
 and she was with titular captain of the team 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.350
 When he arrived I have a memory. 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.110
 that green side since the requirement of 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.180
 I want to make the best of each athlete 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.420
 as soon as six months ago he got very 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.420
 on my feet to show here that I could not 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.409
 me and that moved me into a 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.320
 year 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.729
 the whole team came up together and 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.530
 individually was also not 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.659
 most complete player a top scorer 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.469
 player which is what really make a 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.119
 difference in the group and that was 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.770
 starting to explore is all mine 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.069
 potential and when we won the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.140
 even the Brazilian title was ready 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.980
 to this greater challenge that is the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.430
 liberators and would be a first degree 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.680
 the international title of the club and 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.140
 hotel was already there for some time 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.610
 it is not nearly two years and already had that 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.760
 style of offensive game same time 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.700
 right engaging engagement with very that 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.590
 the players at their peak 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.319
 so even though we have 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.950
 been superior in all games had 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.680
 very difficult games, games are not a draw 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.099
 had the final we lost the game of 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.140
 going against the young boys and in the game of 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:53.030
 back sag had great mobilization of 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.629
 São Paulo's crowd was a spectacle 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.410
 wonderful and there we felt disgust 14 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:03.260
 and 21 15 in letting out that one 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.090
 title perhaps a balanced game in the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.940
 sense that they defend a lot of people 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.040
 I could not do it for myself and 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.450
 I believe that for most of the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.140
 people is following the line of 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.269
 game 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.750
 the moment decided was that it pity 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:20.120
 tineke macedo conceded miss by 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.980
 20 minutes from the end of the game me I 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.290
 I had to knock it does not always count 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.049
 that I got that ball was a 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.000
 whole stadium vibrating players 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.230
 remembering only who is vibrating was I 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.560
 because I had to hit 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.419
 then I posted the ball in the foot the ball on the floor 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.750
 and when well the steps back like this 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:42.200
 if you see that vibration there for me 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.569
 I saw that more impressive than 120 thousand 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.500
 people shouting at her in this 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.739
 licensing 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.269
 and then I went and did the penalty he thinks 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.410
 just concluded né 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.090
 that spence ended that we 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.150
 I knew I could win that I was better. 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.870
 but the goal does not come out does not come out there when 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.299
 left and we went to the dispute of 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.099
 Esperanto, we know that it is a 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.560
 great goalkeeper to us too 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.609
 and all that environment ends up favoring 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.070
 that is for things to work out and 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.440
 there it was also useful do not know yet 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.870
 was the first title of many 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.969
 international relations and which has 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.430
 paulo no grande at a big event 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:27.669
 success 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:32.680
 the victory that has many and in great 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:35.860
 we tried not to know 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.960
 Barcelona team but we can 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.000
 with whom I already knew fame was 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.250
 team's team 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.960
 revolutionized at the time also a little 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.479
 with barcelona today to this day 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.850
 I found by fans of barcelona the 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.930
 Spanish even if you call a criticism of 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.330
 20 m 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.270
 so it was a very anxious day 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.410
 before the game where we were already in 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.289
 preparing for a long time in the 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.479
 liberators in the middle of the year and waiting 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.710
 six months but at the same time days and 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.889
 fellowship has made people 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.280
 overcome this and did not close the 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.800
 people took over beyond their technique 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.610
 nor the beautiful game of telê santana 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:19.300
 He built there until we get started 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.030
 take a warrior spirit not 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.720
 there were warriors there in one each of the 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.479
 time ne 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.639
 on the day of the game so we went 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:30.070
 thus transforming not only is a good team 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:34.260
 but also a team that was not going to leave 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:38.080
 escape her that chance and we 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.909
 He left the game losing and gets 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.750
 scared like that for a few minutes 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:46.960
 after the goal but we already started 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.360
 confident grandson are also with the 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.020
 Captain also pass this thing 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.050
 trust this is we had nothing 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.360
 to lose power equal technically equal 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.909
 physics and that in addition to all 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.289
 strong and strong group 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:04.720
 five years later the goiás began to 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.570
 we'll soon react to all that 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.689
 wonderful play of corn is that I 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.009
 I scored on my belly 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:15.299
 It was a difficult game but we were 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:17.239
 posted better that we had is 

00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:19.499
 positioning that make us 

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:21.989
 create because we knew that earlier 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:24.539
 or later we'll score but he 

00:06:21.989 --> 00:06:28.039
 back to the capital of brasilcap clothing 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.039
 ended up going for the goal 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.440
 the goal
