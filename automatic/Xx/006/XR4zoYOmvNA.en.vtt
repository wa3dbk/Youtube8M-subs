00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.950 

so<00:00:06.430> this<00:00:06.609> module<00:00:06.819> shows<00:00:07.000> us<00:00:07.450> a<00:00:07.479> whole

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:07.960 
so this module shows us a whole

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.590 
so this module shows us a whole
thickness<00:00:08.290> section<00:00:09.010> of<00:00:09.129> the<00:00:09.250> skin<00:00:09.549> we<00:00:10.389> have

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:10.600 
thickness section of the skin we have

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.920 
thickness section of the skin we have
the<00:00:10.870> epidermis<00:00:12.150> with<00:00:13.150> the<00:00:13.270> basement<00:00:13.510> membrane

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930 
the epidermis with the basement membrane

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.019 
the epidermis with the basement membrane
zone<00:00:15.600> then<00:00:16.600> the<00:00:16.630> dermis<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:18.340> then<00:00:18.850> this

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
zone then the dermis and then this

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.429 
zone then the dermis and then this
yellow<00:00:19.300> bit<00:00:19.539> is<00:00:19.660> a<00:00:19.689> Depot's<00:00:20.699> hypodermis<00:00:21.699> on

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
yellow bit is a Depot's hypodermis on

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.400 
yellow bit is a Depot's hypodermis on
this<00:00:23.439> model<00:00:24.329> so<00:00:25.329> let's<00:00:25.509> start<00:00:25.839> off<00:00:26.019> by<00:00:26.050> looking

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
this model so let's start off by looking

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.349 
this model so let's start off by looking
at<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.829> top<00:00:27.039> here<00:00:27.279> here<00:00:27.490> we<00:00:27.640> see<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:27.970> dermal

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
at the top here here we see the dermal

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.409 
at the top here here we see the dermal
papillae<00:00:29.279> which<00:00:30.279> as<00:00:30.460> you<00:00:30.579> remember<00:00:30.669> project

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
papillae which as you remember project

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.790 
papillae which as you remember project
up<00:00:31.980> into<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.550> epidermis<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:35.320> here<00:00:35.530> we<00:00:35.620> see<00:00:35.770> a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
up into the epidermis so here we see a

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.000 
up into the epidermis so here we see a
dermal<00:00:36.100> papillae<00:00:36.460> here<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:37.770> these<00:00:38.770> represent

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
dermal papillae here and these represent

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.500 
dermal papillae here and these represent
dermal<00:00:39.699> papillae<00:00:40.859> projecting<00:00:41.859> up<00:00:42.329> into<00:00:43.329> the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
dermal papillae projecting up into the

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.150 
dermal papillae projecting up into the
epidermis<00:00:43.899> which<00:00:44.350> is<00:00:44.530> on<00:00:44.680> top<00:00:46.949> when<00:00:47.949> we<00:00:47.980> look

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
epidermis which is on top when we look

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.950 
epidermis which is on top when we look
at<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.399> top<00:00:48.550> of<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.850> epidermis<00:00:49.480> we<00:00:49.629> see<00:00:49.809> that

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
at the top of the epidermis we see that

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.750 
at the top of the epidermis we see that
there's<00:00:50.140> pores<00:00:50.500> here<00:00:50.829> for<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.160> sweat<00:00:51.399> to<00:00:51.579> come

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
there's pores here for the sweat to come

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.549 
there's pores here for the sweat to come
out<00:00:51.910> of<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.329> sweat<00:00:52.570> gland<00:00:52.870> ducts<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.379> we<00:00:56.440> can

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
out of the sweat gland ducts and we can

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.860 
out of the sweat gland ducts and we can
also<00:00:56.739> see<00:00:57.190> here<00:00:57.429> the<00:00:57.579> hairs<00:00:57.879> penetrating

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
also see here the hairs penetrating

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:07.530 
also see here the hairs penetrating
through<00:00:59.109> the<00:00:59.579> epidermis<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.790> we<00:01:07.030> can<00:01:07.180> notice

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
through the epidermis and we can notice

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.609 
through the epidermis and we can notice
the<00:01:07.780> layers<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.590> epidermis<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:10.619> basal

the<00:06:01.410> hair<00:06:01.620> erector<00:06:02.010> muscles<00:06:02.040> will<00:06:02.610> contract

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
the hair erector muscles will contract

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.060 
the hair erector muscles will contract
moving<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:04.740> hair<00:06:04.950> in<00:06:05.190> that<00:06:05.340> direction<00:06:07.070> making

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
moving the hair in that direction making

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.420 
moving the hair in that direction making
the<00:06:08.220> hair<00:06:08.430> shaft<00:06:08.820> more<00:06:09.620> erect<00:06:10.620> so<00:06:11.100> when<00:06:11.280> that

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
the hair shaft more erect so when that

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.640 
the hair shaft more erect so when that
muscle<00:06:11.820> contracts<00:06:12.410> the<00:06:13.410> hair<00:06:13.650> is<00:06:13.860> moved<00:06:14.160> into

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
muscle contracts the hair is moved into

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.379 
muscle contracts the hair is moved into
a<00:06:16.650> more<00:06:16.919> erect<00:06:18.020> position

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
a more erect position

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.459 
a more erect position
so<00:06:21.289> this<00:06:21.439> just<00:06:21.620> gives<00:06:21.830> us<00:06:22.129> some<00:06:22.520> of<00:06:22.669> the

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:23.469 
so this just gives us some of the

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:27.520 
so this just gives us some of the
structures<00:06:24.469> that<00:06:24.620> we've<00:06:24.770> talked<00:06:25.039> about<00:06:26.319> in<00:06:27.319> a

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
structures that we've talked about in a

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.339 
structures that we've talked about in a
cross-section<00:06:28.189> of<00:06:28.250> the<00:06:28.400> skin<00:06:28.729> in<00:06:29.050> this<00:06:30.050> quite

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:30.349 
cross-section of the skin in this quite

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:47.850 
cross-section of the skin in this quite
