still an enjoyable read mostly due to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.710 
still an enjoyable read mostly due to
the<00:00:29.310> fact<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.670> as<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.210> had<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> crazy

the fact that as not had a crazy
transformation<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.650> week<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> love<00:00:32.579> how

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
transformation this week but I love how

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.580 
transformation this week but I love how
it<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:32.940> built<00:00:33.149> up<00:00:33.329> how<00:00:33.540> originally<00:00:34.020> Rukia<00:00:34.440> was

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
it was built up how originally Rukia was

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
it was built up how originally Rukia was
sort<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.829> having<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.280> raise<00:00:35.850> her<00:00:36.059> temperature

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
sort of having to raise her temperature

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.819 
sort of having to raise her temperature
a<00:00:36.600> little<00:00:36.840> bit<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.200> she<00:00:37.260> actually<00:00:37.530> doesn't

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
a little bit so she actually doesn't

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.830 
a little bit so she actually doesn't
destroy<00:00:38.190> her<00:00:38.370> body<00:00:38.610> she<00:00:39.149> even<00:00:39.329> mentioned<00:00:39.510> she

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
destroy her body she even mentioned she

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.030 
destroy her body she even mentioned she
has<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.079> go<00:00:40.200> through<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.469> little<00:00:40.680> bit<00:00:40.710> more

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
has to go through a little bit more

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950 
has to go through a little bit more
training<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:42.090> sort<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.390> disappoints<00:00:42.930> me

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
training and this sort of disappoints me

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.090 
training and this sort of disappoints me
because<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.379> kind<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.590> hoping<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.980> she

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
because I was kind of hoping that she

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.709 
because I was kind of hoping that she
would<00:00:44.160> be<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.399> renji's<00:00:44.879> level<00:00:45.210> or<00:00:45.360> even<00:00:45.480> be

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
would be on renji's level or even be

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.420 
would be on renji's level or even be
akhiya<00:00:46.050> level<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:46.559> maybe<00:00:46.890> that's<00:00:47.160> wishing

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
akhiya level but maybe that's wishing

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.400 
akhiya level but maybe that's wishing
for<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:47.969> bit<00:00:48.149> much<00:00:48.420> because<00:00:48.960> when<00:00:49.260> as

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
for a little bit much because when as

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.410 
for a little bit much because when as
not<00:00:49.620> finally<00:00:50.010> erupts<00:00:50.610> from<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> ice<00:00:51.030> he<00:00:51.329> is

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
against this character however I was

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.910 
against this character however I was
really<00:02:04.020> hoping<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.469> was<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.860> be

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
really hoping this was going to be

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.490 
really hoping this was going to be
another<00:02:05.430> badass<00:02:05.729> Rukia<00:02:06.299> moment<00:02:06.689> which<00:02:06.810> maybe

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
another badass Rukia moment which maybe

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.410 
another badass Rukia moment which maybe
they'll<00:02:07.799> both<00:02:08.160> finish<00:02:08.640> him<00:02:08.789> off<00:02:08.910> together<00:02:09.119> as

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
they'll both finish him off together as

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.880 
they'll both finish him off together as
brother<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.780> sister<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.229> think<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.679> would<00:02:10.800> be

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
brother and sister I think that would be

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.190 
brother and sister I think that would be
a<00:02:10.920> really<00:02:11.160> cool<00:02:11.430> element<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.780> really

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
a really cool element to this but really

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.880 
a really cool element to this but really
I<00:02:13.230> think<00:02:13.470> it's<00:02:13.590> going<00:02:13.709> to

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
I think it's going to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.380 
I think it's going to
vop<00:02:14.250> Oh<00:02:14.430> who's<00:02:14.610> gonna<00:02:14.730> end<00:02:15.000> up<00:02:15.210> like

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
vop Oh who's gonna end up like

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.450 
vop Oh who's gonna end up like

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
the fact that he was able to literally

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.620 
the fact that he was able to literally
cut<00:02:19.290> through<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.800> fear<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.850> like<00:02:21.030> giant

space that was covered with all of these
eyes<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.760> was<00:02:23.819> basically<00:02:24.060> like<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.480> big<00:02:24.750> glass

zanpakuto<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.510> we've<00:02:36.630> seen<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:36.990> series

from<00:02:39.330> zero<00:02:39.600> division<00:02:39.959> we<00:02:40.080> can<00:02:40.200> only<00:02:40.440> imagine

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
from zero division we can only imagine

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.460 
from zero division we can only imagine
how<00:02:41.430> much<00:02:41.580> ray<00:02:41.880> pitch<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.360> coming<00:02:42.570> as<00:02:42.930> not<00:02:43.200> sway

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
how much ray pitch is coming as not sway

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.400 
how much ray pitch is coming as not sway
so<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:44.220> liked<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:45.030> chapter<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.870> was<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.110> little

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
so I liked this chapter it was a little

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.290 
so I liked this chapter it was a little
short<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:47.010> was<00:02:47.190> very<00:02:47.250> very<00:02:47.640> quick<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
short it was very very quick but the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.330 
short it was very very quick but the
artwork<00:02:48.660> was<00:02:48.810> cool<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.290> as<00:02:49.770> not<00:02:49.980> as<00:02:50.100> still<00:02:50.310> as

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
artwork was cool I as not as still as

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.770 
artwork was cool I as not as still as
creepy<00:02:50.820> as<00:02:50.850> ever<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.239> especially<00:02:51.510> like<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
creepy as ever I especially like the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.300 
creepy as ever I especially like the
scene<00:02:52.019> where<00:02:52.170> he<00:02:52.260> explodes<00:02:52.709> from<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.010> ice<00:02:53.130> and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
scene where he explodes from the ice and

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.280 
scene where he explodes from the ice and
transforms<00:02:53.880> little<00:02:54.720> disappointed<00:02:55.230> that

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
transforms little disappointed that

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.660 
transforms little disappointed that
Rukia<00:02:55.530> didn't<00:02:55.920> really<00:02:56.130> get<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.340> finish<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
Rukia didn't really get to finish the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.130
