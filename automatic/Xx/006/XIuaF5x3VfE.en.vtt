 There are many points of contact, such as the direction that you are often anyway 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.599
 the knight and thiago however, it almost seems that the target of 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.190
 reference to the public 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.830

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.489
 to the presenter and a series of comedians 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.179
 because the novelty of the comedians. 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.549
 but I see the difference of language and our most 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.599
 in the comment. here. a lot more space for musicians too 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.059

 if for a single arch capitulate the large plates 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.059
 this is not a stimulus for the immediate response of the public 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.309
 laughter yes there is no such thing 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:38.690
