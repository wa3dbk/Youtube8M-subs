this<00:00:36.450> little<00:00:36.750> area<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.290> believe<00:00:37.920> there's<00:00:38.100> like

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
this little area I believe there's like

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.010 
this little area I believe there's like
maybe<00:00:38.520> eight<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.969> them<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.360> don't<00:00:39.570> think<00:00:39.750> you

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
maybe eight of them I don't think you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.299 
maybe eight of them I don't think you
can<00:00:40.140> hit<00:00:40.230> them<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> sword<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.129> make<00:00:41.280> sure

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
can hit them with the sword so make sure

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.549 
can hit them with the sword so make sure
to<00:00:41.430> pick<00:00:41.610> up<00:00:41.730> some<00:00:41.940> ammo<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.140> need<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
to pick up some ammo if you so need it

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.350 
to pick up some ammo if you so need it
and<00:00:43.890> make<00:00:44.250> sure<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.670> those<00:00:44.910> balloons

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and make sure you get all those balloons

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.690 
and make sure you get all those balloons
as<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.559> kind<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.829> glitched<00:00:47.129> into<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
as this one kind of glitched into the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.220 
as this one kind of glitched into the
pipe<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.120> had<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> hard<00:00:48.600> time<00:00:48.660> shooting<00:00:48.989> it

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
pipe and I had a hard time shooting it

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.040 
pipe and I had a hard time shooting it
but<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:49.980> once<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.840> you're

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
but then once you do get that you're

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.750 
but then once you do get that you're
gonna<00:00:52.140> want<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> climb<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.980> tower<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> do

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
gonna want to climb the tower so to do

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.229 
gonna want to climb the tower so to do
that<00:00:53.789> go<00:00:54.000> outside<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.100> then<00:00:56.100> go<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that go outside and then go up the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.599 
that go outside and then go up the
little<00:00:57.690> ramp<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.680> made<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> little<00:00:59.309> mistake

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
little ramp here I made a little mistake

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.729 
little ramp here I made a little mistake
so<00:00:59.969> you'll<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> small<00:01:00.539> transition<00:01:01.440> but

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
so you'll see a small transition but

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.500 
so you'll see a small transition but
it's<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.699> take<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.090> whatever<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.390> want

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it's all one take or whatever you want

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.210 
it's all one take or whatever you want
to<00:01:03.570> call<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:04.589> you'll<00:01:04.680> need<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> jump

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
to call it and then you'll need to jump

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.359 
to call it and then you'll need to jump
on<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.670> these<00:01:05.820> platforms<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.229> I'm<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:08.040> exactly

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
on to these platforms so I'm not exactly

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.530 
on to these platforms so I'm not exactly
sure<00:01:08.549> what<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.850> description<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.450> this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
sure what the description of this

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.820 
sure what the description of this
achievement<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.470> need<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> do

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
achievement is but what you need to do

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.920 
achievement is but what you need to do
is<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.189> blow<00:01:11.610> off<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> balloons<00:01:12.299> as<00:01:12.570> well

is to blow off all the balloons as well
as<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.320> cow<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.520> once<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> very

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
as the cow so once we get to the very

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.230 
as the cow so once we get to the very
top<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:16.049> you'll<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.560> me<00:01:17.000> start<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.060> new

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
top here you'll see me start a new

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.090 
top here you'll see me start a new
cinematic<00:01:18.509> where<00:01:18.930> I'm<00:01:19.110> asked<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.650> spin<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
cinematic where I'm asked to spin the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.070 
cinematic where I'm asked to spin the
wheel<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.369> insanity<00:01:20.640> again<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> spin

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
wheel of insanity again and when I spin

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.840 
wheel of insanity again and when I spin
the<00:01:22.170> wheel<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.380> insanity<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.890> time<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.610> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the wheel of insanity this time I get I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.280 
the wheel of insanity this time I get I
land<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.390> cow<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:26.130> once<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.240> land<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.509> cow<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> cow

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
land on cow so once I land on cow a cow

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.399 
land on cow so once I land on cow a cow
does<00:01:28.650> spawn<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.750> just<00:01:30.750> make<00:01:30.900> sure<00:01:30.930> take<00:01:31.290> your

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
does spawn and just make sure take your

easiest thing to shoot because it's
moving<00:01:34.650> at<00:01:34.770> don't<00:01:35.070> think<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.610> lock<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
moving at don't think you can lock on to
it<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.390> me<00:01:36.720> kind<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.990> embarrass<00:01:37.380> myself<00:01:37.560> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it you see me kind of embarrass myself a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.039 
it you see me kind of embarrass myself a
little<00:01:38.100> bit<00:01:38.280> missing<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> think<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.930> hit

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
little bit missing but I think you hit

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.810 
little bit missing but I think you hit
like<00:01:40.140> two<00:01:40.380> or<00:01:40.530> three<00:01:40.560> shots<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.250> explodes

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
like two or three shots and it explodes

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
like two or three shots and it explodes
and<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:42.689> once<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.320> just<00:01:43.500> take<00:01:43.710> out

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and then once you do that just take out

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.530 
and then once you do that just take out
all<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.549> balloons<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.970> think<00:01:45.149> there's<00:01:45.270> another

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
all the balloons I think there's another

eight<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.960> them<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.909> shouldn't<00:01:48.210> lock

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
eight of them and that shouldn't lock

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.460 
eight of them and that shouldn't lock
