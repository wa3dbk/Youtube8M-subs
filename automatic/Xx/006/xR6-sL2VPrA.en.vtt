00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
know you can get filled more from it and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.860 
know you can get filled more from it and
you<00:03:23.640> might<00:03:23.790> not<00:03:23.940> get<00:03:24.090> hungry<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.510> like<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
you might not get hungry in like the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.020 
you might not get hungry in like the
next<00:03:25.110> seven<00:03:25.440> minutes<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:25.770> you<00:03:25.920> make<00:03:26.280> somewhat

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
next seven minutes so you make somewhat

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.820 
next seven minutes so you make somewhat
of<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.209> fair<00:03:27.450> point<00:03:27.750> because<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.230> Snickers<00:03:28.800> bar

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
of a fair point because a Snickers bar

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.160 
of a fair point because a Snickers bar
has<00:03:29.370> almost<00:03:29.730> no<00:03:29.970> nutritional<00:03:30.540> value<00:03:30.570> unless

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
has almost no nutritional value unless

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.420 
has almost no nutritional value unless
you<00:03:31.380> know<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.560> count<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.980> peanuts<00:03:32.310> as

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
you know you count the peanuts as

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.590 
you know you count the peanuts as
protein<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:32.880> don't<00:03:33.150> even<00:03:33.209> know<00:03:33.390> how<00:03:33.480> much

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
protein I don't even know how much

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.090 
protein I don't even know how much
protein<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.050> has<00:03:34.080> but<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.800> know<00:03:34.920> at<00:03:35.070> least

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
protein it has but you know at least

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.360 
protein it has but you know at least
with<00:03:35.430> oatmeal<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.880> have<00:03:36.300> some<00:03:36.660> grain<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:38.040> you

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
with oatmeal you have some grain and you

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.640 
with oatmeal you have some grain and you
know<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.970> guess<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.810> can<00:03:40.050> consider<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.500> a

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
know I guess you can consider that a

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.290 
know I guess you can consider that a
meal<00:03:40.860> but<00:03:41.010> look<00:03:41.220> sugar<00:03:41.820> is<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:41.970> worst

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
meal but look sugar is the worst

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.430 
meal but look sugar is the worst
possible<00:03:42.510> thing<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.900> can<00:03:43.050> put<00:03:43.230> in<00:03:43.320> your<00:03:43.380> body

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
possible thing you can put in your body

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.040 
possible thing you can put in your body
sugar<00:03:44.100> speeds<00:03:44.700> up<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.000> aging<00:03:45.030> process

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
sugar speeds up the aging process

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.780 
sugar speeds up the aging process
of<00:03:46.110> course<00:03:46.380> it's<00:03:46.560> horrible<00:03:47.130> when<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.550> comes<00:03:47.700> to

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
of course it's horrible when it comes to

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.240 
of course it's horrible when it comes to
developing<00:03:48.180> diabetes<00:03:48.470> it's<00:03:49.470> not<00:03:49.680> good<00:03:49.980> so

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
developing diabetes it's not good so

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.310 
developing diabetes it's not good so
yeah<00:03:50.570> counter-argument<00:03:51.570> cavemen<00:03:52.080> didn't

yeah counter-argument cavemen didn't

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.930 
yeah counter-argument cavemen didn't
have<00:03:52.410> much<00:03:52.620> sugar<00:03:52.890> they<00:03:53.550> didn't<00:03:53.790> live<00:03:53.910> very

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940
