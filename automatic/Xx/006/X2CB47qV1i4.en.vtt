00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:16.509
 this is why not but in this page cnrt this call is managed elsewhere 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:17.390
 the mayors 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.869
 the godmother carla bruni and all the gestures she will not stop 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.179
 if you want in summer 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.539
 you know that motorists who turns what changes lane without 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.749
 signal that to present dangers 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.700
 since you can not know where he is moving 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.260
 the green is also true 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.430
 the city at the controls early we must report its intentions so we go 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.320
 present the management col 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.280
 let's start with the town hall 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.510
 I'm happy to be able to control your bike from memory 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.100
 vezzoli standards of the Catholics come off with your left arm the hand 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.760
 we were down to the ground 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.920
 note that in some provinces 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.850
 pointing to the ground chanting his arm an English 45 degrees 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.479
 to sign the decrees on a peak day 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:09.079
 or the left village besides if his left or right arm we look at the 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.560
 finma backwards biosynex gage gently in the car 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.750
 yet very quickly 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.600
 the village you change my duty right certainly the cyclists who have 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.520
 parked the motorists confuse right turn signal and then we 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.600
 have shown that with the alarm signal I prefer this one in 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.020
 some cases for example when we want to go from the voice of center to that of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.799
 right it may be safer to use this other sign 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.750
 I'm going to wear movies or targeted music you can not change the code of the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.720
 road safety nor laws of physics I always write a shot 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.720
 behind you can use your rearview mirror 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.400
 and make sure you have cleared spaces to change lanes 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.900
 any security report you are well under way - and all that bad to be so 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.690
 that she gets out do not forget to take the handlebars with bricks 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.530
 after making your signal to properly control your bike in the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.880
 villages 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.790
 communicate with pedestrians and other cyclists is just as 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.670
 important that communicate with motorists 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.760
 you can use a bell for your voice to signal them your 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.969
 intentions 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.560
 in such a situation you want to be predictable but also you 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.649
 ensure that no one suddenly gets into your flesh 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:29.089
 when you pass pedestrians or cyclists announce your presence 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.349
 watch out for hot water but watch out for the right case 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.919
 a very sick father 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:38.139
 this armed attack going from 5 minutes to the end 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:42.249
 this last phase share a recipe in the box but at this 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.849
 entrance via northern damas nova
