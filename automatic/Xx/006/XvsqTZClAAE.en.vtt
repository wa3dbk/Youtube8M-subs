00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.009
 good others attached to a new video 

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:06.680
 well it seems we have more closures 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.800
 of servers this month you know that the 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.500
 May 31 will close game pai and all 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.480
 the games that you use in this technology 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.769
 will be your multiplayer servers and not 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.419
 we can access them here you have 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.730
 had several news of the games that 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:21.439
 esti and that they will not close today we have a 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.319
 also quite hard since star wars 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.089
 battlefront 2 will close the servers well 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.249
 it says on the steam page that a 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:31.339
 starting on May 31 , it will not be 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:34.960
 possible to play your online function and 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:37.059
 I'm the truth 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.860
 inform or else about the subject when 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.449
 you bought an old game look if 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.629
 I used technology or use of 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.300
 technology gamespy or do not use it and yes yes 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.550
 use it and try to find information 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.469
 about whether that server is going to be closed or not 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.089
 of the truth is that I would do so cautiously 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.339
 and the people who usually buy games 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.199
 old and others because they are cheap and 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.510
 all this be very careful with 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.820
 with this kind of little things because if you 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.649
 you buy a multiplayer game and then the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.800
 day May 31 what giant are you going to 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.240
 regret in pretty pretty enough 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.460
 and the truth is that it's a bitch, not everything 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.229
 this that they close servers and 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.119
 others you already know that transfer to others 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.770
 servers because it costs money and there 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.289
 companies, developer companies and 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.600
 others who are not interested in spending a single 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.770
 cent more in this kind of titles and of 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.539
 done because this comes to them quite 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.850
 pretty good to close some that 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.890
 they wanted to close a long time ago and with these 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.170
 courses because they close them we could not 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.000
 say so we'll see nothing to see what else 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.890
 games are coming out because this will not be 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.360
 the last one seems to be entering 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.000
 enough to announce games and 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.030
 they will close and which ones will not 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.740
 which is pretty bad pretty good 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.940
 for them to continue selling those 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.240
 games but I think they should already 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.460
 start to clarify and say yes and 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.560
 which not because May 30 would be 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.490
 when falling is that much less a month is missing 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.070
 there are about three weeks left and as I say 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.610
 all this is falling and I hope that 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.080
 go announcing more and more games 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.660
 soon rockstar as you already know with your 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.530
 statements of what games and what not in 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.270
 the games lame would not close and some 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.850
 how many more also arose for it 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.250
 enough more but it's still a 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.959
 long list endless thousands and thousands 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.520
 of games so good nothing more 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.720
 kids this I do everything and nothing we go in the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.720
 next video until the next all
