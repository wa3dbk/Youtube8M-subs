and<00:01:38.899> so<00:01:39.319> I<00:01:39.350> got<00:01:39.590> into<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:39.920> stand<00:01:40.249> in<00:01:40.729> about<00:01:40.909> 45

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
and so I got into the stand in about 45

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:42.340 
and so I got into the stand in about 45
minutes<00:01:41.659> before<00:01:41.810> dark

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
minutes before dark

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.410 
minutes before dark
one<00:01:43.039> of<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.219> main<00:01:43.399> bucks<00:01:43.700> you're<00:01:43.880> after<00:01:44.149> on

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
one of the main bucks you're after on

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.959 
one of the main bucks you're after on
the<00:01:44.509> property<00:01:44.990> came<00:01:45.679> from<00:01:45.859> down<00:01:46.069> that<00:01:46.310> run<00:01:46.549> and

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
the property came from down that run and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.239 
the property came from down that run and
I<00:01:47.780> really<00:01:48.229> don't<00:01:48.350> believe<00:01:48.679> he<00:01:48.859> has<00:01:48.950> come<00:01:49.130> into

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
I really don't believe he has come into

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:51.039 
I really don't believe he has come into
the<00:01:49.369> water<00:01:49.579> I<00:01:49.880> think<00:01:50.060> he<00:01:50.359> was<00:01:50.450> here<00:01:50.630> because<00:01:50.780> of

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
the water I think he was here because of

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.169 
the water I think he was here because of
the<00:01:51.140> scent<00:01:51.469> because<00:01:52.039> of<00:01:52.310> all<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.609> activity<00:01:53.090> of

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
the scent because of all the activity of

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.730 
the scent because of all the activity of
the<00:01:53.270> dolz<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:53.689> fawns<00:01:53.899> other<00:01:54.229> bucks<00:01:54.499> in<00:01:54.619> there

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
the dolz and fawns other bucks in there

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.929 
the dolz and fawns other bucks in there
and<00:01:54.829> he<00:01:54.979> might<00:01:55.130> have<00:01:55.219> once<00:01:55.399> been<00:01:55.549> one<00:01:55.759> of<00:01:55.789> those

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
and he might have once been one of those

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.069 
and he might have once been one of those
bucks<00:01:56.210> that<00:01:56.359> was<00:01:56.450> here<00:01:56.600> earlier<00:01:56.869> when<00:01:57.020> I

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
bucks that was here earlier when I

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.410 
bucks that was here earlier when I
walked<00:01:57.289> into<00:01:57.499> the<00:01:57.649> stand<00:01:57.920> but<00:01:58.880> he<00:01:59.030> was<00:01:59.149> coming

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
walked into the stand but he was coming

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.359 
walked into the stand but he was coming
from<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.600> West<00:01:59.689> he<00:02:00.139> was<00:02:00.229> simply<00:02:00.499> cruising

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
from the West he was simply cruising

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.340 
from the West he was simply cruising
through<00:02:01.399> on<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.819> lower<00:02:02.030> trail<00:02:02.389> that<00:02:03.109> lower

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
through on that lower trail that lower

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.830 
through on that lower trail that lower
trails<00:02:03.740> only<00:02:03.979> about<00:02:04.280> 20<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.819> 23<00:02:05.299> yards<00:02:05.659> below

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
trails only about 20 to 23 yards below

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.290 
trails only about 20 to 23 yards below
the<00:02:05.959> stand<00:02:06.350> here<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.920> again<00:02:07.639> it<00:02:07.789> wasn't<00:02:07.969> so

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
the stand here and again it wasn't so

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.760 
the stand here and again it wasn't so
much<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.479> he<00:02:08.780> had<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.110> come<00:02:09.259> into<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.470> water

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
much that he had to come into that water

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.920 
much that he had to come into that water
but<00:02:10.100> that<00:02:10.130> water<00:02:10.490> created<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.180> activity<00:02:11.720> the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
but that water created that activity the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.750 
but that water created that activity the
water<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.740> location<00:02:13.069> where<00:02:13.370> for<00:02:13.610> buck

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
water is in a location where for buck

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.240 
water is in a location where for buck
feels<00:02:14.000> weary<00:02:14.360> about<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.410> water<00:02:15.620> tank<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.040> can

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
feels weary about the water tank you can

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.360 
feels weary about the water tank you can
actually<00:02:16.400> go<00:02:16.670> around<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.180> and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
actually go around it and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.130 
actually go around it and
came<00:02:18.519> down<00:02:18.549> offered<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.239> perfect<00:02:19.659> shot<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:19.900> I

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
came down offered a perfect shot and I

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.440

a stiff Southwest breeze I didn't know I

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.449 
a stiff Southwest breeze I didn't know I
was<00:02:25.120> there<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.540> he<00:02:26.440> made<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.709> about<00:02:26.830> 60<00:02:27.250> 70

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
was there and he made it about 60 70

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.039 
was there and he made it about 60 70
yards<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.510> but<00:02:29.409> the<00:02:29.530> key<00:02:29.769> is<00:02:30.299> again<00:02:31.299> winds

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
yards and but the key is again winds

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.630 
yards and but the key is again winds
blown<00:02:32.379> up<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.739> an<00:02:32.830> open<00:02:33.129> area<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.430> woods

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
blown up to an open area of the woods

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.759 
blown up to an open area of the woods
where<00:02:33.819> our<00:02:33.909> approach<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.360> at<00:02:34.540> we<00:02:35.470> have<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.620> lot

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
where our approach is at we have a lot

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.470 
where our approach is at we have a lot
of<00:02:35.799> down<00:02:36.040> timber<00:02:36.370> we<00:02:36.489> from<00:02:36.640> walking<00:02:37.060> behind<00:02:37.209> to

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
of down timber we from walking behind to

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.930 
of down timber we from walking behind to
get<00:02:37.629> in<00:02:37.750> here<00:02:37.989> or<00:02:38.170> not<00:02:38.200> spooking<00:02:38.680> deer

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
get in here or not spooking deer

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.210 
get in here or not spooking deer
especially<00:02:39.940> in<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.090> morning<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.950> those<00:02:41.950> deer

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
especially in the morning and those deer

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.640 
especially in the morning and those deer
that's<00:02:42.489> just<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.790> natural<00:02:43.000> location<00:02:43.959> for<00:02:44.530> them

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
that's just a natural location for them

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.860 
that's just a natural location for them
to<00:02:44.860> make<00:02:45.489> them<00:02:45.640> some<00:02:45.790> bedding<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.629> feeding

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
to make them some bedding to feeding

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.589 
to make them some bedding to feeding
which<00:02:47.709> really<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.159> probably<00:02:48.640> well<00:02:49.000> over<00:02:49.030> 100

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
which really is probably well over 100

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.319 
which really is probably well over 100
yards<00:02:49.720> by<00:02:49.959> 120<00:02:50.680> 550<00:02:51.670> yards<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.120> range

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
yards by 120 550 yards in that range

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.740 
yards by 120 550 yards in that range
from<00:02:53.079> where<00:02:53.379> we're<00:02:53.500> at<00:02:53.620> right<00:02:53.650> here<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:54.750> we're

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
from where we're at right here so we're

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.619 
from where we're at right here so we're
well<00:02:55.989> well<00:02:56.650> back<00:02:56.950> from<00:02:57.280> that<00:02:57.730> edge<00:02:57.940> there's

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
well well back from that edge there's

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.569 
well well back from that edge there's
actually<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.959> thick<00:02:59.260> edge<00:02:59.470> up<00:02:59.799> along<00:03:00.129> the<00:03:00.370> field

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
actually a thick edge up along the field

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.250 
actually a thick edge up along the field
where<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.000> food<00:03:01.180> plot<00:03:01.359> is<00:03:01.390> we<00:03:01.750> get<00:03:01.900> actually

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
where the food plot is we get actually

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.449 
where the food plot is we get actually
get<00:03:02.379> a<00:03:02.410> little<00:03:02.650> bit<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:02.829> dough<00:03:02.950> but<00:03:03.099> I<00:03:03.159> think<00:03:03.340> up

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
get a little bit of dough but I think up

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.089 
get a little bit of dough but I think up
in<00:03:03.609> that<00:03:03.700> area<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:05.620> that's<00:03:05.859> what<00:03:06.010> you'd

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
in that area and and that's what you'd

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.979 
in that area and and that's what you'd
call<00:03:06.280> more<00:03:06.519> of<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.640> staging<00:03:06.909> area<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.569> really

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
call more of a staging area I really

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.599 
call more of a staging area I really
don't<00:03:08.140> like<00:03:08.319> to<00:03:08.530> hunt<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.829> staging<00:03:09.220> areas<00:03:09.459> too

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
don't like to hunt the staging areas too

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.670 
don't like to hunt the staging areas too
much<00:03:09.790> simply<00:03:10.750> for<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.959> fact<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.440> lot<00:03:11.590> of

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
much simply for the fact that a lot of

him<00:04:41.340> stepping<00:04:41.789> inside<00:04:41.909> the<00:04:42.240> tank<00:04:42.479> we<00:04:42.659> had

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
him stepping inside the tank we had

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.360 
him stepping inside the tank we had
fawns<00:04:43.080> playing<00:04:43.530> in<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.740> tank<00:04:43.949> and<00:04:44.099> we<00:04:44.190> just

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
fawns playing in the tank and we just

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.070 
fawns playing in the tank and we just
set<00:04:44.550> this<00:04:44.699> up<00:04:44.849> in<00:04:45.000> May<00:04:45.150> of<00:04:45.180> last<00:04:45.330> year<00:04:45.690> so<00:04:45.960> this

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
set this up in May of last year so this

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.170 
set this up in May of last year so this
is<00:04:46.199> something<00:04:46.500> that's<00:04:46.770> been<00:04:47.520> here<00:04:47.789> for<00:04:47.819> years

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
is something that's been here for years

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.850 
is something that's been here for years
and<00:04:48.419> they're<00:04:48.509> used<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.810> they've<00:04:49.379> never<00:04:49.620> had

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
and they're used to they've never had

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.330 
and they're used to they've never had
water<00:04:50.159> in<00:04:50.280> this<00:04:50.490> location<00:04:50.819> so<00:04:51.680> they<00:04:52.680> get<00:04:53.099> into

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
water in this location so they get into

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.249 
water in this location so they get into
this<00:04:53.490> water<00:04:53.729> now<00:04:53.909> it's<00:04:54.479> becoming<00:04:54.840> a<00:04:54.990> part<00:04:55.229> of

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
this water now it's becoming a part of

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.659 
this water now it's becoming a part of
their<00:04:55.409> daily<00:04:55.560> habit<00:04:56.039> and<00:04:56.159> their<00:04:56.250> daily<00:04:56.400> lives

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629 
hope this makes sense a little bit of a

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:07.879 
hope this makes sense a little bit of a
setup<00:05:06.840> or<00:05:07.050> we're<00:05:07.139> gonna<00:05:07.259> review<00:05:07.530> this<00:05:07.710> with

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
setup or we're gonna review this with

place we use Rubbermaid containers

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.339 
place we use Rubbermaid containers
coolers<00:05:44.330> but<00:05:45.330> we<00:05:45.419> get<00:05:45.599> the<00:05:45.719> water<00:05:45.900> here<00:05:46.199> when

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
coolers but we get the water here when

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.559 
coolers but we get the water here when
we<00:05:46.440> need<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.650> tank<00:05:47.279> like<00:05:47.460> that<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.759> 110<00:05:48.330> gallons

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 
we need it tank like that is 110 gallons

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.399 
we need it tank like that is 110 gallons
we<00:05:49.560> bought<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:49.770> local<00:05:50.219> feed<00:05:50.460> store<00:05:50.539> there's<00:05:51.539> $65

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 
we bought a local feed store there's $65

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.469 
we bought a local feed store there's $65
so<00:05:52.560> not<00:05:52.740> real<00:05:53.219> expensive<00:05:53.580> it's<00:05:54.090> holding<00:05:54.360> up

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
so not real expensive it's holding up

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.010 
so not real expensive it's holding up
well<00:05:54.690> in<00:05:54.779> the<00:05:54.840> wintertime<00:05:55.080> too<00:05:55.469> and<00:05:56.719> we<00:05:57.719> find

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
well in the wintertime too and we find

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.140 
well in the wintertime too and we find
that<00:05:58.199> if<00:05:58.469> that<00:05:58.650> was<00:05:58.830> full<00:05:59.129> in<00:05:59.340> May<00:05:59.580> we<00:06:00.000> didn't

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
that if that was full in May we didn't

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.369 
that if that was full in May we didn't
have<00:06:00.270> to<00:06:00.330> put<00:06:00.479> water<00:06:00.690> until<00:06:01.050> the<00:06:01.169> end<00:06:01.289> of

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
have to put water until the end of

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:02.779 
have to put water until the end of
September<00:06:01.529> October<00:06:01.979> when<00:06:02.430> we<00:06:02.520> hit<00:06:02.610> a<00:06:02.669> little

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
September October when we hit a little

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.550 
September October when we hit a little
bit<00:06:03.000> of<00:06:03.090> a<00:06:03.150> dry<00:06:03.330> spell<00:06:03.360> so<00:06:03.870> it<00:06:04.020> held<00:06:04.199> its<00:06:04.349> water

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
bit of a dry spell so it held its water

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.619 
bit of a dry spell so it held its water
for<00:06:04.800> a<00:06:04.860> very<00:06:05.039> long<00:06:05.219> time<00:06:05.360> we<00:06:06.360> have<00:06:06.479> some

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:06.629 
for a very long time we have some

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:08.839 
for a very long time we have some
smaller<00:06:06.990> tanks<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:07.860> some<00:06:08.069> man-made<00:06:08.520> holes

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
smaller tanks and some man-made holes

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.450 
smaller tanks and some man-made holes
and<00:06:09.360> this<00:06:10.110> this<00:06:10.409> tank<00:06:10.710> in<00:06:10.860> particular<00:06:11.159> I<00:06:11.370> think

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
and this this tank in particular I think

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.129 
and this this tank in particular I think
because<00:06:11.940> of<00:06:11.969> its<00:06:12.180> depth<00:06:12.479> we<00:06:12.779> keep<00:06:12.960> these

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
because of its depth we keep these

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.839 
because of its depth we keep these
watney's<00:06:13.650> water<00:06:13.889> holes<00:06:14.099> back<00:06:14.310> in<00:06:14.520> the<00:06:14.610> shade

watney's water holes back in the shade

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.909 
watney's water holes back in the shade
it's<00:06:15.509> very<00:06:15.750> important<00:06:16.169> you<00:06:16.229> don't<00:06:16.289> want<00:06:16.379> son

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
it's very important you don't want son

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.830 
it's very important you don't want son
and<00:06:17.099> drying<00:06:17.310> out<00:06:17.490> we<00:06:18.330> dig<00:06:18.539> him<00:06:18.629> in<00:06:18.750> a<00:06:18.779> little

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
and drying out we dig him in a little

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.019 
and drying out we dig him in a little
bit<00:06:19.139> that<00:06:19.590> water<00:06:20.279> temperatures<00:06:20.789> a<00:06:20.849> little<00:06:20.940> bit

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
bit that water temperatures a little bit

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:22.670 
bit that water temperatures a little bit
a<00:06:21.210> lot<00:06:21.419> cooler<00:06:21.629> than<00:06:21.810> it<00:06:21.990> would<00:06:22.139> be<00:06:22.169> out<00:06:22.409> if<00:06:22.560> it

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
a lot cooler than it would be out if it

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.189 
a lot cooler than it would be out if it
was<00:06:22.800> out<00:06:22.889> in<00:06:22.919> the<00:06:23.009> field<00:06:23.389> so<00:06:24.389> we<00:06:24.599> get<00:06:24.719> water<00:06:24.990> to

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
was out in the field so we get water to

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.809 
was out in the field so we get water to
last<00:06:25.409> year<00:06:25.650> pretty<00:06:25.830> large<00:06:26.099> I<00:06:26.219> think<00:06:26.250> we<00:06:26.490> added

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 
last year pretty large I think we added

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.140 
last year pretty large I think we added
60<00:06:27.240> gallons<00:06:27.599> of<00:06:27.659> water<00:06:27.870> to<00:06:28.169> this<00:06:29.060> during<00:06:30.060> the

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
60 gallons of water to this during the

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.939 
60 gallons of water to this during the
season<00:06:30.449> mostly<00:06:30.750> during<00:06:30.990> october/november

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
season mostly during october/november

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.730 
season mostly during october/november
on<00:06:32.129> two<00:06:33.090> separate<00:06:33.449> occasions<00:06:33.539> maybe<00:06:34.469> three

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
on two separate occasions maybe three

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.790 
on two separate occasions maybe three
separate<00:06:35.039> occasions<00:06:35.990> it<00:06:36.990> still<00:06:37.259> has<00:06:37.409> water<00:06:37.589> in

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
separate occasions it still has water in

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.079 
separate occasions it still has water in
it<00:06:37.889> in<00:06:38.009> early<00:06:38.190> February<00:06:38.639> and<00:06:38.759> I<00:06:38.820> know<00:06:38.909> we've

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:39.089 
it in early February and I know we've

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:40.700 
it in early February and I know we've
had<00:06:39.120> some<00:06:39.389> snow<00:06:39.690> melt<00:06:39.960> and

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
had some snow melt and

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.870 
had some snow melt and
we<00:06:40.860> haven't<00:06:41.070> had<00:06:41.160> a<00:06:41.220> lot<00:06:41.340> of<00:06:41.370> snow<00:06:41.550> this<00:06:41.820> year

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
we haven't had a lot of snow this year

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.820 
we haven't had a lot of snow this year
so<00:06:42.210> it's<00:06:42.690> holding<00:06:42.780> its<00:06:43.050> water<00:06:43.259> pretty<00:06:43.590> well

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
so it's holding its water pretty well

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:52.780 
so it's holding its water pretty well
and<00:06:44.100> I<00:06:44.850> hope<00:06:45.180> you<00:06:45.330> enjoy<00:06:45.539> the<00:06:45.690> setup

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.850
