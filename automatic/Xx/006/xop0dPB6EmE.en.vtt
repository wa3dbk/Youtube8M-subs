until movie about the base metaphors
from<00:00:20.250> electro<00:00:20.730> harmonix<00:00:21.330> now<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
from electro harmonix now this is a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.330 
from electro harmonix now this is a
channel<00:00:22.890> strip<00:00:23.130> effect<00:00:24.090> kind<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.920> one<00:00:25.920> size

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
channel strip effect kind of one size

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.939 
channel strip effect kind of one size
fits<00:00:26.970> all<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.930> all<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.260> need<00:00:28.470> kind<00:00:28.769> of

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
fits all this is all you need kind of

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.550 
fits all this is all you need kind of
thing<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.480> I'm<00:00:30.480> actually<00:00:30.779> using<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.439> today

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
thing and I'm actually using it today

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.459 
thing and I'm actually using it today
instead<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.489> my<00:00:32.820> radial<00:00:33.239> direct<00:00:33.780> box<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.320> well

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
instead of my radial direct box as well

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.280 
instead of my radial direct box as well
so<00:00:34.770> all<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.520> signal<00:00:35.969> recording<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.930> coming

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
so all the signal recording is coming

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.400 
so all the signal recording is coming
directly<00:00:37.410> from<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.610> base<00:00:38.790> metaphors<00:00:39.410> this

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
directly from the base metaphors this

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.869 
directly from the base metaphors this
pedal<00:00:40.860> allows<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.570> separate<00:00:43.110> EQ<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.879> some

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
pedal allows for a separate EQ and some

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.479 
pedal allows for a separate EQ and some
distortion<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:46.500> also<00:00:46.649> do<00:00:47.039> some

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
distortion and you can also do some

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.119 
distortion and you can also do some
compression<00:00:48.480> into<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> into<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> circuit<00:00:50.070> or

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
compression into the into the circuit or

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.610 
compression into the into the circuit or
not<00:00:50.280> things<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.180> control<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.020> pedal<00:00:52.379> here

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
not things that control the pedal here

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.180 
not things that control the pedal here
we've<00:00:52.770> got<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.300> dry<00:00:54.620> knob<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.829> beginning

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
we've got a dry knob at the beginning

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.060 
we've got a dry knob at the beginning
which<00:00:56.329> introduces<00:00:57.329> as<00:00:57.629> much<00:00:57.930> dry<00:00:58.320> signal<00:00:58.649> as

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
which introduces as much dry signal as

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.979 
which introduces as much dry signal as
you<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.579> or<00:00:59.730> don't<00:00:59.850> want<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.480> won't<00:01:00.780> be

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you want or don't want that won't be

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.759 
you want or don't want that won't be
affected<00:01:01.530> by<00:01:01.680> either<00:01:01.859> EQ<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> distortion<00:01:03.769> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
affected by either EQ the distortion the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.070 
affected by either EQ the distortion the
volume<00:01:05.430> controls<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> overall<00:01:06.450> output<00:01:06.689> of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
volume controls the overall output of

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.750 
volume controls the overall output of
the<00:01:07.170> circuit<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:08.520> controls<00:01:09.150> both<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.760> DI

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the circuit this controls both the DI

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.570 
the circuit this controls both the DI
out<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.260> regular<00:01:13.710> out<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.369> need<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
out and the regular out so you need to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.749 
out and the regular out so you need to
be<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> little<00:01:15.000> careful<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:16.340> when<00:01:17.340> when

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
be a little careful with that when when

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.149 
be a little careful with that when when
the<00:01:17.850> circuits<00:01:18.210> bypass<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.229> DI<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.680> full

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the circuits bypass the DI is full

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.410 
the circuits bypass the DI is full
volume<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.810> when<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.229> bypassed<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:24.030> volumes

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
volume so when it's bypassed the volumes

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.140 
volume so when it's bypassed the volumes
at<00:01:24.630> full<00:01:24.900> volume<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.500> when<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:26.150> activated

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
at full volume and when it's activated

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.760 
at full volume and when it's activated
the<00:01:27.270> volumes<00:01:27.659> at<00:01:27.840> whatever<00:01:27.990> volume<00:01:28.590> they're

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the volumes at whatever volume they're

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.499 
the volumes at whatever volume they're
so<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.189> need<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> be<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> hair<00:01:29.970> careful

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
so you just need to be a hair careful

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.090 
so you just need to be a hair careful
with<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:30.960> you're<00:01:31.140> using<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.560> DI<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
with that if you're using the DI and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.550 
with that if you're using the DI and
then<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:33.000> course<00:01:33.060> there<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.479> distortion<00:01:34.020> which

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
then of course there is distortion which

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.649 
then of course there is distortion which
is<00:01:34.829> controlled<00:01:35.460> by<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.640> separate<00:01:36.119> selector

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
is controlled by a separate selector

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.170 
is controlled by a separate selector
switch<00:01:36.930> over<00:01:37.259> here<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.520> even<00:01:39.000> when

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
switch over here which is on even when

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.499 
switch over here which is on even when
the<00:01:39.409> circuits<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:41.060> activated<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> can

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the circuits not activated so you can

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.210 
the circuits not activated so you can
tell<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.049> when<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.350> turn<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.829> there<00:01:44.070> will

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
tell that when you turn it on there will

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.090 
tell that when you turn it on there will
be<00:01:44.250> distortion<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.770> course<00:01:46.799> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
be distortion so and that of course is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.859 
be distortion so and that of course is
controlled<00:01:47.490> by<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.729> knob<00:01:47.939> right<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.630> there

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
controlled by this knob right here there

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.190
