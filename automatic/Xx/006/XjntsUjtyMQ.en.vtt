00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.809 

some<00:02:18.580> insecticide<00:02:19.680> think<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.860> mostly<00:02:21.519> use

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
some insecticide think that mostly use

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.280 
some insecticide think that mostly use
they<00:02:22.390> use<00:02:22.420> for<00:02:22.870> dogs

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
they use for dogs

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.649 
they use for dogs
now<00:02:24.010> there<00:02:24.250> is<00:02:24.370> one<00:02:24.400> insecticide<00:02:25.239> which<00:02:25.480> they

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
now there is one insecticide which they

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.690 
now there is one insecticide which they
use<00:02:25.870> for<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.230> dogs<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:26.860> we<00:02:26.890> mix<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.459> in<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
use for the dogs so we mix that in the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.369 
use for the dogs so we mix that in the
water<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.180> we<00:02:28.330> dip<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.750> pigeon<00:02:29.049> into<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
water and we dip the pigeon into the

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.610 
water and we dip the pigeon into the
water<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:30.310> clear<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:30.700> fleas<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.260> we

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
water to clear the fleas so this we

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.330 
water to clear the fleas so this we
usually<00:02:32.860> do<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.310> think<00:02:33.519> about<00:02:33.909> four<00:02:34.269> months

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
usually do I think about four months

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.380 
usually do I think about four months
