politics<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.719> improve<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> environment

politics and we improve the environment
it's<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.070> trifecta<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:57.329> three<00:00:57.690> things<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
it's a trifecta it's three things that

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.660 
it's a trifecta it's three things that
you<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.350> improve<00:00:58.680> at<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> same<00:00:59.309> time<00:01:01.670> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
you can improve at the same time the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.240 
you can improve at the same time the
idea<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> use<00:01:03.840> sugar<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.949> fuel

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
idea here is to use sugar as the fuel

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.820 
idea here is to use sugar as the fuel
and<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:06.270> using<00:01:06.900> nature's<00:01:07.229> own<00:01:07.380> machinery

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and then using nature's own machinery

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.640 
and then using nature's own machinery
using<00:01:08.520> enzymes<00:01:08.939> he's<00:01:09.570> able<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> get<00:01:09.990> power<00:01:10.290> out

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
using enzymes he's able to get power out

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.429 
using enzymes he's able to get power out

you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.890> get<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.280> free<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.670> we're<00:01:14.790> gonna

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you can get it for free and we're gonna

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.730 
you can get it for free and we're gonna
put<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.600> side<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.140> has<00:01:16.200> an<00:01:16.560> enzyme
