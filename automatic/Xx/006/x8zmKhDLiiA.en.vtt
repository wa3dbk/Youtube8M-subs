00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:11.378
In this video I'm going to talk about and show you 
 the Romanian Deadlift - a variation of the regular Deadlift.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:16.368
During this exercise the barbell doesn't touch the ground between 
 repetitions and you start in an upright position

00:00:16.368 --> 00:00:19.938
then lower the barbell and go back up.

00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:24.376
Because of the differences the targeted muscles are a bit different to regular Deadlifts.

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:30.215
The Quadriceps basically gets excluded from this exercise thus 
 receiving pretty much no work at all.

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:34.704
Especially the posterior chain gets worked hard, which consists of

00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:39.775
the hamstrings, the hip and the lower back.

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:42.211
These muscles or muscle groups get worked hard during Romanian Deadlifts.

00:00:43.112 --> 00:00:53.073
Many people confuse the Romanian Deadlift (RDL) with 
 the Straight-Leg(ged) or the Stiff-Leg(ged) Deadlift (SLDL).

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:59.213
The first difference is that during RDLs you start at the top 
 and then lower the bar to get into the bottom position.

00:00:59.213 --> 00:01:05.203
You initiate the movement with the hip by shoving it backwards

00:01:05.203 --> 00:01:10.275
while the legs are extended but not fully locked.

00:01:10.275 --> 00:01:15.881
When doing SLDLs you start at the floor.

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:21.904
It's more similar to regular Deadlifts because you pick the weight up 
 at first and lower it back down during each rep.

00:01:21.904 --> 00:01:26.609
This leads to slightly different worked muscles or muscle groups.

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:35.769
During RDLs the primary mover are the hamstrings and the hip, while 
 it's the erector spinae or the lower back for SLDLs.

00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:41.580
RDL: eccentric part first (starts at the top)
SLDL: 
 concentric part first (starts at the bottom)

00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:46.080
Regarding exercise form there are as always some noteable points.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.400
Firstly the lower back has to stay contracted during the whole movement.

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:56.710
This is necessary to protect the spine and work the lower back.

00:01:56.708 --> 00:02:05.670
Secondly that the bar has to stay close to 
 the body. Don't let it swing away.

00:02:05.668 --> 00:02:11.310
This is also key to reduce the stress which gets placed on your spine.

00:02:11.307 --> 00:02:15.880
Taking this into account there are several things 
 which can go wrong during Romanian Deadlifts.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.330
You might be tempted to round your back, which is bad. Don't do that.

00:02:20.334 --> 00:02:24.640
Then there's the issue with rounded shoulders.

00:02:24.638 --> 00:02:30.080
For some people this can cause shoulder issues so try 
 to hold them up and in a natural position.

00:02:30.077 --> 00:02:34.350
Also it can happen that if you lower the bar

00:02:34.348 --> 00:02:39.800
and you feel a desirable stretch in your hamstrings

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:47.480
Instead of noticing this and going back up you might be tempted to round 
 your lower back or move your knees forward to get extra depth.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.480
This is not desirable and should be avoided.

00:02:51.634 --> 00:02:53.940
Romanian Deadlift: Form

00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:56.340
Now, let me show you the exercise form.

00:02:56.339 --> 00:03:00.810
Choose a regular double overhand grip that's slightly wider than shoulder-wide.

00:03:02.712 --> 00:03:08.100
Some people can go deeper on this exercise than others. 
 This is simply a case of one's flexibility.

00:03:08.102 --> 00:03:11.240
Contract your lower back

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:26.900
Start the movement at the hip

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.280
Well, that's about it. Thanks for watching and until next time!

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:38.440
