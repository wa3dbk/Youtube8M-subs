00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.549
 with the girls, one more day 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.940
 channel today's video is this makeup 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:08.559
 very simple with a touch of blue 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.510
 that is so fashionable for these 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.580
 spring-summer seasons for 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.380
 start as always I will use my 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.650
 wild return playmate and I'm going to 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.390
 Apply on the entire eye area 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.069
 following this prime I'm going to use this 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.199
 shadow that is quite similar the color 

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:26.349
 of my skin and that I need to buy 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.300
 another one and I'm going to apply it in the 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.009
 eyelid and I'll take it to the area 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.050
 below the eyebrows and I want it to be 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.930
 I think it is uniformly in everything 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.050
 after that I will be using a 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.780
 brown shadow clarita 88 palette 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.570
 betinho colors and I'll apply it in 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.640
 the area of ​​the basin this shadow I want 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.440
 that diffuses very well because I want 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.440
 that is almost imperceptible 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.060
 then I'm going to apply a shadow to a 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.070
 brown a little darker and I'm going to 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.120
 apply in the basin area but more 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.000
 close to the eyelid and 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.430
 I'm going to I'm going to go up to 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.460
 create a smoky effect in that area 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.460
 I also want to blur the basin 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.590
 very good because we do not want it to be 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.570
 that this area here is the area 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.850
 eye - catching makeup but make it the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.150
 delineated now I'm going to apply this 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.330
 shade that is quite white illuminates 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.619
 very well the arch area of the eyebrows and 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.540
 nothing simply I'm going to apply it well 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.159
 stick to your eyebrows and they will give 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.100
 I notice that I am blurring it with the 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.100
 fingers to give a more natural finish 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.490
 now let's go to the interesting thing of 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.410
 makeup that is the delineated and for 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.740
 that I will use this eyeliner of the 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.930
 synthesis line &amp; the oceanic colors 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.520
 and I'm just going to delineate my eye like 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.500
 I do it when I use black eyeliner 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.619
 how can you notice the pigmentation of 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.860
 This liner is not the best so 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.509
 then I will be applying a pigment 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.739
 of the mais that is what gives that touch 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.739
 vibrant and intense to the delineated 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.580
 now I'm going to do my habits like 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.220
 I always do but in this case in this 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.980
 occasion made it a little more dramatic 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.800
 that I do normally with the outlined 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.239
 because as I told you we believe that 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.670
 the focus of this look is 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.670
 he is delineated blue 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.370
 now to make it look vibrant I'm going to 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.459
 use this pigment that I mentioned to you 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.430
 it's called one to turn of glam eyes 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.620
 cosmetics I am applying it moist 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.270
 not just what I did was to moisten 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.190
 the brush with a little solution of 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.830
 contact lenses and I applied it as 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.610
 you can see this eyeliner is what you 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:16.570
 gives that very intense touch almost 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.970
 fluorescent to makeup and just 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.709
 I'm applying it on the eyeliner 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.709
 that I applied previously 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.770
 to finish I'm going to apply a bit of 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.920
 pencil eyeliner on the water line 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:42.010
 both superior and inferior and then I'm going 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.200
 to use a pencil brush to 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.000
 blur that eyeliner a little and 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.860
 also apply a little of the 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.050
 brown color that we apply in the basin 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.239
 to finally I will apply a layer 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.830
 of mascara in this case 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.220
 I'm using the color show of 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.220
