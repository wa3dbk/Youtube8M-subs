going<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.539> use<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> square<00:00:19.170> sheet<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.380> paper

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
going to use a square sheet of paper

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.380 
going to use a square sheet of paper

eight centimeters or 1 and 1 eighths of
an<00:00:34.170> inch<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:35.130> let's<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.730> started<00:00:36.180> we<00:00:37.050> first

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
an inch so let's get started we first

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.229 
an inch so let's get started we first
have<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.590> fold<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.190> square<00:00:38.460> grid<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:39.030> eight

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
have to fold a square grid with eight

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.970 
have to fold a square grid with eight
divisions<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.840> each<00:00:40.020> side<00:00:40.320> I've<00:00:40.559> got<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
divisions on each side I've got a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.380 
divisions on each side I've got a
detailed<00:00:41.399> video<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.730> how<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:41.969> do<00:00:42.210> this

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
detailed video on how to do this

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.389 
detailed video on how to do this
accurately<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.530> I'm<00:00:43.620> speeding<00:00:43.950> through<00:00:44.070> it

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
accurately so I'm speeding through it

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.510 
accurately so I'm speeding through it
here<00:00:44.700> once<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.329> folded<00:00:45.719> your<00:00:45.840> 8x8<00:00:46.440> grid<00:00:46.520> we're

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
here once you folded your 8x8 grid we're

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.170 
here once you folded your 8x8 grid we're
going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.969> fold<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.920> one<00:00:49.920> row<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> bottom

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
going to fold in one row in the bottom

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.709 
going to fold in one row in the bottom
and<00:00:51.420> two<00:00:51.960> rows<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> top<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.340> now<00:00:54.239> we're

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and two rows in the top and now we're

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.479 
and two rows in the top and now we're
going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.110> fold<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:56.449> one<00:00:57.449> column<00:00:57.930> right<00:00:58.140> here

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
going to fold in one column right here

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.360 
going to fold in one column right here
while<00:00:59.489> opening<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.390> paper<00:01:00.840> here<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
while opening the paper here so that a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.260 
while opening the paper here so that a
diagonal<00:01:03.149> crease<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:04.049> created<00:01:04.820> right<00:01:05.820> from

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
diagonal crease is created right from

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.380 
diagonal crease is created right from
this<00:01:06.450> point<00:01:06.780> right<00:01:07.260> here<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.210> we're<00:01:09.210> bringing

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
this point right here so we're bringing

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.660 
this point right here so we're bringing
this<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:12.799> creasing<00:01:14.420> from<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.689> point<00:01:16.049> to

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
this in and creasing from that point to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.560 
this in and creasing from that point to
align<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.880> edge<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:20.430> third<00:01:20.850> crease

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
align this edge with the third crease

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.730 
align this edge with the third crease
line<00:01:21.840> right<00:01:22.110> here

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.139 

and<00:01:30.780> also<00:01:31.780> flatten<00:01:32.409> right<00:01:32.590> here<00:01:33.100> adding<00:01:34.060> a

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
and also flatten right here adding a

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.819 
and also flatten right here adding a
crease<00:01:34.920> there<00:01:36.630> now<00:01:37.630> we're<00:01:37.899> going<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.170> add<00:01:38.469> a

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
crease there now we're going to add a

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.539 
crease there now we're going to add a
crease<00:01:39.159> on<00:01:39.460> this<00:01:40.000> small<00:01:40.630> square<00:01:41.049> right<00:01:41.409> here

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
crease on this small square right here

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.059 
crease on this small square right here
just<00:01:42.549> by<00:01:42.700> bringing<00:01:42.969> the<00:01:43.899> point<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.710> the

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
just by bringing the point to the

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:52.020 
just by bringing the point to the
intersection<00:01:47.459> unfold<00:01:48.459> and<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:50.829> bring<00:01:51.700> that

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
intersection unfold and then bring that

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:00.029 
intersection unfold and then bring that
paper<00:01:52.709> inside<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:55.509> this<00:01:56.429> and<00:01:57.450> flatten<00:01:59.039> now

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
paper inside like this and flatten now

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.370 
paper inside like this and flatten now
you<00:02:00.100> have<00:02:00.459> a<00:02:00.489> corner<00:02:00.909> right<00:02:01.090> here<00:02:01.390> I'm<00:02:02.170> going

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
you have a corner right here I'm going

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:10.350 
you have a corner right here I'm going
to<00:02:02.500> fold<00:02:02.950> that<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:09.489> fold<00:02:10.119> it

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
to fold that and then just fold it

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.210 
to fold that and then just fold it
behind<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:12.430> it's<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.540> there<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.220> it's

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
behind so that it's in there and it's

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:24.229 
behind so that it's in there and it's
hidden<00:02:21.090> then<00:02:22.090> we're<00:02:22.420> going<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.750> fold<00:02:23.290> behind

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
hidden then we're going to fold behind

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:33.030 
hidden then we're going to fold behind
two<00:02:25.239> columns<00:02:26.040> like<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:31.530> flip<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.859> model

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
two columns like this and flip the model

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.770 
two columns like this and flip the model
over<00:02:34.470> now<00:02:35.470> we're<00:02:35.980> going<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.340> take<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:37.239> corner

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
over now we're going to take that corner

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:47.009 
over now we're going to take that corner
and<00:02:38.519> fold<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:39.760> behind<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:45.480> counting<00:02:46.480> one<00:02:46.780> two

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
and fold it behind and counting one two

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.440 
and fold it behind and counting one two
columns<00:02:47.620> we're<00:02:48.130> going<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.810> fold<00:02:49.810> this<00:02:50.370> forward

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
columns we're going to fold this forward

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.770 
columns we're going to fold this forward
and<00:02:53.639> then<00:02:54.900> we're<00:02:55.900> going<00:02:56.109> to<00:02:56.230> fold<00:02:56.799> behind<00:02:57.780> one

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
and then we're going to fold behind one

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.170 
and then we're going to fold behind one
