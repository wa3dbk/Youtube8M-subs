game I'm gonna just tell you right now
about<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.850> graphics<00:03:37.330> I<00:03:37.480> guess<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.230> graphics

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
about the graphics I guess the graphics

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.550 
about the graphics I guess the graphics
are<00:03:38.830> pretty<00:03:39.070> darn<00:03:39.580> good<00:03:39.850> I'm<00:03:40.600> considering

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
are pretty darn good I'm considering

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.820 
are pretty darn good I'm considering
it's<00:03:41.740> an<00:03:41.890> RPG<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:43.600> game<00:03:43.810> isn't<00:03:44.260> which

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
it's an RPG and the game isn't which

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.470 
it's an RPG and the game isn't which
originally<00:03:45.400> made<00:03:45.790> no<00:03:46.180> six<00:03:46.600> I<00:03:46.810> think<00:03:48.480> it's

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
originally made no six I think it's

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.180 
originally made no six I think it's
really<00:03:49.870> good<00:03:50.110> it's<00:03:51.070> probably<00:03:51.540> 720p<00:03:52.540> graphics

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
really good it's probably 720p graphics

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:20.210 
really good it's probably 720p graphics
maybe<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.310> little<00:03:54.490> less
