00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
signed up for the course and I didn't

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.700 
signed up for the course and I didn't
really<00:01:17.240> realize<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.170> connection<00:01:18.560> to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
there is a huge range of skills that you

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.710 
there is a huge range of skills that you
learn<00:01:29.320> when<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:29.950> say<00:01:30.130> first-year<00:01:30.720> experiment

with different mediums we experiment and

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.790 
with different mediums we experiment and
