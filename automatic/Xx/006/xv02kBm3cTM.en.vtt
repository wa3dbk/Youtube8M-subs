so<00:00:00.480> we're<00:00:00.690> going<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.900> focus<00:00:01.140> on<00:00:01.500> my<00:00:01.979> young<00:00:02.220> men

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
so we're going to focus on my young men

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.309 
so we're going to focus on my young men
this<00:00:02.700> video<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:04.339> just<00:00:05.339> want<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:06.319> first

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
this video and I just want you to first

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.140 
this video and I just want you to first
know<00:00:07.560> that<00:00:07.799> in<00:00:07.980> our<00:00:08.340> case<00:00:08.700> we're<00:00:08.970> going<00:00:09.090> to

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
know that in our case we're going to

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.419 
know that in our case we're going to
focus<00:00:09.420> on<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.870> case<00:00:10.139> where<00:00:10.440> people<00:00:11.130> divide

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
focus on the case where people divide

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.629 
focus on the case where people divide
money<00:00:12.320> people<00:00:13.320> divide<00:00:13.650> both<00:00:13.920> between<00:00:14.400> money

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
money people divide both between money

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.240 
money people divide both between money
and<00:00:14.730> personal<00:00:15.330> investments<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.199> when<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:16.980> mean

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
and personal investments and when I mean

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.220 
and personal investments and when I mean
personal<00:00:17.760> investments<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.330> mean<00:00:18.600> bonds<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
personal investments I mean bonds and

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.109 
personal investments I mean bonds and
this<00:00:19.770> leads<00:00:20.010> us<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> discussion<00:00:21.029> of

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
this leads us to the discussion of

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.349 
this leads us to the discussion of
present<00:00:21.720> value<00:00:22.160> what<00:00:23.160> present<00:00:23.580> value<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.060> it's

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
present value what present value is it's

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.560 
present value what present value is it's
pretty<00:00:24.720> much<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.880> discounted<00:00:26.880> value<00:00:27.090> for

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
pretty much just a discounted value for

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.410 
pretty much just a discounted value for
some<00:00:27.779> future<00:00:28.080> reward<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.519> there's<00:00:30.179> actually

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
some future reward so there's actually

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.330 
some future reward so there's actually
your<00:00:30.750> formula<00:00:31.349> for<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.859> formula

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
your formula for this and the formula

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:44.440 
your formula for this and the formula
for<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:33.030> P<00:00:33.870> V<00:00:35.090> subscript<00:00:36.090> T<00:00:38.540> equal<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:40.050> R<00:00:41.840> T

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
for this is P V subscript T equal to R T

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
for this is P V subscript T equal to R T
over<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:46.340> plus<00:00:47.340> or<00:00:47.700> 1<00:00:48.239> plus<00:00:48.600> i<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.710> power<00:00:49.829> of

over I plus or 1 plus i to the power of

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:58.540 
over I plus or 1 plus i to the power of
T<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:54.079> T<00:00:55.079> would<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.340> our<00:00:56.989> period<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.140> time

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
T and T would be our period of time

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:08.780 
T and T would be our period of time
period<00:00:59.550> of<00:01:00.649> time<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:05.210> I<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:07.220> would<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.490> our

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
period of time and and I I would be our

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:20.080 
period of time and and I I would be our
current<00:01:09.299> interest<00:01:09.689> rate<00:01:11.930> interest<00:01:12.930> rate<00:01:18.320> now

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
current interest rate interest rate now

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.700 
current interest rate interest rate now
let's<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.240> through<00:01:21.390> an<00:01:21.450> example<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.170> this

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
let's go through an example so this

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.039 
let's go through an example so this
example<00:01:23.130> suppose<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.000> promise<00:01:24.479> two<00:01:24.630> hundred

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
example suppose you promise two hundred

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.370 
example suppose you promise two hundred
dollars<00:01:25.380> next<00:01:25.680> year<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.850> next<00:01:27.299> year<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.869> where

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
dollars next year and next year is where

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.270 
dollars next year and next year is where
t<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.009> equal<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.880> one<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.920> current

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
t is equal to one and the current

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.719 
t is equal to one and the current
interest<00:01:32.700> rate<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.180> ten<00:01:34.110> percent<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.829> ten

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
interest rate is ten percent and ten

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.120 
interest rate is ten percent and ten
percent<00:01:36.180> means<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:38.100> our<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:39.200> 0.1<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.860> our

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
percent means that our I is 0.1 so our

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.770 
percent means that our I is 0.1 so our
present<00:01:41.909> value<00:01:42.420> or<00:01:42.659> present<00:01:43.409> value<00:01:43.920> for<00:01:44.780> for

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
present value or present value for for

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.050 
present value or present value for for
next<00:01:46.140> year<00:01:46.350> where<00:01:46.619> T<00:01:46.920> equals<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.549> one<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.090> pv<00:01:48.869> 1

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
next year where T equals to one is pv 1

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:59.959 
next year where T equals to one is pv 1
equal<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.090> R<00:01:51.540> 1<00:01:52.549> over<00:01:54.439> 1<00:01:55.439> plus<00:01:56.360> i1<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.969> our

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
equal to R 1 over 1 plus i1 and our

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.060 
equal to R 1 over 1 plus i1 and our
return<00:02:00.450> were<00:02:00.780> promised<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.350> hundred<00:02:01.740> dollars

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
return were promised a hundred dollars

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.480 
return were promised a hundred dollars
next<00:02:02.340> year<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.329> would<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.750> our<00:02:03.869> far<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:05.100> r

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
next year so this would be our far so r

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.300 
next year so this would be our far so r
1<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.450> hundred<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:08.929> one<00:02:09.929> plus<00:02:10.259> i1<00:02:10.530> plus<00:02:11.039> 1

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
1 is a hundred and one plus i1 plus 1

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.730 
1 is a hundred and one plus i1 plus 1
point<00:02:11.580> 1<00:02:12.510> 1<00:02:12.750> plus<00:02:13.230> your<00:02:13.410> point

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
point 1 1 plus your point

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.890 
point 1 1 plus your point
one<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:14.190> 1.1<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:17.210> this<00:02:18.210> is<00:02:18.360> pretty<00:02:18.750> much

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
one is just 1.1 and this is pretty much

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:28.630 
one is just 1.1 and this is pretty much
a<00:02:20.720> thousand<00:02:21.720> /<00:02:22.220> 11<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:24.120> our<00:02:24.870> pv<00:02:26.780> pv<00:02:27.780> 1<00:02:27.960> is

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
a thousand / 11 so our pv pv 1 is

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.970 
a thousand / 11 so our pv pv 1 is
approximately<00:02:29.640> on<00:02:30.120> 91<00:02:31.080> dollars<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
approximately on 91 dollars so the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.630 
approximately on 91 dollars so the
present<00:02:35.520> value<00:02:36.800> discounting<00:02:37.800> value<00:02:38.160> for<00:02:38.430> our

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
present value discounting value for our

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.990 
present value discounting value for our
future<00:02:39.360> hundred<00:02:39.840> dollars<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.580> 91<00:02:41.580> not<00:02:41.760> dollars

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
future hundred dollars is 91 not dollars

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.260 
future hundred dollars is 91 not dollars
and<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.290> what<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.650> want<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.700> go<00:02:44.880> through

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
and this is what I want to go through

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.020 
and this is what I want to go through
this<00:02:45.570> video<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:47.010> hope<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.400> see<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.820> in<00:02:47.910> the
