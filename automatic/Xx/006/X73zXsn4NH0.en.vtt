 a three-month internship not very 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.780
 Although well paid but it has given me the

 Spain as soon as they appear suitable 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.950
 become permanent employment contracts 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:19.850
 offered for most of them 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:21.380
 is it the first time in the life in 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.940
 Germany would very much like to be back in Germany 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.420
 the emergency room work as already 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.420
 Back then in Berlin 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.150
 but if you are for spain it is 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.830
 on the one hand, of course, a loss if 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.870
 Young people like Sarah leave the country 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.980
 I see the regional government 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.980
 on the other hand also advantages 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.820
 also in the opinion of these deputies 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.380
 can the citizens of the emergence 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.160
 a pan-European labor market 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.160
 benefit

 a small town near Cologne the 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.670
 age average is high trend 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.319
 rising the region would need four times 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.220
 more nursing staff than the labor market 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.080
 currently gives 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.670
 there are the six young Spanish 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.020
 sisters and nurses the few 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.510
 weeks in this care facility 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.510
 work as called 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.750
 all six are incredibly motivated 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.340
 Also very involved in dealing with the 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.980
 People are now here in the facility 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.900
 that's fun, but it 's just that 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.430
 a lot of costs and a lot of effort 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.750
 Nursing and sisters so far 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.430
 all have worked in clinics 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:16.959
 estimate that more intimate ambiance of a 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:18.700
 nursing home at an intel logo oster 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.380
 Europe would become the 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.729
 Managing Directors wish the risk for 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.470
 the training of young workers 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.850
 not to have to carry alone 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.850
 everyone has a 40-hour week and 80 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.050
 percent of it is taught in German and 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.220
 then, of course, here too 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.720
 Requirements expert care documentation 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.100
 Quality Management should be one of 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.870
 young Spaniards do not decide anymore 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.460
 keep going then it would stay 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.640
 German employer at this cost 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.640
 sit
