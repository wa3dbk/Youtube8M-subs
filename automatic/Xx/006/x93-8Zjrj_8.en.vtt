00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
of the Patriots this one is like the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.620 
of the Patriots this one is like the

yeah<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.450> think<00:02:24.570> that's<00:02:24.870> what<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.140> well<00:02:25.710> I

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
yeah I think that's what it is well I

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.290 
yeah I think that's what it is well I
think<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.220> trick<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.820> know<00:02:27.060> that's

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
think the trick is you know that's

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.420 
think the trick is you know that's
probably<00:02:27.570> gonna<00:02:27.720> be<00:02:27.780> snowy<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:29.070> we<00:02:29.160> got<00:02:29.310> all

probably gonna be snowy so we got all

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.760 
probably gonna be snowy so we got all
these<00:02:29.580> white<00:02:29.880> guys<00:02:30.120> no<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:31.080> stop<00:02:31.290> there<00:02:31.620> all

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
91 yards passing Cam Newton also didn't

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.210 
91 yards passing Cam Newton also didn't
have<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.840> great<00:04:12.989> game<00:04:13.140> 16<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.650> 32<00:04:14.010> with<00:04:14.160> an

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
have a great game 16 of 32 with an

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.610 
have a great game 16 of 32 with an
interception<00:04:14.580> but<00:04:15.360> here's<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.229> difference

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
interception but here's the difference

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.440 
interception but here's the difference
in<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.070> game<00:04:17.310> Vernon<00:04:17.640> Davis<00:04:17.880> left<00:04:18.090> early

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
in that game Vernon Davis left early

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.000 
in that game Vernon Davis left early
with<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.690> concussion<00:04:19.109> they<00:04:19.650> didn't<00:04:19.919> have

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
with a concussion they didn't have

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.979 
with a concussion they didn't have
Crabtree<00:04:20.609> back<00:04:20.849> and<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.390> think<00:04:21.630> that's<00:04:21.840> the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
Crabtree back and I think that's the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:22.550 
Crabtree back and I think that's the
main<00:04:22.169> difference

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
main difference

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.050 
main difference
these<00:04:22.800> two<00:04:22.919> teams<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.700> Niners

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
these two teams is that the Niners

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.840 
these two teams is that the Niners
actually<00:04:24.600> have<00:04:24.870> viable<00:04:25.830> options<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.580> throw<00:04:26.790> to

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
actually have viable options to throw to
