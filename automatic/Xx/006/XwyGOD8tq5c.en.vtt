even bright sunny days can all cause
winter<00:00:14.630> damage<00:00:14.870> to<00:00:15.259> a<00:00:15.290> number<00:00:15.590> of<00:00:15.620> our

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
winter damage to a number of our

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.220 
winter damage to a number of our
evergreen<00:00:16.550> shrubs<00:00:16.970> such<00:00:17.300> as<00:00:17.450> this<00:00:17.570> boxwood

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
evergreen shrubs such as this boxwood

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.839 
evergreen shrubs such as this boxwood
now<00:00:18.890> boxwood<00:00:19.580> or<00:00:19.820> buxus<00:00:20.420> sempervirens<00:00:21.140> are

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
now boxwood or buxus sempervirens are

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.470 
now boxwood or buxus sempervirens are
particularly<00:00:22.849> sensitive<00:00:23.750> to<00:00:24.290> winter<00:00:24.680> damage

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
particularly sensitive to winter damage

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.909 
particularly sensitive to winter damage
particularly<00:00:26.480> if<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:26.930> plant<00:00:27.230> has<00:00:27.349> entered

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
particularly if the plant has entered

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.339 
particularly if the plant has entered
the<00:00:28.130> winter<00:00:28.489> in<00:00:28.730> a<00:00:29.239> compromised<00:00:29.840> state<00:00:30.230> of

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
the winter in a compromised state of

health

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.499 
health
so<00:00:30.890> keeping<00:00:31.189> our<00:00:31.309> plants<00:00:31.669> healthy<00:00:32.119> is<00:00:32.180> one<00:00:32.360> way

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
so keeping our plants healthy is one way

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.530 
so keeping our plants healthy is one way
to<00:00:32.750> avoid<00:00:33.320> damage<00:00:33.829> but<00:00:34.640> with<00:00:34.940> a<00:00:34.969> severe<00:00:35.390> winter

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
to avoid damage but with a severe winter

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.530 
to avoid damage but with a severe winter
damage<00:00:36.110> is<00:00:36.260> often<00:00:36.670> occurs<00:00:37.670> and<00:00:37.970> there's

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
damage is often occurs and there's

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.790 
damage is often occurs and there's
several<00:00:38.720> different<00:00:38.840> types<00:00:39.260> of<00:00:39.410> damage<00:00:39.770> that

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
several different types of damage that

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.060 
several different types of damage that
we<00:00:39.980> see<00:00:40.400> the<00:00:40.580> most<00:00:40.790> common<00:00:41.540> is<00:00:41.720> winter<00:00:42.680> burn<00:00:42.890> of

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
we see the most common is winter burn of

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.070 
we see the most common is winter burn of
the<00:00:43.190> foliage<00:00:43.670> such<00:00:44.000> as<00:00:44.180> we<00:00:44.300> have<00:00:44.510> here<00:00:44.540> now

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
the foliage such as we have here now

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.370 
the foliage such as we have here now
this<00:00:45.710> can<00:00:45.950> happen<00:00:46.390> when<00:00:47.390> heavy<00:00:47.990> winds

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
this can happen when heavy winds

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.130 
this can happen when heavy winds
desiccate<00:00:49.220> the<00:00:49.340> plant<00:00:49.610> or<00:00:49.850> if<00:00:50.030> a<00:00:50.210> warm<00:00:50.630> during

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
desiccate the plant or if a warm during

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.140 
desiccate the plant or if a warm during
a<00:00:51.320> warm<00:00:51.560> spell<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.070> plant<00:00:52.340> uses<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.760> lot<00:00:52.970> more

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
a warm spell the plant uses a lot more

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.930 
a warm spell the plant uses a lot more
moisture<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.900> this<00:00:54.560> is<00:00:54.740> especially<00:00:55.160> common

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
moisture and this is especially common

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.620 
moisture and this is especially common
if<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:57.380> ground<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.950> frozen<00:00:58.160> at<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.610> time<00:00:58.940> that

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
if the ground is frozen at the time that

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.960 
if the ground is frozen at the time that
these<00:00:59.900> windy<00:01:00.530> periods<00:01:00.950> occur<00:01:01.370> that<00:01:01.790> the

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
these windy periods occur that the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.179 
these windy periods occur that the
bright<00:01:02.630> sunshine<00:01:02.960> because<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.649> plant<00:01:03.920> can't

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
bright sunshine because the plant can't

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.310 
bright sunshine because the plant can't
take<00:01:04.489> up<00:01:04.670> more<00:01:05.000> moisture<00:01:05.210> from<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.750> soil<00:01:06.020> to

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
take up more moisture from the soil to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.100 
take up more moisture from the soil to
replace<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.130> water<00:01:07.340> that's<00:01:07.790> lost<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.630> what

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
replace the water that's lost and what

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.340 
replace the water that's lost and what
we<00:01:09.260> see<00:01:09.500> happen<00:01:10.010> is<00:01:10.220> some<00:01:10.820> damaged<00:01:11.750> foliage

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
we see happen is some damaged foliage

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.860 
we see happen is some damaged foliage
that's<00:01:12.620> dried<00:01:12.950> out<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.610> oftentimes<00:01:14.450> it's

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
that's dried out and oftentimes it's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.780 
that's dried out and oftentimes it's
reddish<00:01:15.200> or<00:01:15.380> brown<00:01:15.620> in<00:01:15.650> color<00:01:16.130> it<00:01:16.400> might<00:01:16.610> be

reddish or brown in color it might be

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.060 
reddish or brown in color it might be

plant we have you could clearly see the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.020 
plant we have you could clearly see the
difference<00:01:24.260> between<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.740> damaged<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.490> the

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
damage that occurs from winter injury

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.840 
damage that occurs from winter injury
happens<00:01:32.659> when<00:01:33.020> we<00:01:33.200> have<00:01:33.530> wide<00:01:34.369> fluctuations

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
happens when we have wide fluctuations

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.469 
happens when we have wide fluctuations
in<00:01:35.450> temperature<00:01:35.479> on<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.890> warmer<00:01:37.369> days<00:01:37.580> a<00:01:37.909> lot

damaged plant tissue if that severe
enough<00:01:59.450> we'll<00:01:59.689> see<00:01:59.900> cracks<00:02:00.320> develop<00:02:01.220> along

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
enough we'll see cracks develop along
