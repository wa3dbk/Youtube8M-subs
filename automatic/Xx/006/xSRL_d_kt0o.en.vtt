in<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.210> video<00:00:09.540> we'll<00:00:09.719> be<00:00:09.750> unboxing<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.860> AMD

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
in this video we'll be unboxing the AMD

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.010 
in this video we'll be unboxing the AMD
FX<00:00:12.290> 1858<00:00:13.290> core<00:00:13.620> processor<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.599> yes<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.839> these

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
FX 1858 core processor so yes in these

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.630 
FX 1858 core processor so yes in these
browsers<00:00:16.440> processors<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.070> been<00:00:17.190> finally

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
browsers processors have been finally

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.640 
browsers processors have been finally
released<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.660> met<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> met<00:00:19.500> with<00:00:19.619> a

released and I met to the met with a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.710 
released and I met to the met with a
very<00:00:19.859> Mex<00:00:20.100> response<00:00:20.490> some<00:00:21.240> people<00:00:21.480> said<00:00:21.630> they

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
very Mex response some people said they

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.240 
very Mex response some people said they
were<00:00:21.779> really<00:00:21.960> good<00:00:22.140> other<00:00:22.560> people<00:00:22.890> over<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
were really good other people over the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.519 
were really good other people over the
overwhelming<00:00:24.060> thing<00:00:24.119> was<00:00:24.449> many<00:00:25.140> people<00:00:25.380> said

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
overwhelming thing was many people said

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.630 
overwhelming thing was many people said
they<00:00:25.619> didn't<00:00:25.859> like<00:00:25.949> them<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.490> didn't

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
they didn't like them and it didn't

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.640 
they didn't like them and it didn't
perform<00:00:26.760> as<00:00:26.970> well<00:00:27.150> as<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> i7<00:00:27.869> 2670

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.200 

performing<00:00:31.650> chip<00:00:31.880> especially<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.059> you're

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
performing chip especially if you're

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.490 
performing chip especially if you're
looking<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.480> extreme<00:00:33.660> multi-threaded

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
looking for extreme multi-threaded

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.430 
looking for extreme multi-threaded
performance<00:00:35.040> due<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.940> its<00:00:36.059> eve<00:00:36.149> course<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.290> for

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
performance due to its eve course so for

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.049 
performance due to its eve course so for
things<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.739> video<00:00:38.010> editing<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
things like video editing this is a

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.630 
things like video editing this is a
really<00:00:39.270> good<00:00:39.390> processor<00:00:40.129> so<00:00:41.129> here's<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> box

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
really good processor so here's the box

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.940 
really good processor so here's the box
it's<00:00:42.000> actual<00:00:42.329> metal<00:00:42.480> 10<00:00:42.750> rather<00:00:43.710> than<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
it's actual metal 10 rather than a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.459 
it's actual metal 10 rather than a
cardboard<00:00:44.550> box<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.960> front<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.350> see

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
cardboard box so on the front we can see

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.220 
cardboard box so on the front we can see
a<00:00:46.500> very<00:00:46.620> nice<00:00:46.800> thing<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> AMD<00:00:47.460> arrow

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
a very nice thing with the AMD arrow

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.540 
a very nice thing with the AMD arrow
back<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> processor<00:00:49.920> obviously<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.460> not

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
back to the processor obviously it's not

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.709 
back to the processor obviously it's not
got<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.180> real<00:00:51.329> life<00:00:52.760> AMD<00:00:53.760> FX<00:00:54.030> equal

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
got that on it in real life AMD FX equal

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.439 
got that on it in real life AMD FX equal

we<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.629> see<00:00:57.949> other<00:00:58.949> process<00:00:59.340> itself<00:00:59.670> drill

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
we can see other process itself drill

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.479 
we can see other process itself drill
holes<00:01:00.210> loosen<00:01:00.780> their<00:01:01.129> apex<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> core

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
holes loosen their apex the core

there<00:01:12.260> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> back<00:01:13.560> we've<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> seal<00:01:14.189> for

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
there on the back we've got a seal for

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
there on the back we've got a seal for
the<00:01:14.700> box<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.960> some<00:01:16.140> more<00:01:16.229> information<00:01:16.409> about

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the box and some more information about

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.870 
the box and some more information about
it<00:01:17.869> just<00:01:18.869> what's<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.320> box<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
it just what's in the box really on the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.060 
it just what's in the box really on the
side<00:01:21.150> seam<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.409> find<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.770> our

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
raddion graphics card you'll get you

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.380 
raddion graphics card you'll get you
know<00:01:26.040> some<00:01:26.580> petrol<00:01:26.939> graphics<00:01:27.240> performance

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
know some petrol graphics performance

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.999 
know some petrol graphics performance
however<00:01:28.110> there's<00:01:28.350> no<00:01:28.439> problem<00:01:28.740> using<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
however there's no problem using this

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.679 
however there's no problem using this
with<00:01:29.189> Nvidia<00:01:29.880> graphics<00:01:30.030> card<00:01:30.450> or<00:01:30.509> anything

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
with Nvidia graphics card or anything

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.929 
with Nvidia graphics card or anything
like<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
like that

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.490 
like that
gates<00:01:32.939> let's<00:01:33.210> open<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.869> box<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.320> need<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
gates let's open this box so we need to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.469 
gates let's open this box so we need to
break<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> seals<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.970> they're<00:01:36.150> on

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
break the seals of it so that they're on

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.120 
break the seals of it so that they're on
inside<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:40.680> moving<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
inside here like that it's moving the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.600 
inside here like that it's moving the
box<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.259> comes<00:01:43.259> like<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.950> doesn't<00:01:47.100> come<00:01:47.369> off

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
box so comes like it doesn't come off

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.139 
box so comes like it doesn't come off
they<00:01:47.729> look<00:01:49.280> nice<00:01:50.630> some<00:01:51.630> people<00:01:51.869> box<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.320> list

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
they look nice some people box this list

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.020 
they look nice some people box this list
box<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.509> yep<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.649> yes<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.460> see<00:01:56.790> some<00:01:56.909> stuff

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
box this is yep so yes we see some stuff

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.380 
box this is yep so yes we see some stuff
and<00:01:57.210> say<00:01:57.299> it'll<00:01:57.570> take<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> state's<00:01:58.439> or<00:01:59.390> excuse

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
and say it'll take the state's or excuse

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.560 
and say it'll take the state's or excuse
me<00:02:00.420> stuck

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
me stuck

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.200 
me stuck
so<00:02:03.170> first<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.440> all<00:02:03.470> we<00:02:03.590> get<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.980> DMV<00:02:04.970> stock

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
so first of all we get the DMV stock

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.090 
so first of all we get the DMV stock
cooler<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:05.660> we'll<00:02:05.810> see<00:02:06.410> what<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:06.590> one<00:02:06.710> is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100
