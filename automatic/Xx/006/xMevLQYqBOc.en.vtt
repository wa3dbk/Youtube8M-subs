00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
took this base you know how hard it is

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.000 
took this base you know how hard it is
especially<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> competent<00:00:19.619> team<00:00:19.770> this

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
especially with a competent team this

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.160 
especially with a competent team this
basis<00:00:20.640> I'd<00:00:20.880> go<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.390> far<00:00:21.539> say<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:21.900> almost

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
basis I'd go so far say it's almost

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.380 
basis I'd go so far say it's almost
impossible<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:23.010> take<00:00:23.189> without<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> lot<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.150> luck

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
impossible to take without a lot of luck

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.859 
impossible to take without a lot of luck

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.700 
start off right here see I'm almost out
of<00:00:33.149> ammo<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.600> I'll<00:00:33.690> pick<00:00:33.840> up<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.079> guy's<00:00:34.320> kit

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
of ammo so I'll pick up this guy's kit

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.889 
of ammo so I'll pick up this guy's kit
and<00:00:35.030> another<00:00:36.030> guy<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> other<00:00:36.390> team<00:00:36.750> has

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and another guy on the other team has

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.510 
and another guy on the other team has
rigged<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:37.739> good<00:00:37.860> position<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
rigged at a really good position on the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.100 
rigged at a really good position on the
tank<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.879> see<00:00:39.180> me<00:00:39.329> constantly<00:00:39.870> running

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
tank as you see me constantly running

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.240 
tank as you see me constantly running
from<00:00:40.379> him<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.829> point

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
from him at this point

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.790 
from him at this point
and<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.750> switch<00:00:43.050> kit<00:00:43.320> because<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.620> only

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
and so I switch kit because it's only

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.590 
and so I switch kit because it's only
kid<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.010> had<00:00:44.160> access<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:45.239> she's<00:00:45.420> seen<00:00:45.570> I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
kid I had access to because she's seen I

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.080 
kid I had access to because she's seen I
think<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.170> got<00:00:46.469> killed<00:00:46.710> enough

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
think I just got killed enough

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.720 
think I just got killed enough
completely<00:00:48.090> washed<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.510> ammo<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.430> kind<00:00:50.640> of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
completely washed of ammo and it kind of

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.939 
completely washed of ammo and it kind of
uh<00:00:50.809> turns<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.989> bad<00:00:52.140> thing<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.649> I'm<00:00:52.710> trying<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
uh turns to a bad thing so I'm trying to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.590 
uh turns to a bad thing so I'm trying to
find<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.280> tank<00:00:53.460> right<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.090> we'll<00:00:54.390> put<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
find the tank right here so we'll put a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.630 
find the tank right here so we'll put a
mortar<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.140> him<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.829> try<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> pull<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> tank

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
mortar on him to try to pull the tank

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.220 
mortar on him to try to pull the tank
out<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.789> position<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.449> maybe<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.020> sneak

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
out of position so maybe we can sneak

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.080 
out of position so maybe we can sneak
through<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.620> long<00:00:58.920> opening<00:00:59.550> trench<00:00:59.910> right

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
through this long opening trench right

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.500 
through this long opening trench right

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
problem on this map is beat is the B

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.720 
problem on this map is beat is the B
bomb<00:04:15.030> site<00:04:15.650> that<00:04:16.650> battlefield<00:04:17.100> rush<00:04:17.520> is

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
bomb site that battlefield rush is

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.940 
bomb site that battlefield rush is
basically<00:04:18.330> a<00:04:18.420> huge<00:04:18.690> game<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.080> demolition<00:04:19.350> 12<00:04:19.830> E

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
basically a huge game of demolition 12 E

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.670 
basically a huge game of demolition 12 E
12<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.520> the<00:04:21.150> way<00:04:21.270> the<00:04:21.480> squad<00:04:21.780> spawns<00:04:22.290> are<00:04:22.500> set

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
12 and the way the squad spawns are set

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.440 
12 and the way the squad spawns are set
up<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.040> makes<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.460> feel<00:04:23.580> even<00:04:23.760> bigger<00:04:24.030> than<00:04:24.270> 12

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
up it makes it feel even bigger than 12

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.680 
up it makes it feel even bigger than 12
Ito<00:04:24.690> makes<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:24.990> feel<00:04:25.080> like<00:04:25.200> 32<00:04:25.830> versus<00:04:26.220> 32<00:04:26.630> in<00:04:27.630> a

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
Ito makes it feel like 32 versus 32 in a

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.630 
Ito makes it feel like 32 versus 32 in a
full<00:04:27.930> game<00:04:28.170> so<00:04:28.860> you're<00:04:28.950> always<00:04:29.160> gonna<00:04:29.490> be

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
full game so you're always gonna be

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.460 
full game so you're always gonna be
constantly<00:04:29.910> shooting<00:04:30.330> at<00:04:30.420> somebody<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:31.080> the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
constantly shooting at somebody and the

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.680 
constantly shooting at somebody and the
only<00:04:31.740> bad<00:04:31.980> thing<00:04:32.010> about<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:33.240> way<00:04:33.360> it's<00:04:33.510> set<00:04:33.660> up

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
only bad thing about the way it's set up

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.330 
only bad thing about the way it's set up
on<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.020> spawn<00:04:34.200> system<00:04:34.500> or<00:04:34.590> consult<00:04:35.010> versus

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
on the spawn system or consult versus

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.920 
on the spawn system or consult versus
computer<00:04:35.760> is<00:04:36.380> it's<00:04:37.380> 12<00:04:37.680> B<00:04:37.830> 12<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:38.820> stuff<00:04:39.090> 32<00:04:39.480> 32

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
computer is it's 12 B 12 and stuff 32 32

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.290 
computer is it's 12 B 12 and stuff 32 32
it<00:04:40.170> feels<00:04:40.440> 32<00:04:40.860> 32<00:04:41.280> it'd<00:04:41.490> be<00:04:41.610> easier<00:04:42.060> because

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
it feels 32 32 it'd be easier because

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.330 
it feels 32 32 it'd be easier because
that<00:04:43.260> guy<00:04:43.440> that<00:04:43.650> spawning<00:04:43.980> back<00:04:44.100> on<00:04:44.220> his

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
that guy that spawning back on his

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.430 
that guy that spawning back on his
teammate<00:04:44.870> wouldn't<00:04:45.870> know<00:04:45.960> where<00:04:46.170> you<00:04:46.260> are

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
teammate wouldn't know where you are

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.160 
teammate wouldn't know where you are
exactly<00:04:46.800> because<00:04:47.630> because<00:04:48.630> he<00:04:48.750> got<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.900> kill

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
exactly because because he got a kill

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.580 
exactly because because he got a kill
cam<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:49.590> know<00:04:49.620> five<00:04:49.950> seconds<00:04:50.340> earlier<00:04:50.610> I

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
cam you know five seconds earlier I

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.810 
cam you know five seconds earlier I
might<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:52.680> Brady's<00:04:52.950> game<00:04:53.100> up<00:04:53.220> into<00:04:53.430> two<00:04:53.580> parts

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
might to Brady's game up into two parts

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.000 
might to Brady's game up into two parts
but<00:04:54.210> um<00:04:54.420> we're<00:04:55.140> just<00:04:55.170> getting<00:04:55.440> this<00:04:55.530> first

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
but um we're just getting this first

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.980 
but um we're just getting this first
part<00:04:56.220> basically<00:04:56.430> just<00:04:56.760> setting<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.180> up<00:04:57.420> you

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
part basically just setting it up you

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
left corner now we're back stuck at our

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.460 
left corner now we're back stuck at our
base<00:05:01.260> and<00:05:02.420> at<00:05:03.420> this<00:05:03.570> point<00:05:03.870> we're<00:05:04.020> -<00:05:04.170> we're

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.310 
base and at this point we're - we're
basically<00:05:04.710> trying<00:05:04.980> to<00:05:05.130> get<00:05:06.030> there<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:06.600> get

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
basically trying to get there and get

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.990 
basically trying to get there and get
get<00:05:07.620> set<00:05:07.830> up<00:05:07.980> position<00:05:08.160> and<00:05:08.610> you'll<00:05:08.790> see<00:05:08.970> a

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
get set up position and you'll see a

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000 
get set up position and you'll see a
struggle<00:05:09.540> a<00:05:09.600> couple<00:05:09.990> times<00:05:10.170> by<00:05:10.470> not<00:05:10.740> being

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
struggle a couple times by not being

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.710 
struggle a couple times by not being
able<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.220> move<00:05:11.400> period<00:05:11.910> just<00:05:12.090> constantly<00:05:12.630> just

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
able to move period just constantly just

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.140 
able to move period just constantly just
staying<00:05:13.110> alive<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.890> having<00:05:14.400> gunfights

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
staying alive and having gunfights

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.840 
staying alive and having gunfights
I<00:05:16.130> remember<00:05:17.130> at<00:05:17.250> this<00:05:17.340> point<00:05:17.430> in<00:05:17.670> the<00:05:17.730> game

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
I remember at this point in the game

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.910 
I remember at this point in the game
myself<00:05:18.060> we<00:05:18.450> were<00:05:18.570> basically<00:05:19.320> like<00:05:19.470> come<00:05:19.650> on<00:05:19.770> we

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
myself we were basically like come on we

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.710 
myself we were basically like come on we
just<00:05:19.980> can't<00:05:20.340> let<00:05:20.520> them<00:05:20.700> take<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:21.030> tank<00:05:21.270> so<00:05:21.540> we

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
just can't let them take the tank so we

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.850 
just can't let them take the tank so we
got<00:05:21.840> to<00:05:21.960> have<00:05:22.080> to<00:05:22.140> take<00:05:22.290> advantage<00:05:22.440> of<00:05:22.740> the

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
got to have to take advantage of the

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.070 
got to have to take advantage of the
tank<00:05:23.100> and<00:05:23.490> I<00:05:24.030> look<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.330> see<00:05:24.510> how<00:05:24.660> bad<00:05:24.870> we're

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
tank and I look and see how bad we're

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.670 
tank and I look and see how bad we're
outnumbered

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
outnumbered

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.260 
outnumbered
I<00:05:25.830> don't<00:05:26.250> even<00:05:26.310> count<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.700> random<00:05:27.030> on<00:05:27.150> our

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
I don't even count the random on our

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.910 
I don't even count the random on our
team<00:05:27.420> because<00:05:27.690> he<00:05:27.810> does<00:05:27.990> pretty<00:05:28.230> much<00:05:28.380> nothing

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
team because he does pretty much nothing

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.900 
team because he does pretty much nothing
but<00:05:29.070> give<00:05:29.250> them<00:05:29.430> free<00:05:29.700> kills<00:05:31.550> there<00:05:32.550> we<00:05:32.670> go

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.040 

see<00:05:35.910> I'm<00:05:36.060> hurt<00:05:36.270> now<00:05:36.450> something's<00:05:36.780> gonna<00:05:36.900> be

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
see I'm hurt now something's gonna be

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.379 
see I'm hurt now something's gonna be
backing<00:05:37.380> off

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.600 

all<00:05:41.990> right<00:05:42.259> it's<00:05:42.740> pretty<00:05:42.949> it's<00:05:43.189> good<00:05:43.370> to<00:05:43.490> have

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
all right it's pretty it's good to have

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.029 
all right it's pretty it's good to have
a<00:05:43.669> mixture<00:05:44.270> as<00:05:44.449> well<00:05:44.509> the<00:05:45.349> one<00:05:45.469> thing<00:05:45.650> I<00:05:45.830> do<00:05:45.889> I

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
a mixture as well the one thing I do I

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:51.360 
a mixture as well the one thing I do I
do<00:05:46.280> not<00:05:46.430> I<00:05:46.879> do<00:05:47.120> fine<00:05:47.539> kind<00:05:47.780> of<00:05:47.870> odd<00:05:48.020> with<00:05:49.009> the

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.740 

basically<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.550> recon<00:05:52.909> kitten<00:05:53.210> Vietnam<00:05:53.569> is

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
basically the recon kitten Vietnam is

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.719 
basically the recon kitten Vietnam is
there's<00:05:53.990> no<00:05:54.110> some<00:05:54.349> no<00:05:54.710> motion<00:05:55.129> sensor<00:05:55.520> thing

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
there's no some no motion sensor thing

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.050 
there's no some no motion sensor thing
obviously<00:05:56.389> because<00:05:56.930> Vietnam<00:05:57.439> but<00:05:57.710> it<00:05:58.520> kind<00:05:59.000> of

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
obviously because Vietnam but it kind of

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.399 
obviously because Vietnam but it kind of
hurts<00:05:59.270> the<00:05:59.389> recon<00:05:59.719> getting<00:05:59.990> the<00:06:00.080> expert

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
hurts the recon getting the expert

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:02.439 
hurts the recon getting the expert
aspect<00:06:01.009> of<00:06:01.159> usefulness<00:06:01.580> other<00:06:02.000> than<00:06:02.270> like<00:06:02.389> a

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
aspect of usefulness other than like a

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.570 
aspect of usefulness other than like a
they<00:06:03.110> have<00:06:03.229> the<00:06:03.319> super<00:06:03.710> strong<00:06:03.979> right<00:06:04.250> sniper

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
they have the super strong right sniper

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.149 
they have the super strong right sniper
rifle<00:06:05.000> them<00:06:05.120> forty<00:06:05.569> which<00:06:05.750> is<00:06:05.949> basically<00:06:06.949> the

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
rifle them forty which is basically the

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.390 
rifle them forty which is basically the
paradigm<00:06:07.520> 95<00:06:07.969> with<00:06:08.270> like<00:06:08.419> the<00:06:08.569> m24<00:06:09.289> bolt<00:06:09.889> you

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
paradigm 95 with like the m24 bolt you

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.740 
paradigm 95 with like the m24 bolt you
know<00:06:10.520> the<00:06:10.689> m24<00:06:11.689> cycling<00:06:13.120> but<00:06:14.120> other<00:06:14.300> than<00:06:14.509> that

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
know the m24 cycling but other than that

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.719 
know the m24 cycling but other than that
the<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.319> recon<00:06:15.650> kit<00:06:15.860> isn't<00:06:16.159> too<00:06:16.250> useful<00:06:16.279> at

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
the the recon kit isn't too useful at

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.950 
the the recon kit isn't too useful at
all<00:06:16.909> on<00:06:17.330> the<00:06:18.159> on<00:06:19.159> Vietnam<00:06:19.729> it's<00:06:20.599> just<00:06:20.779> my

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
all on the on Vietnam it's just my

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.909 
all on the on Vietnam it's just my
opinion<00:06:21.080> I<00:06:21.650> mean<00:06:22.279> yeah<00:06:23.029> it<00:06:23.090> has<00:06:23.300> TNT<00:06:23.840> and<00:06:24.680> yet

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
opinion I mean yeah it has TNT and yet

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.029 
opinion I mean yeah it has TNT and yet
has<00:06:25.159> mortars<00:06:25.779> but<00:06:26.779> how<00:06:27.590> often<00:06:27.860> do<00:06:27.949> you

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 
has mortars but how often do you

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.839 
has mortars but how often do you
actually<00:06:28.159> going<00:06:28.430> to<00:06:28.520> use<00:06:28.789> TNT<00:06:30.610> can't<00:06:31.610> fill<00:06:31.819> it

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849 
actually going to use TNT can't fill it

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:33.189 
actually going to use TNT can't fill it
very<00:06:32.150> far<00:06:32.389> it's<00:06:32.629> only<00:06:32.719> really<00:06:32.930> good<00:06:33.139> for

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 
very far it's only really good for

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:35.290 
very far it's only really good for
vehicles<00:06:33.830> or<00:06:34.129> tanks<00:06:34.550> that<00:06:34.639> are<00:06:34.729> sitting<00:06:34.909> still
