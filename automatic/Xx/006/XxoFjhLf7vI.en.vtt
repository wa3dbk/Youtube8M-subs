constantly resetting and then you just

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.069 
constantly resetting and then you just
put<00:01:29.610> everything<00:01:29.970> back<00:01:30.360> together<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.930> way<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
know slip that on correctly it's hard to

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.960 
know slip that on correctly it's hard to
do<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.369> right<00:01:38.549> hand<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.060> candid

do with my right hand and what candid
like<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.240> then<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.530> screw<00:01:43.799> everything<00:01:44.040> in

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
like that then you screw everything in

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.240 
like that then you screw everything in
pop<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.390> case<00:01:45.600> back<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.079> pop<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.860> back<00:01:47.070> on

pop the case back on pop this back on

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.069 
pop the case back on pop this back on
and<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:48.390> should<00:01:48.869> work<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:50.700> that's<00:01:51.600> how<00:01:52.020> you
