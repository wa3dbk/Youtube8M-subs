00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.190
 connect with this shirt 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.640
 we go part because what interests us 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.250
 is this captor to fix the box 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.340
 that little ones could do the idea of ​​how 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.920
 is the capturing is more and almost almost that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.920
 that I can take the whole box with with 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.270

 very very fast sale I will have more 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.710
 information in the description but it's 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.989
 a capturing that by its own name 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.489
 as its own name indicates but the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.379
 activate now that you can take 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.159
 either side you can record without 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.699
 need to have fish you can record to 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:03.330
 720p 60 frames per second without the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.560
 need of pc introducing the one 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.500
 sd card here is how to how 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.750
 record if with connected to the computer that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.049
 you can record in 1080p but as I say 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.760
 without a computer you can record 720p up 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.159
 that in a little bit take out a new 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.939
 update that allows 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.690
 the use of this captor without recording if 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.300
 without pc 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.090
 at 1080 less good let's proceed to 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:37.690
 do the boxing here is the capturing 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.260
 It's super super tiny as you can 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.940
 check is dwarf practically seems 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.860
 It seems the size of a mobile phone 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.590
 this button here is a button that serves 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.590
 directly to start recording 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.960
 of the capture and well I do not know if you can 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.200
 check it here below to see how 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.460
 it's down there put 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.939
 the name of my name my gamertag and 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:13.230
 this my nickname that I used on youtube 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:14.840
 there he puts it down below there yes no 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.920
 good 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.770
 The grabber is very simple to use 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:26.290
 we have like here has 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:29.160
 the mini usb is worth this is a mini usb that 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.190
 just connect usb mini usb to the console 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.350
 hd mini hdmi outs and it feeds the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.480
 console by this cable here that you 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.190
 connects by the usb feeds the 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.080
 capturing what does this mean that 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.640
 You can take this captor to 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.580
 any competition to a friend's house 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.340
 to whoever wants directly with 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.600
 the usb cable and with both hdmi and ya 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.360
 you know the same mechanism as another 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.180
 capturing the console to the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.050
 capturing and capturing 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.320
 to the television to play 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.100
 and something that is quite comfortable enough 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.370
 the fact that I can record 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.660
 without having the need to use a pc 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.920
 here we see it as it puts pc mode or modes 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.260
 let's start or sd card that you have here in 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.960
 on the side has the introduction here 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.510
 of the sd card so we can 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:30.070
 will record and all our our 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.830
 catch as I say catch in 60 to 60 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.460
 fps and camera brings us this with this 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.900
 it seems the presentation of a rope 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.510
 when when you are telling a Boxing 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.480
 transports and seems seems a bit 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.170
 let's see this as it comes with 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.769
 with three months I think from here split 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.769
 it's worth a code 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.840
 it comes three months 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.920
 to be able to do streaming as 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.120
 I say that if you connect it to the computer 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.790
 can obviously you can do streaming and 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.360
 let's take out what comes here 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.360
 inside see 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.800
 What is inside of us? 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.010
 beauty is inside that says 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.010
 much 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.980
 the case we are going to take 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.980
 the cables 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:37.290
 here we are spending a little bit worth this 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:40.860
 it seemed to me one of those are the little ones 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:44.669
 things that make you a product 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.139

 is a cover a cover to introduce 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.979

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.979
 is set 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.400
 we have the capture case that I eat 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.530
 we see the capturer 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.530
 perfectly with your zipper 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.550
 ok and this you can take it 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.050
 practically wherever you want because no 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.790
 occupies does not occupy space is very light the 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.270
 capturing and as I say also touch 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.340
 of 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.430
 of the cover for the truth is that it is 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:29.120

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.960
 thank you very much 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.700
 and the cover and then what else do we have then? 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.620
 we have 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.620
 the typical hdmi cable 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.110
 hdmi cable and pretty short so that 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.540
 they want it longer it's just from 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.320
 the console to the capturing I'm going to 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.840
 open is going to stay here then we have 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.969
 what i said before the usb mini usb 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:01.649
 to give current to the capturing 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:04.499
 and here we have this is for the audio 

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:06.110
 this cable for audio 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:10.490
 here we have 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:13.849
 this I guess it will be for to play 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.560
 and this is the component cable already 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:17.720
 you know what to do because he has those 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.849
 copyright issues because of the issue of 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.480
 blu-ray play shows because you have to 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:25.350
 Record 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.180
 with components good guys is about 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.030
 all for this one boxing of this 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:33.990
 capturing and I will do an image test 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.220
 when I have fretted I think it comes 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.430
 You have to come here here 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.370
 effectively 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:45.110
 the page to download the software 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:47.210
 well they do not spend was disc and so they force you 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.670
 that every time you download the 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:53.030
 software so you have to download the 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.520
 software that is more modern 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.010
 here the box comes the instructions 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.270
 but a little more to explain from this 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.940
 capturing I want the operation 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.400
 it's very simple and 60 fps can a 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.860
 quality they offered all 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.720
 capturing that is the same quality 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:14.990
 of image in this tiny size 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:18.580
 It's worth as I say the two hdmi 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:21.249
 the current input of the sd input 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.129
 and good 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:26.579
 the expectations are good and I think that 

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:29.139
 will give very good result of this 

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:30.669
 capturing I said yes at ease in the 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:32.769

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:44.849
 will be for sale what it will cost 

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:48.249
