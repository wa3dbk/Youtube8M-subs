functioning in the present you need to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.280 
functioning in the present you need to

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
understand their personal history

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.350 
understand their personal history
because<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> brain<00:01:38.369> more<00:01:38.640> than<00:01:38.790> anything<00:01:39.030> is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
because the brain more than anything is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
because the brain more than anything is
an<00:01:39.810> historical<00:01:40.470> organ<00:01:40.890> its<00:01:41.189> stores

an historical organ its stores

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.300 
an historical organ its stores
experiences<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.140> understand<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
experiences so if you understand the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.819 
experiences so if you understand the
