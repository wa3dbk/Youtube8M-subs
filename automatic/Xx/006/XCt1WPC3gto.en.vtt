00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
about Lake how the flows bindings work

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.900 
about Lake how the flows bindings work
and<00:00:12.030> about<00:00:12.960> how<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.950> Burton<00:00:14.490> custom<00:00:14.639> has

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
treated me so the flow bindings

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.090 
treated me so the flow bindings
basically<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.940> start<00:00:18.180> out<00:00:18.270> like<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:19.100> unlock

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
basically you start out like this unlock

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.359 
basically you start out like this unlock
the<00:00:20.279> back<00:00:20.720> flip<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.869> down<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.920> slide<00:00:23.189> your

flip<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.019> back<00:00:25.199> up<00:00:25.430> lock<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.580> down<00:00:27.109> pretty

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
flip it back up lock it down pretty

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.109 
flip it back up lock it down pretty
sturdy<00:00:28.349> you're<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:28.680> going<00:00:28.920> anywhere<00:00:29.119> then

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
sturdy you're not going anywhere then

sturdy you're not going anywhere then
there's<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> little<00:00:30.570> ratcheting<00:00:30.990> technology

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
there's a little ratcheting technology

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.840 
there's a little ratcheting technology
it<00:00:31.769> has<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.510> could<00:00:33.809> click<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.230> up<00:00:34.380> and

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
it has so you could click it up and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.840 
it has so you could click it up and
loosen<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:35.969> hold<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.480> down<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.930> lift

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
loosen it you hold it down and you lift

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.250 
loosen it you hold it down and you lift
and<00:00:38.850> when<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.270> want<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> back<00:00:39.840> down<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.170> just

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and when you want to back down you just

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.900 
and when you want to back down you just
Ratchet<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:40.980> locks<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.460> place<00:00:41.670> like

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
Ratchet it and then locks in place like

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.150 
Ratchet it and then locks in place like
that<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.110> keep<00:00:43.290> my<00:00:43.350> ratchet

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
that like if I keep my ratchet

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.200 
that like if I keep my ratchet
it'll<00:00:44.760> lock<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.180> place<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.230> anywhere

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
it'll lock in place not going anywhere

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.270 
it'll lock in place not going anywhere

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
back then it has these flow bindings

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.270 
back then it has these flow bindings
have<00:01:47.100> custom<00:01:47.930> or<00:01:48.930> not<00:01:49.259> custom<00:01:49.619> they<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.890> flow

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you can lock it down into their channel

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.679 
you can lock it down into their channel
technology<00:01:59.460> otherwise<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.360> wouldn't<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.600> able

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it is a great train board it's about
