00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.140
 house this short violence how to withdraw 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.620
 the back cover of microsoft blooming 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.059
 Lumia 640 gelete and how to install your 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.370
 battery correctly the procedure 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.080
 it's very easy and very simple but for 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.210
 those who are new to this topic the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.910
 how smartphone may be afraid 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.550
 in going to the back cover of those covers 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.289
 back are very resistant this lid 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.810
 it's a pasta as you can hear 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.210
 on this side here has the space of the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.829
 battery then to remove this lid 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.320
 this stage what you have to do is 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.360
 pass a little bit in the corners of 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.570
 soon make a little pressure with the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.360
 finger not like that 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.550
 remove a corner or a little bit later 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.710
 remove the other corner a little bit what 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.360
 listen to the two clicks we use 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.850
 our hand put our fingers here 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.309
 up and we're going to put pressure on the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.470
 center completely neither here next 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.330
 right but on the left side since 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.010
 having done there is a gap in this 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.739
 moment since the battery is not on 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.900
 there we are going to do it here in this way 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.420
 we press back and so on 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.490
 The battery is easily removed as 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.080
 I said there was a gap so I did not 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.610
 we would be putting pressure on nothing to 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.630
 change if we put pressure to the side 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.330
 left 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.490
 we would be leaning on something like that is 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.830
 easy and simple removes the lid 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.690
 back and the battery is going to put on the 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.700
 next way 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.010
 we will consider contacts 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.740
 that are below those contacts of 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.290
 come with the battery contacts is 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.080
 say that the battery should be put like this 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.410
 not so but with the contacts towards 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.020
 phone in this way we slide the 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.400
 battery and then make a small 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.460
 pressure and our battery is already on 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.110
 we put the lid again is the best 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.620
 is with the beginning on the side where 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.800
 there are the buttons 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.560
 we put the part the buttons first 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.660
 in this way and then we are doing 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.520
 a little pressure around the whole 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.010
 phone and the phone is ready 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.020
