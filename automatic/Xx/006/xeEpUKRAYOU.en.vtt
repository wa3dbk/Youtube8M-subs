the whole syndicate ticket that you can

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.870 
the whole syndicate ticket that you can
actually<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:13.280> well<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.310> took<00:01:14.400> over<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
actually get well I took over the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.160 
actually get well I took over the
complex<00:01:15.180> both<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.750> always<00:01:15.900> been

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
complex both have always been

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.020 
complex both have always been
historically<00:01:16.650> been<00:01:16.799> used<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.970> think

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
historically been used here and I think

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.310 
historically been used here and I think
when<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.330> coming<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.689> start<00:01:18.900> being<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.140> big

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
when the coming and start being a big

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.039 
when the coming and start being a big
loss<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> rules<00:01:21.600> which<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:21.990> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
loss and for the rules which one this is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.280 
loss and for the rules which one this is
over<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:23.040> complex<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.640> used<00:01:23.850> by<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.720> years

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
over the complex is used by for years

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.590 
over the complex is used by for years
there's<00:01:25.890> divers<00:01:26.340> use<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.729> likes<00:01:26.909> this

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
there's divers use the likes this

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.330 
there's divers use the likes this

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.149 
sighting on a Windsor from the other
light<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.720> not<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.930> problem<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
