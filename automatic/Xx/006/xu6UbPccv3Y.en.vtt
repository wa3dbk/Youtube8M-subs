the<00:00:47.640> acoustic<00:00:48.090> guitar<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.750> Survival

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the acoustic guitar but in Survival

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.610 
the acoustic guitar but in Survival
Guide<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.800> use<00:00:50.390> seven<00:00:51.390> sections<00:00:51.660> or<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.260> is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
Guide I use seven sections or so is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.580 
Guide I use seven sections or so is
about<00:00:53.309> four<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:54.030> acoustic<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.899> three<00:00:55.379> with

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
about four with acoustic and three with

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.770 
about four with acoustic and three with
electric<00:00:56.210> but<00:00:57.210> let's<00:00:57.420> try<00:00:57.600> it

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
electric but let's try it

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.639 
electric but let's try it
so<00:00:57.930> there<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:59.550> chord<00:00:59.789> progression<00:01:00.239> is

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
so there the chord progression is

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.090 
so there the chord progression is
obviously<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> pop<00:01:02.489> song<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.149> very<00:01:03.270> easy<00:01:03.750> so

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
I said in the course the F major seventh

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.550 
I said in the course the F major seventh
could<00:04:00.120> be<00:04:01.010> see<00:04:02.010> like<00:04:02.400> seen<00:04:02.940> like<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.900> minor

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
could be see like seen like a a minor

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.600 
could be see like seen like a a minor
with<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.820> bass<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:08.220> minor

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
with the bass so is a minor

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.450 
with the bass so is a minor
the<00:04:10.450> bass<00:04:10.660> player<00:04:10.960> is<00:04:11.320> going<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.800> be<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.070> evil

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
the bass player is going to be a evil

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:20.490 
the bass player is going to be a evil
half<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:13.390> expect<00:04:14.040> major<00:04:15.040> seventh<00:04:15.550> then<00:04:17.519> G<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:19.840> G

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
half so expect major seventh then G is G

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.610 
half so expect major seventh then G is G
position<00:04:20.980> of<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:22.570> then<00:04:22.810> C<00:04:23.130> position<00:04:24.130> of<00:04:24.460> E

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
position of a and then C position of E

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:34.290 
position of a and then C position of E
and<00:04:26.760> then<00:04:27.760> G

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:05:00.570 

okay<00:04:36.009> let's<00:04:37.009> record<00:04:39.879> one<00:04:40.879> two<00:04:41.330> three<00:04:41.870> four

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.500 

so<00:05:01.870> we<00:05:02.870> can't<00:05:03.140> listen<00:05:03.620> without<00:05:04.450> without<00:05:05.450> the

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
so we can't listen without without the

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:25.989 
so we can't listen without without the
click<00:05:05.870> okay

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:25.999 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:30.129 

so<00:05:26.899> you<00:05:27.169> will<00:05:27.319> need<00:05:27.499> up<00:05:27.619> a<00:05:28.129> base<00:05:28.909> on<00:05:29.269> for<00:05:30.049> the

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
so you will need up a base on for the

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.819 
so you will need up a base on for the
route<00:05:30.349> but<00:05:30.969> this<00:05:31.969> is<00:05:32.119> one<00:05:32.419> of<00:05:32.449> that<00:05:32.839> typical

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:33.829 
route but this is one of that typical

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:36.519 
route but this is one of that typical
way<00:05:34.039> to<00:05:34.069> build<00:05:34.579> I<00:05:35.059> called<00:05:35.599> that<00:05:35.809> big<00:05:36.110> guitars

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:36.529 
way to build I called that big guitars

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:41.949 
way to build I called that big guitars
in<00:05:37.309> recording<00:05:38.139> often<00:05:39.139> I<00:05:39.259> add<00:05:40.749> Telecaster<00:05:41.749> with

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:41.959 
in recording often I add Telecaster with

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:45.909 
in recording often I add Telecaster with
a<00:05:41.989> very<00:05:42.649> crunchy<00:05:43.459> a<00:05:43.789> little<00:05:44.499> so<00:05:45.499> clean<00:05:45.889> but

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
a very crunchy a little so clean but

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.489 
a very crunchy a little so clean but
with<00:05:46.309> a<00:05:46.339> little<00:05:46.519> bit<00:05:46.789> of<00:05:46.909> crunch<00:05:47.269> and<00:05:47.509> double

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:48.499
