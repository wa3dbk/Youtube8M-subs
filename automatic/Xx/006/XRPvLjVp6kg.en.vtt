00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
degrees you can kind of eyeball it or if

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.119 
degrees you can kind of eyeball it or if
you<00:01:41.569> have<00:01:41.659> a<00:01:41.689> thermometer<00:01:41.959> that's<00:01:42.349> good<00:01:42.530> so

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:43.129 
you have a thermometer that's good so

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:44.529 
you have a thermometer that's good so
you<00:01:43.189> want<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.399> get<00:01:43.489> that<00:01:43.610> preheating<00:01:44.119> first<00:01:44.360> it

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
you want to get that preheating first it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.539 
you want to get that preheating first it
takes<00:01:44.719> a<00:01:44.840> while<00:01:44.929> to<00:01:44.989> preheat<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.560> oil<00:01:45.679> one<00:01:46.429> way

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
takes a while to preheat the oil one way

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.069 
takes a while to preheat the oil one way
you<00:01:46.610> can<00:01:46.759> test<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.209> oil<00:01:47.239> is<00:01:47.509> grab<00:01:47.689> some<00:01:47.959> your

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
you can test the oil is grab some your

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.679 
you can test the oil is grab some your
flour<00:01:48.319> just<00:01:49.129> drop<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:49.459> in<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.610> pan<00:01:49.789> and<00:01:50.030> if<00:01:50.599> you

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
flour just drop it in the pan and if you

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.510 
flour just drop it in the pan and if you
see<00:01:50.929> that<00:01:51.110> it's<00:01:51.259> fizzing<00:01:51.920> up<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.219> bubbling

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
see that it's fizzing up and bubbling

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520 
see that it's fizzing up and bubbling
like<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:52.849> is<00:01:52.969> here<00:01:53.329> that<00:01:53.840> means<00:01:53.989> your<00:01:54.170> oil<00:01:54.319> is

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
like it is here that means your oil is

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.919 
like it is here that means your oil is
hot<00:01:54.890> enough<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.340> cook<00:01:55.489> on<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:56.420> could<00:01:56.659> be<00:01:56.689> too

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
hot enough to cook on it could be too

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.660 
hot enough to cook on it could be too
hot<00:01:57.170> but<00:01:57.439> it's<00:01:57.619> it's<00:01:57.859> definitely<00:01:58.009> hot<00:01:58.459> enough

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
hot but it's it's definitely hot enough

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.940 
hot but it's it's definitely hot enough
to<00:01:58.789> cook<00:01:58.939> on<00:01:59.149> if<00:01:59.329> it's<00:01:59.450> bubbling<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.770> what

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950
