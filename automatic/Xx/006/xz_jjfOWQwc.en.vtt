00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
Kabam has added a new kind of feature

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.590 
Kabam has added a new kind of feature
which<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.110> slippy<00:00:34.739> slide<00:00:35.130> II<00:00:35.160> ice<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:36.149> as

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
which is the slippy slide II ice so as

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.180 
which is the slippy slide II ice so as
you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.809> see<00:00:36.870> when<00:00:37.320> you're<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.770> dungeon

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
you can see when you're in this dungeon

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.369 
you can see when you're in this dungeon
and<00:00:38.460> from<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.910> looking<00:00:39.030> at<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.989> movement

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and from just looking at it the movement

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.319 
and from just looking at it the movement
is<00:00:40.500> quite<00:00:40.770> hard<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> get<00:00:41.280> used<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.610> because<00:00:42.120> you

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
is quite hard to get used to because you

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
is quite hard to get used to because you
will<00:00:42.510> slip<00:00:42.750> around<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.950> quite

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
will slip around so it is quite

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.350 
will slip around so it is quite
dangerous<00:00:44.280> when<00:00:44.610> you're<00:00:44.700> moving<00:00:44.940> forward<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
dangerous when you're moving forward and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.209 
dangerous when you're moving forward and
someone<00:00:45.600> pops<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:46.020> your<00:00:46.140> face<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.920> will<00:00:47.100> be

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
someone pops on your face it will be

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.920 
someone pops on your face it will be
it'll<00:00:47.460> take<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> lot<00:00:47.940> longer<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.360> move

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it'll take a lot longer to move

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.490 
it'll take a lot longer to move
backwards<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.430> very<00:00:50.719> vital<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:52.110> my

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
backwards so it is very vital on my

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.830 
backwards so it is very vital on my
Archer<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.980> I'm<00:00:53.129> able<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.600> paralyze<00:00:54.600> them

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
Archer that I'm able to paralyze them

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.060 
Archer that I'm able to paralyze them
because<00:00:55.050> when<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.710> their<00:00:55.829> face<00:00:56.039> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
because when I get up in their face and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.740 
because when I get up in their face and
it<00:00:56.370> takes<00:00:56.550> me<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> few<00:00:56.910> seconds<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> back<00:00:57.539> up

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it takes me a few seconds to back up

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.630 
it takes me a few seconds to back up
because<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> sliding<00:00:58.530> that's<00:00:59.370> good<00:00:59.550> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
because of the sliding that's good to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.709 
because of the sliding that's good to
paralyze<00:00:59.940> them<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.210> they<00:01:00.329> can't<00:01:00.510> come<00:01:00.539> after

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
paralyze them so they can't come after

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.250 
paralyze them so they can't come after
you<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.079> sit<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:02.270> so<00:01:03.270> how<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.080> the
