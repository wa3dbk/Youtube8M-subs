00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.650 
collaborative problem-solving is that
the<00:02:14.780> problem<00:02:15.260> itself<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:16.160> complex<00:02:16.819> I<00:02:17.150> couldn't

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
the problem itself is complex I couldn't

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.820 
the problem itself is complex I couldn't
help<00:02:17.810> them<00:02:18.080> because<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.410> would<00:02:18.500> defeat<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
help them because that would defeat the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.309 
help them because that would defeat the
purpose<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.459> their<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.269> exercises<00:02:20.810> to

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
purpose of their that the exercises to

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.869 
purpose of their that the exercises to
actually<00:02:21.620> get<00:02:21.799> them<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.310> think<00:02:22.760> for

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
actually get them to think for

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.089 
actually get them to think for
themselves<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.930> that's<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.560> very<00:02:24.680> good<00:02:24.799> thing

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
themselves and that's a very good thing

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.559 
themselves and that's a very good thing
because<00:02:25.160> what<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.879> means<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.299> that<00:02:26.330> they're

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
because what that means is that they're

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.410 
because what that means is that they're
given<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.930> stimulus<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.650> communicate<00:02:28.640> at<00:02:29.060> first

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
given a stimulus to communicate at first

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.789 
given a stimulus to communicate at first
it<00:02:29.690> was<00:02:29.810> hard<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.349> not<00:02:30.500> get<00:02:30.709> frustrated<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:33.440> the

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
it was hard to not get frustrated on the

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.770 
it was hard to not get frustrated on the
chat<00:02:34.069> but<00:02:34.400> it's<00:02:34.579> getting<00:02:34.880> easier<00:02:35.030> as<00:02:35.450> we<00:02:35.630> do

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
chat but it's getting easier as we do

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.670 
chat but it's getting easier as we do
more<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.019> it

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
more of it

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.350 
more of it
it<00:02:36.890> was<00:02:37.010> great<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.310> see<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.910> reaction

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
it was great to see that the reaction

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.990 
it was great to see that the reaction
went<00:02:38.510> once<00:02:38.750> they<00:02:38.900> solve<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.349> silence<00:02:39.829> I<00:02:40.040> and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
went once they solve the silence I and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.430 
went once they solve the silence I and
they<00:02:41.329> were<00:02:41.390> able<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.660> move<00:02:41.870> on<00:02:42.079> to<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.260> next

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
they were able to move on to the next

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.559 
they were able to move on to the next
task<00:02:42.650> when<00:02:43.010> we<00:02:43.160> first<00:02:43.430> started<00:02:43.849> looking<00:02:44.030> at

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
task when we first started looking at

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.690 
task when we first started looking at
the<00:02:45.200> collaborative<00:02:45.739> problem-solving<00:02:46.130> and

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
the collaborative problem-solving and

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.539 
the collaborative problem-solving and
the<00:02:46.940> IP<00:02:47.060> C<00:02:47.450> digital<00:02:47.870> literacies<00:02:48.410> what<00:02:49.220> we<00:02:49.370> did

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
the IP C digital literacies what we did

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.640 
the IP C digital literacies what we did
was<00:02:49.730> scope<00:02:50.329> out<00:02:50.569> what<00:02:50.599> a<00:02:50.810> developmental

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
was scope out what a developmental

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.979 
was scope out what a developmental
progression<00:02:52.250> might<00:02:52.640> look<00:02:52.880> like<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.510> teacher

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
progression might look like the teacher

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.350 
progression might look like the teacher
then<00:02:54.440> can<00:02:55.010> identify<00:02:55.160> what<00:02:56.120> are<00:02:56.269> the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
then can identify what are the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.330 
then can identify what are the
strategies<00:02:56.690> what<00:02:57.260> are<00:02:57.379> the<00:02:57.440> resources<00:02:57.739> that<00:02:58.160> I

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
strategies what are the resources that I

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.150 
strategies what are the resources that I
can<00:02:58.370> use<00:02:58.930> some<00:02:59.930> help<00:02:59.959> them<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.440> develop<00:03:00.829> and

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
can use some help them to develop and

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.039 
can use some help them to develop and
enhance<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.700> skills<00:03:01.819> that<00:03:02.209> they<00:03:02.329> have<00:03:02.359> the

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
enhance the skills that they have the

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.509 
enhance the skills that they have the
beauty<00:03:03.319> of<00:03:03.350> this<00:03:03.470> program<00:03:04.010> is<00:03:04.220> they<00:03:04.370> actually

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
beauty of this program is they actually

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.550 
beauty of this program is they actually
have<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:04.910> rely<00:03:05.150> on<00:03:05.180> each<00:03:05.420> other<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.930> really

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
have to rely on each other and really

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.080 
have to rely on each other and really
communicate<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.280> collaborate<00:03:07.400> with<00:03:07.880> each

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
communicate and collaborate with each

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.479 
communicate and collaborate with each
other<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.450> solve<00:03:08.660> tasks<00:03:09.319> our<00:03:09.620> students<00:03:10.250> need

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
other to solve tasks our students need

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.610 
other to solve tasks our students need
to<00:03:10.639> be<00:03:10.790> able<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:11.090> collaborate<00:03:11.420> they<00:03:12.319> need<00:03:12.530> to

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
to be able to collaborate they need to

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.920 
to be able to collaborate they need to
go<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.769> solve<00:03:13.100> problems<00:03:13.609> they<00:03:14.510> need<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.810> be

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
go to solve problems they need to be

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.240 
go to solve problems they need to be
able<00:03:15.019> to<00:03:15.170> work<00:03:15.440> with<00:03:15.739> each<00:03:15.859> other

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
able to work with each other

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.190 
able to work with each other
across<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.000> globe<00:03:17.239> they<00:03:17.720> need<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:17.959> be<00:03:18.049> able<00:03:18.109> to

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
across the globe they need to be able to

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.900 
across the globe they need to be able to
communicate<00:03:18.889> and<00:03:19.160> that's<00:03:19.549> where<00:03:19.790> this

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
communicate and that's where this

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.690 
communicate and that's where this
project<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.450> taking<00:03:20.630> us<00:03:20.930> it's<00:03:21.709> taking<00:03:22.160> us<00:03:22.280> into

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
project is taking us it's taking us into

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.910 
project is taking us it's taking us into
the<00:03:22.940> classrooms<00:03:23.540> with<00:03:24.139> a<00:03:24.170> new<00:03:24.470> generation

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
the classrooms with a new generation

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.430 
the classrooms with a new generation
it's<00:03:25.220> good
