00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.230
 hello guys welcome to prepare the 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:08.830
 puntocom selectivity we go with a new 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.440
 biology video and this time I'm going 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.009
 to tell you about the cellular organization 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.900
 the different types of organization 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.670
 cell phone agreement 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.990
 we will talk about some small 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.750
 characteristics of the cells 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.449
 eukaryotes and prokaryotic cells 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.009
 although in later videos 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.109
 we will develop this theme as much as 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.449
 one cell like another with more pro forma 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.329
 already deep well then in 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.719
 how about water types before talking 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.410
 of the types of cellular organization 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.989
 let's see what are the 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.129
 common characteristics that have all 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.710
 the cells what are the elements 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.859
 common of all of them well well there are 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.840
 as I say some essential components 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.550
 that are going to be common for all 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.190
 the cell and that are on the one hand the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.489
 plasma membrane which is the membrane 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.379
 surface that will separate the medium 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.140
 internal cell medium that 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.360
 surrounds and that also in the place where 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.830
 produces control the exchange of 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.020
 substances with 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.970
 this would be what is the way of the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.390
 plasma after the cytoplasm would be 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.820
 is another element common to the entire cell 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.740
 the cytoplasm is the internal medium of 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.690
 cell where where are you going to find 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.050
 the molecules and where they are going to find 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.180
 the different organs the different 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.780
 structures needed for good 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.120
 operation of that cell is worth and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.890
 among all the good ones as I say it 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.320
 find all gas all 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.000
 organelles mitochondria ribosomes 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.790
 agreement each of them specialized 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.550
 in a function and all of them needed 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.070
 for the physiology the functioning 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.430
 cellular and then we will have the material 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.100
 genetic that is to say that all the 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.500
 works are going to have a DNA that may or may not 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.050
 be contained in a core that we will see 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.810
 that there are certain types of cells that 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.120
 they have a nucleus that surrounds the DNA and 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.400
 others that do not have it 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.260
 the DNA as we already know how you have already 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.840
 seen recorded several videos on this 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.110
 DNA is the theme that somehow 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.390
 directs or is responsible for marking the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.210
 protein synthesis 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.000
 and this implies that I also determine the 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.490
 activity of that of that cell at the same 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.920
 time that is going to take care of 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.480
 transmit the genetic information of 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.680
 generation in generation 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.770
 so as I say these are the three 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.710
 the three fundamental elements and 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.290
 essentials common to every cell 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.930
 membrane cytoplasm nucleus and now in 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.880
 function of the degree of complexity that 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.740
 because it exists in the cell we are going to 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.660
 talk about two types of organization 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.210
 cellular but as you are already seeing in 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.250
 the slides the schemes that 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.840
 are putting then at the time of 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.270
 talk about cellular organization I'm going to 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.120
 let's see two types on the one hand the 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.550
 prokaryotic cell and on the other hand the 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.950
 eukaryotic cell well that is a cell 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.080
 prokaryotes the prokaryotic works as 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.770
 you already have there in image are very cells 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.140
 simple small from 0 2 to 5 microns 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.940
 they are characterized because they lack nucleus 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.220
 and the rest of membranous structures 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.260
 that yes they are going to have to yes they are going to 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.470
 have the cells and the cells 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.480
 superiors according 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.280
 What are the prokaryotic cells? 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.040
 prokaryotic cells are on the one hand the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.200
 bacteria and on the other hand are the micro 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.270
 plasmas and this is what we will move next 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.580
 we 'll see later a little more expanded 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.210
 that is, all the mycoplasma are 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.450
 the smallest known cells 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.820
 approximately between 0.1 and 0.8 microns and 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.110
 that unlike bacteria do not 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:49.200
 they have cell wall wall of agreement 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.910
 are or are the causes are the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.120
 causing the micro plasmas of a large 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.680
 number of a large number of diseases 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.520
 in both the bacteria and the micro 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.220
 plasmas can live in isolation or 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.970
 may well be associated forming colonies 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.220
 but they will never form an organism 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.080
 multicellular according as if you can 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.670
 unchain or form the cell 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.280
 eukaryotic 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.560
 are as I say are structures or are 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.950
 simple cells its structure too 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.019
 it's simple to agree and therefore 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.860
 this also facilitates or allows you 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.040
 some adaptation to the different ones to the 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.590
 different means this in terms of what 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.780
 which would be the prokaryotic cell or the 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.760
 eukaryotic cell are larger cells 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.650
 there you have the scheme in your 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.710
 screen are larger cells 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.190
 approximately between 10 and 30 microns are 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.840
 more complex than the prokaryotic cell 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.850
 they present a nucleus that differs 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.010
 that is separated from the cytoplasm by a 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.410
 double membrane that would be the membrane 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.479
 because it will be the nuclear membrane and in the 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.400
 inside the nucleus are the 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.860
 DNA molecules that are found 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.350
 associated with proteins called 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.710
 histones is valid there you have in the scheme 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.600
 of the eukaryotic cell membrane what 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.830
 what is the plasma membrane what is 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.080
 the cytoplasm and what is the 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.470
 in the cytoplasm you will find 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.260
 all organelles 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.870
 all the structures necessary for the 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.210
 operation of that activity 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.950
 cell each one of those organs is 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.780
 find specialized in a 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.070
 determined in a certain process 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.470
 the eukaryotic cells constitute all 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.650
 the organisms or is the basis of all the 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.840
 same multicellular and most of 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.170
 unicellular organisms that is to say by 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.190
 pieces of yeast and so on and so on 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.200
 agreement 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.030
 obviously it is not known how 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.390
 they formed how the first 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:53.300
 cells but the study of fossils 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.770
 has established that or allows to establish 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.620
 that the prokaryotic cell appeared 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.560
 approximately will make about 3,500 million 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.710
 of years while the eukaryotic cell 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:07.130
 would have arisen approximately a few 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.320
 1500 about 1500 million years ago another 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.840
 difference more in terms of the cell 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.220
 eukaryotic and the cell company is and already 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.370
 in that scheme that you have there now 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.350
 same on the screen you see a small one with 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.360
 one last classification of what 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.970
 would be eukaryotic cells and what 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.590
 are the cells themselves are you 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.230
 basic difference that you have there is in 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.990
 how much the cellular organization will be 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.910
 five idiots or they will be prokaryotes and the 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.640
 prokaryotic cells as you see form 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.310
 only unicellular organisms and there 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.160
 you have bacteria and micro plasmas 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.740
 not multicellular agree and as soon as 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.570
 to the eukaryotic cells these already go 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.580
 to be formed they call it to form organisms 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.120
 that can be cell phones here 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.699
 we would have 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.340
 unicellular algae fungi 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.080
 unicellular the protozoa and on the other 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.540
 the side are the cellular pluris 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.419
 where we will have algae here 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.970
 multicellular fungi plants and animals 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:06.080
 agree well then the 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:08.479
 video in box dedicated to the types of 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.820
 cellular organization of agreement I hope 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.010
 that has not ignored and as always 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.790
 thank you very much for watching the videos and 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.790
 thanks for being
