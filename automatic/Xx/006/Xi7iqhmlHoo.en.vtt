00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.700
 information on traditional titles 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.090
 so much we try to inform first to 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.649
 these 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.390
 consumers about the games of 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.579
 catalog that we believe they are 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.890

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.899

 that may have more impact on the 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.640
 market and reduce the chances of 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.380
 that others present similar products 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.479
