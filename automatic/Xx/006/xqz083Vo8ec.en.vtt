about a week away so yeah if you get all

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.320 
about a week away so yeah if you get all
four<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.710> two<00:01:57.890> gems<00:01:58.220> could<00:01:58.850> beat<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.150> game

100%<00:01:59.810> then<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.470> get<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.740> special

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
100% then you get the special

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.760 
100% then you get the special
alternative<00:02:01.880> ending<00:02:02.240> or<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.840> real<00:02:03.050> ending

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
alternative ending or the real ending

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.380 
alternative ending or the real ending
I<00:02:03.800> guess<00:02:04.310> where<00:02:05.290> brioche<00:02:06.290> shoots<00:02:06.650> is<00:02:06.920> ray<00:02:07.700> the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
I guess where brioche shoots is ray the

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.050 
I guess where brioche shoots is ray the
cortex<00:02:09.320> space<00:02:09.619> station<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.640> explodes

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
cortex space station and the explodes

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.760 
cortex space station and the explodes
and<00:02:11.270> then<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.480> crashes<00:02:11.720> into<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.140> ions<00:02:12.560> and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
and then it crashes into the ions and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.590 
and then it crashes into the ions and
releases<00:02:13.220> Luka<00:02:13.790> but<00:02:13.820> we<00:02:13.940> don't<00:02:14.090> see<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.390> yet

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
releases Luka but we don't see that yet

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.250 
releases Luka but we don't see that yet
but<00:02:15.140> yeah<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:17.060> yeah<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:17.270> get<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.570> see<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.990> and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
but yeah so yeah you get to see that and

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.170 
but yeah so yeah you get to see that and
then<00:02:18.709> after<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.280> guess<00:02:19.520> also<00:02:19.910> start

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
then after that I guess also start

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.300 
then after that I guess also start
talking<00:02:20.360> about<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.870> future<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.500> guess<00:02:22.130> they'll

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
talking about the future I guess they'll

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.650 
talking about the future I guess they'll
return<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.700> bit<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:23.000> an<00:02:23.090> update<00:02:23.209> video<00:02:23.510> because

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
return to bit of an update video because

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.240 
return to bit of an update video because
this<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.110> quite<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:25.030> roaster<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.090> suppose<00:02:27.250> would

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
this is quite a roaster I suppose would

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.590 
this is quite a roaster I suppose would
have<00:02:28.370> been<00:02:28.459> also<00:02:28.580> supposed<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.090> fight<00:02:29.270> a<00:02:29.300> bit

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
have been also supposed to fight a bit

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.620 
have been also supposed to fight a bit
like<00:02:29.810> another<00:02:30.620> level<00:02:30.830> before<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:32.450> to

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
like another level before this and to

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.110 
like another level before this and to
make<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.870> into<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.320> part<00:02:33.650> there<00:02:34.459> yeah<00:02:34.730> but<00:02:35.030> he

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
make it into this part there yeah but he

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.350 
make it into this part there yeah but he
had<00:02:35.239> this<00:02:35.480> just<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.170> safe<00:02:36.410> really<00:02:36.800> um<00:02:37.459> just<00:02:38.269> a

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
had this just that safe really um just a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.880 
had this just that safe really um just a
very<00:02:38.540> lackluster<00:02:38.989> after<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.739> game

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
very lackluster after the game

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.620 
very lackluster after the game
considering<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.489> box<00:02:40.670> model<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.120> not<00:02:41.269> bad<00:02:41.480> to

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
considering the box model is not bad to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.470 
considering the box model is not bad to
do<00:02:41.840> about<00:02:41.989> all<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.560> mean<00:02:43.209> he<00:02:44.209> should<00:02:44.390> have

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
do about all I mean he should have

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.970 
do about all I mean he should have
thought<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:44.930> something<00:02:45.380> better<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:45.950> I

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
thought of something better but I

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.220 
thought of something better but I
suppose<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.790> would<00:02:46.910> make<00:02:46.940> sense<00:02:47.300> report<00:02:47.870> X<00:02:48.080> to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
suppose it would make sense report X to

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.970 
suppose it would make sense report X to
be<00:02:48.290> trying<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.590> escape<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:51.500> hardest<00:02:51.830> he

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
be trying to escape and the hardest he

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.890 
be trying to escape and the hardest he
ever<00:02:52.280> became<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:53.030> probably<00:02:53.360> Crash<00:02:53.720> Bandicoot

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
ever became is probably Crash Bandicoot

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.320 
ever became is probably Crash Bandicoot
3<00:02:54.260> even<00:02:54.800> though<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.190> was<00:02:55.459> really<00:02:55.670> not<00:02:55.910> hard<00:02:56.209> and

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
3 even though it was really not hard and

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.530 
3 even though it was really not hard and
then<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.510> suppose<00:02:56.930> yeah<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:58.190> Jen<00:02:58.610> even<00:02:59.209> tiny

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
then I suppose yeah and Jen even tiny

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.660 
then I suppose yeah and Jen even tiny
you'd<00:02:59.989> say<00:03:00.230> you're<00:03:00.410> harder<00:03:00.920> bosses<00:03:01.340> have<00:03:01.519> to

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
you'd say you're harder bosses have to

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.660 
you'd say you're harder bosses have to
architects<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.239> be<00:03:02.360> honest<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:03.380> yeah

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:55.899 

so<00:03:14.110> we<00:03:15.110> are<00:03:15.260> back<00:03:15.620> in<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:53.769> right<00:03:54.769> so<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.819> way

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
so we are back in the right so the way

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.699 
so we are back in the right so the way
we<00:03:56.030> do<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.510> we<00:03:56.870> go<00:03:57.019> over<00:03:57.049> here

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.110 

hope<00:04:00.709> he<00:04:00.859> doesn't<00:04:00.980> go<00:04:01.220> back<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.640> boss<00:04:01.849> but

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
hope he doesn't go back to the boss but

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.569 
hope he doesn't go back to the boss but
I<00:04:02.180> think<00:04:02.420> it<00:04:02.480> just<00:04:02.629> goes<00:04:02.750> into<00:04:03.019> the<00:04:03.459> she'll<00:04:04.459> go

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
soon enough but obviously those are

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.629 
soon enough but obviously those are
obligations<00:05:26.159> which<00:05:26.610> I<00:05:26.729> intend<00:05:27.210> to<00:05:27.300> yeah
