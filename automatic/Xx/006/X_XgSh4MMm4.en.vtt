00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.020

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.210
 cemetery forgotten by god 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.500
 we need six poles for 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.420
 elements of harmony 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.060
 we must try to bring it back to life 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:40.900
 rain bowden cabbage you are just one 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:43.329
 stupid talking horse I'll try to 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.110
 perform a resurrection spell 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:51.660
 because you don't raise my bird 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.480
 with sex what you resting in the kingdom 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.330
 listen to the darkness and obey mine 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.700
 will now rise of the earth to seem 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.700
 your flesh and get ready for war 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.500
 ops that was the wrong spell 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.500
 some other ingenious einstein idea 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.570
 i am full of spike ideas i am a 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.570
 genius 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.290
 here you spike the upper 5000 gardens 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.150
 in every oar I have in every respect 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.100
 realized that without rimbaud and the thing 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:10.209
 best to do was build a robot 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:14.650
 you're an idiot smash smash 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:19.940
 kill cool smash destroy 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.580
 kill cool smash destroy one 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.060
 cool 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.060
 that's enough 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:38.000
 there is still a nice move 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.190
 one last thing we didn't try 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.920
 spike something so terrifying that 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.810
 not even I used to do twilight 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.720
 not to offend but you're starting to 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.150
 behave like a crazy story 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.799
 herself is full of crazy spike men and 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.690
 misunderstood women who have dedicated the 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.730
 own life in the name of progress 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.860
 all this to destroy taboos that 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.750
 hinder the building of the breed 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.580
 of ponies although this may involve 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.760
 violation of fundamental laws 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.230
 of modesty and society bla bla bla 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.370
 but he never closes that fucking thing 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.079
 quick mouth we have to take it to 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.250
 lab before anyone sees us 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.250
 you are the boss 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:41.000

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.650

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.720
 is about to happen will have to stay in 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.700
 this room no one will know about this 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.530
 terrifying experiment to come 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.690
 remembered as the last great act of 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.790
 arrogance committed by a mortal 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.560
 there we find it spike is serious 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.390
 we can't say any ponies 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.050
 otherwise, simply experiment 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:04.380
 no one for any ponies 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.760
 I really don't understand why 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.720
 sure I would have understood if I had said 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.550
 nobody 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.050
 seems one of those things that one does 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.250
 just because everyone else is 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.250
 they do therefore 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.639
 what do you feel i got really tired 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:25.250
 ok we didn't even want to come here 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.610
 let's screw this whore and let's go 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.110
 well and let me breathe mine from time to time 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.110
 girl wants me to stop with the grass 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.690
 this is my favorite kind of magic 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.610
 now spy lighter 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.180
 this is an episode 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.180
 electrifying 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.229
 it may suffice to extinguish it 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.690
 hey rainbow for example 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.690
 are you OK 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.740
 I don't understand in movies when a body 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.469
 he is struck by lightning always returns 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.419
 in life he thought it was enough then it's true 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.119
 what they say makes no sense to be a 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:49.589
 dead horse 

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:49.589
 and okay goes to bury it 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.510
 you didn't even give me a gift 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:06.800

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:09.910

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.150

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.150

00:06:49.840 --> 00:07:00.160
