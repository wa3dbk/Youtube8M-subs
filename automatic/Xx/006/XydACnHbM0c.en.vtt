00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
wrasse which I actually got less than a

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.700 
wrasse which I actually got less than a
week<00:00:21.630> ago<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.170> actually<00:00:22.470> doing<00:00:22.680> very

well<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.849> my<00:00:23.939> tank<00:00:24.180> right<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:24.540> and<00:00:24.900> I'm<00:00:25.320> this

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
well in my tank right now and I'm this

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.679 
well in my tank right now and I'm this
wrasse<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.310> actually<00:00:26.700> pretty<00:00:26.939> interesting

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
wrasse is actually pretty interesting

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.300 
wrasse is actually pretty interesting
and<00:00:28.399> so<00:00:29.399> basically<00:00:29.970> let's<00:00:30.450> start<00:00:30.689> off<00:00:31.250> okay<00:00:32.250> so

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
and so basically let's start off okay so

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.580 
and so basically let's start off okay so
this<00:00:32.669> wrasse<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.360> completely<00:00:33.960> reef<00:00:34.260> safe

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
this wrasse is completely reef safe

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.260 
this wrasse is completely reef safe
Washington<00:00:35.130> say<00:00:35.250> completely<00:00:35.700> because<00:00:36.059> there

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
Washington say completely because there

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
Washington say completely because there
is<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.750> type<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.380> coral<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.800> he<00:00:38.040> may<00:00:38.340> knit

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
is one type of coral that he may knit

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.049 
is one type of coral that he may knit
back<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:41.420> he<00:00:42.420> usually<00:00:42.960> nips<00:00:43.500> at<00:00:43.769> or<00:00:44.519> I<00:00:44.579> should

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
back and he usually nips at or I should

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.509 
back and he usually nips at or I should
say<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.660> yellow<00:00:45.839> rats<00:00:46.230> usually<00:00:46.649> usually<00:00:47.039> nips

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
say the yellow rats usually usually nips

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.970 
say the yellow rats usually usually nips
at<00:00:48.410> feather<00:00:49.410> dusters<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.780> if<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.739> have

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
at feather dusters so if you have

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.069 
at feather dusters so if you have
feather<00:00:53.339> dusters<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.910> your<00:00:54.030> tank<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.449> don't

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
feather dusters in your tank I don't

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.310 
feather dusters in your tank I don't
recommend<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.559> fish<00:00:55.769> because<00:00:56.839> they<00:00:57.839> will

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
recommend this fish because they will

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.189 
recommend this fish because they will
probably<00:00:58.559> or<00:00:59.039> April<00:00:59.519> probably<00:00:59.909> eager<00:01:00.120> or<00:01:00.870> nip

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
probably or April probably eager or nip

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.590 
probably or April probably eager or nip
at<00:01:01.379> your<00:01:02.039> feather<00:01:02.249> dusters<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.879> I'm<00:01:03.269> pretty

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
at your feather dusters and I'm pretty

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.950 
at your feather dusters and I'm pretty
sure<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.870> won't<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:05.210> yeah<00:01:06.210> these<00:01:06.690> are

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
sure it won't like that yeah these are

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.250 
sure it won't like that yeah these are
my<00:01:07.260> frogs<00:01:07.860> bond<00:01:08.190> as<00:01:09.120> though<00:01:09.330> ant<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
my frogs bond as though ant it's the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.499 
my frogs bond as though ant it's the
lights<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.590> turned<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.280> that's<00:01:11.430> why<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
lights just turned on so that's why the

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:13.810 
lights just turned on so that's why the
pops<00:01:12.930> aren't<00:01:13.259> open<00:01:13.470> yet

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
pops aren't open yet

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.880 
pops aren't open yet
it's<00:01:14.820> my<00:01:14.939> Daisy<00:01:15.149> star<00:01:15.479> polyps<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.590> anyways

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it's my Daisy star polyps but anyways

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.660 
it's my Daisy star polyps but anyways
back<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.850> fish<00:01:18.530> also<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.829> think<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.460> most

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
back to the fish also I think the most

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.370 
back to the fish also I think the most
interesting<00:01:20.850> thing<00:01:21.479> about<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.899> fish<00:01:22.170> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
interesting thing about this fish is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.300 
interesting thing about this fish is
that<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.619> about<00:01:26.719> when<00:01:27.719> it<00:01:27.869> sleeps<00:01:28.200> when<00:01:29.189> it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that it was about when it sleeps when it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.020 
that it was about when it sleeps when it
sleeps<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.509> actually<00:01:31.079> very<00:01:31.439> cool<00:01:31.799> um<00:01:32.070> this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
sleeps it's actually very cool um this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.920 
sleeps it's actually very cool um this
fish<00:01:33.740> when<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.770> sleeps<00:01:35.399> it<00:01:35.880> shoots<00:01:36.479> itself

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
fish when it sleeps it shoots itself

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.569 
fish when it sleeps it shoots itself
into<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> sand<00:01:39.289> and<00:01:40.289> it's<00:01:40.770> very<00:01:41.159> cool<00:01:41.490> I've

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
into the sand and it's very cool I've

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.100 
into the sand and it's very cool I've
actually<00:01:41.880> seen<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> once<00:01:44.329> but<00:01:45.329> he<00:01:45.570> did

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
actually seen to do it once but he did

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.260 
actually seen to do it once but he did
it<00:01:46.289> last<00:01:46.799> time<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.070> saw<00:01:47.250> him<00:01:47.340> he<00:01:47.369> did<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.789> maybe

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
it last time I saw him he did it maybe

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.510 
it last time I saw him he did it maybe
about<00:01:48.509> 10<00:01:49.320> seconds<00:01:49.770> after<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.130> lights<00:01:50.310> shut

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
about 10 seconds after the lights shut

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.560 
about 10 seconds after the lights shut
off<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.409> um<00:01:52.430> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.729> actually<00:01:54.119> very

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
off and um you know it's actually very

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.279 
off and um you know it's actually very
very<00:01:54.780> cool<00:01:56.060> I'll<00:01:57.060> try<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.509> get<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> video<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.200> it

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
very cool I'll try to get a video of it

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.230 
very cool I'll try to get a video of it
today<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.070> shoots<00:01:59.340> himself<00:01:59.549> into<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
today when it shoots himself into the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.130 
today when it shoots himself into the
sand<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.609> of<00:02:02.729> need<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.299> deep<00:02:03.810> sand

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
sand so I you kind of need a deep sand

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.859 
sand so I you kind of need a deep sand
bed<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.770> probably<00:02:05.250> need<00:02:05.369> about<00:02:05.460> 2<00:02:05.789> inches<00:02:06.179> and

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
bed you probably need about 2 inches and

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.710 
bed you probably need about 2 inches and
right<00:02:07.170> now<00:02:07.380> mine<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.039> about<00:02:08.250> an<00:02:09.060> inch<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.660> a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
right now mine is about an inch and a

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.010 
right now mine is about an inch and a
half<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:10.259> goes<00:02:10.670> under<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:12.000> not<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.780> sand

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
half it goes under it's not the sand

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.870 
half it goes under it's not the sand
doesn't<00:02:13.170> go<00:02:13.380> exactly<00:02:13.680> right<00:02:14.430> here<00:02:14.700> goes<00:02:14.850> a

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
doesn't go exactly right here goes a

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.059 
doesn't go exactly right here goes a
little<00:02:15.240> deeper<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.640> enough<00:02:17.910> sand

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
little deeper so I have enough sand

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.940 
little deeper so I have enough sand
for<00:02:20.819> this<00:02:21.239> little<00:02:21.599> guy<00:02:23.090> but<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.739> decide<00:02:25.739> to
