00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.060
 even dangerous each 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.669
 the Californian 

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:06.680
 I had digging apostates 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.680
 and then for those whom I could see it stone 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.399
 the reform is a bit poorly explained for its Canadian clients 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:14.499
 French 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.929
 popular story safa that's exaggerating that I'm going 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.509
 before his encounter with screen loading 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.319
 second face the battery 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:26.809
 we can see the telethon a firm body park in june when he comes back on 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:30.019
 the post public inquiry was a little bit about this project 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.930
 so i will try to cd you 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.030
 to read you it is small 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.700
 she 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.460
 for the 15 investigations 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.500
 otherwise things that a cord 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.250
 our reform 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.210
 we have in 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.240
 the final touch 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.079
 at first not in danger 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.630
 indeed to say that the 3G 3g card is a lot of juice 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.390
 but not support it 53 'jessy 3g not produced in these behaviors to 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.280
 risk 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.160
 the c3g europe this is term for those who have internet those who 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.190
 do not use internet disable the 3g it's completely useless market 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.280
 I knew he has three children 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.850
 in you have first place you have fashion 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.509
 for me 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.259
 so the hand for m I already had you fed up on this date of May 15 in 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.980
 places as well as networks 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.540
 for the player to fido anything 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.940
 and then when you listen to music bend the parents of 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.790
 splints of texas messages 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.500
 at the same time that you listen to your music second things so well that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 if you let cool it worked 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.030
 so if you get tired vote wafa based on the findings the intimacy of a kilo 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.170
 because from the east he is at your battery 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.380
 as rolling used by antoine paganelli has other forms 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.170
 thereafter you have at the level above frÃªche nor at the data 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.220
 dante 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.510
 what is called the data 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.380
 to protect 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.330
 who will use them the system 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.170
 then the climate function 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.609
 the calendar 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:04.939
 and then the contexts 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.069
 there is see - balmy 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.899
 On the other hand 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.469
 I'm waiting for a reaction from people saying that if we wait for our pocket 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.019
 1 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.569
 here they are 5 15 to every 5 min 9 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.889
 six dogs 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.069
 of excessively battery to nantes so 20 years ago was for two years 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.069
 to see in the information to all five pilots 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.550
 you have many ways Kanak 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.749
 Ben Laden 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:35.079
 19 39 it is vain despite this has not been simple there is a second to which 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.719
 point j 1 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.650
 it's going to end very very very well 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.009
 what goes wrong the battery 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:42.529
 will 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.030
 apart from a lot easier 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.819
 moreover we have our ten years 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.819
 I think you suggest gasoline and 4th battery palavas fumel the blood 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:53.880
 the story 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.890
 and if we even talked about this province of badakhshan because you 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.340
 have reached your Beijing phone where the inter on silence for inter and 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.390
 on the a10 barras apparently in madiba goes for a little bit more energy 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.229
 thereafter for greece a half savary 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.359
 I wanted to date but this network will not take the Caribbean Sea 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:13.409
 I think it's nice to see 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.779
 she's alerting a text message way he's mayor the alerted kids to 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:22.090
 friendly canots and well sent the first cannatella had to close alas 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:26.189
 the assets also compose it on the east it can communicate messages 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:27.329
 texts 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.929
 e more you also have taulhac 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:31.329
 like this one 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.329
 that you are afraid to 1 2 3 4 or 5 but natixis is more often on the mode 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.930
 of the woman he goes even further to go use the 1-2 dati not give way 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.089
 after that you have there are now two more passersby 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.480
 better kill the drums you have the voice is tenacious 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.319
 let's not look at the ranking of three quarters of the c3 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.469
 so it's very very low 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:55.689
 satanas one of the highest 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.949
 you too have the general level 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:01.920
 the ofsp the whole 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.429
 it's a 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:05.369
 you let her have courage 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:09.430
 to know a square a little bit more john wood had been actually 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.149
 by candice heck on the go to do with 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:13.739
 the new plu at all 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.769
 and two points to zero I think 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.129
 with the oval collection stojan 4 to 5 a year we do not doubt 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:24.330
 and then scared be barely 0 first and foremost the senses 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.210
 samb loto no TV not these pages 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.939
 so if you let go but it's with a little bit of juice 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.469
 you also have the possibility 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:37.149
 the person speaks to you after creating a teaser site of the album 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.759
 to this godfather saint-palais cyr 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.020
 she turned on 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.490
 listen to apple if you do things 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.620
 so a bit barbaric term of 20-24 board 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.449
 I remind you that fascinating in the disable 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.229
 and then you have a spa town
