African<00:03:07.420> person<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.350> they<00:03:08.500> had<00:03:08.590> met<00:03:08.860> and

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
African person that they had met and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.270 
African person that they had met and
talked<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:09.970> interacted<00:03:10.600> with<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:11.280> that's

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
talked to and interacted with and that's

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.920 
talked to and interacted with and that's
a<00:03:12.520> large<00:03:12.760> reason<00:03:13.150> why<00:03:13.270> I<00:03:13.300> brought<00:03:13.600> him<00:03:13.720> here

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
a large reason why I brought him here

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.140 
a large reason why I brought him here
and<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.830> techniques<00:03:15.550> that<00:03:15.730> they<00:03:15.850> use<00:03:15.970> for

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
and the techniques that they use for

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.000 
and the techniques that they use for
African<00:03:16.660> acrobatics<00:03:17.260> are<00:03:17.410> different<00:03:17.800> than

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
African acrobatics are different than

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.300 
African acrobatics are different than
you<00:03:18.430> would<00:03:18.580> use<00:03:18.730> for<00:03:18.970> American<00:03:19.450> or<00:03:19.570> European

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
you would use for American or European

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.800 
you would use for American or European
acrobatics<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.459> I'd<00:03:22.120> like<00:03:22.360> them<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.690> be

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
acrobatics so I'd like them to be

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.290 
acrobatics so I'd like them to be
exposed<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.320> different<00:03:23.440> styles<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.310> want<00:03:24.730> to

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
exposed to different styles I want to

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.050 
exposed to different styles I want to
take<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.989> artists<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.620> Kenya<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.220> want<00:03:27.820> them<00:03:28.030> to

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
take the artists to Kenya I want them to

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.620 
take the artists to Kenya I want them to
see<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.810> ghettos<00:03:29.170> they<00:03:29.920> say<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:31.030> America<00:03:31.480> they

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
see the ghettos they say in America they

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.590 
see the ghettos they say in America they
have<00:03:31.750> ghettos<00:03:32.200> but<00:03:33.100> that's<00:03:33.820> not<00:03:34.090> ghetto

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
have ghettos but that's not ghetto

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.190

that's<00:03:35.530> with<00:03:35.830> months<00:03:36.220> hours<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.780> they<00:03:37.989> should

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
that's with months hours so they should

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.690 
that's with months hours so they should
visit<00:03:38.739> Africa<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:40.090> see<00:03:40.840> Africa<00:03:41.350> how<00:03:42.130> we<00:03:42.190> cope

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
visit Africa and see Africa how we cope

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.530
