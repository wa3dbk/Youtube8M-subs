00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
levels in this entire game 01 my most

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:48.800 
levels in this entire game 01 my most
hated<00:00:36.120> levels<00:00:37.160> is<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.670> annoying

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.110 
I think it's just a little area to
prevent<00:00:53.280> right<00:00:53.610> now<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.150> think<00:00:55.790> yeah<00:00:56.790> it's<00:00:56.910> just

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.150 

for<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.050> first<00:02:26.230> time<00:02:26.500> which<00:02:26.710> is<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.980> first

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
for the first time which is the first

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.820
