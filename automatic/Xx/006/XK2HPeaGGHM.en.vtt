 I already had that 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.390

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.090
 Midfield played and well performance 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.950
 Was so-so I think pep guardiola 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.540
 is it probably more often on the 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.080
 let six play because on the left 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.810
 position also the senate now always 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.620
 Schalke 04 plays more often and better 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:28.260

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.600
 maybe I'll find somehow 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.810
 something really cool and here without 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:57.720

 not carius jaha loris karius card 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.470
 number 200 attack value 1 so he is 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.420
 probably the best attack player 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:32.420
