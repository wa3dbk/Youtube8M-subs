00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
yeah how he transforms yeah because the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.520 
yeah how he transforms yeah because the
exelon<00:01:29.520> turns<00:01:29.970> into<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.329> robot<00:01:30.509> also<00:01:31.049> why<00:01:31.350> don't

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
exelon turns into a robot also why don't

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.980 
exelon turns into a robot also why don't
they<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.799> beast<00:01:32.490> wars<00:01:32.970> maximal<00:01:33.600> symbol

and you go around to the back here pull

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.190 
and you go around to the back here pull
this<00:03:03.260> area<00:03:03.860> apart<00:03:06.700> then<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:07.880> just<00:03:08.150> fold<00:03:08.840> the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
this area apart then you just fold the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.470 
this area apart then you just fold the
legs<00:03:09.410> up<00:03:10.090> make<00:03:11.090> sure<00:03:11.120> they<00:03:11.420> snap<00:03:11.720> into<00:03:11.900> place

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
legs up make sure they snap into place

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.050 
legs up make sure they snap into place
so<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.600> looks<00:03:14.810> like<00:03:14.900> this<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:15.850> by<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.910> way

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
so it looks like this and by the way

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.810 
so it looks like this and by the way
this<00:03:17.239> joint<00:03:17.630> online<00:03:18.140> doesn't<00:03:19.100> stay<00:03:19.400> snapped

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
this joint online doesn't stay snapped

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.320 
this joint online doesn't stay snapped
together<00:03:20.180> very<00:03:20.660> well<00:03:21.340> breaks<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.610> comes<00:03:22.940> open

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
together very well breaks it comes open

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.350 
together very well breaks it comes open
like<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.800> anyways<00:03:24.800> fold<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.310> around<00:03:25.610> fold<00:03:26.180> it

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
like that anyways fold it around fold it

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.650 
like that anyways fold it around fold it
around<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:27.560> other<00:03:27.650> way<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.450> fold<00:03:29.450> down<00:03:29.600> the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
around the other way and fold down the

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.560 
around the other way and fold down the
feet<00:03:29.989> these<00:03:30.769> are<00:03:31.010> can't<00:03:31.250> rubbery<00:03:31.640> plastic<00:03:31.850> and

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
feet these are can't rubbery plastic and

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.860 
feet these are can't rubbery plastic and
then<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:34.459> most<00:03:34.730> she'll<00:03:34.970> former<00:03:35.420> part<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.780> this

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
then the most she'll former part of this

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.090 
then the most she'll former part of this
entire<00:03:36.260> thing<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:37.220> grab<00:03:37.489> this<00:03:38.769> fold<00:03:39.769> it<00:03:39.920> down

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
entire thing you grab this fold it down

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.280 
entire thing you grab this fold it down
and<00:03:40.910> you're<00:03:41.030> basically<00:03:41.450> done<00:03:41.750> with<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.019> robot

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
and you're basically done with the robot

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.880 
and you're basically done with the robot

like little almost smokestacks sort of

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.950 
like little almost smokestacks sort of
look<00:04:20.489> but<00:04:21.489> whatever<00:04:22.110> um<00:04:23.640> so<00:04:24.640> issues<00:04:25.240> with<00:04:25.780> this

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
look but whatever um so issues with this

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.780 
look but whatever um so issues with this
mode<00:04:26.320> is<00:04:27.480> wrists<00:04:28.480> and<00:04:28.600> fist<00:04:29.200> holes<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.790> elbows

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
mode is wrists and fist holes and elbows

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.600 
mode is wrists and fist holes and elbows
all<00:04:31.120> seem<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.990> make<00:04:32.140> it<00:04:32.350> so<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.860> arm<00:04:33.040> should<00:04:33.400> go

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
all seem to make it so the arm should go

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.920 
all seem to make it so the arm should go
like<00:04:33.850> this<00:04:34.590> but<00:04:35.590> these<00:04:36.100> fins<00:04:36.760> get<00:04:37.419> in<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.720> way

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
like this but these fins get in the way

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.650 
like this but these fins get in the way
so<00:04:38.770> you<00:04:38.830> can't<00:04:39.160> have<00:04:39.370> to<00:04:39.490> have<00:04:39.669> his<00:04:39.940> arms<00:04:40.360> to

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
so you can't have to have his arms to

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.190 
so you can't have to have his arms to
the<00:04:40.690> side<00:04:40.960> like<00:04:40.990> this<00:04:41.200> I<00:04:41.590> mean<00:04:42.550> that's<00:04:42.669> okay

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
deployment also works in his robot form

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.159 
deployment also works in his robot form
you<00:04:57.880> pull<00:04:58.330> him<00:04:58.479> out<00:04:58.950> to<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.010> side<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:01.169> rotate

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
the transformer toys as spaceships so

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.280 
the transformer toys as spaceships so
it's<00:05:39.760> nice<00:05:39.970> to<00:05:40.270> have<00:05:40.390> one<00:05:40.450> that's<00:05:40.900> designated
