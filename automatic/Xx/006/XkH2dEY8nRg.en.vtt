00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
carburetor is good yes we could possibly

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.080 
carburetor is good yes we could possibly
build<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.260> I<00:01:19.590> said<00:01:19.980> yeah<00:01:20.220> I'll<00:01:20.400> see<00:01:20.910> what<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
build one so I said yeah I'll see what I

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.530 
build one so I said yeah I'll see what I
can<00:01:21.120> do<00:01:21.740> so<00:01:22.740> there<00:01:23.220> was<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.370> little<00:01:23.640> groove<00:01:23.880> on

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
can do so there was a little groove on

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.010 
can do so there was a little groove on
this<00:01:25.290> thing<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.550> found<00:01:26.970> some<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.660> small

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
this thing and I found some really small

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.230 
this thing and I found some really small
tiny<00:01:28.260> o-rings<00:01:28.830> it's<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> groove<00:01:29.970> machine

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
tiny o-rings it's not a groove machine

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.860 
tiny o-rings it's not a groove machine
for<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.870> but<00:01:31.830> I<00:01:32.070> found<00:01:32.280> us<00:01:32.550> I<00:01:32.790> found<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.690> real

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
for that but I found us I found a real

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
for that but I found us I found a real
small<00:01:34.080> ring<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:35.610> fit<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.290> my<00:01:37.440> plan<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.680> to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
small ring that fit and so my plan is to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.100 
small ring that fit and so my plan is to
try<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:38.220> duplicate<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.030> somehow<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.420> some

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
try to duplicate this somehow and some

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.710 
try to duplicate this somehow and some
brass<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:42.080> possibly<00:01:43.080> have<00:01:43.620> a<00:01:44.540> little<00:01:45.540> tiny

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
brass and possibly have a little tiny

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.220 
brass and possibly have a little tiny
set<00:01:46.080> screw<00:01:46.400> that's<00:01:47.400> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> tighten<00:01:48.060> down

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
set screw that's going to tighten down

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.170 
set screw that's going to tighten down

and<00:02:00.990> that's<00:02:01.680> going<00:02:01.830> to<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.640> part<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.060> it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
and that's going to be this part of it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.020 
and that's going to be this part of it
here<00:02:03.480> I<00:02:03.630> went<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.650> little<00:02:05.040> bit<00:02:05.190> bigger<00:02:05.430> than

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
here I went a little bit bigger than

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.240 
here I went a little bit bigger than
what<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.690> because<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.230> didn't<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.620> didn't

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
what this is because I didn't I didn't

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
what this is because I didn't I didn't
want<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> work<00:02:08.550> with<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.729> real<00:02:09.000> thin<00:02:09.440> wall

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
want to work with that real thin wall

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.930 
want to work with that real thin wall
there<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:12.200> it's<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:13.920> 5/8<00:02:14.370> I've<00:02:14.640> got<00:02:14.819> it

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
there so it's a this is 5/8 I've got it

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.000 
there so it's a this is 5/8 I've got it
counterbored

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
counterbored

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.949 
counterbored
ten<00:02:16.670> millimeters<00:02:17.470> I've<00:02:18.470> got<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:19.810> 3/16<00:02:20.810> hole

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
ten millimeters I've got a 3/16 hole

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.570 
ten millimeters I've got a 3/16 hole
down<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.380> there<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.560> little<00:02:21.680> bit<00:02:21.830> further<00:02:22.160> and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
down in there a little bit further and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.350 
down in there a little bit further and
then<00:02:23.170> here's<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.440> actual<00:02:24.770> barbed<00:02:25.160> piece<00:02:26.150> that

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
then here's the actual barbed piece that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.290 
then here's the actual barbed piece that
I<00:02:26.450> just<00:02:26.480> finished<00:02:26.989> making<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.970> use<00:02:29.150> the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
I just finished making and I use the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.309 
I just finished making and I use the
piece<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.630> 3/8<00:02:30.080> brass<00:02:30.980> rod<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:32.090> make<00:02:32.120> this<00:02:32.540> this

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
piece of 3/8 brass rod to make this this

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.510 
piece of 3/8 brass rod to make this this
part<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.770> it<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.360> 8<00:02:35.360> millimeter<00:02:36.520> because

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
part of it is 8 millimeter because

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.610 
part of it is 8 millimeter because
that's<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.180> best<00:02:38.450> measurement<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:39.110> can<00:02:39.290> get<00:02:39.470> is

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
that's the best measurement I can get is

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.750 
that's the best measurement I can get is
that<00:02:39.770> hose<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.130> goes<00:02:40.190> on<00:02:40.430> there<00:02:40.580> is<00:02:40.610> 8

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
that hose that goes on there is 8

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.370 
that hose that goes on there is 8
millimeter<00:02:42.519> so<00:02:43.519> I've<00:02:43.730> got<00:02:43.940> I've<00:02:44.209> got<00:02:44.269> this<00:02:44.660> at

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
millimeter so I've got I've got this at

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.530 
millimeter so I've got I've got this at
8<00:02:45.560> millimeter<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.340> what<00:02:46.489> I'm<00:02:46.580> going<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.760> do<00:02:46.940> I'm

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
8 millimeter so what I'm going to do I'm

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.150 
8 millimeter so what I'm going to do I'm
going<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.780> go<00:02:47.840> over<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.110> mill<00:02:48.319> I'm<00:02:48.739> going

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
going to go over to the mill I'm going

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.580 
going to go over to the mill I'm going
to<00:02:49.220> drill<00:02:49.670> my<00:02:49.790> cross<00:02:50.090> hole<00:02:50.360> through<00:02:50.630> here<00:02:51.170> I'm

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
to drill my cross hole through here I'm

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.039 
to drill my cross hole through here I'm
going<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:51.920> use<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.640> in<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.790> mill<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.420> create<00:02:53.930> me

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
going to use it in the mill to create me

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.340 
going to use it in the mill to create me
a<00:02:54.080> flat<00:02:54.380> spot<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.980> my<00:02:55.610> goal<00:02:55.880> is<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.209> sit<00:02:57.200> this

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
a flat spot and my goal is to sit this

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.449 
a flat spot and my goal is to sit this
these<00:02:57.830> two<00:02:58.040> pieces<00:02:58.400> together<00:02:58.489> together<00:02:59.180> and

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
these two pieces together together and

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.550 
these two pieces together together and
silver<00:03:01.459> solder<00:03:01.730> them<00:03:02.239> together<00:03:02.420> that's<00:03:03.380> what

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
silver solder them together that's what

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.030 
silver solder them together that's what
I'm<00:03:03.650> going<00:03:03.799> to<00:03:03.830> try<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.760> then<00:03:05.860> once<00:03:06.860> I<00:03:06.980> get

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
I'm going to try and then once I get

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.830 
I'm going to try and then once I get
this<00:03:07.370> all<00:03:07.640> this<00:03:07.850> drill<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.150> then<00:03:08.360> stuff<00:03:08.600> done

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
this all this drill and then stuff done

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.390 
this all this drill and then stuff done
here<00:03:09.140> I'll<00:03:09.319> put<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.500> back<00:03:09.680> in<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:09.920> middle<00:03:10.250> and

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
here I'll put it back in the middle and

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.270 
here I'll put it back in the middle and
and<00:03:10.660> figure<00:03:11.660> out<00:03:11.810> where<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.260> set<00:03:12.500> screw<00:03:12.799> needs

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
and figure out where the set screw needs

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.090 
and figure out where the set screw needs
to<00:03:13.459> go<00:03:14.049> in<00:03:15.049> relation<00:03:15.560> how<00:03:15.709> it's<00:03:15.890> going<00:03:16.040> to

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
to go in relation how it's going to

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.650 
to go in relation how it's going to
position<00:03:17.090> on<00:03:17.540> here<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:19.269> that's<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.480> that's

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
position on here so that's it that's

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.229 
position on here so that's it that's
what<00:03:20.780> I'm<00:03:20.959> working<00:03:21.290> on<00:03:21.440> and<00:03:22.030> it's<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.060> little

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
what I'm working on and it's a little

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.240 
what I'm working on and it's a little
tricky<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.810> know<00:03:24.040> messing<00:03:25.040> with<00:03:25.070> these

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
tricky you know messing with these

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.009 
tricky you know messing with these
little<00:03:25.400> small<00:03:25.670> parts<00:03:26.030> like<00:03:26.239> this<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:29.019> that's

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
little small parts like this so that's

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.190 
little small parts like this so that's
it<00:03:30.290> I'm<00:03:30.470> going<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.769> keep<00:03:30.890> going<00:03:31.040> with<00:03:32.200> all

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
it I'm going to keep going with all

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.780 
it I'm going to keep going with all
right<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.410> got<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.680> pieces<00:03:34.100> ready<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.549> think

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
right I got the pieces ready I think

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.860 
right I got the pieces ready I think
that's<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.880> main<00:03:38.060> body<00:03:38.329> of<00:03:38.630> it

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.970 

that's<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.989> stem<00:03:43.200> that's<00:03:43.349> going<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.620> go<00:03:43.739> there

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
that's the stem that's going to go there

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.670 
that's the stem that's going to go there
I'm<00:03:44.220> going<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.489> see<00:03:44.760> if<00:03:44.849> I<00:03:44.940> can't<00:03:45.560> silver<00:03:46.560> that

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
I'm going to see if I can't silver that

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.080 
I'm going to see if I can't silver that
together<00:03:48.409> and<00:03:49.409> I've<00:03:49.560> got<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.709> little<00:03:50.010> 630<00:03:50.879> to

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
together and I've got a little 630 to

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.550 
together and I've got a little 630 to
set<00:03:51.360> screw<00:03:51.629> that's<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.930> smallest<00:03:52.200> sets

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
set screw that's the smallest sets

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.539 
set screw that's the smallest sets
grafter<00:03:52.980> fine

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
grafter fine

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.369 
grafter fine
I've<00:03:53.879> probably<00:03:54.090> got<00:03:54.239> some<00:03:54.510> smaller<00:03:54.780> but<00:03:55.019> I

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
I've probably got some smaller but I

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.130 
I've probably got some smaller but I
just<00:03:56.159> can't<00:03:56.370> find<00:03:56.430> any<00:03:56.790> right<00:03:57.000> now<00:03:57.030> but<00:03:57.390> it'll

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
just can't find any right now but it'll

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.369 
just can't find any right now but it'll
once<00:03:58.920> it's<00:03:59.129> on<00:03:59.370> there<00:03:59.819> it<00:04:00.720> will<00:04:00.810> sit<00:04:01.019> against

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
once it's on there it will sit against

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.420 
once it's on there it will sit against
that<00:04:01.500> housing<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:03.329> it<00:04:03.599> should<00:04:04.069> pinch<00:04:05.069> you<00:04:05.280> get

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
that housing and it should pinch you get
