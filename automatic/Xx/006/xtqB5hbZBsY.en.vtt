00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.969
 Hi how are you 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.590
 I am a rock and in this video I want to 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.570
 share you a very property 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.839
 important from youtube that are the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.839
 thumbnails 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.170
 of the videos if you see the videos that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.780
 place the people there are ones that have 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.210
 some miniatures that are these little things 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.630
 that we see here rectangular 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.489
 represent the video there are some that 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.710
 correspond to the video there are others like 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.760
 This is a personalized 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.670
 This is a personalized 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.030
 even this area and this is one and it's 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.739
 in another personalized of this property 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.870
 is currently enabled almost to 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.820
 all the users I think for all 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.000
 actually then what we have to 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.979
 to do is to log in with our 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.129
 mind that I have my account I put 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:03.839
 log in and then to this 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.839
 I go to where it says video manager 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.719
 in the upper right part have my 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.130
 videos how they look with their thumbnail 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.810
 personalized and why those colors 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.090
 because they are colors that call the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.060
 attention and that somehow if you see 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.009
 a flat video or list when 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.119
 we are watching a video we see almost 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.289
 always on the right side a panel 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.720
 side that the videos come out 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.390
 related 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.260
 the color influences the image a lot 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.650
 so if we can place a color and 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.090
 a readable typography we can attract to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.890
 the people to watch our video do 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.410
 click and play our video 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.830
 this increases our level of visits 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.860
 this is also proven in ads 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.580
 google adwords google now 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.620
 facebook then we see that what is the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.540
 influence of color in the decision of 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.160
 a person click ok then by 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.680
 that I have chosen these colors that 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.670
 they represent in a certain way what is my 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.510
 digital entity 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.490
 then you can see them inside of me 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.350
 what's been my videos then 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.270
 that's why I use it what is then here 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.340
 are all my videos how this is done 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.440
 so when I create a video 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.290
 in the editing part we are going to see this 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.450
 no ok then 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.609
 here we are enabled our 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.939
 thumbnails and here it's always going to come out 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:31.099
 something I will grab another video that is 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.020
 that does not have a thumbnail to create this 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.810
 height order 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.240
 ok if I come here are the thumbnails 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.460
 randomly launches youtube in the part 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.620
 low let's see where pineapple says 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.690
 Custom thumbnail and we click on it 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.120
 and we can select the thumbnail 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.860
 that we want less than 2 megabytes ok 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.810
 maximum size then here I have 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.510
 but they are the ones that I have placed in my 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.510
 channel and well I can place 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.569
 Lets put 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.150
 best method to earn money 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.170
 to choose 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.530
 then here if you can see how it looks 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.810
 now the miniature and then this is going to 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.160
 be the preview that they will see 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.510
 users outside of my channel ok or 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.460
 against my channel but without having 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.290
 reproduced the video then this is 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.870
 very important that to be able to use it 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.580
 to be able to attract more to 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.410
 people call more attention because 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.360
 I already have this and it goes down 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.520
 defect this I have no problem with that 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.460
 that the other option that I want 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.980
 to share is to be able to host a site 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.320
 personalized web to our channel although 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.510
 then this allows us to be able to carry 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.200
 some people to some website in 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.220
 especially how this is done we enter 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.140
 I think it was very fast 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.820
 good even when they enter the manager of 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.290
 videos in the upper right are going 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.520
 to see here on the left hand 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.130
 they are going to see 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.200
 a panel that says hector of videos 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.440
 Youtube channel configuration analysis 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.420
 ok no it will not be channel configuration 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.930
 because here in channel configuration 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.860
 let's go into advanced options and 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.810
 then I will place my website here 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.910
 associated here if they see ya I have my 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.770
 associated website when you place 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.340
 the youtube website is going to tell you 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.440
 that verify your domain this has 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.630
 what to do through the dns of your 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.860
 domain and youtube gives you all the 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.940
 information to verify 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.370
 then you give it to verify and since 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.190
 correct verification appears and what 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.070
 is the important thing about this, look here 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.460
 I have 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.800
 let's see where we are going to enter this 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.740
 that I have one enabled 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.310
 While this is not my video not 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.310
 put it 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:10.170
 I 'm going ahead a bit because 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.170
 I want it to go fast 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.270
 because it went on sale this is my 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:35.290
 link the one that comes out here in this part what 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.240
 that how do you do this good if you enter 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.240
 the annotation properties here of 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.910
 my video 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.340
 you can do it ok this is an annotation 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.960
 It is done when you make a video 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.330
 create an annotation and they can do this 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.770
 kind of things then what function 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.440
 meet this look when I get 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.870
 On top of this, I'm not going to come to a 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.610
 youtube video but to a website and 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.990
 is my associated website therefore it is 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.449
 very important that you have a place 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.370
 web associated with your channel to be your 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.199
 main capture page for you 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.349
 you can take people from that site and 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:09.090
 have a conversion of people ok 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:13.099
 so if you see here, look, I'll click 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:15.180
 and it goes directly to my main 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:18.150
 capture page 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.970
 and how do we do this we're going to 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.940
 notes as I said this is my video 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.930
 of annotation 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.930
 this is mini 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.440
 this is my 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.360
 and annotation then where are we going to 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.409
 put it place our site url 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.929
 associated web here and then 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.849
 will use various options so we weighed I 

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:48.309
 I'm an associate and we put our 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:51.429
 associated site and ready there should already 

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:53.559
 operate our video with our link 

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:55.779
 that is all for today 

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:58.269
 I really hope you find it very useful 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:00.330
 this information I invite you to 

00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:03.519
 make your custom thumbnails 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:07.839
 with bright colors with colors like 

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:09.610
 yellow or blue fuchsia red color white 

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:11.379
 with typography because this calls 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.520
 a lot of attention places photos I have 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:15.410
 here one of some photos 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.759
 You can place some pictures like the ship 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.620
 that I would earn for the interest of the case there 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:21.139
 have a face of a boy or like to the 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.289
 turn the crisis and take out a boy or 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:26.210
 things like that that gets a lot of attention 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:27.889
 then invites you to let people 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.449
 Give them click and see your video 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:30.979
 then it is an opportunity that 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.229
 can see your proposal because then 

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:34.610
 this is the video you have to share 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:37.389
 today because it seems very 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:41.120
 great and if you liked sharing it with 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:43.280
