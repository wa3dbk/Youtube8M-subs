00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.460
 hello welcome to a new video spears 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.460
 or smooth greetings 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.369
 with friends as we are on this occasion 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.480
 but for you a new inbox and it's not 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.830
 theme an English box of an ipod touch of 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.190
 fifth generation white color 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.650
 here 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:33.719
 then we will start with this new 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.239
 boxing I hope it is of your total pleasure 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:42.149
 the box is basically the same as the ipod 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.149
 previous this the plastic 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:51.059
 it starts from 32 gb and 64 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.059
 there is no 1618 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.250
 it is white 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.250
 it's super thin you see 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.290
 here come the specifications of what 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.200
 is what the box brings 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.600
 but what they contain here is a picture 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.800
 of the importer in this case that is 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.660
 blue of mexico 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.180
 it is an importer only there is no 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.300
 no store here in Mexico support 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.050
 good 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.860
 let's start it takes off here 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.860
 in this part 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.120
 be there why 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.030
 Well, well, that started a fucking 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.470
 of gadget since it's practically 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.020
 like an iphone 5 what is the difference 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.990
 that this one does not make calls does not have a 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.540
 lane that is not 3g of whoever it is 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.940
 basically the same thing has a Romanian 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.120
 has an a5 processor that is the one 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.640
 Iphone 4s 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.310
 it's much better even I feel the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.650
 technical characteristics are much 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.300
 better than an iphone 4 and 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.100
 obviously this is cheaper 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.539
 device 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.510
 and let's get it out 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.560
 already comes with movies 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:19.590
 this could as we say white 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:24.000
 and although it did not get to young 6 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:27.360
 a 5 7 6 megapixel camera me 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.030
 it seems that it is 7 in a video more or you 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.280
 specified the said technique 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.080
 then it is a camera 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.239
 which appointment of the same lenses that the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.310
 iphone 5 eye is not the same 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:43.400
 megapixels but brings the same lenses 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.400
 from the iphone 5 that's a great plus 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.370
 As I tell you, it comes, and also 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.830
 comes with the photos in panorama and is from 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.870
 Same size of the 4 point screen 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.980
 7 inches 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.980
 if we are going to open it 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.900
 A) Yes 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.210
 by saint berthevin california 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.210
 your manuals 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.700
 with the world 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.540
 It seems that he also brings stickers like that 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.879
 of 22 classic ticas 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.420
 this also I came with the goal air of 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:32.010
 connector is the new cable technology 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.970
 to charge your water devices 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.110
 as you can see there are 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.710
 does not come with a wall charger 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.080
 for wall 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.410
 but only also that of the collector 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.080
 the usb 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.300
 is reversible and so it does not matter how 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.640
 let's introduce our device to you 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.050
 it falls the same 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.020
 is a club that calls this what it is 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.680
 there is a strap so they can 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.469
 hang your 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.890
 your ipod can hang it on your wrist 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:09.370
 they danced 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.540
 well in the color of the ipad in this case 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.310
 White 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.220
 there are many colors even in it seems that 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.220
 they are always that if they come in pairs 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:23.040
 and the new spots 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.750
 These are votes that cost the same as 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.080
 a normal 450 hearing aids were 49 me 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.080
 they look like 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.260
 and it's supposed to be a better technology 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.260
 with a clearer sound even of 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.020
 some enveloping form 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.220
 and good 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.220
 let's put the box here 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.050
 but nothing more 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.990
 we are going to 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.520
 same yes no 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.410
 we have raised the ti we have to 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.410
 fly 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.100
 of fifth generation 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.950
 this little button is for the group 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.950
 is awesome 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.949
 and it comes out maybe you do not get to appreciate 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.949
 but it gets up a little 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.370
 and then here they are introduced 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.280
 is evolving 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.990
 the truth is very father 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.030
 very very cute 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.300
 but have dominion I will compare with 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.669
 magic mouse 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.870
 generates more cooperation is super 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.390
 thin 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:13.480
 It's like four times thicker magic 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.480
 mouse and is and is very thin too 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.450
 Well, I hope your maximum and that 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.610
 has been executed 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:27.750
 I'm talking a little bit because it's night 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:30.600
 I do not want to wake up the family 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.110
 we are seeing the next lucky 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.110
 bye
