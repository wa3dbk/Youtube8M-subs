but we can't say the same for the
trackpad<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.409> trackpad<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.860> actually<00:01:44.250> one<00:01:44.369> of

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
trackpad the trackpad is actually one of

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.010 
trackpad the trackpad is actually one of
the<00:01:44.490> worst<00:01:44.700> trackpads<00:01:45.210> we've<00:01:45.390> ever<00:01:45.570> seen<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the worst trackpads we've ever seen on a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.020 
the worst trackpads we've ever seen on a
netbook<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.590> date<00:01:46.770> not<00:01:47.280> only<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.670> really

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
netbook to date not only is it really

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.969 
netbook to date not only is it really
small<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:49.020> really<00:01:49.229> not<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.470> easy<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
small but it's really not that easy to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.889 
small but it's really not that easy to
navigate<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.490> desktop<00:01:50.909> with<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.270> we've

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
navigate the desktop with it we've

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.569 
navigate the desktop with it we've
gotten<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> kind<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> field<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.490> it

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
gotten the kind of the field down for it

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.330 
gotten the kind of the field down for it
but<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:53.820> times<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:54.420> will<00:01:55.380> refuse<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.159> mute

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
but at times it just will refuse to mute

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.209 
but at times it just will refuse to mute
to<00:01:56.700> move<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:58.140> as<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.680> see<00:01:58.860> now<00:01:59.009> it's

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
to move so as you can see now it's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.340 
to move so as you can see now it's
working<00:01:59.430> quite<00:01:59.790> well<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.450> little<00:02:01.079> bit<00:02:01.200> too

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
working quite well but a little bit too

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.050 
working quite well but a little bit too
much<00:02:01.500> pressure<00:02:01.680> will<00:02:02.040> not<00:02:02.280> allow<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.850> move

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
much pressure will not allow it to move

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.499 
much pressure will not allow it to move
around<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> desktop<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:05.390> m.tech<00:02:06.390> has

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
around the desktop and there m.tech has

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.389 
around the desktop and there m.tech has
also<00:02:06.659> gone<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.290> two<00:02:07.829> mouse<00:02:08.039> button

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
also gone with the two mouse button

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.910 
also gone with the two mouse button
straddling<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.090> trackpad<00:02:09.739> though<00:02:10.739> we've

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
straddling the trackpad though we've

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.199 
straddling the trackpad though we've
kind<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.160> gotten<00:02:11.340> used<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.790> arrangement

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
kind of gotten used to this arrangement

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.120 
kind of gotten used to this arrangement
these<00:02:12.510> buttons<00:02:12.810> are

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
these buttons are

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.800 
these buttons are
tremely<00:02:13.340> stiff<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.970> really<00:02:14.300> hard<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.600> press

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
tremely stiff and really hard to press

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.490 
tremely stiff and really hard to press
down<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.650> what<00:02:15.920> we've<00:02:16.070> had<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.250> do<00:02:16.490> is<00:02:16.640> really

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
down so what we've had to do is really

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.600 
down so what we've had to do is really
just<00:02:18.500> really<00:02:18.800> learn<00:02:18.950> how<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.130> master<00:02:19.490> the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
just really learn how to master the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.100 
just really learn how to master the
trackpad<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.090> we've<00:02:20.330> obviously<00:02:20.420> preferred

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
trackpad and we've obviously preferred

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.710 
trackpad and we've obviously preferred
plugging<00:02:21.770> in<00:02:21.860> an<00:02:21.950> external<00:02:22.280> mouse<00:02:22.550> at<00:02:23.450> all

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
plugging in an external mouse at all

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.260 
plugging in an external mouse at all
times<00:02:23.990> so<00:02:24.710> we've<00:02:24.860> noticed<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.370> performance

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
times so we've noticed that performance

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.420 
times so we've noticed that performance
is<00:02:26.420> decent<00:02:27.170> though<00:02:27.350> it's<00:02:27.500> just<00:02:27.710> not<00:02:27.860> as<00:02:28.010> snappy

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
is decent though it's just not as snappy

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.680 
is decent though it's just not as snappy
as<00:02:28.460> we've<00:02:28.700> seen<00:02:28.910> with<00:02:28.970> some<00:02:29.240> of<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.390> atom

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
as we've seen with some of the atom

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.450 
as we've seen with some of the atom
based<00:02:29.870> processors<00:02:30.410> as<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.070> see<00:02:31.220> here<00:02:31.370> we're

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
based processors as you see here we're

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.710 
based processors as you see here we're
going<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.670> try<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:31.940> launch<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.510> Firefox

going to try and launch the Firefox

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.070 
going to try and launch the Firefox
browser<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.970> just<00:02:35.180> takes<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.510> few<00:02:35.540> more

well as to navigate to webpages you know
the<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:43.070> connectivity<00:02:43.850> is<00:02:43.940> fine<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.780> just

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
the the connectivity is fine it just

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.780 
the the connectivity is fine it just
seems<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.440> there<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:46.010> seems<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.520> be<00:02:46.550> a<00:02:46.640> little

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
seems that there it seems to be a little

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
seems that there it seems to be a little
bit<00:02:46.970> too<00:02:47.120> much<00:02:47.240> of<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.450> task<00:02:47.660> here<00:02:48.050> for<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
bit too much of a task here for the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.690 
bit too much of a task here for the
processor<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.100> said<00:02:52.250> we're

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
processor and like you said we're

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.340 
processor and like you said we're
showing<00:02:52.910> here<00:02:53.030> we're<00:02:53.330> trying<00:02:53.960> to<00:02:54.080> open<00:02:54.290> a

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
showing here we're trying to open a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.160 
showing here we're trying to open a
twitter<00:02:54.470> page<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.240> takes<00:02:56.240> a<00:02:56.360> few<00:02:56.510> seconds<00:02:56.900> as

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
twitter page and takes a few seconds as

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.080 
twitter page and takes a few seconds as
if<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.920> system<00:02:58.280> is<00:02:58.370> kind<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.670> thinking<00:02:58.880> about

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
if the system is kind of thinking about

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.720 
if the system is kind of thinking about
something<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.560> then<00:03:00.860> we<00:03:01.010> will<00:03:01.190> kind<00:03:01.460> of<00:03:01.550> just

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
something and then we will kind of just

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.500 
something and then we will kind of just
launched<00:03:02.390> some<00:03:02.600> other<00:03:02.720> programs<00:03:03.170> here<00:03:04.510> show

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
launched some other programs here show

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.560 
launched some other programs here show
you<00:03:05.570> how<00:03:05.750> long<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:05.960> takes<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.380> open<00:03:07.570> open

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
you how long it takes to open open

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:24.160 
you how long it takes to open open
office

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.960 

so<00:03:24.740> like<00:03:24.860> we<00:03:24.980> said<00:03:25.160> there's<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.430> bit<00:03:25.550> of<00:03:25.580> waiting

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
so like we said there's a bit of waiting

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.150 
so like we said there's a bit of waiting
in<00:03:26.090> terms<00:03:26.300> of<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.770> application<00:03:27.770> load<00:03:27.920> time

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
in terms of the application load time

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.400 
in terms of the application load time
and<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.489> terms<00:03:28.700> of<00:03:28.819> multitasking<00:03:29.330> but<00:03:30.080> for<00:03:30.349> if

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
and in terms of multitasking but for if

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.900 
and in terms of multitasking but for if
you're<00:03:30.560> about<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.190> know<00:03:31.220> use<00:03:31.520> this<00:03:31.700> kind

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
you're about to you know use this kind

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.970 
you're about to you know use this kind
of<00:03:32.170> interface<00:03:33.170> for<00:03:33.380> living<00:03:33.650> in<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.800> browser

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
of interface for living in the browser

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.800 
of interface for living in the browser
or<00:03:34.400> visiting<00:03:34.849> websites<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.720> know

checking<00:03:36.080> email<00:03:36.470> we<00:03:36.620> do<00:03:36.739> think<00:03:37.010> it's<00:03:37.160> pretty

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200
