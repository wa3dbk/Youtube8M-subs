00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
we're gonna crank it up all the way to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.229 
we're gonna crank it up all the way to
dry<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.489> your<00:00:38.670> top<00:00:38.790> speed<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
dry so that your top speed is the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.700 
dry so that your top speed is the
highest<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.690> your<00:00:39.780> downforce<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> lowest

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
highest and your downforce is the lowest

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.319 
highest and your downforce is the lowest
this<00:00:41.160> will<00:00:41.309> cause<00:00:41.460> steering<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.000> be<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> little

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
this will cause steering to be a little

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
this will cause steering to be a little
harder<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.440> will<00:00:43.649> need<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> get

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
harder but you will need that to get

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.520 
harder but you will need that to get
that<00:00:44.460> time<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.149> then<00:00:45.660> for<00:00:45.899> options<00:00:46.289> here

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
that time in and then for options here

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.959

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
that's only 0.3 seconds off that time

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.740

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
I am using an automatic setup but it's

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.969 
I am using an automatic setup but it's
critical<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.909> tap<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.229> X<00:02:07.530> button<00:02:07.890> to

critical that you tap that X button to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.110 
critical that you tap that X button to
downshift<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.179> brake<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.830> literally

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
downshift as you can brake in literally

downshift as you can brake in literally
10%<00:02:12.120> less

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
10% less

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.600 
10% less
the<00:02:12.690> distance<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.410> doesn't<00:02:13.710> sound<00:02:14.130> like<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> lot

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
the distance it doesn't sound like a lot

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.570 
the distance it doesn't sound like a lot
but<00:02:14.850> trust<00:02:15.120> me<00:02:15.210> 10%<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.140> lot<00:02:16.560> here<00:02:17.100> I'm<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.280> bum

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
but trust me 10% is a lot here I'm a bum

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.700
