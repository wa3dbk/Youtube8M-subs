00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello together today I will be you 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.589
 my august our things fail 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:17.550
 really worn in august 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:19.710
 have a lot of fun as the very first 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.109
 Let's start with a nail polish series 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.769
 my nails are earlier 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.260
 really very complicated 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.840
 I could not wait any longer than one to 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.239
 say two days wear on the second day 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.420
 my nails are already totally broken off 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.370
 off and on the way where my nail polish 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.469
 then the nails were gone too 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.570
 broken because they were not that strong 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.670
 until I get the nail polish series from 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.559
 sally hanson discovered for me and 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.230
 although they promise that the nail polishes 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.750
 Hold on to me for two weeks 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.699
 you about five to six days and that 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.010
 is really a very big one for me 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.899
 big time and that's why I'm with it 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.120
 I was really happy too 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.469
 I would be the one in the month of August 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.589
 80 worn 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.570
 that is such a rosé I have too 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.320
 I really wear it very much today 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.909
 with pleasure 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.760
 otherwise I have one more 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.590
 dark red and a b stream invasion 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.330
 nail polish rich really very very 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.610
 Often the number I will give you below 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.770
 Write if you are so complicated 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.420
 have nails and no nail gets then 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.909
 I would paint you the silly bounds 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.430
 recommend it costs one now 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.350
 nail polish for the ten euros and the top 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.270
 course costs then again 10 euros 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.080
 the bavaria really does hold a lot 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.930
 long and for that he 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.990
 To use so often I think it's worth it 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.690
 that is definitely cheaper and cheaper 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.700
 more beautiful than the nails each 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.340
 I 'm really happy 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.240
 I still have a stock product very well 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.880
 namely the expresscard three tops and 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.890
 essence that looks and is 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.930
 that thought so that after that 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.390
 one has painted the nails enough with it 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.460
 the nail polish all open faster 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.870
 so that you can do it in nail polish and 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.000
 then like jobs and then they are 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.800
 rock hard that's the case with me at least 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.470
 I do not do that so I do 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.780
 evening in bed always paint the nails 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.340
 I always do that and then 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.980
 I do it in the morning with blankets 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.990
 and I have been here ever since 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.209
 user is no longer me 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.790
 let me first the nails then I leave 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.680
 They dry a bit because I 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.450
 then while watching videos 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.350
 and so and when I'm really tired 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.990
 I have become 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.120
 then I do the jobs on it and then 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.580
 I am no longer in the morning mitgehenden 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.350
 Plaid corners on the nails too 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.090
 that's why it's the perfect one for me 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.040
 solution, however, you should know 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.800
 that this is not what you are 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.110
 in smoke immediately after the nail polish 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.470
 and the nails the exaggerated 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.520
 dried not sauce but effective 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.250
 is funny 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.010
 really well then I have a in august 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.290
 shadow really worn throughout 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.090
 what make-up for me 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.640
 I've always really used that and 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.860
 Although this is a song written by kiko 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.570
 in the color 226 that it's such a beautiful one 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.970
 I really have metro over and over 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.070
 I used again here in praise 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.840
 today now not made because today have 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.670
 me before I shot the video 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.680
 witnessed products shot video 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.330
 comes on sunday if you want to know 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.280
 offers to have done all this then 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.830
 can you turn on sunday again 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.480
 But we come back to meet harmless 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.970
 i have always had this color 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.280
 used in a circle and the color fits 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.750
 actually to everything and I think 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.700
 such a rosé tone in the war leaves the whole thing 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.990
 look so beautiful again 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.030
 but if you want you can 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.250
 Of course, in everyday life just like that 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.340
 So perhaps use at 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.320
 current and then in the pries sees here 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.990
 I really like that 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.500
 London and brunegg are happy to be there 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:56.220
 Environmentally good is a natural color thing 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.170
 then the sounds eg 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.830
 make the cheeks stand out again 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.680
 so that they are so beautiful 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.600
 harmonious if you live I love 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.820
 i love i make a song 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.190
 really used very often 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.100
 and down here at the bottom 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.290
 Eyelash Wreath is that this color here 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.040
 also from the cinema and that in the 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.920
 number 216 in the camera sees this now 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.390
 not as glamorous as in real life 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.100
 is such a brown tone with a light one 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.290
 gold shimmer unterton still in there 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.570
 So I will be very interesting 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.030
 in any case in the close-ups 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.950
 show the color I really love and 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.260
 the eyeshadows of ricoh and me are 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.010
 pretty much the only thing that bothers me 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.840
 is that she is pretty much as often as possible 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.860
 But the colors are crumbly 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.140
 really beautifull 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.510
 they can be bandaged very easily 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.610
 So also for make-up beginnings among you 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.320
 if you can buy the political just buy 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.290
 take care a bit that you do that 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.000
 So retrieves and then it can be 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.890
 whole really nice 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.650
 then I have a place where 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.710
 really very much like to have used 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.919
 and of essens the number 20 berlin 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.870
 The color looks like this now 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.260
 something flashy but that's really 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.510
 the perfect thrill for everyday life 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.720
 which color you want to wear 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.290
 this sound really fits as well as everything 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:30.180
 and indeed the son has year under do 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:32.610
 but it is still pink and because of this 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.490
 interesting undertone fits the color 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.250
 really has a poverty of it 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.990
 I believe that two of me have two 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:44.850
 piece sent 1 1 I have mine 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.010
 give and promote sister 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.560
 that really a very nice one 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.729
 Colors for everyday life really often 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.400
 and very much 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.979
 then i have a face brother what 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.530
 my life has changed okay now 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.450
 Truly exaggerate it but that is 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.550
 really a brother to me really 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.960
 has become very important in the 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.910
 last two months 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.789
 I do not like it when you leave 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:12.780
 Rowing and then demanded exaggerated 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:14.820
 So it looks like you have to use powder 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.919
 So that the foundation does not slip with it 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.860
 the whole holds longer and so on 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.590
 I do not like that faces 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.479
 then look so overly dull 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.479
 Of course, there are products that something 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.970
 are lighter and so on but that 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:33.270
 Powder is really the perfect one for me 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.250
 solution because there are very fine 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.940
 I have you company particle with in it 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:41.250
 said that my job is and there is 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.510
 translucent facebook or on it in the 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.510
 formula 1 medium 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:50.750
 photo it is really very very fine 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.160
 now very much came out 15 he 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.660
 knew 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.060
 that is really very, very not one 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.280
 shimmer particles in there if you can 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:02.150
 you will not use that and katy 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.790
 everything is demanded 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.040
 but you are not so dull 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.900
 These do not look like shimmering particles 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.120
 make the whole thing really over the top 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.400
 I especially enjoy using it 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.560
 I'm sure that's the whole thing 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.320
 will keep very long because there is 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.800
 really a lot in there and that 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:26.210
 the 21 grams are very very fine 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.310
 something magical in itself and that 's it 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.260
 then already with my favorites 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.300
 tell me something about it 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.300
 Are you interested in any of that? 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.520
