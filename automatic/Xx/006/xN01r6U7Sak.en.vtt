today with another quick pes2014 video
this<00:00:07.500> time<00:00:07.770> having<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.280> deeper<00:00:08.820> look<00:00:08.970> into<00:00:09.150> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
this time having a deeper look into the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.070 
this time having a deeper look into the
combination<00:00:10.469> play<00:00:10.830> for<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:11.670> year<00:00:11.929> so<00:00:12.929> what

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
combination play for this year so what

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.660 
combination play for this year so what
is<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.230> all<00:00:13.530> about<00:00:13.559> where<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.099> can<00:00:14.219> select<00:00:14.370> up

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
is it all about where you can select up

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.640 
is it all about where you can select up
to<00:00:14.700> three<00:00:15.150> different<00:00:15.599> types<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.199> combined

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
to three different types of combined

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.220 
to three different types of combined
strategies<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:18.390> only<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.630> implemented

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
strategies it can only be implemented

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.529 
strategies it can only be implemented
though<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:19.650> at<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> time<00:00:20.300> once<00:00:21.300> those

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
where they are to be implemented will be

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.920 
where they are to be implemented will be
shown<00:00:25.650> players<00:00:26.580> will<00:00:26.820> link<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.359> an<00:00:27.480> attempt

look now at these numbers you're

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.299 
look now at these numbers you're
probably<00:00:43.500> wondering<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.160> all<00:00:44.280> about

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
probably wondering what it's all about

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.139 
probably wondering what it's all about
well<00:00:44.700> 1<00:00:44.969> through<00:00:45.420> 11<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.320> specific

course it shows you videos as well so
you<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.430> what<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:11.700> all<00:01:11.760> about<00:01:11.820> drop<00:01:12.420> deep

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
you know what it's all about drop deep

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.440 
you know what it's all about drop deep
and<00:01:12.869> overlap<00:01:13.340> overlap<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.490> pull<00:01:14.729> back<00:01:14.970> got

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and overlap overlap and pull back got

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.450 
and overlap overlap and pull back got
straight<00:01:15.869> run<00:01:16.110> hold<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.560> an<00:01:16.710> overlap<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.280> well

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
straight run hold up an overlap as well

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.060 
straight run hold up an overlap as well
diagonal<00:01:18.090> dribble<00:01:18.799> cut<00:01:19.799> inside<00:01:20.250> as<00:01:20.640> well<00:01:22.070> so

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
diagonal dribble cut inside as well so

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.429 
diagonal dribble cut inside as well so
imagine<00:01:23.280> linking<00:01:23.850> players<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.360> Grigori<00:01:24.810> Robin

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
imagine linking players up Grigori Robin

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.800 
imagine linking players up Grigori Robin
Muller<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> zerg<00:01:26.520> each<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:26.970> well<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
Muller and zerg each as well the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.190 
Muller and zerg each as well the
absolutely<00:01:28.200> phenomenal<00:01:28.530> when<00:01:28.860> them<00:01:29.060> movement

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
absolutely phenomenal when them movement

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.730 
absolutely phenomenal when them movement
will<00:01:31.200> bleed<00:01:31.409> sublime<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.439> these<00:01:34.680> are

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
will bleed sublime so these are

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.160 
will bleed sublime so these are
locations<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.329> three<00:01:36.659> four<00:01:36.900> six

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
locations now you can see three four six

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.560 
locations now you can see three four six
and<00:01:37.350> seven<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.920> where<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.700> combined<00:01:39.270> play

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and seven is where this combined play

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.219 
and seven is where this combined play
can<00:01:39.840> happen<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.710> field<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.899> these<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.110> be

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
can happen on the field and these can be

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.450 
can happen on the field and these can be
tweaked<00:01:43.530> throughout<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> course<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.399> the
