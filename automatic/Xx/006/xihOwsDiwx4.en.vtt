00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.100 
fraternities I just gave them random two
Greek<00:01:44.100> letters<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.780> know<00:01:45.960> there

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
Greek letters so for all I know there

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.380 
Greek letters so for all I know there
might<00:01:46.229> actually<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:47.000> if<00:01:48.000> you're<00:01:48.119> trying<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
might actually be if you're trying to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.789 
might actually be if you're trying to
use<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> sureties<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.290> are<00:01:49.380> called<00:01:49.619> this

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
use the sureties that are called this

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.780 
use the sureties that are called this
but<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.600> think<00:01:51.600> pretty<00:01:52.079> much<00:01:52.290> every<00:01:52.500> letter

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
but I think pretty much every letter

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.770 
but I think pretty much every letter
combination<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.880> taken<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.509> there's<00:01:54.689> nothing

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
combination is taken so there's nothing

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.940 
combination is taken so there's nothing
I<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.470> about<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:56.060> this<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.299> and

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
I can really do about that this one and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.609 
I can really do about that this one and
I<00:01:58.950> actually<00:01:59.130> really<00:01:59.759> really<00:01:59.790> love<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.329> one

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
I actually really really love this one

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.819 
I actually really really love this one
