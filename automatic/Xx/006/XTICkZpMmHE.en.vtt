I<00:01:32.540> just<00:01:33.540> don't<00:01:33.750> think<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.229> good<00:01:34.619> it's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.219 
I just don't think it's that good it's
really<00:01:35.400> expensive<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.479> does<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.079> it

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
really expensive for what it does and it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.649 
really expensive for what it does and it
not<00:01:37.439> be<00:01:37.650> an<00:01:37.710> instant<00:01:38.250> speed<00:01:38.579> really<00:01:39.180> hurts<00:01:39.450> it

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
not be an instant speed really hurts it

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.719 
not be an instant speed really hurts it
it's<00:01:40.079> nice<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.860> basically<00:01:41.040> pay<00:01:41.430> 3

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
it's nice that you can basically pay 3

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.670 
it's nice that you can basically pay 3
mana<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.240> 33<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.810> haste<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.500> that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
mana for a 33 with haste but that

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.590 
mana for a 33 with haste but that
doesn't<00:01:44.040> really<00:01:44.130> help<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.610> car<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.119> much<00:01:45.420> in

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
the field as possible that will boost

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.940 
the field as possible that will boost
this<00:03:38.880> guy<00:03:39.060> stat<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.540> lot<00:03:39.870> while<00:03:40.260> also<00:03:40.470> giving<00:03:40.770> it

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
this guy stat a lot while also giving it

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.740 
this guy stat a lot while also giving it
the<00:03:41.070> flexibility<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.790> do<00:03:42.000> all<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.480> stuff

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
the flexibility to do all the stuff

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.620 
the flexibility to do all the stuff
whenever<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.290> need<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.880> now<00:03:44.880> this<00:03:45.120> isn't<00:03:45.360> a

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
whenever you need it now this isn't a

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.600 
whenever you need it now this isn't a
perfect<00:03:45.840> car<00:03:46.140> by<00:03:46.320> any<00:03:46.560> means<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.280> really

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
perfect car by any means and it really

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.120 
perfect car by any means and it really
isn't<00:03:47.910> that<00:03:48.270> good<00:03:48.510> for<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.810> limited<00:03:48.930> play<00:03:49.320> but

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
isn't that good for a limited play but

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.220 
isn't that good for a limited play but
in<00:03:50.310> an<00:03:50.430> ally<00:03:50.640> deck<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.300> could<00:03:51.630> become<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.930> staple

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
in an ally deck it could become a staple

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.980 
in an ally deck it could become a staple
it's<00:03:53.040> really<00:03:53.520> bad<00:03:53.880> on<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.180> small<00:03:54.480> board<00:03:54.780> and

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
it's really bad on a small board and

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.410 
it's really bad on a small board and
it's<00:03:55.110> awful<00:03:55.560> against<00:03:55.860> wipes<00:03:56.100> but<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:56.970> think<00:03:57.270> the

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
it's awful against wipes but I think the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.180 
it's awful against wipes but I think the
power<00:03:57.660> of<00:03:57.930> allies<00:03:58.320> will<00:03:58.560> make<00:03:58.770> up<00:03:58.920> for<00:03:58.950> those

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
power of allies will make up for those

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.880 
power of allies will make up for those
faults<00:03:59.870> we<00:04:00.870> still<00:04:01.170> have<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:01.440> wait<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.830> see

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
faults we still have to wait and see

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.740 
faults we still have to wait and see
what<00:04:02.280> other<00:04:02.520> allies<00:04:02.970> are<00:04:03.150> released<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.600> this

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
what other allies are released in this

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.140 
what other allies are released in this
set<00:04:04.080> but<00:04:04.650> I'm<00:04:04.770> hopefully<00:04:05.250> optimistic<00:04:05.970> for

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150
