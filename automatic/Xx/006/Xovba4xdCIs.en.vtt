00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.790
 i know 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.240
 for the logo it will just print 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.860
 and seeing that I am a fucking ravine 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.340
 it is drawn months later it will take 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.760
 cut out the logo after placing it 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.280
 on the scrap plate then with 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.350
 the marker will have to make the outlines of the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.350
 logo then cut with the mule 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.380
 once glaucoma is drawn 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.380
 on the plate in jail will I have 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.210
 cut the leases with the grindstone will 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.130
 not cut in rounded otherwise you go 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.520
 break the disc should just cut 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.520
 right every time like that 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.119
 just after it will draw traits 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.360
 like that because it's a lot more 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.200
 simple as to actually cut out a 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.299
 plate we read it will do as here 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.899
 I classified rounded g3 is all right on 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.899
 made us a triangle 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.879
 and justin counts in the egg every 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:44.299
 edges that are useless always that 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:44.299
 all the triangles that does not release 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.739
 and for girls 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.120
 I used this machine need to 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.409
 well I'm going to round all the sides 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.430
 thanks to that you want everything that is 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:17.730
 red but higher more y 'will 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.730
 Let's go 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.959
 and 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.150
 Yes 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.250
 he 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.250
 what's this 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.770
 he 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.430
 we 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.400
 Yes 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.049
 once the borgers actually I 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.709
 could have started sharpening the four 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.110
 sides here and after give him a 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.060
 matte gray color a little background it's like 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.699
 that by simply soaking it in 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.030
 hydrochloric acid the reaction is 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.030
 do pretty quickly 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.680
 and
