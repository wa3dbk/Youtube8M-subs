00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 and it shows we're all in people at 5 and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.069
 we are back with a new career 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.580
 care that happened to me 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.960
 ok ok let's go forward and I'm going to how 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.340
 I'm fine playing with subscribers 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.540
 of 6 that by Thursday you know that 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.470
 to play with me you have to 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.640
 to do is to be in the crew and follow me 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.400
 also by twitter that is in the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.160
 description and in that way then the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.940
 I will invite and tweet notice of when 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.550
 I'll play 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.890
 let's say comfortable I do not have very slowly 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.150
 the first ones are other returns for 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.280
 true 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.710
 and I do not know if it will be very long I do not know if 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.489
 the race will be short but 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:51.190
 let's see if by here although that I think 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.190
 that was the one that was in miniature 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.019
 you have to advance forward there are 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.550
 overtake him here we brake a bit to 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.590
 do not happen 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.780
 well we have this back no no 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.720
 a kid we lost a lot and 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.350
 Until that moment, this is the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.610
 At the moment of speaking here, it is enough that you 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:19.060
 you put today let's go let's go around here 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.120
 the tornado is exactly here and 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.890
 we enter sections 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.070
 I do not know why but I think it's not going to 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.070
 go out 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.300
 and be careful especially in the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.770
 fall because if the car falls down 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.160
 can advance us by stimulating the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.680
 radar and we take you out for quite a while 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.340
 advantage but good as you know I am 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.759
 to mess it up 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.890
 and I'll do it at the last moment and 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.890
 will advance as at this moment 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.260
 and I think we already have one near no 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.040
 It changes a lot with that because that 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.650
 brake quite a bit and now here 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.870
 and this is the time to make it perfect 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.560
 and we have the race is worth here in curb 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.929
 because if I do not go to 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.060
 let's kill forward this would be one of the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.260
 two sides you have to get there you have to 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.670
 get it key 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.670
 this does not have to come out the first time 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.139
 care care care we let it 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.159
 we have what we have we have it good 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.690
 we can do the now yes it is 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.670
 true that it is all straight 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.580
 we can not load it even though this is coming 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.410
 pretty fast because it looks at the radar 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:41.400
 ok it seems that it has happened with which 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.400
 I can not get it 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.590
 and that is here the goal is here the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.590
 goal 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.700
 we are quite side because to me this 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.430
 kind of racing I really love 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.200
 very much because you have to do it there 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.150
 in plan you have to go up not 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.210
 you can get off a lot because then you 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.640
 I have to be 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.620
 the tornado and the truth that pretty cool 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.630
 then I have another one that oysters is amazing 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.950
 this tornado I will try to upload it for the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.330
 next day this race as it is a 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.620
 authentic past so I do not expect anything 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.030
 have you liked low declaimed your 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.750
 cristian stage and we do not see in next 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.750
 see you later
