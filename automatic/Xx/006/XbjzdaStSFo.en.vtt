flavor and its taste and its aroma and
that's<00:00:11.099> what<00:00:11.370> drives<00:00:12.090> people<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.840> come<00:00:13.500> back

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
that's what drives people to come back

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.970 
that's what drives people to come back
to<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:13.950> same<00:00:14.340> beer<00:00:14.700> for<00:00:15.480> me<00:00:15.920> there's<00:00:16.920> a

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
to that same beer for me there's a

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.769 
to that same beer for me there's a
there's<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.760> whole<00:00:17.910> tasting<00:00:18.890> methodology<00:00:19.890> that

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
there's a whole tasting methodology that

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.660 
there's a whole tasting methodology that
you<00:00:21.779> know<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.199> quite<00:00:22.439> in-depth<00:00:22.859> if<00:00:23.340> you

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
you know can be quite in-depth if you

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.460 
you know can be quite in-depth if you
were<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> contrast<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.539> with<00:00:24.689> other<00:00:25.050> beers

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
were to contrast that with other beers

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.290 
were to contrast that with other beers
you<00:00:26.039> know<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.220> would<00:00:26.460> say<00:00:26.670> will<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.150> is

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
you know you would say will this is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.509 
you know you would say will this is
distinctive<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.080> Keis<00:00:28.920> does<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.490> a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
distinctive and Keis does have a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.849 
distinctive and Keis does have a
distinctive<00:00:30.119> aroma<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.500> know<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.679> think

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
distinctive aroma and you know we think

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.380 
distinctive aroma and you know we think
that's<00:00:32.009> one<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.369> main<00:00:32.550> reasons<00:00:33.059> that

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that's one of the main reasons that

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.110 
that's one of the main reasons that
people<00:00:33.870> can<00:00:34.230> tell<00:00:34.559> kisa<00:00:34.890> part<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.790> know<00:00:35.880> from

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
people can tell kisa part you know from

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.520 
people can tell kisa part you know from
other<00:00:36.210> beers

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.950 

so<00:00:42.530> Alexander<00:00:43.190> keys<00:00:43.720> it<00:00:44.720> would<00:00:44.840> be

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
so Alexander keys it would be

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.000 
so Alexander keys it would be
characterized<00:00:45.740> as<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:46.130> as<00:00:46.580> a<00:00:46.640> heavier<00:00:47.060> styled

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
characterized as a as a heavier styled

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.800 
characterized as a as a heavier styled
fear<00:00:49.010> certainly<00:00:49.790> in<00:00:49.940> our<00:00:50.060> market<00:00:50.510> anyway

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
fear certainly in our market anyway

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.720 
fear certainly in our market anyway
we've<00:00:51.050> considered<00:00:51.440> a<00:00:51.650> heavier<00:00:51.920> style<00:00:52.310> of<00:00:52.430> beer

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
we've considered a heavier style of beer

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.630 
we've considered a heavier style of beer
and<00:00:52.970> that<00:00:53.330> really<00:00:53.480> goes<00:00:53.810> to<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:55.010> malt<00:00:55.280> that<00:00:55.520> we

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
and that really goes to the malt that we

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.640 
and that really goes to the malt that we
use<00:00:55.880> and<00:00:56.300> goes<00:00:56.480> right<00:00:56.720> back<00:00:56.900> to<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.290> brewing

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
use and goes right back to the brewing

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.520 
use and goes right back to the brewing
process<00:00:57.820> so<00:00:58.820> in<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.420> in<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.660> brew<00:00:59.989> house<00:01:00.170> we

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
process so in the in the brew house we

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.979 
process so in the in the brew house we
control<00:01:01.130> the<00:01:01.730> amount<00:01:01.970> of<00:01:02.150> conversion<00:01:02.809> of<00:01:02.930> the

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
control the amount of conversion of the

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.370 
control the amount of conversion of the
starch<00:01:03.530> that's<00:01:04.010> present<00:01:04.850> naturally<00:01:05.479> in<00:01:05.690> the

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
starch that's present naturally in the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.490 
starch that's present naturally in the
malt<00:01:06.710> that<00:01:07.370> we<00:01:07.490> bring<00:01:07.729> in<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.210> when<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.140> yeast

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
malt that we bring in and when the yeast

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.540 
malt that we bring in and when the yeast
ferments<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:11.320> sugars<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.590> maltose<00:01:13.010> a

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
ferments the sugars the maltose a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.760 
ferments the sugars the maltose a
certain<00:01:14.240> amount<00:01:14.420> of<00:01:14.570> residual<00:01:15.080> sugar<00:01:15.380> is<00:01:15.560> left

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
certain amount of residual sugar is left

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.460 
certain amount of residual sugar is left
behind<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.850> on<00:01:17.000> Alexander<00:01:17.869> Keith's<00:01:18.140> one<00:01:18.380> of

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
behind so on Alexander Keith's one of

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.840 
behind so on Alexander Keith's one of
the<00:01:18.560> things<00:01:18.710> that's<00:01:18.860> very<00:01:18.979> characteristic

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
the things that's very characteristic

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.850 
the things that's very characteristic
about<00:01:20.000> keys<00:01:20.300> is<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:21.020> we<00:01:21.140> actually<00:01:21.290> leave

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
about keys is that we actually leave

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.450 
about keys is that we actually leave
behind<00:01:22.430> a<00:01:22.850> very<00:01:23.270> high<00:01:23.509> level<00:01:24.229> of<00:01:24.410> this<00:01:24.979> non

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
behind a very high level of this non

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.760 
behind a very high level of this non
fermented<00:01:26.240> sugar<00:01:26.660> and<00:01:26.930> that's<00:01:27.410> what<00:01:27.560> gives

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
fermented sugar and that's what gives

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.160 
fermented sugar and that's what gives
key<00:01:28.220> some<00:01:28.550> of<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:28.700> extra<00:01:29.119> body<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.690> also

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
key some of that extra body and also

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.140 
key some of that extra body and also
some<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.530> extra<00:01:30.830> edge<00:01:30.979> retention<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:32.030> when

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
some that extra edge retention so when

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.880 
some that extra edge retention so when
you're<00:01:32.300> tasting<00:01:32.720> keys<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.229> may<00:01:33.350> taste<00:01:33.649> like<00:01:33.830> a

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
you're tasting keys it may taste like a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.950 
you're tasting keys it may taste like a
heavier<00:01:34.220> beer<00:01:34.520> but<00:01:34.970> it's<00:01:35.090> really<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.450> function

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
heavier beer but it's really a function

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.600 
heavier beer but it's really a function
of<00:01:36.080> you<00:01:36.530> know<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.770> amount<00:01:37.009> of<00:01:37.130> unfermented

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
of you know the amount of unfermented

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.639 
of you know the amount of unfermented
sugars<00:01:38.360> that<00:01:38.660> you<00:01:39.050> know<00:01:39.140> we<00:01:39.290> intentionally

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
sugars that you know we intentionally

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.830 
sugars that you know we intentionally
leave<00:01:40.280> behind<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.000> brewing<00:01:41.180> process

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.889 

so<00:01:47.840> Alexander<00:01:48.350> Keith<00:01:48.590> red<00:01:49.219> amber<00:01:49.579> it<00:01:50.240> slightly

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
so Alexander Keith red amber it slightly

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.440 
so Alexander Keith red amber it slightly
differentiates<00:01:51.710> from<00:01:51.979> Alexander<00:01:52.939> key<00:01:53.149> sale

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
differentiates from Alexander key sale

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.109 
differentiates from Alexander key sale
per<00:01:53.840> se<00:01:54.049> as<00:01:54.289> it's<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.979> it's<00:01:55.549> really<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.969> next

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
per se as it's the it's really the next

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.109 
per se as it's the it's really the next
step<00:01:56.299> up<00:01:56.719> and<00:01:57.140> turns<00:01:57.409> up<00:01:57.649> heaviness<00:01:58.310> but<00:01:58.850> on

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
step up and turns up heaviness but on

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.600 
step up and turns up heaviness but on
terms<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.719> taste<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.380> can<00:02:00.530> detect<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:01.130> slightly

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
terms of taste you can detect a slightly

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.700 
terms of taste you can detect a slightly
heavier<00:02:02.119> note<00:02:02.479> in<00:02:02.720> terms<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.140> caramel

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
heavier note in terms of caramel

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.609 
heavier note in terms of caramel
characteristic<00:02:04.520> coming<00:02:05.240> through<00:02:05.509> both<00:02:06.049> on

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
characteristic coming through both on

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.160 
characteristic coming through both on
the<00:02:06.799> nose<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:07.579> on<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:07.970> taste<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:08.869> on<00:02:09.050> the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
the nose and on the taste so on the

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.359 
the nose and on the taste so on the
taste<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:09.590> can<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.800> tell<00:02:09.979> it's<00:02:10.160> little

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
taste you can to tell it's little

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.610 
taste you can to tell it's little
heavier<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.940> on<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.480> aroma<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:12.080> caramel

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
heavier and on the aroma that caramel
