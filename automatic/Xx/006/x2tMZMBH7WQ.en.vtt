00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:05.906
 God is our refuge and strength; a very present emergency aid. 

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:09.276
 This is Psalm 46: 1. In the next few versions of this Psalm, 

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:15.482
 We see the beautiful illustration of GOD that is our peace and comfort during disasters. 

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:20.087
 In verses 2 and 3, we even see when the symbols of might - the mountains will be caught in the sea, 

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:25.493
 the waters thereof roar and mourn, the waves shall go mad, but we have God as our peace; 

00:00:25.493 --> 00:00:31.298
 and verse 10 says, "Be still, and know: I am God." 

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:38.305
 Paul calls God the "Father of deformations" and the "God of all comfort" in 2 Corinthians 1: 3. 

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.107
 Sometimes we go through these things, 

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:46.419
 so that we can experience those things; trust God and see His comfort, and when others go through things, 

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:48.883
 we can also comfort them. 

00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:53.487
 It's not an easy thing to go through - I'm sure you've been through a lot. 

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:59.293
 But see, we can be like Jonah and run straight from GOD, 

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:04.097
 whether we can be like Job and fall on our knees before God and ask for His help. 

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:11.505
 It is either pride or humility, and in disasters, we may all turn to God and not run away. 

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:16.476
 Habakkuk - He was a prophet of God. This is a very strange book from the Old Testament, 

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.880
 but still a wonderful one - it is also a book about hardship. 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.484
 At first Habakkyk did not fully understand what God was doing. 

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:26.287
 God was chastising His people with a more wicked nation than them. 

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:34.695
 But in the end, when he realizes and still knows (he is an obedient prophet of God), 

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:37.698
 That even when that fig tree doesn't bear figs, 

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:39.700
 when the vineyards bear no fruit, 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.103
 when there is no more sheep left in the field, 

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:47.107
 and when there are no more animals in the stables, 

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:53.080
 We still know that God is faithful, and He will still praise Him. 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.685
 And this is my hope for all of you - when you go through disasters, trust in God. 

00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:01.088
 If you know someone who's going through a disaster, be there for them. 

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:06.493
 Be the carnal love of God to them. Share the love of Jesus with them. 

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:11.698
 Sometimes listening is good. Other times it is necessary to pray with them! It's fantastic! 

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:15.902
 Our power is in prayer! It is a gift from God. It is not our own strength and strength. 

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.305
 But God can work through us. 

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:23.310
 So again, if you're going through a disaster, whether you know someone who's going through one, trust God. 

00:02:23.310 --> 99:59:59.000
 Look at Him first. Be blessed. Know that God is our Father of deeds and also the God of all comfort. God bless you.
