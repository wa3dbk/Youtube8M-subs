00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
and today we're looking at a starship

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.260 
and today we're looking at a starship
trooper<00:00:04.500> pinball<00:00:04.830> machine<00:00:05.100> now<00:00:06.000> let's<00:00:06.150> see

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
trooper pinball machine now let's see

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:21.200 
trooper pinball machine now let's see
when<00:00:06.420> it<00:00:06.540> boots<00:00:06.660> up<00:00:19.490> okay<00:00:20.490> let's<00:00:20.670> go<00:00:20.910> into<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
when it boots up okay let's go into the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.150 
when it boots up okay let's go into the
Diagnostics<00:00:27.050> so<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.439> go<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
Diagnostics so if we go to the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.580 
Diagnostics so if we go to the
diagnostic<00:00:30.410> on<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> truck<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:33.530> can<00:00:34.530> see

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
diagnostic on the truck you can see

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:49.459 
diagnostic on the truck you can see
showing<00:00:36.200> only<00:00:37.200> two<00:00:37.649> balls<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.640> that's<00:00:48.260> okay<00:00:49.260> as

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
showing only two balls so that's okay as

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.430 
showing only two balls so that's okay as
you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.680> see<00:00:49.890> after<00:00:50.160> cycle<00:00:51.059> trough<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
you can see after cycle trough the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
you can see after cycle trough the
second<00:00:53.070> ball<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.489> still<00:00:53.789> shown<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.210> missing

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
second ball is still shown as missing

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
second ball is still shown as missing
whereas<00:00:55.079> balls<00:00:55.379> three<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.430> four<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:57.030> showing

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
whereas balls three and four are showing

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.650 
whereas balls three and four are showing
as<00:00:57.539> present<00:00:58.050> let<00:00:58.800> me<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.100> say<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.149> couple<00:01:00.359> more

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
as present let me just say a couple more

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.050 
as present let me just say a couple more
balls<00:01:04.070> they<00:01:05.070> all<00:01:05.189> moved<00:01:05.430> along<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.880> but

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
balls they all moved along one but

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.080 
balls they all moved along one but
they're<00:01:06.150> always<00:01:06.299> missing<00:01:06.720> our<00:01:06.869> position<00:01:07.320> two

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.149 

now<00:01:13.930> this<00:01:16.290> seems<00:01:17.290> like<00:01:17.350> he's<00:01:17.619> indicating<00:01:18.130> that

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
now this seems like he's indicating that

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.819 
now this seems like he's indicating that
switch<00:01:18.549> number<00:01:18.759> two<00:01:19.060> well<00:01:19.479> switch<00:01:19.720> 14<00:01:20.170> which

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
switch number two well switch 14 which

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.310 
switch number two well switch 14 which
is<00:01:20.860> second<00:01:21.310> ball<00:01:21.460> toss<00:01:21.640> which<00:01:22.000> is<00:01:22.270> missing<00:01:22.869> or

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
is second ball toss which is missing or

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.160 
is second ball toss which is missing or
broken<00:01:23.380> so<00:01:24.280> let's<00:01:24.640> have<00:01:24.729> a<00:01:24.820> look<00:01:24.970> at<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.180> and

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
broken so let's have a look at that and

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.010 
broken so let's have a look at that and
another<00:01:27.159> problem<00:01:27.430> we've<00:01:27.610> got<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.450> shooter

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
another problem we've got is the shooter

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.260 
another problem we've got is the shooter
is<00:01:29.229> a<00:01:29.289> bit<00:01:29.500> sluggish<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.909> barrel<00:01:31.179> of

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
is a bit sluggish and the the barrel of

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.370 
is a bit sluggish and the the barrel of
spring<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.600> really<00:01:31.929> broken<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:33.520> good<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.350> I

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
spring is really broken that good so I

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.950 
spring is really broken that good so I
need<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.649> rebuild<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.539> there<00:01:40.539> are<00:01:40.689> other

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
need to rebuild that there are other

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.389 
need to rebuild that there are other
thing<00:01:41.079> we<00:01:41.170> can<00:01:41.289> see<00:01:41.560> is<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.009> flippers

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
thing we can see is that the flippers

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:56.279 
thing we can see is that the flippers
alone<00:01:53.729> don't<00:01:54.729> respond<00:01:55.149> very<00:01:55.330> quickly<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:56.140> they

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
alone don't respond very quickly so they

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.399 
alone don't respond very quickly so they
need<00:01:56.439> a<00:01:56.470> full<00:01:56.709> rebuild

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
need a full rebuild

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.839 
need a full rebuild
well<00:01:59.409> this<00:01:59.709> Trotter<00:01:59.979> is<00:02:00.130> very<00:02:00.340> difficult<00:02:00.759> to

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:00.849 
well this Trotter is very difficult to

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:02.130 
well this Trotter is very difficult to
take<00:02:01.030> apart<00:02:01.390> it's<00:02:01.659> actually<00:02:01.720> got<00:02:02.020> these

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
take apart it's actually got these

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.899 
take apart it's actually got these
little<00:02:02.439> bolts<00:02:02.770> with<00:02:03.069> very<00:02:03.340> very<00:02:03.640> shallow

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
little bolts with very very shallow

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.370 
little bolts with very very shallow
heads<00:02:04.299> on<00:02:04.479> them<00:02:04.630> so<00:02:04.840> whoever<00:02:05.259> actually

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
heads on them so whoever actually

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.380 
heads on them so whoever actually
learning<00:02:05.619> tools<00:02:05.920> old<00:02:06.189> fair<00:02:06.670> overload<00:02:07.000> aunties

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
learning tools old fair overload aunties

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.359 
learning tools old fair overload aunties
pair<00:02:07.689> of<00:02:07.750> pliers<00:02:07.959> now<00:02:08.890> actually<00:02:09.160> I'll<00:02:09.220> take

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
pair of pliers now actually I'll take

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.490 
pair of pliers now actually I'll take
out<00:02:09.610> four<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.149> these<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.720> get<00:02:10.899> this<00:02:11.019> part<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
out four of these to get this part the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.020 
out four of these to get this part the
thruster<00:02:11.799> come<00:02:11.950> apart<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:12.700> can<00:02:12.880> then

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
thruster come apart so that you can then

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.940 
thruster come apart so that you can then
take<00:02:13.269> away<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.590> second<00:02:15.040> bolt<00:02:15.220> there<00:02:16.950> I'll

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
take away the second bolt there I'll

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.530 
take away the second bolt there I'll
finally<00:02:18.370> managed<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.790> remove<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.269> switch

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
finally managed to remove the switch

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.080 
finally managed to remove the switch
it's<00:02:19.989> actually<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.320> mechanical<00:02:20.829> failure<00:02:21.090> you

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
it's actually a mechanical failure you

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.000 
it's actually a mechanical failure you
can't<00:02:22.299> actually<00:02:22.450> reliably<00:02:23.380> press<00:02:23.709> that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
can't actually reliably press that

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.580 
can't actually reliably press that
rather<00:02:24.790> than<00:02:24.940> electrical<00:02:25.480> failure<00:02:25.900> oh<00:02:26.079> it's

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
rather than electrical failure oh it's

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.900 
rather than electrical failure oh it's
normally<00:02:26.859> contact<00:02:27.250> at<00:02:27.400> where<00:02:27.549> else<00:02:27.670> not

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
normally contact at where else not

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.539 
normally contact at where else not
conducting<00:02:28.420> properly<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:30.280> looks<00:02:30.489> like

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
conducting properly and it looks like

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.610 
conducting properly and it looks like
some<00:02:30.910> idiot<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.480> actually<00:02:31.780> oiled<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.410> it's

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
some idiot is actually oiled this it's

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.020 
some idiot is actually oiled this it's
causing<00:02:32.920> oil<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.370> there's<00:02:33.640> oil<00:02:33.880> all<00:02:34.000> over

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
causing oil and there's oil all over

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.910 
causing oil and there's oil all over
here<00:02:34.480> as<00:02:34.690> well<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.109> where<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.290> take<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.620> off<00:02:35.739> and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
here as well so where to take it off and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
someone doesn't seem to know what I'm

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.069 
someone doesn't seem to know what I'm
doing<00:02:39.459> ruin<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.329> with<00:02:40.359> point<00:02:40.720> loads<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:40.989> oil

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
doing ruin that with point loads of oil

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.400 
doing ruin that with point loads of oil
in<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.000> next<00:02:43.269> job<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.780> fit<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.290> new

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
in it and the next job is to fit a new

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.979 
in it and the next job is to fit a new
switch<00:02:44.859> solder<00:02:45.730> on<00:02:45.819> a<00:02:45.850> new<00:02:46.090> diode<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.840> then

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
switch solder on a new diode and then

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.220 
switch solder on a new diode and then
solder<00:02:47.380> on<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.859> old<00:02:48.700> wires<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:50.079> one

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
solder on the old wires and that one

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.319 
solder on the old wires and that one
doesn't<00:02:50.470> want<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.709> play<00:02:50.859> so<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.819> saw<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.060> one

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
doesn't want to play so you saw that one

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.460 
doesn't want to play so you saw that one
on<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:52.630> there<00:02:53.639> and<00:02:54.639> then<00:02:54.700> that's<00:02:55.000> done<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
on so there and then that's done and

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.900 
on so there and then that's done and
while<00:02:56.829> I'm<00:02:56.980> working<00:02:57.310> under<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.549> play<00:02:57.700> field

while I'm working under the play field
we've<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.269> small<00:02:58.389> the<00:02:58.630> own<00:02:58.810> I've<00:02:59.049> just<00:02:59.410> noticed

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
we've a small the own I've just noticed

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.160 
we've a small the own I've just noticed
this<00:03:00.670> why<00:03:00.940> here<00:03:01.239> it's<00:03:01.420> broken<00:03:01.690> off<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:01.930> this

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
this why here it's broken off of this

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.930 
this why here it's broken off of this
switch<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:02.829> just<00:03:02.920> need<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.190> reprime<00:03:03.579> not<00:03:03.760> and

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
switch so I just need to reprime not and

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.860 
switch so I just need to reprime not and
sorted<00:03:04.540> by<00:03:04.630> Colin<00:03:06.389> and<00:03:07.389> that's<00:03:07.690> what's

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
showing in the truck now

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.340 
showing in the truck now
okay<00:03:15.519> well<00:03:15.700> tests<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.209> game<00:03:16.389> I've<00:03:16.930> noticed

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
okay well tests in the game I've noticed

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:26.349 
okay well tests in the game I've noticed
like<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.620> red<00:03:17.829> streak<00:03:18.069> here

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.699 

okay<00:03:27.359> so<00:03:27.420> I've<00:03:27.659> disassembled<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.319> plunger

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
okay so I've disassembled the plunger

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.309 
okay so I've disassembled the plunger
now<00:03:28.859> if<00:03:29.670> you're<00:03:29.849> gonna<00:03:29.939> polish<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.719> up<00:03:30.810> fit<00:03:31.290> a

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
now if you're gonna polish it up fit a

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.259 
now if you're gonna polish it up fit a
new<00:03:31.499> spring<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.900> new<00:03:34.709> sleeve<00:03:35.010> in<00:03:35.400> there<00:03:36.000> and

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
new spring and a new sleeve in there and

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.550 
new spring and a new sleeve in there and
then<00:03:36.900> reassemble<00:03:38.480> so<00:03:39.480> in<00:03:39.540> order<00:03:39.689> to<00:03:39.840> rebuild

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
then reassemble so in order to rebuild

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.289 
then reassemble so in order to rebuild
the<00:03:40.739> flip<00:03:40.950> they're<00:03:41.159> all<00:03:41.340> these<00:03:41.459> nice<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.879> do<00:03:42.030> is

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
the flip they're all these nice to do is

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.809 
the flip they're all these nice to do is
remove<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.409> end<00:03:43.650> stop<00:03:44.010> first<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.670> can

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
remove the end stop first so you can

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.159 
remove the end stop first so you can
take<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.030> coil<00:03:45.329> off<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.689> then<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.870> can<00:03:45.989> remove

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
take a coil off and then you can remove

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.720 
take a coil off and then you can remove
the<00:03:46.290> best<00:03:46.530> mechanism<00:03:47.069> without<00:03:47.189> onto<00:03:47.639> the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
the best mechanism without onto the

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.449 
the best mechanism without onto the
solder<00:03:47.969> on<00:03:48.090> your<00:03:48.180> wires<00:03:49.099> so<00:03:50.099> if<00:03:50.219> we<00:03:50.340> have<00:03:50.430> a

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
solder on your wires so if we have a

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.250 
solder on your wires so if we have a
look<00:03:50.639> at<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.879> old<00:03:51.269> parts<00:03:51.689> versus<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.139> new

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
look at the old parts versus the new

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.409 
look at the old parts versus the new
parts<00:03:52.680> as<00:03:52.829> we<00:03:52.980> can<00:03:53.129> see<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.609> playfield

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
could come away from the play field and

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.600 
could come away from the play field and
cause<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.229> playfield<00:04:22.620> bat<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.039> scrape<00:04:23.340> on<00:04:23.580> the

rest on and that's all three flippers

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.279 
rest on and that's all three flippers
rebuilt<00:04:29.909> I'm<00:04:30.120> just<00:04:30.330> putting<00:04:30.539> some<00:04:30.840> new<00:04:31.020> rulers

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289
