00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:09.559
 We will show you how to use the photoshop cs 6 to easily make your photos watercolor-like 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.420
 To do 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:17.910
 It seems that this is completed 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:22.030
 More images are pretty rough images in any relation but this 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.240
 I think that I want to process it like this 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:31.329
 I opened the original image in photoshop 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.710
 Please change this to a layer as it is the background now 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:38.090
 From the filter 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:44.210
 If you select oil, such a screen is displayed 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:49.210
 Brush craft is a little default child now, but I set my brother here as my brother 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.079
 The ones that have been sent will be displayed in this preview 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:57.589
 Ape seems 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:59.680
 Cell phone can be parallel stroke of something like the brush but I can be understood Moraere look 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.830
 I hope the guy at Yo you 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.670
 Well this time I will set in 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.970
 Creed also feels like gold 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:16.400
 When the degree of cleanliness is lowered 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:20.110
 I'm getting to be able to do a go-a- like processing 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:28.690
 Please set before in this 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:36.040
 It is such a feeling of enlargement and reduction, but please set here in the third place 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:42.340
 I think that it is all right if you set three corners and details in the same country 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:46.540
 The angle at which the Tteyuu angle direction of handicrafts say do you rely on the light from somewhere and say something 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.710
 It can be set here 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:54.950
 This is another moment 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:59.210
 So even if hit from the same distinction called Toko details of whether 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:07.310
 Please set up with d as it is related to school 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:12.800
 Next is this relationship, but for example this is a bit stronger and it looks like this with auto 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.940
 Looks like it is Eikako of the rear husband is violently 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:21.120
 So now outside is watercolor 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:25.530
 It looks like this makes it flat like this if you set this to 0 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.560
 When you get this ok, 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.120
 A layer 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.780
 The layer after the box is applied 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:40.260
 This is not a painting-like painting style 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.260
 Though the style of the watercolor style is the end of this 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.700
 A little brighter 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:52.840
 When you want to 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:59.740
 Select the color tone correction from the approximate image, brightness contrast, etc. 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:06.000
 Well, I 'm going to use the past to go here 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:11.370
 We introduce commitment is a way to brighten again in a little easy, etc. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:17.370
 Duplicate the layer and prepare 3 layers 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.989
 It 's a copy of layer zero, so convert it to the screen 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.819
 With such feeling 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:29.430
 It will be able to process brightly with 8 ring a simple reception . 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:31.240
 The adjustment of this brightness is easy in the place called futon maid 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.490
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.490
 Will be able to super set 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.760
 Believe 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.550
 This is more virtual 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.760
 Screen 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:50.360
 Such a feeling that it was made 50 minutes of futon maid of the screen can brighten the carter 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.050
 I can do it 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.050
 This completes the watercolor-style image processing
