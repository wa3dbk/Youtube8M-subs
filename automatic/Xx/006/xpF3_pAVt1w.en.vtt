and<00:01:13.940> it<00:01:14.150> goes<00:01:14.450> up<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:14.750> down

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
and it goes up and down

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.539 
and it goes up and down
especially<00:01:16.439> all<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.679> does<00:01:16.829> I<00:01:17.070> don't<00:01:17.340> think<00:01:17.369> it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
especially all it does I don't think it

here grab some logs right that's what
that<00:03:28.230> blades<00:03:28.799> on<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.010> back<00:03:29.159> for<00:03:29.340> keep<00:03:29.579> them

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
that blades on the back for keep them

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.640 
that blades on the back for keep them
keep<00:03:29.939> stuff<00:03:30.180> from<00:03:30.209> going<00:03:31.200> through<00:03:31.230> here<00:03:31.530> and

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
messing me up okay some reason the thing

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:43.750 
messing me up okay some reason the thing
wants<00:03:38.159> to<00:03:38.310> keep<00:03:38.459> going<00:03:38.909> to

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.010 

right<00:03:44.360> is<00:03:44.629> it<00:03:44.810> oh<00:03:44.989> it's<00:03:45.230> out<00:03:45.379> of<00:03:45.409> whack

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
right is it oh it's out of whack

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.600 
right is it oh it's out of whack
I'll<00:03:47.530> look<00:03:47.800> at<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.010> it's<00:03:48.250> like<00:03:48.400> SATA

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
I'll look at it it's like SATA

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.070 
I'll look at it it's like SATA
it's<00:03:51.540> not<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.930> was<00:03:52.080> not<00:03:52.230> sinned<00:03:52.740> right<00:03:54.080> right

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
it's not it was not sinned right right

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.750 
it's not it was not sinned right right
here<00:03:55.260> if<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.440> look<00:03:55.620> it's<00:03:56.160> not<00:03:56.340> centered<00:04:01.760> or

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
here if you look it's not centered or

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.700 
here if you look it's not centered or
glitched<00:04:03.570> out<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.020> messed<00:04:04.170> up

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.370 

so<00:04:08.280> therefore<00:04:08.520> it<00:04:08.820> wants<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.120> go<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.300> the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
so therefore it wants to go to the

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.410 
so therefore it wants to go to the
right

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
right

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.000 
right
well<00:04:13.990> let's<00:04:14.170> mess<00:04:14.319> with<00:04:14.380> a<00:04:14.500> little<00:04:14.680> bit<00:04:14.800> longer

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
well let's mess with a little bit longer

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.030 
well let's mess with a little bit longer
let's<00:04:15.310> reset<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:15.819> see<00:04:15.940> if<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.120> fixes<00:04:16.299> it

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
let's reset it and see if it fixes it

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.470 
let's reset it and see if it fixes it
let's<00:04:18.040> go<00:04:18.190> ahead<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.340> try<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.000> skate<00:04:19.269> a<00:04:19.299> few

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
let's go ahead and try to skate a few

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.620 
let's go ahead and try to skate a few
more<00:04:19.570> trees<00:04:19.810> here<00:04:20.109> oh<00:04:21.030> that's<00:04:22.030> my<00:04:22.180> controller

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
more trees here oh that's my controller

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:35.130 
more trees here oh that's my controller
I<00:04:22.840> don't<00:04:23.169> think<00:04:23.410> it<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.650> but<00:04:24.450> could<00:04:25.450> be

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.170 

it<00:04:36.140> just<00:04:36.350> wants<00:04:36.560> to

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
it just wants to

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:47.860 
it just wants to
hop<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.930> lobster

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.330 

oh<00:04:47.960> my<00:04:48.590> gosh

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:01.700 

just<00:04:53.970> drag<00:04:54.180> them<00:04:54.300> under<00:04:54.510> my<00:04:54.630> skater

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.980 

okay<00:05:02.340> so<00:05:02.400> we<00:05:02.730> know<00:05:02.850> it<00:05:03.030> can<00:05:03.150> skid<00:05:03.510> some<00:05:03.780> logs

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
okay so we know it can skid some logs

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.430 
okay so we know it can skid some logs
now<00:05:04.770> let's<00:05:04.980> see<00:05:05.430> if<00:05:05.490> we<00:05:05.580> can<00:05:05.730> fix<00:05:05.940> that

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:22.080 

steering<00:05:18.230> okay<00:05:19.230> so<00:05:19.290> it<00:05:19.560> just<00:05:19.770> glitched<00:05:20.130> out

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
steering okay so it just glitched out

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.830 
steering okay so it just glitched out
what<00:05:22.690> in<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:22.840> world<00:05:23.050> is<00:05:23.199> right<00:05:23.440> here

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.180 

it's<00:05:26.380> invisible<00:05:26.680> barrier

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
it's invisible barrier

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.360 
it's invisible barrier
that's<00:05:29.670> odd

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.500 

okay<00:05:33.370> so<00:05:33.430> that's<00:05:33.670> a<00:05:33.730> pretty<00:05:33.910> good<00:05:34.060> skitter

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
okay so that's a pretty good skitter

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.630 
okay so that's a pretty good skitter
only<00:05:34.930> thing<00:05:35.080> I<00:05:35.170> seen<00:05:35.410> was<00:05:35.890> with<00:05:36.100> the<00:05:36.370> middle

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
only thing I seen was with the middle

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.410 
only thing I seen was with the middle
glitching<00:05:37.300> out<00:05:37.390> some<00:05:37.660> reason<00:05:37.840> and<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:40.180> claw

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
glitching out some reason and the claw

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.180 
glitching out some reason and the claw
wants<00:05:40.990> to<00:05:41.910> let<00:05:42.910> stuff<00:05:43.180> go<00:05:43.390> through<00:05:43.770> maybe<00:05:44.770> it's

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
wants to let stuff go through maybe it's

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.490 
wants to let stuff go through maybe it's
something<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.640> do<00:05:45.730> with<00:05:45.880> the<00:05:46.000> co<00:05:46.240> l<00:05:46.540> maybe<00:05:47.290> make

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
something to do with the co l maybe make

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.620 
something to do with the co l maybe make
them<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.680> little<00:05:47.770> thicker<00:05:48.120> that<00:05:49.120> might<00:05:49.300> help<00:05:49.510> a

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
them a little thicker that might help a

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.020 
them a little thicker that might help a
little<00:05:49.660> bit<00:05:49.930> hard<00:05:50.410> to<00:05:50.470> say<00:05:50.710> and<00:05:51.490> I<00:05:51.730> wish<00:05:51.880> it

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
little bit hard to say and I wish it

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.270 
little bit hard to say and I wish it
could<00:05:52.060> go<00:05:52.300> extend<00:05:52.930> out<00:05:53.140> but<00:05:53.590> that's<00:05:53.950> hard<00:05:54.160> to

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
could go extend out but that's hard to

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.710 
could go extend out but that's hard to
do<00:05:54.400> sometimes<00:05:54.640> because<00:05:55.120> then<00:05:55.240> you<00:05:55.330> start<00:05:55.570> mess

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
do sometimes because then you start mess

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.910 
do sometimes because then you start mess
with<00:05:55.870> that<00:05:56.020> then<00:05:56.230> you<00:05:56.320> have<00:05:56.440> all<00:05:56.470> these<00:05:56.680> other

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
with that then you have all these other

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.340 
with that then you have all these other
issues<00:05:57.570> unless<00:05:58.570> you're<00:05:58.720> a<00:05:58.780> pro<00:05:58.960> and<00:05:59.170> you<00:05:59.260> know

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
issues unless you're a pro and you know

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.840 
issues unless you're a pro and you know
what's<00:05:59.500> doing<00:05:59.770> then<00:05:59.860> is<00:05:59.980> probably<00:06:00.220> a<00:06:00.280> snap<00:06:00.820> of

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
what's doing then is probably a snap of

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.550 
what's doing then is probably a snap of
the<00:06:00.970> fingers<00:06:01.390> basically<00:06:01.810> you<00:06:02.080> know<00:06:02.200> not<00:06:02.500> that

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
the fingers basically you know not that

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.950 
the fingers basically you know not that
easy<00:06:02.920> but<00:06:03.270> anyway<00:06:04.270> I<00:06:04.300> hope<00:06:04.480> you<00:06:04.600> guys<00:06:04.720> like<00:06:04.870> my
