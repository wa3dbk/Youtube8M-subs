back on the marine automobile 455 engine

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.670 
back on the marine automobile 455 engine
build<00:00:03.179> you<00:00:03.570> can<00:00:03.689> see<00:00:03.810> here<00:00:03.990> I've<00:00:04.110> fitted<00:00:04.410> the

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
build you can see here I've fitted the

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.780 
build you can see here I've fitted the
windows<00:00:05.190> tray<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:07.250> a<00:00:08.250> window<00:00:08.490> tree<00:00:08.670> is

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
windows tray and a window tree is

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.000 
windows tray and a window tree is
actually<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.179> free<00:00:09.420> horse<00:00:09.630> parlor<00:00:10.110> taken<00:00:10.590> all

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
actually a free horse parlor taken all

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.430 
actually a free horse parlor taken all
the<00:00:11.130> oil<00:00:11.309> miss<00:00:11.519> away<00:00:11.700> from<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> crank<00:00:12.320> so<00:00:13.320> you

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
the oil miss away from the crank so you

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.600 
the oil miss away from the crank so you
always<00:00:13.590> want<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.830> try<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.040> get<00:00:14.250> one<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.519> these

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
always want to try to get one of these

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.060 
always want to try to get one of these
and<00:00:16.010> when<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.039> mounted<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:19.039> actually<00:00:20.039> just

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
and when I mounted this actually just

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.259 
and when I mounted this actually just
shim<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.430> up<00:00:20.570> 130,000<00:00:21.570> because<00:00:22.820> it<00:00:23.820> was<00:00:24.029> just

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
shim it up 130,000 because it was just

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.179 
shim it up 130,000 because it was just
too<00:00:24.390> close<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.869> rod<00:00:25.050> bolt<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.650> they<00:00:26.099> were

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
too close to that rod bolt and they were

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.060 
too close to that rod bolt and they were
touching<00:00:26.430> when<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:26.970> was<00:00:27.320> rotate<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> crank<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
touching when I was rotate the crank and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.410 
touching when I was rotate the crank and
now<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> got<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> crank<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> spin<00:00:30.119> without

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
now I got the crank to spin without

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.880 
now I got the crank to spin without
touching<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:32.300> here<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> melting<00:00:33.989> high

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
touching it here I have a melting high

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.740 
touching it here I have a melting high
volume<00:00:35.250> oil<00:00:35.430> pump<00:00:35.730> motor<00:00:35.910> down<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.420> made

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
volume oil pump motor down here made

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.119 
volume oil pump motor down here made
through<00:00:36.899> through<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> spring<00:00:37.410> wasn't<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
through through the spring wasn't it and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.389 
through through the spring wasn't it and
I<00:00:38.190> shimmed<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:38.879> three<00:00:39.030> washers<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
I shimmed it all with three washers and

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.440 
I shimmed it all with three washers and
actually<00:00:41.399> ran<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.940> my<00:00:42.030> old<00:00:42.239> engine<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
actually ran this on my old engine and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.670 
actually ran this on my old engine and
it<00:00:45.450> was<00:00:46.320> putting<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.649> sixty<00:00:47.750> psi<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.379> spoiled

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
it was putting on sixty psi and spoiled

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.959 
it was putting on sixty psi and spoiled
what<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.829> want<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.250> don't<00:00:50.309> want<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> go<00:00:50.640> too<00:00:50.789> much

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
what I want I don't want to go too much

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.189 
what I want I don't want to go too much

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
with that and you're just wasting

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.650 
with that and you're just wasting
horsepower<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.059> course<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.570> get

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
horsepower and of course you have to get

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.510 
horsepower and of course you have to get

a Melling pickup you can see I

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.400 
a Melling pickup you can see I
fabricated<00:00:57.000> my<00:00:57.239> own<00:00:59.449> fastener<00:01:00.449> pieces<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.109> it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
fabricated my own fastener pieces for it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.830 
fabricated my own fastener pieces for it
get<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.309> bolted<00:01:02.699> down<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.510> want<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> keep

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the pickup off the bottom of the pan a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.590 
the pickup off the bottom of the pan a
little<00:01:05.670> bit<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.090> don't<00:01:06.180> want<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.450> thing

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
little bit you don't want that thing

little bit you don't want that thing
laying<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> bottom<00:01:08.540> here's<00:01:09.540> my<00:01:09.689> oil<00:01:09.900> pan

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
laying on the bottom here's my oil pan

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:20.570 
laying on the bottom here's my oil pan
this<00:01:11.850> pan<00:01:12.150> used<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.659> look<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:14.780> that

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.040 

basically<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> did<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.170> they<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.440> saw

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
basically what I did is they just saw

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.840 
basically what I did is they just saw
that's<00:01:25.050> a<00:01:25.200> piece<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.590> metal<00:01:26.870> weld<00:01:27.870> it<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.850> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
that's a piece of metal weld it on and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.800 
that's a piece of metal weld it on and
then<00:01:29.970> weld<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.360> cat<00:01:30.600> piece<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.170> there<00:01:35.810> this

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
then weld a cat piece on there this

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
then weld a cat piece on there this
funny-looking<00:01:37.170> thing<00:01:37.410> here<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.000> different

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
funny-looking thing here is a different

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.660 
funny-looking thing here is a different
oil<00:01:39.180> drain<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:40.470> bottom<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.860> pan<00:01:41.130> sits

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
oil drain the bottom of this pan sits

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.540 
oil drain the bottom of this pan sits
really<00:01:41.790> close<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.360> hull<00:01:42.510> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.660> boat<00:01:42.720> and

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
really close to the hull of the boat and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.030 
really close to the hull of the boat and
you<00:01:44.550> can<00:01:44.700> take<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.090> oil<00:01:45.450> drain<00:01:46.200> plug<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.650> but

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you can take this oil drain plug out but

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.360 
you can take this oil drain plug out but
it<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.310> basically<00:01:47.880> pours<00:01:48.420> over<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.840> hull<00:01:49.050> I

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
it just basically pours over the hull I

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.210 
it just basically pours over the hull I
didn't<00:01:50.370> like<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.530> set<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.130> I

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
didn't like that so I set this up and I

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.260 
didn't like that so I set this up and I
was<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.490> draining<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.940> oil<00:01:54.000> through

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
was actually draining the oil through

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.970 
was actually draining the oil through
the<00:01:54.390> transom<00:01:54.870> this<00:01:55.530> year<00:01:55.680> I'm<00:01:55.770> probably

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
the transom this year I'm probably

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.320 
the transom this year I'm probably
actually<00:01:56.190> need<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> pump<00:01:56.790> I'm<00:01:56.970> going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.150> suck

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
actually need a pump I'm going to suck

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.690 
actually need a pump I'm going to suck
it<00:01:57.450> out<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.080> can<00:01:58.200> get<00:01:58.290> even<00:01:58.350> more

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
it out of here so I can get even more

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:07.660 
it out of here so I can get even more
oil<00:01:59.700> out<00:01:59.910> of<00:01:59.940> this<00:02:00.120> pan

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.040 

who's<00:02:08.670> inside<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.180> the<00:02:09.240> pan<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.690> was<00:02:09.899> actually

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
who's inside of the pan I was actually

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.270 
who's inside of the pan I was actually
running<00:02:10.380> this<00:02:10.649> oil<00:02:11.040> pan<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:13.160> border<00:02:14.160> with

running this oil pan on the border with

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.370 
running this oil pan on the border with
all<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.520> windage<00:02:14.850> tray<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.900> low<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:16.110> took<00:02:16.320> a

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
all the windage tray so low I took a

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.960 
all the windage tray so low I took a
plasma<00:02:16.800> cutter<00:02:16.980> cut<00:02:17.280> some<00:02:17.400> strips<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.820> it

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
plasma cutter cut some strips in it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.650 
plasma cutter cut some strips in it
reinforced<00:02:18.930> them<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:20.270> basically<00:02:21.270> hoped<00:02:21.570> that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
reinforced them and basically hoped that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.180 
reinforced them and basically hoped that
that<00:02:21.810> would<00:02:21.870> help<00:02:22.410> cut<00:02:22.680> down<00:02:22.710> some<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.070> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
that would help cut down some of the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.460 
that would help cut down some of the
windage<00:02:23.490> I<00:02:24.320> also<00:02:25.320> put<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> trapdoor<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.310> I

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
windage I also put a trapdoor in it I

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.730 
windage I also put a trapdoor in it I
mean<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.500> trapdoor<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:33.200> keep<00:02:34.200> all<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.590> oil

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
mean a trapdoor is to keep all the oil

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.730 
mean a trapdoor is to keep all the oil
in<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.070> sump<00:02:35.370> area<00:02:36.290> okay<00:02:37.290> we're<00:02:37.410> gonna<00:02:37.530> let

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
in the sump area okay we're gonna let

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.250 
in the sump area okay we're gonna let
off<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.850> doesn't<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.420> will<00:02:39.750> rush<00:02:39.930> into<00:02:40.080> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
off it doesn't that will rush into the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.800 
off it doesn't that will rush into the
front<00:02:40.850> this<00:02:41.850> got<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.300> straight<00:02:42.570> shot<00:02:42.600> now<00:02:44.810> you

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
front this got a straight shot now you

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.780 
front this got a straight shot now you
can<00:02:45.959> buy<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.110> pan<00:02:46.440> like<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:46.860> but<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.459> think

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
can buy a pan like this but I think

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.470 
can buy a pan like this but I think
they're<00:02:47.880> like<00:02:48.000> two<00:02:48.150> or<00:02:48.300> three<00:02:48.360> hundred

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
they're like two or three hundred

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.990 
they're like two or three hundred
dollars<00:02:48.980> basically<00:02:49.980> made<00:02:50.130> this<00:02:50.310> pan<00:02:50.490> free

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
dollars basically made this pan free

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.790 
dollars basically made this pan free
can't<00:02:51.900> beat<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.230> price<00:02:54.230> had<00:02:55.230> some<00:02:55.440> issues

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
can't beat that price had some issues

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.740 
can't beat that price had some issues

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
trying to fit the oil pan on here see a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.380 
trying to fit the oil pan on here see a
neat<00:03:01.650> little<00:03:01.740> modification<00:03:02.430> there<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.180> front

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
neat little modification there the front

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.460 
neat little modification there the front
two<00:03:03.570> stoves<00:03:03.810> are<00:03:03.959> actually<00:03:04.230> hitting<00:03:04.350> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
two stoves are actually hitting the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.320 
two stoves are actually hitting the
front<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.310> curvature<00:03:05.580> of<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:05.940> pan<00:03:06.150> was

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
front and the curvature of the pan was

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.020 
front and the curvature of the pan was
hitting<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.840> windows<00:03:07.170> tray<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:08.190> since<00:03:08.940> this

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
hitting the windows tray so since this

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.560 
hitting the windows tray so since this
is<00:03:09.090> marine<00:03:09.570> pan<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.870> had<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.290> luxury<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:10.650> just

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
is marine pan I had the luxury of just

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.840 
is marine pan I had the luxury of just
eliminating<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.720> whole<00:03:12.870> section<00:03:13.230> there<00:03:13.850> and

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
eliminating that whole section there and

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.820 
eliminating that whole section there and
now<00:03:15.180> my<00:03:15.360> assistant<00:03:15.780> will<00:03:15.959> test<00:03:16.200> fit<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.620> pan

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
now my assistant will test fit the pan

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:25.759 
now my assistant will test fit the pan
on<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.100> engine<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:24.120> can<00:03:24.600> see<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:25.590> lays

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
on the engine and you can see it lays

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.380 
on the engine and you can see it lays
perfectly<00:03:25.890> flat<00:03:27.890> she's<00:03:28.890> actually<00:03:29.070> up<00:03:29.250> about<00:03:29.670> a

run this motor my advice to you and that

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.960 
run this motor my advice to you and that
would<00:03:58.200> be<00:03:58.379> to<00:03:58.620> go<00:03:59.069> ahead<00:03:59.159> and<00:03:59.340> get<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.489> milodon

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
would be to go ahead and get a milodon

oil pump shaft they seem to have the
correct<00:04:02.459> size<00:04:02.790> pieces<00:04:03.409> and<00:04:04.409> I'm<00:04:04.560> just<00:04:04.680> going

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
correct size pieces and I'm just going

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.050 
correct size pieces and I'm just going
to<00:04:04.860> drop<00:04:05.010> this<00:04:05.069> in<00:04:05.370> now<00:04:05.519> I<00:04:05.549> had<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:05.819> take<00:04:05.879> the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
to drop this in now I had to take the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.830 
to drop this in now I had to take the
retaining<00:04:06.450> clip<00:04:06.659> off<00:04:06.840> because<00:04:07.349> I<00:04:08.840> couldn't

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
retaining clip off because I couldn't

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.210 
retaining clip off because I couldn't
put<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.079> in<00:04:10.230> from<00:04:10.409> the<00:04:10.500> bottom<00:04:10.860> because<00:04:11.010> the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
put this in from the bottom because the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.990 
put this in from the bottom because the
baffle<00:04:12.170> block<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.319> clip<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:14.220> simply<00:04:14.640> dropping

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
baffle block the clip so simply dropping

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.490 
baffle block the clip so simply dropping
it<00:04:15.090> from<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.269> top<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:15.930> get<00:04:16.109> ready<00:04:16.260> for<00:04:16.350> a

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
it from the top and get ready for a

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.500 
it from the top and get ready for a
prime<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:18.359> here<00:04:18.810> we<00:04:18.959> have<00:04:19.049> fitted<00:04:20.000> an<00:04:21.000> oil

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
prime and here we have fitted an oil

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.090 
prime and here we have fitted an oil
pressure<00:04:21.750> gauge<00:04:22.310> on<00:04:23.310> there<00:04:24.500> got<00:04:25.500> our<00:04:25.740> filter

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
pressure rise as I do this and

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.830 
pressure rise as I do this and
ultimately<00:04:57.180> when<00:04:57.300> I'm<00:04:57.389> trying<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:57.630> do<00:04:57.690> is<00:04:57.750> I'm

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
trying to get oil out all these push

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:12.000 
trying to get oil out all these push
rods

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.010 

all<00:05:13.010> right<00:05:13.160> most<00:05:13.310> of<00:05:13.490> them<00:05:13.670> oil<00:05:13.940> actually<00:05:14.690> all

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
all right most of them oil actually all

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.050 
all right most of them oil actually all
get<00:05:15.170> oil<00:05:15.440> a<00:05:15.740> couple<00:05:16.070> not<00:05:16.430> much<00:05:16.640> of<00:05:16.760> the<00:05:16.820> others

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
get oil a couple not much of the others

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.270 
get oil a couple not much of the others
what<00:05:17.660> happens<00:05:18.050> is<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.650> groove<00:05:18.830> in<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:18.980> lifter

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
what happens is the groove in the lifter

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.000 
what happens is the groove in the lifter
isn't<00:05:19.520> lined<00:05:19.700> up<00:05:19.850> with<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.180> oil<00:05:20.540> feed<00:05:20.810> hole<00:05:21.080> so

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
isn't lined up with the oil feed hole so

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.480 
isn't lined up with the oil feed hole so
I<00:05:22.490> get<00:05:22.910> it<00:05:22.970> was<00:05:23.180> clear<00:05:23.360> enjoy<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:24.020> song<00:05:24.490> and

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
I get it was clear enjoy the song and

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.740 
I get it was clear enjoy the song and
those<00:05:26.390> lifters<00:05:28.300> came<00:05:29.300> in<00:05:29.420> a<00:05:29.450> different

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
those lifters came in a different

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.990 
those lifters came in a different
position<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.350> then<00:05:30.710> continue<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.370> fry

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
position and then continue to fry

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.990 
position and then continue to fry
so<00:05:32.600> we'll<00:05:32.750> keep<00:05:32.930> a<00:05:33.140> high<00:05:33.590> in<00:05:33.650> this<00:05:33.890> rocker<00:05:34.700> arm

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
so we'll keep a high in this rocker arm

00:05:35.000 --> 00:06:01.170 
so we'll keep a high in this rocker arm
two<00:05:35.570> tabs

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:10.080 

it's<00:06:02.020> all<00:06:02.200> still<00:06:02.530> Scott<00:06:08.550> pretty<00:06:09.550> tough<00:06:09.760> to<00:06:09.910> fit

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
it's all still Scott pretty tough to fit

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:16.290 
it's all still Scott pretty tough to fit
that<00:06:10.210> oil<00:06:10.390> pair<00:06:14.700> watch<00:06:15.700> the<00:06:15.850> bit<00:06:15.970> on<00:06:16.030> the<00:06:16.120> water

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
that oil pair watch the bit on the water

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.250 
that oil pair watch the bit on the water
already<00:06:16.890> be<00:06:17.890> swimming
