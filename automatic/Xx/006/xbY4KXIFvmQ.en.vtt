I<00:01:48.030> took<00:01:48.179> and<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.479> compounded<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.349> with<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.590> new

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
I took and I compounded it with the new

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.960 
I took and I compounded it with the new
manzara<00:01:50.729> FG<00:01:51.239> 400<00:01:51.929> compound<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.789> that<00:01:53.940> I

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
manzara FG 400 compound and to do that I

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.809 
manzara FG 400 compound and to do that I
used<00:01:54.739> foam<00:01:55.739> cutting<00:01:56.009> pads<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.489> the<00:01:56.580> Flex

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
used foam cutting pads with the Flex

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.779 
used foam cutting pads with the Flex
3401<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.440> couple<00:01:58.679> of<00:01:58.830> places<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.369> used<00:01:59.580> the

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
3401 and a couple of places I used the

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.570 
3401 and a couple of places I used the
SI<00:02:00.229> 1500<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.590> reap<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.459> to

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
SI 1500 just to reap all just to

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.150 
SI 1500 just to reap all just to
make<00:02:02.729> sure<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.910> got<00:02:03.179> any<00:02:03.590> remaining<00:02:04.590> swirls<00:02:05.069> and

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160

scratches and any haze left by some

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.260 
scratches and any haze left by some
really<00:02:07.560> aggressive<00:02:07.860> compounding<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.849> did<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
really aggressive compounding I did and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.960 
really aggressive compounding I did and
then<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.899> went<00:02:10.170> over<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.649> with<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> finishing<00:02:11.760> pad

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
then I went over it with a finishing pad

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.170 
then I went over it with a finishing pad
with<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> SF<00:02:12.690> 4000<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:14.069> by<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.640> time<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:14.940> was

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
with the SF 4000 and by the time I was

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.059 
with the SF 4000 and by the time I was
done<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.510> did<00:02:16.140> chemically<00:02:16.620> strip<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.040> and

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
done I did chemically strip it and
