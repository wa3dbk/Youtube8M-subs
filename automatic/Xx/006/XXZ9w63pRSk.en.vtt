I<00:00:22.680> am<00:00:23.130> rubbish<00:00:23.640> at<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:24.960> best<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.859> tell

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
I am rubbish at it as best as I can tell

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.389 
I am rubbish at it as best as I can tell
you've<00:00:26.810> got<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.960> get<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.380> water<00:00:28.590> from

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.110 

wherever<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:32.790> coming<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:35.120> there

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
wherever it is it's coming out to there

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.920 
wherever it is it's coming out to there
I<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.570> you've<00:00:37.110> got<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.320> get<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.559> off<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.930> off

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
I think you've got to get it off the off

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.530 
I think you've got to get it off the off
the<00:00:40.260> screen<00:00:40.850> well<00:00:41.850> that's<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.270> seems<00:00:42.450> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the screen well that's what it seems to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.360 
the screen well that's what it seems to
be<00:00:42.660> anyway<00:00:43.020> I've<00:00:43.379> had<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.559> little<00:00:43.739> play<00:00:44.040> and

maybe you meant to get at a certain

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.100 
maybe you meant to get at a certain
distance<00:00:49.610> for<00:00:50.610> more<00:00:50.789> points<00:00:51.210> perhaps<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.930> don't

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
distance for more points perhaps I don't

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.970 
distance for more points perhaps I don't
know<00:00:53.270> but<00:00:54.270> I'm<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:54.899> good<00:00:55.680> at<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.980> clearly

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
know but I'm not good at it clearly

possibilities that's the word I'm

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:07.609 
possibilities that's the word I'm
looking<00:01:07.080> for

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
looking for

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.060

I don't know quite what the point oh I'm
supposed<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:12.030> go<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.210> certain<00:02:12.420> distance<00:02:12.720> am<00:02:13.230> i

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
supposed to go a certain distance am i

pipe<00:04:10.970> mania<00:04:11.420> I<00:04:11.870> remember<00:04:12.500> rightly<00:04:12.680> on<00:04:13.040> the

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
pipe mania I remember rightly on the

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.050 
pipe mania I remember rightly on the
acorn<00:04:13.580> archimedes<00:04:14.500> is<00:04:15.730> simple<00:04:16.730> in<00:04:16.850> concept

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
acorn archimedes is simple in concept
