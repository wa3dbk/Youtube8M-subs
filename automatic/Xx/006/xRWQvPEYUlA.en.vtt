job can you explain what we have here

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.609 
job can you explain what we have here
and<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.830> do<00:00:19.980> yeah<00:00:20.869> what<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:21.960> have<00:00:22.170> here

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
and what you do yeah what we have here

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.820 
and what you do yeah what we have here
is<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:23.250> moon<00:00:23.580> tire<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.150> what<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.140> do<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.380> try<00:00:25.800> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
is a moon tire and what we do is try to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.820 
is a moon tire and what we do is try to
develop<00:00:26.189> tires<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.630> act<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.230> airfield

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
develop tires that act like airfield

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.580 
develop tires that act like airfield
tires<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:29.970> don't<00:00:30.119> use<00:00:30.300> any<00:00:30.449> air<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.109> don't

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
tires but don't use any air and don't

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590 
tires but don't use any air and don't
use<00:00:31.679> any<00:00:31.830> rubber<00:00:32.040> well<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.450> on

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
use any rubber well so what we have on

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.150 
use any rubber well so what we have on
typical<00:00:33.960> cars<00:00:34.320> right<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:35.010> these

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
typical cars right now are these

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.799 
typical cars right now are these
pneumatic<00:00:35.700> tires<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.180> air-filled<00:00:36.570> one's

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
pneumatic tires the air-filled one's

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.180 
pneumatic tires the air-filled one's
kind<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.350> what<00:00:37.530> you're<00:00:37.710> seeing<00:00:37.890> here<00:00:38.010> on

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
kind of like what you're seeing here on

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.000 
kind of like what you're seeing here on
the<00:00:38.430> chariot<00:00:38.790> right<00:00:39.390> over<00:00:39.750> right<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.559> why

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the chariot right over right and so why

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.830 
the chariot right over right and so why
would<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.489> want<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.700> go<00:00:41.850> away<00:00:42.120> from<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.480> for

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
would we want to go away from that for

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.010 
would we want to go away from that for
lunar<00:00:43.230> exploration<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.940> guess<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.870> first

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
lunar exploration so I guess the first

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.569 
lunar exploration so I guess the first
point<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> manned<00:00:46.860> mission<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.370> can't

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
point is for a manned mission you can't

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.420 
point is for a manned mission you can't
have<00:00:47.760> an<00:00:47.879> airfield<00:00:48.210> structure<00:00:48.719> because<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:50.010> it

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
have an airfield structure because if it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.580 
have an airfield structure because if it
goes<00:00:50.579> flat<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.329> aborts<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.719> mission<00:00:52.140> okay

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
goes flat it aborts the mission okay

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.950 
goes flat it aborts the mission okay
good<00:00:52.860> point<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.520> tires<00:00:53.850> bad<00:00:54.180> okay<00:00:54.660> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
good point for that tires bad okay and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.229 
good point for that tires bad okay and
the<00:00:55.770> second<00:00:56.129> point<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.520> rubber<00:00:56.879> doesn't

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the second point is that rubber doesn't

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.450 
the second point is that rubber doesn't
work<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> moon<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.620> temperature<00:00:59.129> swings

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
work on the moon the temperature swings

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.240 
work on the moon the temperature swings
are<00:00:59.730> extreme<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:01.379> hot<00:01:01.590> temperature<00:01:02.070> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
are extreme and in hot temperature is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.429 
are extreme and in hot temperature is
rubber<00:01:02.489> soft<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.570> cool<00:01:03.780> temperatures<00:01:04.049> very

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
rubber soft and cool temperatures very

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.250 
rubber soft and cool temperatures very
brittle<00:01:04.739> okay<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.600> talk<00:01:06.810> me<00:01:07.049> through

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
brittle okay so can you talk me through

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.140 
brittle okay so can you talk me through
a<00:01:07.320> little<00:01:07.500> bit<00:01:07.650> i<00:01:07.680> mean<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.310> metal<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
a little bit i mean it's like metal and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.240 
a little bit i mean it's like metal and
plastic<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.110> kinds<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.470> cool<00:01:10.650> stuff<00:01:10.680> what

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
plastic and all kinds of cool stuff what

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.670 
plastic and all kinds of cool stuff what
do<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.549> here<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.869> work<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.290> some<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
do we have here so we work with some of

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.679 
do we have here so we work with some of
the<00:01:13.740> major<00:01:13.920> tire<00:01:14.340> manufacturers<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.509> is

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the major tire manufacturers this is

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.710 
the major tire manufacturers this is
this<00:01:16.049> happens<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:17.270> lunar<00:01:18.270> tire<00:01:18.479> we

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
this happens to be lunar tire we

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.840 
this happens to be lunar tire we
developed<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.830> partnership<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.310> Michelin

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
developed a partnership with Michelin

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.990 
developed a partnership with Michelin
okay<00:01:21.330> very<00:01:21.659> cool<00:01:21.900> they<00:01:22.140> call<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> tuile

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
okay very cool they call it the tuile

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.200 
okay very cool they call it the tuile
tire<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.270> wheel<00:01:24.450> nice<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:26.189> deforms<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
tire and wheel nice it deforms like a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.510 
tire and wheel nice it deforms like a
tire<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:27.990> requires<00:01:28.619> an<00:01:28.890> error<00:01:29.070> rubber<00:01:29.310> like

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
tire but requires an error rubber like

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.270 
tire but requires an error rubber like
we<00:01:29.640> said<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:31.680> looks<00:01:31.920> very<00:01:32.100> complicated

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
we said and it looks very complicated

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.390 
we said and it looks very complicated
but<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.420> actually<00:01:33.540> really<00:01:33.900> simple<00:01:33.990> okay<00:01:34.740> if

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
but it's actually really simple okay if

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.120 
but it's actually really simple okay if
you<00:01:35.759> put<00:01:35.970> weight<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.450> tire<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.979> outer

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you put weight on this tire the outer

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.760 
you put weight on this tire the outer
band<00:01:38.490> grows<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.270> these<00:01:40.049> spokes<00:01:40.350> go<00:01:40.590> into

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
band grows and these spokes go into

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.490 
band grows and these spokes go into
tension<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.570> amount<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.020> they<00:01:43.140> stretch

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
tension so the amount that they stretch

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.249 
tension so the amount that they stretch
is<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.520> amount<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.659> wheel<00:01:46.049> will

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
is the amount that this wheel will

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.350 
is the amount that this wheel will
deform<00:01:46.560> at<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> bottom<00:01:47.070> okay<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.060> deforms

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
deform at the bottom okay so it deforms

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480 
deform at the bottom okay so it deforms
like<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> tire<00:01:48.840> interesting<00:01:49.740> now<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
like a tire interesting now I have to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.130 
like a tire interesting now I have to
ask<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> serious<00:01:51.180> question<00:01:51.329> here<00:01:51.840> because

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
ask you a serious question here because

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.179 
ask you a serious question here because
you<00:01:52.290> know<00:01:52.409> when<00:01:52.619> we're<00:01:52.740> talking<00:01:52.890> about

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
you know when we're talking about

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.730 
you know when we're talking about
exploration<00:01:54.060> we're<00:01:54.600> designing<00:01:54.869> Rovers<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
exploration we're designing Rovers and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.620 
exploration we're designing Rovers and
space<00:01:56.040> suits<00:01:56.340> why<00:01:56.820> should<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.420> paying

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
space suits why should we be paying

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.160

particular<00:01:58.229> attention<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.740> designing<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.520> tire

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
particular attention to designing a tire

particular attention to designing a tire
well<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.500> guess<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.040> can't<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.430> vehicle

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
well I guess you can't have a vehicle

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.940 
well I guess you can't have a vehicle
without<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.420> tire<00:02:03.659> good<00:02:04.110> point<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
without a tire good point and on the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.530 
without a tire good point and on the
moon<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.430> can't<00:02:05.640> use<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.000> ones<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.329> have

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
moon if you can't use the ones we have

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.300 
moon if you can't use the ones we have
we<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.439> do<00:02:07.530> some<00:02:07.710> technology

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
we have to do some technology

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.139 
we have to do some technology
