route the BlueStacks application now so

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.850 
route the BlueStacks application now so
go<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.510> root<00:02:26.690> files<00:02:26.989> and<00:02:27.320> inside<00:02:27.709> it

go to the root files and inside it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.830 
go to the root files and inside it
you'll<00:02:28.010> find<00:02:28.280> three<00:02:28.550> files<00:02:28.820> over<00:02:29.090> here<00:02:29.239> now

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
you'll find three files over here now

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.270 
you'll find three files over here now
the<00:02:29.900> very<00:02:30.440> first<00:02:30.620> thing<00:02:30.769> that<00:02:30.860> we'll<00:02:31.070> have<00:02:31.190> to

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
the very first thing that we'll have to

the very first thing that we'll have to
do<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.610> you'll<00:02:31.850> have<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:32.300> stop<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.870> BlueStacks

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
do is you'll have to stop the BlueStacks

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.470 
do is you'll have to stop the BlueStacks
application<00:02:34.010> from<00:02:34.310> accessing<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.090> Internet

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
application from accessing the Internet

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.170 
application from accessing the Internet
so<00:02:36.019> right<00:02:36.590> click<00:02:36.709> on<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.040> BS<00:02:37.370> net<00:02:37.550> blocker<00:02:37.850> and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
so right click on the BS net blocker and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.830 
so right click on the BS net blocker and
run<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.630> as<00:02:38.750> an<00:02:38.900> administrator<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:43.750> then<00:02:44.750> you

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
run it as an administrator and then you

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.270 
run it as an administrator and then you
will<00:02:44.959> be<00:02:45.080> prompted<00:02:45.319> with<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:45.739> window<00:02:46.010> here

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
will be prompted with this window here

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.460 
will be prompted with this window here
on<00:02:46.400> block<00:02:46.880> internet<00:02:47.480> connection<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.290> that

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
on block internet connection so that

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.380 
on block internet connection so that
should<00:02:48.680> basically<00:02:49.130> stop<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.910> BlueStacks

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
should basically stop the BlueStacks

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.890 
should basically stop the BlueStacks
application<00:02:51.110> from<00:02:51.560> accessing<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.400> Internet

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
application from accessing the Internet

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.259 
application from accessing the Internet
so<00:02:53.900> now<00:02:54.019> once<00:02:54.320> that's<00:02:54.620> done<00:02:55.070> go<00:02:55.340> ahead<00:02:56.060> and

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
so now once that's done go ahead and

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:09.130 
so now once that's done go ahead and
open<00:02:56.720> up<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.049> BlueStacks<00:02:57.829> application

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.110 

so<00:03:10.140> once<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.590> BlueStacks<00:03:11.040> application<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:11.910> up

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
so once the BlueStacks application is up

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.940 
so once the BlueStacks application is up
and<00:03:12.330> running<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:13.110> very<00:03:13.380> next<00:03:13.590> thing<00:03:13.710> which

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
and running the very next thing which

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.470 
and running the very next thing which
will<00:03:14.070> have<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.280> do<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.670> you'll<00:03:14.970> have<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.270> go<00:03:15.420> to

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
here that is the BS multi-tool so just

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.190 
here that is the BS multi-tool so just
right<00:03:23.580> click<00:03:23.760> on<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.150> run<00:03:24.720> as<00:03:24.930> an

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
presented with this particular screen

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.440 
presented with this particular screen
over<00:03:34.560> here<00:03:34.590> now<00:03:35.459> you<00:03:35.820> will<00:03:35.970> have<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.120> select

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
over here now you will have to select

so<00:03:40.170> just<00:03:40.380> hit<00:03:40.530> on<00:03:40.650> 1<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:42.060> should

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
so just hit on 1 and that should

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.300 
so just hit on 1 and that should
basically<00:03:42.510> start<00:03:43.140> routing<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:43.830> BlueStacks

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
basically start routing the BlueStacks

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.120 
basically start routing the BlueStacks
application<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.330> your<00:03:45.390> computer<00:03:46.020> so<00:03:46.980> this

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
application on your computer so this

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.530 
application on your computer so this
wait<00:03:47.400> till<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.670> whole<00:03:47.850> process<00:03:48.180> gets

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
wait till the whole process gets

00:03:48.540 --> 00:04:00.910 
wait till the whole process gets
completed

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.740 

all<00:04:01.920> right<00:04:02.280> guys<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:02.610> once<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:02.970> done<00:04:03.239> routing

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
all right guys so once it's done routing

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.990 
all right guys so once it's done routing
the<00:04:03.870> BlueStacks<00:04:04.620> application<00:04:05.280> adjusted<00:04:05.819> on

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
the BlueStacks application adjusted on

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.180 
the BlueStacks application adjusted on
queue<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.780> window<00:04:07.050> will<00:04:07.170> close<00:04:07.200> now<00:04:08.129> the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
queue and the window will close now the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.890 
queue and the window will close now the
next<00:04:08.670> thing<00:04:08.790> which<00:04:08.910> we'll<00:04:09.030> have<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.209> do<00:04:09.390> is<00:04:09.599> in

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
next thing which we'll have to do is in

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.360 
next thing which we'll have to do is in
order<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.319> check<00:04:10.530> whether<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.950> BlueStacks

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
order to check whether the BlueStacks

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.970 
order to check whether the BlueStacks
application<00:04:11.940> has<00:04:12.120> been<00:04:12.260> successfully<00:04:13.260> rooted

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
application has been successfully rooted

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.960 
application has been successfully rooted
go<00:04:14.849> to<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.060> downloaded<00:04:15.540> folder<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:16.940> then<00:04:17.940> go

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
go to the downloaded folder and then go

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.949 
go to the downloaded folder and then go
to<00:04:18.299> root<00:04:18.900> checker<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:20.209> then<00:04:21.209> just<00:04:21.510> go<00:04:21.840> ahead

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
to root checker and then just go ahead

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.590 
to root checker and then just go ahead
and<00:04:22.160> run<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:23.430> particular<00:04:23.610> application<00:04:24.240> over

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
and run this particular application over

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.030 
and run this particular application over
here<00:04:24.750> that<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.169> a<00:04:25.199> root<00:04:25.500> checker<00:04:25.680> Pro

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
here that is a root checker Pro

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.590 
here that is a root checker Pro
application<00:04:26.699> which<00:04:26.880> would<00:04:27.000> basically<00:04:27.210> tell

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
application which would basically tell

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.450 
application which would basically tell
whether<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:28.050> BlueStacks<00:04:28.500> application<00:04:29.280> has

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
whether the BlueStacks application has

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.210 
whether the BlueStacks application has
been<00:04:29.490> is<00:04:29.850> successfully<00:04:30.510> rooted<00:04:30.870> or<00:04:31.139> not<00:04:31.260> so

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
been is successfully rooted or not so

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.129 
been is successfully rooted or not so
just<00:04:32.430> wait<00:04:32.669> till<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.030> installation<00:04:34.020> gets

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
just wait till the installation gets

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:41.920 
just wait till the installation gets
completed

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.510 

so<00:04:42.930> once<00:04:43.139> the<00:04:43.260> installation<00:04:43.530> is<00:04:43.860> done<00:04:43.919> at<00:04:44.310> the

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
so once the installation is done at the

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.129 
so once the installation is done at the
bottom<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.240> will<00:04:45.300> say<00:04:45.479> that<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.840> root<00:04:45.990> checker

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
bottom it will say that the root checker

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.680 
bottom it will say that the root checker
Pro<00:04:46.500> application<00:04:47.160> has<00:04:47.310> been<00:04:47.340> installed<00:04:47.690> so

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
Pro application has been installed so
