00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 welcome to my channel tacks diane 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.529
 white and go I'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.610
 a handbag and ipad case 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.799
 jaime personalized as you will see 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.799
 Personalized my bag for my initial 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.750
 The materials are 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:27.490
 a piece of leather of 34 and a half by 36 and 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:31.490
 half a piece of leather 32 by 10 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:36.110
 a piece of felt 34 x 36 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.620
 and the same color of the velcro leather and 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.620
 tacks 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.990
 I have decided to customize the closure with 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.890
 a name with the initial letter of my 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:54.820
 name this is the closing of the bag 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.690
 hand and I'm going to tack the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.060
 initial of my name is the s 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.790
 let's go through 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.850
 the drawing of the initial 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:10.920
 of the name with a pen trying to transfer 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.920
 the paper so that it is traced on the leather 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.390
 and we'll hit the tacks first and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.120
 then we sew them to reinforce it 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.479
 is already pierced now let's paste 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:28.130
 with textile glue one by one the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:31.810
 tacks just the line of the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.810
 drawing in the middle of the tacks 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.009
 and so one next to the other staying in the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.009
 half of the line of the drawing 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.090
 the glue we stick it right in the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.490
 center a small droplet 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.150
 and hence the hole remains 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.860
 fair 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.190
 in the same position as all 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.190
 tacks 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.180
 you see how it is 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.730
 we'll let it dry for half an hour and 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.550
 now we will proceed to make the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.280
 handbag 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.210
 let's make a hem to the part 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.670
 narrow of the bag a hem of a 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.030
 centimeter more or less we go to 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.350
 filleting to help us sew 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.760
 squeezing well with your fingers to give 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.909
 shape 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.379
 and we started to make a topping 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.379
 always at the beginning and at the end 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.190
 we proceed to do the same with the other 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.640
 side 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:54.170
 we have already made the 2 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.000
 narrow edges to half a centimeter and 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.720
 Now what we will proceed to do is 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.600
 put the felt with pins 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.490
 that is between the two 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:12.250
 the 22 flown between the hems 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:15.330
 we go first to make to fix 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.330
 felt to leather 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.340
 by the edge to half a centimeter 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.600
 we have already made what is the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.810
 leather and felt we will sew the 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.989
 tacks 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.270
 to reinforce and that with the management of 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:39.460
 bag do not fall 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:41.290
 lazcoz we have one by one if it can be 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.900
 twice 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.329
 good is already sewn by hand well 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.420
 reinforced now what we 're going to do is 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:53.180
 fold it right with right and put 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:58.060
 pins on both sides 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.060
 to be able to sew it and turn it over 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.239
 let's take it out little by little it will cost 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.960
 but we do it with patience and with the 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.950
 fingers to the end 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.960
 the corners we help each other with our fingers 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.960
 squeezing well or with something sharp 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.230
 we cut the final edge as far as the edge 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.290
 that we can to be able to sew 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.470
 let's cut the part of 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.470
 behind 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.490
 nothing to half a centimeter 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.000
 what we are going to do is put another 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.319
 glue textile glue and let's 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.659
 press so that it stays flat 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:53.479
 with textile glue and let's paste 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:53.479
 this is just pita from here 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.340
 and then we take it 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:03.600
 we put weight on something that I thought 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.360
 and let it dry half an hour 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.350
 let's go through a stitching for all the 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.860
 turn of the flap of the bag 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.880
 we measure that it is centered 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.390
 the two equal sides 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.850
 we put a pin 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.700
 well I decided that instead of sewing what 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.770
 I'm going to stick because the fabric is very thick 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.700
 double and with the felt and I do not know if my 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.700
 machine will endure 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.680
 we press well with our hands for 2 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.680
 minutes 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.389
 and let dry 10-15 minutes 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.830
 good is already stuck our lapel what 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.320
 what we have to do is put right 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.650
 with right 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.050
 in fact with right and we go to the steak 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:05.000
 ar both sides and let's sew 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.000
 to then turn it over 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.470
 I recommend that things slowly because 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.480
 being leather so thick if you have a 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.630
 portable machine like mine pretty much 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.910
 has already split two needles good since 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.700
 we are cutting the leftover threads of 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:25.030
 extremes and now what we have to 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:28.710
 to do is to turn around the turn 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.710
 that is right with right 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:34.149
 Now it's time to put on the velcro we've already given 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.149
 the return to the bag 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.210
 a handbag card for petero 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.210
 ipad for whatever you want 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.890
 what is needed is to put velcro 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.670
 up here and here we made a signal 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.670
 to match 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.750
 although the velcro is adhesive I'm going to 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.750
 put 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.760
 textile glue and special leather 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.220
 for what 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.500
 the adhesive is reinforced more 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:10.080
 we have to press two minutes the 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:13.139
 press velcro 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:17.099
 and leave it at least 15 20 minutes 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:19.430
 now we will stick the other velcro up 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:19.430
 so that 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:26.150
 well we have the bag a bag of 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.590
 hand 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.590
 and now we can close 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.960
 a bag for the ipad to tablet for 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:40.949
 of folder for documents documents 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.590
 magazines work things paperwork and 

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:45.969
 good if you realize to put the 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:49.540
 filter like that does not do like 

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:51.790
 like three departments 

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:54.930
 Well, if we want to use it to put 

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.930
 different things
