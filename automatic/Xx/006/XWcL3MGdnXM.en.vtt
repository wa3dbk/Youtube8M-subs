00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and then the tech dogs - canine units so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.400 
and then the tech dogs - canine units so
let's<00:00:51.329> see<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.809> if<00:00:52.020> there<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
let's see we can do if there is a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.080 
let's see we can do if there is a
specific<00:00:52.949> weapon<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.430> would<00:00:53.520> lightly<00:00:53.850> used

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
specific weapon you would lightly used

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.090 
specific weapon you would lightly used
in<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.600> future<00:00:54.870> video<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.410> specific<00:00:55.890> kill

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
in a future video on specific kill

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.920 
in a future video on specific kill
streak<00:00:56.340> simply<00:00:57.120> leave<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> comments

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
streak simply leave it in the comments

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.049 
streak simply leave it in the comments
and<00:00:58.020> I'll<00:00:58.109> try<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.320> get<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.699> problem

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and I'll try to get to it and a problem

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.610 
and I'll try to get to it and a problem
that's<00:01:00.210> hopefully<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> enjoy<00:01:01.260> today's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
that's hopefully going to enjoy today's

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
and well that pretty much does it

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.010 
and well that pretty much does it
because<00:03:16.550> in<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:16.760> game<00:03:16.910> your<00:03:17.450> score<00:03:17.780> streaks

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:27.360 
that don't stack up or kills to
essentially<00:03:20.350> you<00:03:21.350> only<00:03:21.440> get<00:03:21.650> points<00:03:22.100> for<00:03:22.220> kill
