is if you can see that see the looseness
in<00:00:33.390> between<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.989> two<00:00:34.230> pieces<00:00:35.190> right<00:00:35.730> there

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
in between the two pieces right there

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.590 
in between the two pieces right there
I'll<00:00:37.170> move<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.410> camera<00:00:38.040> around<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.399> little<00:00:38.489> bit

and you can hear it too that socket
inside<00:00:49.079> there<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.590> bad<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.510> see<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.690> top

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
inside there is bad and see the top

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
inside there is bad and see the top
there's<00:00:52.290> no<00:00:52.530> grease<00:00:52.920> zerk<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:56.150> made<00:00:57.150> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
there's no grease zerk so that's made to

turn<00:01:45.179> very<00:01:45.690> easy<00:01:46.190> another<00:01:47.190> thing<00:01:47.369> too<00:01:47.580> on<00:01:47.880> this

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
turn very easy another thing too on this

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.100 
turn very easy another thing too on this
wheel<00:01:50.369> bearing<00:01:50.729> talk<00:01:51.330> to<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> customer<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
wheel bearing talk to the customer and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.480 
wheel bearing talk to the customer and
they<00:01:52.229> said<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.740> there's<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.119> vibrating

vibration<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.090> front<00:01:57.390> end

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
vibration in the front end

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.710 
vibration in the front end
it's<00:01:58.590> very<00:01:58.860> high-pitched<00:01:59.430> vibration<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.450> I

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
it's very high-pitched vibration and I

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.620 
it's very high-pitched vibration and I
noticed<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.560> my<00:02:01.770> test<00:02:02.040> drive<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.579> if<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
noticed on on my test drive that if you

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.200 
noticed on on my test drive that if you
turn<00:02:04.290> into<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.619> steering<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.400> right<00:02:05.670> at

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
turn into the steering to the right at

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.020 
turn into the steering to the right at
about<00:02:06.540> 50<00:02:06.930> miles<00:02:07.110> an<00:02:07.290> hour<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:08.160> moving

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
about 50 miles an hour you just moving

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.400 
about 50 miles an hour you just moving
the<00:02:09.119> steering<00:02:09.390> wheel<00:02:09.630> back<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.049> forth<00:02:10.290> a

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
the steering wheel back and forth a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.949 
the steering wheel back and forth a
little<00:02:10.500> bit<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.920> usually<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:12.420> doing<00:02:12.810> that

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
little bit I usually like doing that

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.420 
little bit I usually like doing that
when<00:02:13.110> there's<00:02:13.290> no<00:02:13.410> traffic<00:02:13.470> in<00:02:14.010> front<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.370> me

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
when there's no traffic in front of me

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.400 
when there's no traffic in front of me
or<00:02:14.549> behind<00:02:14.579> me<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.120> could<00:02:15.690> hear<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.989> noise<00:02:16.110> get

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
or behind me I could hear the noise get

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.930 
or behind me I could hear the noise get
a<00:02:16.440> little<00:02:16.739> bit<00:02:16.829> louder<00:02:17.070> when<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.489> turn<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.910> to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
a little bit louder when I turn it to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.699 
a little bit louder when I turn it to
the<00:02:18.060> right<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.780> usually<00:02:18.959> indicates<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
the right and that usually indicates the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.920 
the right and that usually indicates the
left<00:02:19.950> wheel<00:02:20.160> bearing<00:02:20.459> when<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.150> loads<00:02:21.450> it

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
left wheel bearing when it loads it

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.530 
left wheel bearing when it loads it
starts<00:02:22.739> making<00:02:22.920> more<00:02:23.310> noise<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.880> we<00:02:24.299> feel<00:02:24.510> that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
starts making more noise so we feel that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.870 
starts making more noise so we feel that
there's<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:25.049> fit<00:02:25.380> wheel<00:02:25.860> bearing<00:02:26.160> failure<00:02:26.190> as

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
there's a fit wheel bearing failure as

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.120 
there's a fit wheel bearing failure as
well<00:02:29.030> alright<00:02:30.030> another<00:02:30.269> question<00:02:31.019> come<00:02:31.950> up

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.410 
what we do is we just pry that clamp a
little<00:02:45.269> bit<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.799> that<00:02:47.190> helps<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.670> kind<00:02:48.390> of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
little bit and that helps to kind of

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.640 
little bit and that helps to kind of
loosen<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.900> up<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:50.780> then<00:02:51.780> what<00:02:52.019> we<00:02:52.170> can<00:02:52.290> do<00:02:52.500> is

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
loosen it up and then what we can do is

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.300 
loosen it up and then what we can do is
we<00:02:53.579> take<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.060> spin<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.750> little<00:02:54.989> bit<00:02:55.310> and

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
we take and spin that a little bit and

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.350 
we take and spin that a little bit and
love<00:02:57.180> times<00:02:57.480> it'll

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
love times it'll

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.510 
love times it'll
it<00:02:59.360> will<00:02:59.510> fight<00:02:59.780> you<00:03:00.020> some<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.650> then<00:03:01.070> make

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
it will fight you some and then make

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.450 
it will fight you some and then make
sure<00:03:01.550> you<00:03:01.910> get<00:03:02.060> your<00:03:02.210> balance<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.840> pulled<00:03:03.200> off

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
sure you get your balance to pulled off

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.830 
sure you get your balance to pulled off
we'll<00:03:04.460> have<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.730> watch<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.120> other<00:03:05.210> side<00:03:05.540> too

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
we'll have to watch the other side too

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.320 
we'll have to watch the other side too
because<00:03:06.110> it's<00:03:06.290> going<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:07.790> piece<00:03:08.060> there

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
because it's going to that piece there

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.540 
because it's going to that piece there
has<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.900> go<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.500> other<00:03:09.680> boot<00:03:10.100> on<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.400> other

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
has to go to the other boot on the other

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.050 
has to go to the other boot on the other
side<00:03:13.540> all<00:03:14.540> right<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:14.840> here's<00:03:15.020> this<00:03:15.170> tool<00:03:16.060> inner

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
side all right so here's this tool inner

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.670 
side all right so here's this tool inner
tie<00:03:17.300> rod<00:03:17.330> in<00:03:18.610> socket<00:03:20.410> what<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.500> has<00:03:21.680> with<00:03:21.980> it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
tie rod in socket what it has with it

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.250 
tie rod in socket what it has with it
it's<00:03:24.680> got<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:24.920> little<00:03:26.800> insert<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:30.140> way

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
it's got a little insert and the way

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.590 
it's got a little insert and the way
this<00:03:30.470> unit<00:03:30.950> works<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.700> we<00:03:31.940> have<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.210> put<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.510> on

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
this unit works is we have to put it on

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.130 
this unit works is we have to put it on
the<00:03:32.780> tie<00:03:32.960> rod<00:03:33.230> end<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.650> then<00:03:33.790> this<00:03:34.790> thing

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
the tie rod end and then this thing

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.500 
the tie rod end and then this thing
clips<00:03:36.140> together<00:03:36.550> like<00:03:37.550> this<00:03:37.820> and<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.210> keeps

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
clips together like this and that keeps

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.790 
clips together like this and that keeps
everything<00:03:39.100> together<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:42.260> I'll<00:03:42.410> show<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:42.680> how

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
everything together so I'll show you how

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:53.020 
everything together so I'll show you how
that<00:03:43.130> goes<00:03:43.160> on<00:03:51.250> let's<00:03:52.250> take<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.520> straight<00:03:52.790> up

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
that goes on let's take it straight up

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:02.530 
that goes on let's take it straight up
and<00:03:53.150> down<00:03:53.180> here<00:03:59.380> this<00:04:00.380> unit<00:04:00.830> just<00:04:01.270> goes<00:04:02.270> right

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
and down here this unit just goes right

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:12.130 
and down here this unit just goes right
over<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.900> edge<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:11.030> you<00:04:11.180> could<00:04:11.330> see<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.840> just

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
over the edge and you could see it just

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:20.370 
over the edge and you could see it just
slides<00:04:13.100> right<00:04:13.280> over<00:04:13.459> it<00:04:14.140> nice<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.350> easy

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.070 

have<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:21.560> can<00:04:21.680> see<00:04:21.950> on<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.220> side<00:04:22.610> there

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.200 

there's<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.140> little<00:04:27.820> place<00:04:28.820> where<00:04:29.060> that's

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
there's a little place where that's

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:36.990 
there's a little place where that's
going<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:29.660> go<00:04:31.660> it's<00:04:32.660> hard<00:04:32.780> for<00:04:32.960> me<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.169> show<00:04:33.440> you

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.990 

right<00:04:38.000> there<00:04:38.330> little<00:04:38.630> tiny<00:04:38.900> hole<00:04:39.430> that<00:04:40.430> roll

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
right there little tiny hole that roll

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.680 
right there little tiny hole that roll
pins<00:04:41.330> can<00:04:41.630> get<00:04:41.780> pushed<00:04:42.530> into<00:04:42.770> place<00:04:43.130> there

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
pins can get pushed into place there

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.270 
pins can get pushed into place there
that'll<00:04:44.690> keep<00:04:44.720> that<00:04:45.080> from<00:04:45.290> backing<00:04:45.500> out<00:04:48.280> all

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
that'll keep that from backing out all

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.950 
that'll keep that from backing out all
right<00:04:49.430> so<00:04:49.490> you<00:04:49.760> can<00:04:49.910> see<00:04:50.120> that<00:04:50.300> pan<00:04:52.960> right

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
right so you can see that pan right

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.050 
right so you can see that pan right
there

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
there

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.900 
there
now<00:04:56.060> there's<00:04:56.270> trick<00:04:56.600> to<00:04:56.750> this<00:04:57.700> let's<00:04:58.700> show<00:04:58.760> you

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
now there's trick to this let's show you

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.650 
now there's trick to this let's show you
how<00:04:59.150> that<00:04:59.210> works

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.000 

all<00:05:04.290> right<00:05:05.840> we<00:05:06.840> take<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.080> little<00:05:07.350> sharpie<00:05:07.830> a

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
all right we take a little sharpie a

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.150 
all right we take a little sharpie a
little<00:05:08.730> white<00:05:08.940> sharpie<00:05:09.650> and<00:05:10.650> put<00:05:10.950> a<00:05:11.010> little

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
little white sharpie and put a little

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.900 
little white sharpie and put a little
mark<00:05:11.940> on<00:05:12.150> it<00:05:12.300> right<00:05:12.480> there<00:05:13.370> what<00:05:14.370> we<00:05:14.460> do<00:05:14.580> is<00:05:14.730> we

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
mark on it right there what we do is we

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.290 
mark on it right there what we do is we
assemble<00:05:15.270> our<00:05:15.360> tool<00:05:15.600> again<00:05:16.730> we<00:05:17.730> can<00:05:17.910> take<00:05:18.120> that

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
assemble our tool again we can take that

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.940 
assemble our tool again we can take that
back<00:05:18.540> off<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:21.150> we<00:05:21.270> could<00:05:21.420> take<00:05:21.630> this<00:05:21.870> unit<00:05:22.740> put

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
back off and we could take this unit put

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.970 
back off and we could take this unit put
this<00:05:23.100> in<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.400> vise<00:05:23.610> and<00:05:24.000> just<00:05:24.960> tap<00:05:25.260> that<00:05:25.530> just

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
this in the vise and just tap that just

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.890 
this in the vise and just tap that just
barely<00:05:26.280> it<00:05:26.490> so<00:05:26.700> it<00:05:26.760> breaks<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.180> surface<00:05:27.450> and

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
barely it so it breaks the surface and

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.530 
barely it so it breaks the surface and
then<00:05:28.020> you<00:05:28.680> get<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:28.980> on

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.910 

you<00:05:34.170> just<00:05:34.410> take<00:05:34.560> that<00:05:37.220> tap<00:05:38.220> it<00:05:38.430> flush<00:05:38.760> just

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920 
you just take that tap it flush just

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.340 
you just take that tap it flush just
like<00:05:40.920> that<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:42.300> we'll<00:05:42.390> go<00:05:42.510> back<00:05:42.720> on<00:05:42.960> our<00:05:42.990> boot

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
like that and we'll go back on our boot

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.980 
like that and we'll go back on our boot
and<00:05:43.590> we'll<00:05:43.680> be<00:05:43.800> ready<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.510> get<00:05:45.510> the<00:05:45.630> rest<00:05:45.840> of

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
and we'll be ready to get the rest of

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.130 
and we'll be ready to get the rest of
this<00:05:46.050> little<00:05:46.350> brain<00:05:46.500> you<00:05:46.530> put<00:05:46.800> on<00:05:47.930> all<00:05:48.930> right

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
this little brain you put on all right

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.130 
this little brain you put on all right
so<00:05:49.470> then<00:05:49.650> we've<00:05:50.190> got<00:05:50.430> our<00:05:50.990> clamp<00:05:51.990> here<00:05:53.960> we<00:05:54.960> just

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
so then we've got our clamp here we just

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.520 
so then we've got our clamp here we just
take<00:05:55.470> it<00:05:55.500> just<00:05:56.450> be<00:05:57.450> nice<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:57.960> easy<00:05:58.080> with<00:05:58.380> it

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
take it just be nice and easy with it

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.530 
take it just be nice and easy with it
and<00:05:58.650> just<00:05:58.710> squeeze<00:05:59.040> her<00:05:59.190> back<00:05:59.370> into<00:05:59.670> place

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.040 

that<00:06:03.540> should<00:06:03.810> be<00:06:03.990> good

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
that should be good

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.290 
that should be good
look<00:06:07.050> this<00:06:07.230> other<00:06:07.500> clamp<00:06:07.860> back<00:06:08.070> on<00:06:08.340> here<00:06:11.300> and

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
look this other clamp back on here and

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.470 
look this other clamp back on here and
then<00:06:12.540> we've<00:06:12.720> got<00:06:12.870> our<00:06:12.930> inch<00:06:13.410> nut<00:06:13.680> and<00:06:14.330> then<00:06:15.330> our

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
then we've got our inch nut and then our

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.970 
then we've got our inch nut and then our
new<00:06:15.630> outer<00:06:15.840> tie<00:06:16.140> rod<00:06:16.170> end<00:06:16.620> as<00:06:16.950> well<00:06:21.980> so

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
new outer tie rod end as well so

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.180 
new outer tie rod end as well so
absolutely<00:06:24.260> put<00:06:25.260> a<00:06:25.290> little<00:06:25.440> grease<00:06:25.680> inside

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
absolutely put a little grease inside

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.070 
absolutely put a little grease inside
that<00:06:27.680> then<00:06:28.680> we<00:06:28.800> can<00:06:28.950> get<00:06:29.100> that<00:06:29.160> to<00:06:29.580> where<00:06:29.700> we

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
that then we can get that to where we

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.880 
that then we can get that to where we
get<00:06:31.080> it<00:06:31.230> to<00:06:31.380> bite<00:06:31.590> one<00:06:31.620> thread<00:06:33.290> and<00:06:34.290> then<00:06:34.770> we

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
get it to bite one thread and then we

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.510 
get it to bite one thread and then we
count<00:06:35.630> when<00:06:36.630> I<00:06:36.750> pulled<00:06:37.020> this<00:06:37.170> unit<00:06:37.590> out<00:06:37.740> count

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
count when I pulled this unit out count

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:48.040 
count when I pulled this unit out count
of<00:06:38.610> 19

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.110
