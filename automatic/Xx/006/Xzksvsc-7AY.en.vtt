00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
something that we didn't want was

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.750 
something that we didn't want was
getting<00:01:44.189> more<00:01:44.340> physical<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.299> was

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
getting more physical as it was

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.000 
getting more physical as it was
more<00:01:46.090> of<00:01:46.180> longer<00:01:46.600> balls<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:47.170> INF<00:01:47.500> bus<00:01:47.710> scene<00:01:47.920> I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
more of longer balls and INF bus scene I

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.440 
more of longer balls and INF bus scene I
would<00:01:48.160> be<00:01:48.250> more<00:01:48.460> effective<00:01:48.550> in<00:01:49.060> that<00:01:49.210> role

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
would be more effective in that role

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.660

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.020 
reason today he didn't you know he
didn't<00:01:53.770> have<00:01:53.890> his<00:01:53.950> best<00:01:54.010> game<00:01:54.400> he<00:01:54.580> worked<00:01:54.820> hard

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
didn't have his best game he worked hard

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.640 
didn't have his best game he worked hard
but<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.450> know<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.930> wasn't<00:01:56.260> really<00:01:56.380> working

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
but you know it wasn't really working

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.800 
but you know it wasn't really working
for<00:01:56.830> him<00:01:57.040> that<00:01:57.160> well<00:01:57.340> we<00:01:57.940> there<00:01:58.300> was<00:01:58.390> no<00:01:58.540> space

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
for him that well we there was no space

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.960 
for him that well we there was no space
to<00:01:58.990> get<00:01:59.080> behind<00:01:59.440> him<00:01:59.590> today<00:01:59.950> so<00:02:00.790> I<00:02:00.820> thought

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
to get behind him today so I thought

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.170 
to get behind him today so I thought
that<00:02:01.300> would<00:02:01.720> give<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.140> better<00:02:02.970> give<00:02:03.970> them<00:02:04.150> a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
that would give a better give them a

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.940 
that would give a better give them a
little<00:02:04.360> bit<00:02:04.540> more<00:02:04.660> trouble<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.290> seen<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:05.710> came
