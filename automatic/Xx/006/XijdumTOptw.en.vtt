it<00:00:47.949> was<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.100> rough<00:00:48.879> playing<00:00:49.180> prototype<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.680> we

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
it was a rough playing prototype and we

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.160 
it was a rough playing prototype and we
pulled<00:00:51.100> stuff<00:00:51.910> from<00:00:52.210> every<00:00:52.480> single<00:00:52.660> game<00:00:52.960> we

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
celebrating from that point we started

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:18.600 
celebrating from that point we started
to<00:01:17.380> build<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.590> team<00:01:17.770> fairly<00:01:18.100> rapidly<00:01:18.400> and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
to build the team fairly rapidly and

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.030 
to build the team fairly rapidly and
look<00:01:18.820> at<00:01:18.939> our<00:01:19.030> technologies<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:19.930> Maya<00:01:20.500> is<00:01:20.650> one

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
look at our technologies and Maya is one

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.380 
look at our technologies and Maya is one
of<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.280> most<00:01:21.520> powerful<00:01:21.670> tools<00:01:22.030> in<00:01:22.270> the

wasn't<00:01:26.140> an<00:01:26.350> option<00:01:26.530> for<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:27.280> know<00:01:27.369> going

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
wasn't an option for you know going

wasn't an option for you know going
somewhere<00:01:28.570> else<00:01:28.720> we<00:01:29.350> use<00:01:29.380> Maya<00:01:29.799> for<00:01:30.930> almost

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
somewhere else we use Maya for almost

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.109 
somewhere else we use Maya for almost
everything<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:32.920> we<00:01:33.040> do<00:01:33.250> with<00:01:34.090> our

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
everything that we do with our

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.660 
everything that we do with our
characters<00:01:34.750> we<00:01:35.229> prototype<00:01:35.860> everything<00:01:36.430> that

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
characters we prototype everything that

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.429 
characters we prototype everything that
we're<00:01:36.820> doing<00:01:36.939> in<00:01:37.180> Maya<00:01:37.360> from<00:01:37.810> facial

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
we're doing in Maya from facial

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.340 
we're doing in Maya from facial
animation<00:01:39.009> to<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.430> muscle<00:01:40.270> deformation<00:01:41.020> and

animation to the muscle deformation and

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.950 
animation to the muscle deformation and
in<00:01:42.340> some<00:01:42.579> cases<00:01:42.790> we're<00:01:43.119> using<00:01:43.329> it<00:01:43.600> to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
in some cases we're using it to

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.149 
in some cases we're using it to
manipulate<00:01:44.799> textures<00:01:45.670> warping<00:01:46.329> movies<00:01:47.159> with

our swelling in particular we used

would pass damage data and drive our
blend<00:02:04.110> shapes<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:06.530> converted<00:02:07.530> those<00:02:07.680> two

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
blend shapes we then converted those two

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.460 
blend shapes we then converted those two
to<00:02:08.399> run<00:02:08.640> time<00:02:08.880> code<00:02:09.240> so<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.200> same<00:02:10.440> thing

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470

our new character get it in the game and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.580 
our new character get it in the game and
see<00:02:41.010> how<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.310> would<00:02:41.430> work<00:02:41.459> quickly<00:02:42.440> if<00:02:43.440> you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590

effectors in MotionBuilder and we would

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.069 
effectors in MotionBuilder and we would
put<00:03:14.820> an<00:03:14.910> auxilary<00:03:15.239> effector<00:03:15.660> on<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.870> wrists

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
put an auxilary effector on the wrists

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.830 
put an auxilary effector on the wrists

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
our properties on that auxilary effector

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.490 
our properties on that auxilary effector
to<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.820> course<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.209> punch<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.780> then<00:03:28.200> once

to the course of the punch and then once

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.830 
to the course of the punch and then once
we<00:03:28.680> got<00:03:28.829> that<00:03:29.010> data<00:03:29.489> into<00:03:30.360> our<00:03:30.390> game<00:03:30.660> engine

we got that data into our game engine
the<00:03:31.290> results<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:31.950> we<00:03:32.070> got<00:03:32.250> on<00:03:32.400> MotionBuilder

the results that we got on MotionBuilder
were<00:03:33.810> identical<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.590> what<00:03:34.709> we<00:03:34.799> would<00:03:34.950> get<00:03:35.100> in

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
were identical to what we would get in
