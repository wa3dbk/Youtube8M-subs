00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.860
 beginning here that the apartment of four 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.780
 rooms, but you also made a 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.060
 legislation that is good as he lives 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.320
 alone did not need to use the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.390
 four bedrooms 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.940

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.920
 It was worth the lens yesterday, and neither you nor the sound. 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.120
 rooms to make the office of the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.860

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.760
 this space is the yen 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.890
 this environment the most 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.650
 dark, more closed to make a 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.070
 environment to use a touch of 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.720
 colors on the cushions with a 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.900

 Exactly good. He's a person like me. 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.910
 I spoke very homely so he arrives either 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.600

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.590
 I convinced him he's using it on 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.810
 office and in his bedroom was 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.690
