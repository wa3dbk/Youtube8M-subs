00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.109
 the need to have natural materials 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.980
 It was born as part of restoration work on historic buildings 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.170
 the need 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.360
 is to use compatible products and features of 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.680
 those used in the past 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.530
 given the material means used at the time 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.530
 extremely natural products 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.250
 in most interventions 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.890
 the watchful eye of the superintendence for cultural assets insured damages 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.790
 used materials respect certain characteristics in the ingredients 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.870
 excluding a priori any material that would alter the balance 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.870
 of the whole 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.700
 another reason that has always given a strong push to search for products 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 more natural 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.740
 it is the awareness of the need to improve quality 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.890
 of life 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.180
 where we spend most of our time 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.760
 already for several years 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.200
 if there is ever more demand for biocompatible materials 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.190
 even in private homes 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.580
 until it becomes an added value in the sale of new buildings 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.160
 fassa bortolo has always operated at all stages of production 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.530
 in full respect of the environment and man 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.460
 for this reason a line of certified eco-compatible products has been developed 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.540
 by three authoritative European institutions 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.720
 the Italian in Naples the Austrian PB or the German IBM 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.750
 an important recognition 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.580
 which certifies full compliance you have the most rigorous criteria of the modern 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.609

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.219
