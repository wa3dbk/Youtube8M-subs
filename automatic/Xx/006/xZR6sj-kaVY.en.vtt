00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.530
 he 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.650
 my name is kevin alexis my name is 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.100
 axel nicolas kamel mathieu xavier i 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.100
 my name is tristan 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.510
 so in fact we are in a manger on 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.590
 so starts with shots 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.970
 obstacle course then 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.890
 so there are also zombies on the 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.020
 way is in the pocket we have a weapon 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.890
 at 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.480
 one to a date and a good gun I 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.190
 prefer the bat not what it is 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.190
 compared to the ford edge and habits 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.510
 I found it not bad a little man 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.930
 is interesting the gameplay with a 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.409
 good immersion 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.149
 a good sound 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.619
 good maneuverability a little bit 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.210
 rigid I have found yet for now 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.729
 but it's because we played only five 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.170
 minutes so excellent very good 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.090
 atmosphere but after it's hard to 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.159
 to get one with the ambient noise and 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.189
 top yeah that the airy atmosphere 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.229
 to be there and it will frankly there there 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.420
 did not have the atmosphere was it was already 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.209
 well scary the zombies are enough 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.250
 hard killed at health management 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.780
 all that is complicated enough for 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.619
 the moment not revolutionary after 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.310
 the atmosphere is really good 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.380
 transcribed the game there it's good 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.290
 to see thankfully that's good it's a 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.759
 beautiful graphics good it's a little 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.950
 crazy to take in hand must adapt 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.950
 a little but we will not change ammann 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.220
 went big but it's not bad at 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.770
 level of the gameplay it looks very nice 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.329
 we can watch 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.929
 finally there are phases of gameplay on 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.570
 the tablet at the same time as on 1 out 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.429
 the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.869
 the screen so the grip is enough 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.990
 difficult at first because we did not 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.880
 the usual really have two screens the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.530
 joystick with the touch pad on 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.970
 which we must watch the bag has not 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.360
 time there is an entire inventory 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.170
 the thing 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.090
 concretely the tablet it serves to 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.690
 the inventory it serves a switch and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.500
 weapon 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.120
 it is used to pick up objects you have 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.030
 a night vision you can and scan 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.070
 objects the piece of lukewarm water and 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.620
 codes to type for example look more 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.700
 at all what happens on the screen and I 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.680
 think there are two or three times we are going 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.510
 to be eaten must be careful if we 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.640
 must for example to change weapons on 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.680
 is forced to press the tablet 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.959
 so in the beginning if we are not used to it 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.830
 can be very complicated telling them 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.180
 in a slightly awkward situation after 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.780
 good I think it's a question 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.540
 usually 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.850
 I found it very wide at 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.740
 beginning 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.330
 it's a shot to take now otherwise 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.940
 the buttons are pretty well put 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.890
 the screen is nice it's ok the fact 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.510
 to have two like that finally the button to 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.280
 these customs officers c 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.870
 it's disturbing at first, but well, we're going 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.849
 get used to it I think it's okay it's like 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.680
 everything with nintendo we will not talk in 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:19.370
 resident evil 6 unfortunately that is 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.659
 for me an action game now may 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.280
 if I can compare it looks like a 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:26.209
 little to lead led who had gone out to 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.030
 beginning of the 360 do not really have a 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.650
 mood game 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.270
 really well it could please 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.390
 people who play ford but by 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.900
 against it is slower than the brothel 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.250
 after that is to see but I booked 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.310
 Thursday to book or so the pack are 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.450
 organic 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.430
 I'm waiting to see the other games but 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.380
 I think I'll buy it at least 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.900
 no i'm not waiting 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.000
 line up convincing enough for me what 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.770
 have I do not know yet if I'm going 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.450
 buy the wiiu but if i buy it this 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.710
 will be one of my first games I think 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.630
 that it's going to be a nice surprise for 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.580
 the launch catalog of the wii u 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.850
 it's going to be the game I think to have 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.850
 at launch 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.090
 Yes 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.090
 Oh
