the<00:01:56.670> master<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.119> gonna<00:01:57.299> undergo<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
the master is gonna undergo a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.240 
the master is gonna undergo a
transformation<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.100> thought<00:01:59.189> to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
transformation and I just thought to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.399 
transformation and I just thought to
myself<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.240> he's<00:02:00.689> not<00:02:00.899> badass

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
myself like it's like he's not badass

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.920 
myself like it's like he's not badass
enough<00:02:01.770> already<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.700> thing<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.240> huge

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
enough already the thing is huge

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.780 
enough already the thing is huge
he's<00:02:04.500> got<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.219> conjoined

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
he's got like this conjoined

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.999 
he's got like this conjoined
middle-finger<00:02:06.659> thing<00:02:07.290> that's<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.649> this

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
middle-finger thing that's like this

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.570 
middle-finger thing that's like this
long<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:09.060> know<00:02:09.239> he's<00:02:09.890> absolutely<00:02:10.890> terrifying

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
long you know he's absolutely terrifying

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.070 
long you know he's absolutely terrifying
look

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
look

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.350 
look
and<00:02:12.290> now<00:02:12.740> he's<00:02:12.950> gonna<00:02:13.100> go<00:02:13.310> under<00:02:13.580> some<00:02:14.150> kind<00:02:14.270> of

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
and now he's gonna go under some kind of

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.940 
and now he's gonna go under some kind of
transformation<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.200> become<00:02:15.440> even<00:02:15.470> more

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
transformation and become even more

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.490 
transformation and become even more
terrifying<00:02:16.700> I'm<00:02:16.940> sure<00:02:17.150> maybe<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.990> girl<00:02:18.260> wings

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
terrifying I'm sure maybe a girl wings

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.250 
terrifying I'm sure maybe a girl wings
this<00:02:18.770> time<00:02:18.980> or<00:02:19.160> something<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.700> don't<00:02:20.150> know<00:02:20.390> but

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
this time or something I don't know but

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.230 
this time or something I don't know but
definitely<00:02:22.190> am<00:02:22.400> looking<00:02:22.760> forward<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.120> the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
definitely am looking forward to the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.790 
definitely am looking forward to the
strange<00:02:23.510> season<00:02:23.930> -<00:02:24.080> they're<00:02:24.320> talking<00:02:24.710> about

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
strange season - they're talking about

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.930 
strange season - they're talking about
possibly<00:02:25.460> some<00:02:25.730> kind<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:26.240> pasta<00:02:26.600> some<00:02:27.260> kind<00:02:27.500> of

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
possibly some kind of pasta some kind of

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.340 
possibly some kind of pasta some kind of
thing<00:02:28.940> they<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.270> engineer<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:30.050> might<00:02:30.200> be

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
thing they can engineer that might be

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.350 
thing they can engineer that might be
able<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.590> infect<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.190> infected<00:02:31.360> possibly

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
able to infect the infected possibly

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.270 
able to infect the infected possibly
killing<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:33.350> know<00:02:33.470> spreading<00:02:33.890> between<00:02:34.010> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
killing you know spreading between the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.190 
killing you know spreading between the
vampires<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:35.030> killing<00:02:35.510> them<00:02:35.630> finding<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:36.020> weak

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
vampires and killing them finding a weak

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.350 
vampires and killing them finding a weak
link<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.560> their<00:02:36.680> biology<00:02:36.980> maybe<00:02:37.850> some<00:02:38.240> kind

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
link and their biology maybe some kind

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.790 
link and their biology maybe some kind
of<00:02:38.510> virus<00:02:38.810> or<00:02:38.960> something<00:02:39.140> that<00:02:39.380> would<00:02:39.530> attack

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
of virus or something that would attack

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.040 
of virus or something that would attack
them<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.340> would<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.030> affect<00:02:41.420> humans<00:02:41.870> so

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
them and would it affect humans so

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.650 
them and would it affect humans so
that's<00:02:42.290> probably<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.400> best<00:02:43.880> bet<00:02:44.090> in<00:02:44.240> terms<00:02:44.480> of

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
that's probably the best bet in terms of

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.240 
that's probably the best bet in terms of
ideas<00:02:45.050> that<00:02:45.170> there's<00:02:45.380> what<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.620> can<00:02:45.890> think<00:02:46.070> of

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
ideas that there's what I can think of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.000 
ideas that there's what I can think of
because<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.090> don't<00:02:47.270> think<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.990> now<00:02:48.410> there's

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
because I don't think that now there's

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.040 
because I don't think that now there's
something<00:02:49.460> like<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.820> zombie<00:02:50.210> apocalypse<00:02:50.300> okay

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
something like a zombie apocalypse okay

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.940 
something like a zombie apocalypse okay
could<00:02:51.230> probably<00:02:51.440> survive<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.830> zombie

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
could probably survive a zombie

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.580 
could probably survive a zombie
apocalypse<00:02:52.310> but<00:02:52.910> this<00:02:53.570> kind<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:53.990> apocalypse

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
apocalypse but this kind of apocalypse

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.110 
apocalypse but this kind of apocalypse
where<00:02:54.770> everybody<00:02:55.160> or<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.400> turns<00:02:55.700> into<00:02:55.880> these

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
where everybody or it turns into these

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.290 
where everybody or it turns into these
these<00:02:56.600> fearsome<00:02:57.440> grotesque<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.910> know<00:02:59.060> a

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
these fearsome grotesque you know a

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.810 
these fearsome grotesque you know a

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
really don't I really don't see the

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.190 
really don't I really don't see the
possibility<00:03:07.580> of<00:03:08.030> how<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.240> could<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:09.020> could

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
possibility of how you could you could

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.740 
possibility of how you could you could
make<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:09.470> out<00:03:09.560> alive<00:03:09.800> but<00:03:10.670> that's<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.630> know

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
make it out alive but that's it you know

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.170 
make it out alive but that's it you know
they're<00:03:11.960> not<00:03:12.080> really<00:03:12.410> winning<00:03:12.730> we<00:03:13.730> could<00:03:13.940> see

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.570

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
just just be careful because it's really

just just be careful because it's really
really<00:04:33.230> scary

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
really scary

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.880 
really scary
so<00:04:34.340> yeah<00:04:35.150> I'm<00:04:35.540> I<00:04:35.900> don't<00:04:36.080> know<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.470> exact

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
so yeah I'm I don't know the exact

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.530 
so yeah I'm I don't know the exact
release<00:04:37.250> date<00:04:37.310> they<00:04:37.670> haven't<00:04:38.000> posted<00:04:38.150> an

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
release date they haven't posted an

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.140

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
exact air date for the premiere but I

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.000 
exact air date for the premiere but I
think<00:04:41.420> it's<00:04:41.540> gonna<00:04:41.660> be<00:04:41.870> in<00:04:41.990> July<00:04:42.170> last<00:04:42.650> season

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
think it's gonna be in July last season

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.490 
think it's gonna be in July last season
it<00:04:43.100> was<00:04:43.160> in<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:43.760> was<00:04:43.820> in<00:04:44.060> July<00:04:44.320> so<00:04:45.320> that's

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
it was in it was in July so that's

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.380 
it was in it was in July so that's
around<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:45.980> time<00:04:46.160> I'm<00:04:46.370> thinking<00:04:46.520> hopefully

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
around the time I'm thinking hopefully

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.320 
around the time I'm thinking hopefully
they<00:04:47.750> do<00:04:47.810> it<00:04:48.020> before<00:04:48.200> fear<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.370> fear<00:04:50.150> of<00:04:50.210> The

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
they do it before fear the fear of The

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.520 
they do it before fear the fear of The
Walking<00:04:50.480> Dead<00:04:50.660> starts<00:04:51.170> because<00:04:51.320> they<00:04:51.380> don't

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
Walking Dead starts because they don't

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.570 
Walking Dead starts because they don't
really<00:04:51.650> want<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:52.040> don't<00:04:52.160> really<00:04:52.310> think<00:04:52.460> you

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
really want I don't really think you

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.610 
really want I don't really think you
want<00:04:52.700> to<00:04:52.820> compete<00:04:53.180> well<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.840> might<00:04:54.230> necessary

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
want to compete well it might necessary

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.440 
want to compete well it might necessary
it's<00:04:54.830> not<00:04:54.950> really<00:04:55.340> competing<00:04:55.850> because<00:04:56.000> you

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
it's not really competing because you

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.580 
it's not really competing because you
know<00:04:56.570> they<00:04:56.690> might<00:04:56.810> they<00:04:57.050> wouldn't<00:04:57.290> be<00:04:57.350> on<00:04:57.440> like

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
know they might they wouldn't be on like

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.150 
know they might they wouldn't be on like
at<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.860> same<00:04:57.980> time<00:04:58.250> probably<00:04:58.520> but<00:04:59.330> you<00:05:00.160> know

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
at the same time probably but you know

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.800 
at the same time probably but you know
just<00:05:01.430> just<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.760> kind<00:05:01.970> of<00:05:02.000> get<00:05:02.210> buzz<00:05:02.420> around<00:05:02.600> the

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
just just to kind of get buzz around the

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.780 
just just to kind of get buzz around the
show<00:05:02.990> in<00:05:03.110> that<00:05:03.260> but<00:05:03.740> with<00:05:03.860> FX<00:05:04.220> who<00:05:04.370> knows<00:05:04.580> this

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
show in that but with FX who knows this

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.190 
show in that but with FX who knows this
could<00:05:04.940> be<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.210> last<00:05:05.390> season<00:05:05.600> of<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.900> strain

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
could be the last season of the strain

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.650 
could be the last season of the strain
because<00:05:06.560> FX<00:05:07.400> just<00:05:07.700> doesn't<00:05:08.180> they<00:05:08.420> just

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
because FX just doesn't they just

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.420 
because FX just doesn't they just
unfortunately<00:05:09.380> their<00:05:09.590> shows<00:05:09.800> just<00:05:10.070> don't

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
unfortunately their shows just don't

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.250 
unfortunately their shows just don't
it's<00:05:10.820> not<00:05:11.060> like<00:05:11.180> HBO<00:05:11.360> where<00:05:11.840> people<00:05:12.080> pay<00:05:12.230> for
