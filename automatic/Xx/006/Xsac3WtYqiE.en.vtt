a little extra tip for being so generous

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.800 
a little extra tip for being so generous
so<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.820> reason<00:01:17.970> why<00:01:18.180> they're<00:01:18.360> doing<00:01:18.570> all<00:01:18.689> this

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
so the reason why they're doing all this

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.240 
so the reason why they're doing all this
is<00:01:18.960> efficiency<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.740> if<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.009> for

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
is efficiency but if it's for

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.960 
is efficiency but if it's for
efficiently<00:01:20.670> why<00:01:21.060> if<00:01:21.119> they<00:01:21.240> not<00:01:21.540> made<00:01:21.890> classic

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
efficiently why if they not made classic

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.130 
efficiently why if they not made classic
