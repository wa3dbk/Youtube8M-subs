martinet I like to start with the

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.190 
martinet I like to start with the
biggest<00:01:04.190> shapes<00:01:04.550> first<00:01:04.940> if<00:01:05.269> you<00:01:05.659> have<00:01:05.750> trouble

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.780 
step by laying over the olive green
layering<00:02:23.440> colors<00:02:23.680> instead<00:02:24.099> of<00:02:24.370> putting<00:02:24.670> on

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
layering colors instead of putting on

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.509

just<00:02:25.060> one<00:02:25.269> perfect<00:02:25.630> color<00:02:26.080> may<00:02:26.440> seem<00:02:26.709> odd<00:02:26.950> but

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
just one perfect color may seem odd but

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.699 
just one perfect color may seem odd but

the layers of color optically mingle and

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.740 
the layers of color optically mingle and

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
give the completed image a beautiful

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.740 
give the completed image a beautiful
glow<00:02:32.310> I'm<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.640> placing<00:02:33.849> in<00:02:34.180> some<00:02:34.390> darker

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
glow I'm just placing in some darker

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.720 
glow I'm just placing in some darker
green<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:35.290> brown<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.890> represent<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.489> trees

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
green and brown to represent the trees

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.090 
green and brown to represent the trees
in<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.000> distance<00:02:37.120> but<00:02:37.930> leave<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.230> few<00:02:38.590> areas<00:02:38.950> of

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
in the distance but leave a few areas of

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.390 
in the distance but leave a few areas of
green<00:02:39.340> showing<00:02:39.730> through<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.060> add<00:02:40.239> interest

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
green showing through to add interest

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.090 
green showing through to add interest
all<00:02:42.400> right<00:02:42.610> let's<00:02:43.000> add<00:02:43.239> some<00:02:43.269> dimension<00:02:47.100> and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
all right let's add some dimension and

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.339 
all right let's add some dimension and
yellow<00:02:48.340> we<00:02:48.850> do<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.269> because<00:02:49.510> shadows<00:02:50.110> are

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
yellow we do this because shadows are

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.960 
yellow we do this because shadows are
generally<00:02:50.830> cool<00:02:51.069> colors<00:02:51.459> like<00:02:51.670> blue<00:02:51.940> and

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
generally cool colors like blue and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.390 
generally cool colors like blue and
green<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.930> areas<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.500> sunlight<00:02:53.890> are<00:02:54.099> warm

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
green the areas and sunlight are warm

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.720 
green the areas and sunlight are warm
colors<00:02:54.910> such<00:02:55.150> as<00:02:55.330> yellow<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.110> orange<00:02:56.730> using

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
colors such as yellow and orange using

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.460 
colors such as yellow and orange using
these<00:02:57.910> colors<00:02:58.299> really<00:02:58.690> helps<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.349> create

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
these colors really helps to create

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.890 
these colors really helps to create
three-dimensional<00:03:00.459> look<00:03:00.610> in<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.819> picture<00:03:01.209> so

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
three-dimensional look in a picture so

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.050 
three-dimensional look in a picture so
half<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.319> fellas<00:03:02.680> nose<00:03:02.860> will<00:03:03.069> be<00:03:03.190> sky-blue<00:03:03.700> and

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
half of fellas nose will be sky-blue and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.660 
half of fellas nose will be sky-blue and
the<00:03:04.209> other<00:03:04.420> half<00:03:04.720> will<00:03:04.930> be<00:03:04.959> lemon<00:03:05.349> yellow<00:03:05.709> if

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
the other half will be lemon yellow if

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.759 
the other half will be lemon yellow if
you<00:03:06.910> want<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.180> deepen<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.630> shadow<00:03:07.930> here's<00:03:08.620> the

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
you want to deepen the shadow here's the

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.890 
you want to deepen the shadow here's the
dark<00:03:09.010> blue<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:09.940> will<00:03:10.120> be<00:03:10.209> much<00:03:10.630> more

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
dark blue this will be much more

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.840 
dark blue this will be much more
effective<00:03:11.380> than<00:03:11.560> black<00:03:11.799> because<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.760> black

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
effective than black because the black

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:20.210 
effective than black because the black
would<00:03:13.269> just<00:03:13.450> flatten<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.870> colors

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.160

back to the nose and on the blue part

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.380 
back to the nose and on the blue part
add<00:03:23.440> some<00:03:23.830> gray<00:03:24.099> and<00:03:24.430> add<00:03:24.610> some<00:03:24.879> peach<00:03:25.060> down

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
the bottom at this stage you can blend

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.970 
the bottom at this stage you can blend
the<00:03:27.790> peach<00:03:27.970> into<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.420> gray<00:03:28.599> as<00:03:28.750> well

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.500 

you<00:03:32.980> can<00:03:33.159> add<00:03:33.280> some<00:03:33.310> white<00:03:33.730> now<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.299> head
