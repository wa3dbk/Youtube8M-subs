00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
more of a smoky look rather than and to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
more of a smoky look rather than and to
find<00:01:28.979> them<00:01:29.250> hence<00:01:29.549> why<00:01:29.820> i<00:01:29.850> use<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.390> eyeshadow

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
rather than a liquid liner and yeah i

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.370 
rather than a liquid liner and yeah i
thought<00:01:34.799> that's<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.729> one

time using Mac's MSF natural I really

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.280 
time using Mac's MSF natural I really
like<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.120> powder<00:02:15.420> but<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.750> flies<00:02:15.959> everywhere

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
like this powder but it flies everywhere

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.860 
like this powder but it flies everywhere
and<00:02:16.709> less<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.860> use<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.130> small<00:02:17.430> brush<00:02:17.459> so<00:02:18.060> that's

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
and less you use a small brush so that's

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.630 
and less you use a small brush so that's
why<00:02:19.080> I'm<00:02:19.170> using<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.530> small<00:02:19.800> one<00:02:19.950> because<00:02:20.100> i<00:02:20.400> love

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
why I'm using a small one because i love

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.630
