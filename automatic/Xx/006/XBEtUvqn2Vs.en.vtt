00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.000
Our studio has been working in Versailles since 1983.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.000
In our profession, people are putting
labels on you pretty fast.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.000
Our work is strongly oriented towards 
sports facilities of all sizes.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:35.000
This includes recreation areas and gyms for schools, 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.000
or communities as well as much larger-scale 
facilities such as stadiums.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.000
There's one project, one site in particular that 
we have been in love with for quite a long time,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.000
namely that of the Stade Roland Garros in Paris.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.000
For Roland Garros, there's a special constraint
we do not encounter anywhere else:

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.000
the timeframe for the most important 
construction tasks is extremely precise,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.000
meaning that we must absolutely do them 
between two tournaments.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.000
We had to demolish 50% of the centre court, 
the Philippe Chatrier court, 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.000
and obviously had to reconstruct it for the next year.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.000
This is a high-quality job that needs not
only architectural development

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:29.000
but also a lot of organization work
with the contractors and the engineers.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.000
Everybody involved in the construction 
must be strongly motivated,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.000
well-organized and use cutting-edge technology. 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.000
Our studio made an investment in computer hardware
and software for the Roland Garros 2000 project.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.000
Before that, we only had a couple of computers 
but most of the work was done by hand.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:04.000
For the Roland Garros project to work in good 
conditions in a 10-month period between tournaments,

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.000
we had to do some very important studies,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.000
and we immediately turned to the Teamwork solution.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:24.000
Since the release of ArchiCAD 13 and Teamwork 2, 
we have been doing all our projects with the BIM Server,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.460
 which we now use as a flat filing cabinet.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.460
This solution offers many advantages: most importantly,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.460
the centralization of projects that are 
now accessible from every workstation,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.460
as well as the safekeeping of all projects by the BIM Server.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.460
As all the architects in studio were 
already familiar with ArchiCAD, 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.460
there was no need for additional 
training in the use of Teamwork.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.460
If you want to open a file, it's just like for a local file,
all you need  do is go to the directory dialog box 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:11.460
and open a shared file. At this very moment, 
you access the BIM Server database, 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.460
the project is opened and you can 
start working directly on the project.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:24.460
All you need do is start ArchiCAD, open the shared 
file which is then loaded into your workstation 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:32.460
with the server libraries, very simply: everyone 
can work on the tasks assigned to them.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:40.460
Once the project is opened, the work is very fast and is done 
in a classical way, just like with all ArchiCAD projects.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.460
And it's very simple, every time you do a "send and receive"

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:51.460
 you can view the virtual model, the plans, 
all the work done by the studio.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:59.460
This allows for complete synergy by working on the same project. 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:07.460
Better working together is not restricted to me

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.460
and my coworkers in the studio.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.460
This is meant in a much wider sense.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:21.460
Obviously, thanks to the server we call 
our filing cabinet, we can achieve 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:33.460
a spectacular speed and an amazing reaction time

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.460
with consultants, as we can be certain that 
we are working on the same project

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.460
and in the same direction. 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.460
Collaboration includes our partners, especially the consultants

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.460
who usually work on the different technical systems.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.460
With them, we use the DWG format for file exchange.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.460
The next stage for improving the collaboration 
with our different partners,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:14.460
including the consultants and ever increasingly 
the contractors, will be the use of the IFC format.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.460
I believe that this will add another dimension to our exchanges,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.460
since IFC also uses 3D.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:30.460
This was already possible with the DWG format, 
but it was not very practical to manage.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:40.460
I hope that the IFC format will really 
make a contribution to the virtual 3D model,

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.460
that this will help us optimize file exchange and improve the quality

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.460
of the projects we work on. 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.460
It goes without saying that the tools we currently 
have are extremely reassuring for the client.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.460
To come back for a second to the Roland Garros project :r

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.460
in Roland Garros, they play tennis, 
which is a sport where you need to eliminate

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.460
shadows on the playing field. Therefore, 
you need to know the exact time

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:21.460
when shadows will fall and which way they will be heading...

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.460
will they create shadow bodies that hinder the players?

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.460
That would be a real catastrophe!

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:40.460
If the players stopped coming, there would be no more 
stadiums and we would have no project to design. 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:51.460
The tools that we now have allow us the explain very clearly

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.460
to the client everything involved with the project and this.... 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.830
this helps us eliminate hours of endless discussion.
