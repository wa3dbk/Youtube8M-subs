00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
the rod not huge um when I make hollows

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.810 
the rod not huge um when I make hollows
I<00:01:07.370> start<00:01:08.180> with<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.659> disc<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:10.280> when<00:01:10.520> I<00:01:10.550> make

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
I start with a disc and when I make

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.100 
I start with a disc and when I make
disks<00:01:11.390> I<00:01:11.540> don't<00:01:12.350> want<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.650> huge<00:01:12.950> blob<00:01:13.310> I<00:01:13.700> want<00:01:14.690> to

just touch the tip of the manager of the
rod<00:01:18.260> to<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.650> mandrel<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.280> then<00:01:19.850> turn<00:01:20.180> away

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
rod to the mandrel and then turn away

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.710 
rod to the mandrel and then turn away
from<00:01:20.510> me<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.290> if<00:01:21.470> I<00:01:21.650> if<00:01:22.610> I<00:01:22.820> have<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.180> glass<00:01:23.479> at

from me and if I if I have the glass at

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.050 
from me and if I if I have the glass at
the<00:01:23.810> right<00:01:23.960> temperature<00:01:24.320> it'll<00:01:24.740> sort<00:01:24.979> of<00:01:25.130> cool

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
the right temperature it'll sort of cool

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.000 
the right temperature it'll sort of cool
as<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.659> turns<00:01:26.960> away<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:29.080> stack<00:01:30.080> up<00:01:30.350> into<00:01:30.979> a

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
as it turns away and stack up into a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.800 
as it turns away and stack up into a
disk

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
disk

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.139 
disk
see<00:01:33.710> there's<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.070> start<00:01:34.369> we've<00:01:34.549> got<00:01:34.759> a<00:01:34.790> disk

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
see there's the start we've got a disk

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.649 
see there's the start we've got a disk
now<00:01:38.439> I'm<00:01:39.439> going<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.649> make<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.799> second<00:01:40.369> disk<00:01:40.659> just

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
now I'm going to make a second disk just

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.749 
now I'm going to make a second disk just
about<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.500> half<00:01:43.369> an<00:01:43.579> inch<00:01:43.729> or<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.049> away<00:01:45.610> from<00:01:46.610> the

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
about a half an inch or so away from the

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.859 
about a half an inch or so away from the
first<00:01:47.030> one<00:01:48.820> you'll<00:01:49.820> notice<00:01:50.210> I'm<00:01:50.450> working

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
first one you'll notice I'm working

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.090 
first one you'll notice I'm working
underneath<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.950> flame<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:53.140> want<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.289> rod<00:01:54.649> to

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
underneath the flame I want the rod to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:03.429 
underneath the flame I want the rod to
stay<00:01:55.549> hot<00:01:56.350> not<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:58.520> bead<00:02:01.539> okay<00:02:02.539> so<00:02:03.229> now<00:02:03.380> we

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
stay hot not the bead okay so now we

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.289 
stay hot not the bead okay so now we
have<00:02:03.530> two<00:02:03.679> disks<00:02:04.340> that's<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.819> start<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.179> our

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
have two disks that's the start of our

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.350 
have two disks that's the start of our
hollow<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:07.610> what<00:02:07.789> I'm<00:02:07.940> going<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.179> do

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
hollow and what I'm going to do

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
hollow and what I'm going to do
basically<00:02:08.929> is<00:02:09.049> go<00:02:09.289> back<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.890> forth<00:02:11.380> adding

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
basically is go back and forth adding

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.539 
basically is go back and forth adding
rings<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:13.870> glass<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:16.190> each<00:02:16.370> side<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:18.549> those

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
rings of glass to each side and those

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.949 
rings of glass to each side and those
rings<00:02:19.970> are<00:02:20.360> going<00:02:20.989> to<00:02:21.049> kind<00:02:21.319> of<00:02:21.380> start<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.959> cut

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
rings are going to kind of start to cut

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:32.290 
rings are going to kind of start to cut
in<00:02:24.290> towards<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.980> center

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.460 

they're<00:02:32.900> starting<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.470> cup<00:02:33.860> in<00:02:34.270> now<00:02:35.470> you'll

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
they're starting to cup in now you'll

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.760 
they're starting to cup in now you'll
know<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:36.980> might<00:02:37.160> notice<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.470> blue

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
know you might notice that the blue

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.000 
know you might notice that the blue
color<00:02:40.100> was<00:02:40.490> really<00:02:41.300> coming<00:02:41.570> back<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.680> that

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
color was really coming back to that

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.370 
color was really coming back to that
first<00:02:43.280> disc<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.420> means<00:02:44.600> it's<00:02:44.750> really<00:02:45.110> kind<00:02:45.350> of

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
first disc it means it's really kind of

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.890 
first disc it means it's really kind of
cooling<00:02:45.740> off<00:02:45.860> maybe<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.280> little<00:02:46.460> too<00:02:46.580> much<00:02:46.970> um

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
cooling off maybe a little too much um

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.200 
cooling off maybe a little too much um
if<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.410> ever<00:02:48.530> have<00:02:48.770> any<00:02:48.800> cracking<00:02:49.250> that's

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
if you ever have any cracking that's

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.290 
if you ever have any cracking that's
okay<00:02:50.600> don't<00:02:50.990> worry<00:02:51.170> about<00:02:51.320> it<00:02:52.150> we're<00:02:53.150> going<00:02:53.240> to

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
okay don't worry about it we're going to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.440 
okay don't worry about it we're going to
keep<00:02:53.750> this<00:02:53.990> hole<00:02:54.410> bead<00:02:54.860> up<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.910> next<00:02:56.090> step

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
keep this hole bead up in the next step

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.080 
keep this hole bead up in the next step
and<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:57.110> lot<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.290> those<00:02:57.500> cracks<00:02:57.890> will<00:02:58.280> will<00:02:58.880> work

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
and a lot of those cracks will will work

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.070 
and a lot of those cracks will will work
themselves<00:02:59.300> out<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.490> don't<00:03:01.490> worry<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.930> it's

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
themselves out so don't worry and it's

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.470 
themselves out so don't worry and it's
also<00:03:03.230> okay<00:03:03.710> if<00:03:03.950> these<00:03:04.190> rings<00:03:04.850> you're<00:03:05.090> adding

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
also okay if these rings you're adding

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.380 
also okay if these rings you're adding
aren't<00:03:05.980> perfect<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.250> even<00:03:07.790> they<00:03:08.030> can<00:03:08.210> be<00:03:08.360> a

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
aren't perfect and even they can be a

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.310 
aren't perfect and even they can be a
little<00:03:08.600> wonky<00:03:09.640> we<00:03:10.640> will<00:03:10.940> kind<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:12.020> work<00:03:12.290> that

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
little wonky we will kind of work that

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.400 
little wonky we will kind of work that
out<00:03:12.770> in<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.160> next<00:03:13.460> step<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.240> I'm<00:03:15.020> getting

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
out in the next step so I'm getting

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.820 
out in the next step so I'm getting
pretty<00:03:15.560> close<00:03:15.800> here<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:17.150> layers<00:03:17.540> are<00:03:18.110> close

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
pretty close here the layers are close

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.600 
pretty close here the layers are close
to<00:03:19.280> touching<00:03:20.470> with<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.500> last<00:03:21.920> layer<00:03:22.220> what<00:03:22.520> you

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
to touching with the last layer what you

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.530 
to touching with the last layer what you
want<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.940> do<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.620> pretty<00:03:24.620> much<00:03:24.770> overlap<00:03:25.550> both

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
want to do is pretty much overlap both

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.500 
want to do is pretty much overlap both
sides<00:03:28.960> connecting<00:03:29.960> those<00:03:30.110> two<00:03:30.170> disks<00:03:30.890> and

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
sides connecting those two disks and

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.570 
sides connecting those two disks and
trapping<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.950> hot<00:03:34.250> air<00:03:34.580> inside<00:03:36.310> there<00:03:37.310> we<00:03:37.459> go

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
trapping the hot air inside there we go

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.949 
trapping the hot air inside there we go
so<00:03:38.620> what<00:03:39.620> we<00:03:39.680> have<00:03:39.830> now<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:40.670> we<00:03:40.760> have<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:40.940> wom<00:03:41.690> p

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
so what we have now so we have a wom p

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.940 
so what we have now so we have a wom p
hollow<00:03:42.410> glass<00:03:43.450> blob<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:45.500> we're<00:03:45.680> going<00:03:45.709> to

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
hollow glass blob and we're going to

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.460 
hollow glass blob and we're going to
kind<00:03:46.610> of<00:03:46.730> work<00:03:46.910> it<00:03:47.090> out<00:03:47.209> now<00:03:47.510> into<00:03:47.750> a<00:03:47.900> nice

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
kind of work it out now into a nice

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:57.230 
kind of work it out now into a nice
hollow<00:03:48.770> form<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.840> heat<00:03:51.110> up<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.440> whole<00:03:51.800> bean

get a nice even glow and what you're
going<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.670> see<00:03:59.910> is<00:04:00.090> those<00:04:00.650> layers<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:02.100> rings

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
going to see is those layers of rings

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.310 
going to see is those layers of rings
are<00:04:02.940> going<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.150> kind<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.510> melt<00:04:03.810> into<00:04:04.080> each

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
are going to kind of melt into each

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.410 
are going to kind of melt into each
other<00:04:04.680> you're<00:04:05.430> going<00:04:05.550> to<00:04:05.610> have<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.760> nice<00:04:05.970> smooth

other you're going to have a nice smooth

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.480 
other you're going to have a nice smooth
surface<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:07.800> glass<00:04:08.160> instead<00:04:08.670> of<00:04:08.790> ridged

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
surface to the glass instead of ridged

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.580 
surface to the glass instead of ridged
and<00:04:11.510> what's<00:04:12.510> going<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.750> happen<00:04:13.080> is<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.320> hot

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
and what's going to happen is that hot

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.130 
and what's going to happen is that hot

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
air inside that strap is going to kind

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.280 
air inside that strap is going to kind
of<00:04:16.200> push<00:04:16.680> out<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.480> expand<00:04:18.480> the<00:04:18.660> bead<00:04:18.840> just<00:04:19.170> a
