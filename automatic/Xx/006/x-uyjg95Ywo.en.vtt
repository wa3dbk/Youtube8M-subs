controlled dial is anti-tamper

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.440 
controlled dial is anti-tamper
which<00:02:44.280> means<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.880> will<00:02:44.970> need<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> small

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
which means you will need a small

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.590 
which means you will need a small
flat-head<00:02:45.930> screwdriver<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:47.100> adjust<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.670> the

flat-head screwdriver to adjust it the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.690 
flat-head screwdriver to adjust it the
reason<00:02:49.050> for<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.340> temperature

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
reason for this is that the temperature

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.550 
reason for this is that the temperature
