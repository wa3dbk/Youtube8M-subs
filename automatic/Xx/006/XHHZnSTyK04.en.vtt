00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.109
 another ball into 2 video today show 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:23.789
 I give him the first speaking weapon 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:25.830
 the shotgun 13 40 and that must 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.300
 her for the second time in the blue chips 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.519
 Stronghold then feel right in the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.929
 At the beginning of this broken core 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.780
 world, ask here in this 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.579
 use constrictor what you see me 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.239
 play with the mac moments with the new ones 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.399
 class 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.739
 I wanted to explain but I have 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.610
 around the last week to the video 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.460
 but this was only recorded on the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.930
 friday comes friday afternoon there will be 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.789
 the next last where I come 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.860
 talked about the micro menzer 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.969
 and the archive picture so you wonder 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.120
 not if somehow something 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.800
 twice asml tells the core of a 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.210
 Developers how effective that in one 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.210
 solo picture can work 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.710
 the character is a little bit small 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.150
 died quickly 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.840
 that's because the culprit is over 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.360
 my experience points once 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.400
 128 that constantly increases when I mean mine 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.410
 magazine teaching or an opponent led 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.930
 and that's the archive grab and me 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.560
 get packed per anarchy 17 5 percent 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.860
 but more losers hurt 1.75 percent 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.680
 accuracy have a Scottish sword 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.180
 is just now not so well trained that 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.950
 best method the best things i do 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.020
 until now has really found the jobs 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.510
 the manual weapons where the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.140
 fire rate control yourself like 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.060
 revolver go so so has the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.340
 opponents here are now colorless and level 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.930
 12 So I'm a little bit level too 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.410
 but saw how fast this one 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.060
 constructor died and think 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.590
 if you find a revolver 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.300
 celebrated manually then where you can then 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.520
