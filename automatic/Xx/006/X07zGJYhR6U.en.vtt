00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.150
 good guys are always 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.990
 Alessandro is due in this new 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:40.150
 video was a nice little comforting let's say 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.290
 with with my video frequency is 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.230
 just a bit that we didn't feel 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.170
 because I had a little to do 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.100
 now, however, today I am back with 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.989
 this beautiful contest so I never had 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.300
 made a similar contest on my channel 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.519
 what we usually always like 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.550
 many because as already because if well 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.610
 read both from the title and from these 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.820
 images now I will give away 2,500 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.000
 what anyway without losing last 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.270
 example in chat then the prize 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.890
 2,500 gold so I'll be back on the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.080
 winner via kit shop 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.120
 so when I will make a winner then 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.210
 through the tool his nickname in the 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.090
 shop of world of tanks 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.650
 I will give these 2,500 cultured we pass now 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.450
 to the rules that are very much 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.700
 simple the first is absolutely that 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.950
 to join the channel put a nice one 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.600
 I like this video and share it 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.909
 write in the comments you participate 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.710
 these are basic things you need 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.930
 to do otherwise if perhaps the winner 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.720
 I see that in any case he is not registered with 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.430
 channel we do not say I will not give away 25 goals 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.810
 from him and I will therefore have to choose one 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.880
 another therefore absolutely fundamental 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.729
 to register just to like it 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.810
 share 6 especially also write 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.830
 in the comments you take then 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.680
 write me with below if you want 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.350
 of course you have to write 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.660
 I participate and your name at stake in 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.080
 world of tanks so m then it is me more 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.170
 convenient maybe to contact you in game for 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.680
 however, make checks also for 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.180
 your name and in case you will succeed in 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.420
 win the contest just to give you 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.350
 of gold so write me and I will participate in the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.710
 your name 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.670
 on word stakes 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:37.210
 like how to win now then I have 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.890
 thought a little and at the end rather than 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.100
 make a contest in which we maybe press 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.960
 the best game is the most game 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.610
 strange things like that that are more or 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.860
 all less subjective things so maybe 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.480
 one could tell me the game in my opinion 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.790
 which choice was not the best better 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.800
 among other things, I decided to do a contest 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:00.220
 how can you read that will reward who among 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.030
 the greatest number of damages therefore 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.590
 you have to send me via mp on youtube via 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.120
 personal message on youtube for whom 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.630
 did not know how to do just go to 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.760
 my channel press information or about 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.620
 I don't know why some channels are in 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.040
 English other Italian however I have 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.240
 information about the last card that 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.650
 both in the canal 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.720
 and at this point via message 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.610
 private 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.480
 I recommend you write to me in the subject 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.520
 of the message we say instead 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.340
 concerns the col des because many mi 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.750
 write 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.209
 maybe they don't put the object they write 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.220
 things at random I do not struggle to 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.660
 then be able to find the messages that 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.110
 concern the contest uncomfortable 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.790
 so write me in the object maybe 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.380
 with 2500 things it is obviously in the body 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.560
 of the message and you have to put the link 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.390
 to the replay of the game in which you do more 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.570
 damage and the end screenshot 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.600
 battle of course of that game 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.570
 where you see the damage you have done 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.840
 so this is something we say 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.400
 objective, that is to say, it presses that it has done 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.330
 the most damage cannot be done 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.519
 there can be no mistakes in form 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.560
 disputes or other things the only one 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.380
 could be if maybe one remit 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.250
 I know a game with a level 3 makes a 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.550
 Number for disproportionate number of damages 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.900
 to still be level 3 maybe 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.760
 another, instead, improves with a 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.080
 level 10 with lots of damage but in 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.460
 higher proportion than the level 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.310
 3 I will ask you anyway 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.560
 according to you then which of the two would be 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.030
 to reward but maybe it wo n't happen 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.520
 not even this thing then and do 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.160
 a hypothesis because he knew how to do it 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.810
 send me replay link just replay it 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.930
 found inside the world of folder 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.699
 tanks fairplace just load it up 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.400
 some site which 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.690
 mediafire or various sites are some sites 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.470
 share upload 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.810
 etc. etc. same thing for him 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.360
 screenshot only loaded on tinypic 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.979
 imageshack all professor here 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.800
 or maybe you put it in a file and 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.840
 various together with the replay in short, everything 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.940
 what I would say that I have nothing else to say 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.460
 then there is no real date 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.139
 end of the contest will end up about 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.240
 first week of November but of leather 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.120
 when you trade send me replays 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.919
 and imagine then I close the count if 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.949
 then the exams is not declared on 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.949
 winner 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.990
 only the games with the patch are valid 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.330
 current or to 8.8 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.970
 because otherwise I would have a bit of a problem 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.030
 being able to open old replays with 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:44.539
 those old patches then fit 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.220
 all the play with the 8.8 said this of 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.110
 Pretension release participated in 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.060
 many lived however you can win 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.060
 2,500 gold and the next
