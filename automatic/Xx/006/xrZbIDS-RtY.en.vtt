 we continue in a 20 in the province of 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.730
 almería you know that for 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.550
 quite time zero wave and antenna 3 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.769
 are immersed we are in a campaign 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.530
 that is called ponlefreno to try 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.529
 prevent accidents or minimize their 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.289
 effects and that every Monday here on 'wave 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.430
 zero ' in the province of almería 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.900
 we try to help in the measure of 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.910
 our possibilities always with the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.439
 presence of ricardo german police 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.210
 local in roquetas to which we are going to 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.890
 say hello ricardo good afternoon hello 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.630
 good afternoon if you want you can 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.180
 consult besides what we say here 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.020
 other information in your profile in 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.880
 Facebook 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.430
 Roquetas de Mar road education can 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.969
 request the friendship and there are already enough 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.700
 more than 1200 friends and also on a blog 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.059
 educate and roquetas dot blogspot.com 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.010
 today ricardo if you think we talk about the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.960
 let's name it so that all the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.690
 world understand us and ccoo plates that are 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.550
 acrylic license plates not the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.440
 Metals that are already on the market 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.300
 even some vehicles already bring them 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.010
 they are not called eco plates because they have 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.120
 a series of advantages among others are 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.700
 more ecological for example are 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.360
 recyclable but that contribute more besides 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.880
 of it 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.720
 good the main function as for 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.780
 road safety 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.200
 they do not present edges the songs are 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.870
 rounded and on issues of accidents with 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.800
 pedestrians are not going to produce cuts 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:28.480
 that is the most important function in 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.480
 how much to measure safety 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.190
 we have commented well has commented are 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.630
 Ecological plates because they are 100% 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.010
 recyclables has a longer duration and 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.800
 also for example they have higher 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.590
 duration and they are flexible what makes 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.810
 at the time of having a stroke also a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.970
 accident plate 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.100
 last longer even protect the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.049
 bumpers there will be few vehicles that 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.340
 but will take what is imposed in 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.530
 here to a more or less near future yes 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.469
 been homologous already by the ministry of 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.500
 industry and in fact there are already enough 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.030
 brands that start them starts at 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.490
 register vehicles with these 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.470
 plates and yes no 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.390
 you can do it for a price 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.550
 approximately about twenty euros or 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.970
 be it arrives at the dealership 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.720
 Acrylic eco plates today with license plates 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.360
 and with license plates 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.500
 and the advantage is the same as 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.930
 others means 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.910
 equally reflective and have to 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.200
 see yourself and all that are not or are 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.640
 approved by the Ministry of 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.380
 industry so they have the same 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.160
 other features as 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.650
 to the visibility and measures of 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.540
 the numbering of the letters with the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.240
 advantage that they are recyclable and that they are 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.240
 safer and the issue of recycling makes 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.830
 you have to see what many are enrolled 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.510
 vehicles out of the year and also it 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.510
 they destroy a lot at the time of 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.640
 of waste recycling this is not going 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.340
 to be the same a metal plate that 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.110
 we are going to greet today also to 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.450
 Alejandro Díaz, firefighters of the consortium 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.650
 from the west that visits the studios 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.870
 alexander good afternoon to you too 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.120
 some things that you're not going to talk about 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.300
 license plates but yes of something very 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.590
 important that fire extinguishers are almost 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.700
 everybody buy a gadget that 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.530
 you find the store puts it in the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.060
 Car trunk takes them a lot 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.340
 time there because maybe you do not need 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.340
 use it and when will you do it or not 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.390
 it's fine or it's expired or it's not 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.000
 enough because he has bought it 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.860
 too small or not the one 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.680
 you need because maybe you need another 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.650
 kind of foam I do not know if you give us your 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.280
 keys then with the type of fire extinguishers 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.110
 that there is right now for the subject of 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.150
 It leads one personal capacity within 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.670
 the vehicles is difficult is difficult 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.560
 because he really utilizes that 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.350
 you can give that kind of extinguishers 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.190
 it's in a burst of incipient fire 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.420
 at the moment that is occurring 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.430
 at the moment that a fire that already 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.220
 is fed and has certain 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.590
 dimensions for the same capacity 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.390
 strict agent that he has then we are 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.940
 is going to be short, so what do you 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.040
 you recommend that we empty it if there is 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.880
 use them in the empty 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.190
 completely not in the protocols of 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.640
 performance when using fire extinguishers 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.810
 a compression vessel that 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.220
 project extinguishing agents as in 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.160
 this case the margins made that 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.050
 are the dust sometimes the protocol in 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.020
 this type of actions 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.450
 the extinct is not to dose it when it 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.850
 initiates the extinguishing action is emptied 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.370
 the extinct completely do not think that 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.740
 let's economize by spending only half 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.310
 extinct because at the time it was 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.710
 remove the safety pin is extinct 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.120
 already there you have to change it whole there 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.610
 to change the whole load 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.040
 and put both the gas charge and the 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.400
 load of red agents then what 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.949
 Convenient would be the loading capacity 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.720
 that was a little bit superior to what 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.330
 it looks like that because there are times 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.389
 we found extinguishers that are medium 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.419
 kilo or one kilo and think that in the 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.669
 houses for example the red ones the most 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.070
 are 6 kilos of 8 kilos in 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.500
 a vehicle by the type of materials 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.270
 that are going to come out burning good they are 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.740
 of dust is sometimes the most 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.840
 convenient 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.610
 on the subject that we were previously 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.099
 trying on hybrid cars for 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.720
 example, maybe they would be more 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.599
 convenient the kind of different that 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.630
 were from co2 because of the effect that 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.699
 it produces and then the damage that you can 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.360
 that foam that dust when it 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.819
 solidifies in electrical equipment because the 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.620
 devastating is not good carries a fire extinguisher 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:48.680
 does not carry an extinguisher is a decision 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.150
 quite personal if one believes that 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.639
 he's safer carrying a fire extinguisher 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:56.720
 perfect but we have to have it right 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.860
 clear that the extinct the most important thing 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.490
 is the amount of charge from which 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.479
 let's have red agents then 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.470
 retaking the initial theme that we have 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.580
 commented on how to use it because if 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.960
 we should try, even though we think 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.659
 that football is already totally 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.150
 extinguished stressed a little more 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:16.039
 it ends that burden of the extinct that ends the 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.500
 completely because if for example 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.210
 we consume 80 percent and by 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.120
 save that 20 percent that in the end 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.770
 we are not worth anything, we leave it alone 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.330
 when we were presented with another fire that 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.979
 be so for a 20 percent no 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.460
 enough no no no it's not worth it but 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.690
 is that 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.580
 with what your alcohol what is you 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.069
 saying right now if that fire for the 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.259
 reason that is with that 80% we have left 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:38.449
 a little bit and it rekindles surely that 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:40.240
 with that 20% that we have, let's not be 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:42.860
 able to make an acquisition 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.490
 satisfactory one hundred percent then 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.380
 as a measure of use we use an extinct 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:52.160
 made the whole load 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.770
 in the fire good because I think that what 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.539
 we can leave here and another week 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.979
 we count many more things thank you 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:59.449
 really alejandro to your house you can 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:00.650
 come whenever you want, thank you very much 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:02.900
 Alejandro Díaz, who is a firefighter 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.330
 west consortium that today has come 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.979
 also once again invited by ricardo 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.310

 road and as always we propose that 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:20.090
 go to the website of the 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:22.639
 platform put brake that we carry 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.470
 forward zero wave and antenna 3 today by 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:26.659
 example I'm reading are looking for signs 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.100
 and dangerous roads there can 

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:31.770
 you denounce to try 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.780
 and fix them good is called put brake 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:37.520
 puntocom to the two thanks ricardo 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.520
 Alejandro Good afternoon
