00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
in the last few years and mainly because

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.680 
in the last few years and mainly because
the<00:05:20.100> two<00:05:20.280> franchises<00:05:20.550> were<00:05:21.060> they<00:05:21.270> were<00:05:21.419> the

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
the two franchises were they were the

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.330 
the two franchises were they were the
ones<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:21.990> are<00:05:22.200> starting<00:05:22.650> best<00:05:22.860> heavily<00:05:23.280> in

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
ones that are starting best heavily in

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.070 
ones that are starting best heavily in
terms<00:05:23.550> of<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:23.850> peace<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.360> stuff<00:05:24.870> like<00:05:25.020> that

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
terms of the peace and stuff like that

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.950 
terms of the peace and stuff like that
and<00:05:25.789> so<00:05:26.789> I<00:05:26.820> think<00:05:26.940> is<00:05:27.210> going<00:05:27.390> to<00:05:27.450> be<00:05:27.479> exactly

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
and so I think is going to be exactly

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.350 
and so I think is going to be exactly
the<00:05:28.080> same<00:05:28.110> you<00:05:28.440> know<00:05:28.640> Red<00:05:29.640> Bull<00:05:29.789> is<00:05:29.910> coming<00:05:30.240> in

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.940 
the same you know Red Bull is coming in
a<00:05:31.820> with<00:05:32.820> the<00:05:33.120> great<00:05:33.360> start<00:05:33.660> this<00:05:33.810> year<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.260> la

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.100 
a with the great start this year and la
gala<00:05:35.160> sister<00:05:35.640> you<00:05:36.060> know<00:05:36.180> tried<00:05:36.450> in<00:05:36.660> trying<00:05:36.930> to

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
gala sister you know tried in trying to

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.659 
gala sister you know tried in trying to
find<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.710> best<00:05:37.740> home<00:05:38.100> but<00:05:38.340> they're<00:05:38.490> the

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669
