00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.280
 i hate harry potter 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.370
 and god yes I think it's totally 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.900
 unattractive when men read what you 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:19.130
 best friend is eternal in her 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:21.080
 in love that was totally unexpected because 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.000
 the book which I bought used 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.189
 it arrived without a protective cover yes 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.050
 fortunately, there are so many men 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.800
 which are just as expensive as the types in 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.539
 the books 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.039
 I love it when the action is totally 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.390
 predictable then I have to get the 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.090
 next if they do not even buy 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.190
 that saves me much money my bookshelf 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.120
 is really so full I should my books 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.890
 throw away 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.530
 There is a new super harry potter 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.800
 after me I need the smell of 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:52.399
 new books, I think somehow totally 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:55.940
 repulsive what so pile unread 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.219
 what books that please so I buy 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.489
 always a book then I read it and then 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.420
 I buy the next reading really one 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.480
 boring thing 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.460
 the book to the film that's the best 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.440
 the books that are still filming 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.660
 based and not the other way nanny 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.160
 books generally leave me totally cold 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.830
 no feelings 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.050
 oh yes it will be her film with us 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.140
 choose masterpiece your dream is that 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.320
 private library so room in your 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.870
 house in which only books that are the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.070
 totally waste of space no I have 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.350
 never wanted a book here 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.880
 character comes alive, that's the turn 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.100
 will not continue after the second part 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.540
 translated as cool as I have to 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.000
 continue reading English then it looks in 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.330
 shelf totally varied from this 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.520
 subtitles sound like you're worth it 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.320
 you buy all the parts of a series though 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.650
 you did not even read the first one 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.090
 are you stupid so the cover of that 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.920
 I do not care about a book 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.170
 I love it when the next part of one 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.060
 row only years later appears then 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.550
 I have the time to move on 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.530
 to think the story yes people that 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.540
 was the second part to my things the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.920
 readers do not say who is totally the first 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.150
 I did sometime last year 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.380
 Maybe you do not know that yet 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.030
 i was definitely left in you 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.720
 the infobox and i hope it has you 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.300
 like 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.459
 and yes I am sorry that it is so long 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.160
 took but I had to first 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.410
 to come up with a few things and 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.330
 if you're still any things 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.980
 which a reader in no case say 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.030
 then you would like me in the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.740
 to write the comments 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.050
 and maybe someday 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.310
 Part 3 but yes I hope you have it 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.940

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.940
