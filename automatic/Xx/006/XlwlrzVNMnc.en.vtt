so if you like me you don't incredibly
trust<00:00:12.719> car<00:00:13.080> ramps<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.740> so<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.670> trailer<00:00:15.000> is

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
trust car ramps and so this trailer is

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.720 
trust car ramps and so this trailer is
perfect<00:00:15.420> as<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> car<00:00:16.369> anyway<00:00:17.369> what<00:00:17.550> were<00:00:17.640> we

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
wire coat hanger we'll show you how to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.270 
wire coat hanger we'll show you how to
do<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:49.280> it'll<00:00:50.280> last<00:00:50.460> longer<00:00:50.730> -<00:00:54.920> as<00:00:55.920> my

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
do that it'll last longer - as my

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.660 
do that it'll last longer - as my
muffler<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.590> see<00:00:58.800> there's<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.489> broken

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
muffler and you can see there's a broken

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.660 
muffler and you can see there's a broken
one<00:00:59.879> over<00:01:00.090> there<00:01:00.949> this<00:01:01.949> little<00:01:02.280> point<00:01:02.489> right

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
one over there this little point right

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.440 
one over there this little point right
here<00:01:03.890> connects<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.979> there<00:01:05.220> by<00:01:05.909> about<00:01:06.090> two

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
here connects to there by about two

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.690 
here connects to there by about two
three<00:01:06.689> inches<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:08.100> now<00:01:08.130> we're<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> cut<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
three inches so now we're going to cut a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.370 
three inches so now we're going to cut a
piece<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.880> wire<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.479> fit<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.840> let's<00:01:10.200> make<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
piece of wire to fit that let's make a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.609 
piece of wire to fit that let's make a
loop<00:01:10.650> basically<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:12.360> we'll<00:01:12.960> fit<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.260> up<00:01:13.380> there

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
loop basically and we'll fit it up there

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.179 
loop basically and we'll fit it up there
so<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:15.840> sides<00:01:16.229> fixed<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.009> basically

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
so that sides fixed you just basically

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.179 
so that sides fixed you just basically
make<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> loop<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.590> once<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.979> made<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
make a loop and then once you made a

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.399 
make a loop and then once you made a
loop<00:01:20.369> loop<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.790> over<00:01:20.880> there<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.150> then<00:01:21.420> take

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
loop loop it over there and then take

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.200 
loop loop it over there and then take
your<00:01:22.710> prop<00:01:23.310> wires<00:01:23.610> put<00:01:23.909> them<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.150> middle

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
your prop wires put them in the middle

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.600 
your prop wires put them in the middle
and<00:01:24.420> twist<00:01:24.619> it<00:01:25.619> tightens<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.189> up<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.490> also

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
and twist it tightens it up and also

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.920 
and twist it tightens it up and also
keeps<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.090> from<00:01:27.180> coming<00:01:27.360> off<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.689> end<00:01:27.810> of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
keeps it from coming off the end of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.710 
keeps it from coming off the end of
there<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.320> end<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.590> there<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> got<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> do

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
there and end of there so I got to do

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.840 
there and end of there so I got to do
this<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.079> leather<00:01:31.530> side<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
this in this leather side you can see I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.149 
this in this leather side you can see I
did<00:01:33.119> get<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> hole<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.140> my<00:01:34.350> muffler<00:01:34.680> I'm

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
did get a hole in my muffler I'm

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.249 
did get a hole in my muffler I'm
bouncing<00:01:35.640> across<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.210> dirt<00:01:36.390> road<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.930> was
