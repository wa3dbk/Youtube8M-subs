00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.640 
and then um you go down to the third
fret<00:03:23.800> and<00:03:24.750> slide<00:03:25.750> up<00:03:25.930> from<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.290> 3rd<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.500> the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
fret and slide up from the 3rd to the

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:35.580 
fret and slide up from the 3rd to the
5th<00:03:27.330> so<00:03:28.330> you<00:03:28.390> got

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.640 

and<00:03:36.310> then<00:03:36.670> he<00:03:37.360> switches<00:03:37.629> off<00:03:37.870> between<00:03:38.110> that

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
and then he switches off between that

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.420 
and then he switches off between that
and<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.819> same<00:03:40.060> thing<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.830> they<00:03:45.040> accepted

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
and the same thing and they accepted

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.690 
and the same thing and they accepted
instead<00:03:45.730> of<00:03:45.819> doing<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.330> three<00:03:46.750> slide<00:03:47.019> 25

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
instead of doing the three slide 25

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.200 
instead of doing the three slide 25
because<00:03:48.700> three<00:03:49.180> pull<00:03:49.569> off<00:03:49.750> open

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
because three pull off open

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.700 
because three pull off open
so<00:03:52.900> you<00:03:52.960> got

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.770

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.320 

and<00:04:21.389> he<00:04:21.479> does<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:21.959> um<00:04:22.199> I<00:04:22.770> think<00:04:24.500> 15<00:04:25.500> times

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
and he does that um I think 15 times

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.939 
and he does that um I think 15 times
yeah<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.360> know<00:04:27.479> it's<00:04:27.780> like<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:27.990> lot<00:04:28.259> I<00:04:28.500> didn't<00:04:28.830> see

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
yeah I know it's like a lot I didn't see

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.870 
yeah I know it's like a lot I didn't see
you<00:04:29.009> go<00:04:29.160> it's<00:04:29.810> open<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.470> then<00:04:32.280> hammer<00:04:32.550> on<00:04:32.729> it

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
you go it's open and then hammer on it

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.629 
you go it's open and then hammer on it
is<00:04:33.000> on<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.449> fifth<00:04:34.400> seven<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:38.130> then<00:04:38.280> a

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
is on to the fifth seven and then a

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.279 
is on to the fifth seven and then a
string<00:04:39.330> uh<00:04:40.280> fifth<00:04:41.280> so<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.610> got<00:04:41.930> g<00:04:42.930> string

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
string uh fifth so you got g string

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.029 
string uh fifth so you got g string
fifth<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:44.639> string<00:04:44.910> seventh<00:04:45.389> a<00:04:45.710> string<00:04:46.710> fifth

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
fifth you string seventh a string fifth

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.390 
fifth you string seventh a string fifth
you<00:04:47.310> go<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:49.530> you<00:04:49.590> play<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:49.770> open<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.190> then<00:04:50.250> do

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
you go so you play it open and then do

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
you go so you play it open and then do
those<00:04:50.550> camera

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.280 

okay<00:04:54.170> um<00:04:54.410> and<00:04:55.220> I<00:04:55.880> think<00:04:56.690> it<00:04:56.810> sounds<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.110> little

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
okay um and I think it sounds a little

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.140 
okay um and I think it sounds a little
bit<00:04:57.350> smoother<00:04:57.950> and<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.640> think<00:04:58.850> this<00:04:58.910> is<00:04:59.000> what<00:04:59.090> he

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
bit smoother and I think this is what he

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.870 
bit smoother and I think this is what he
does<00:04:59.300> if<00:04:59.510> you<00:04:59.600> put<00:04:59.840> in<00:04:59.960> a<00:05:00.080> 6<00:05:00.440> between<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.370> fifth

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
does if you put in a 6 between the fifth

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.250 
does if you put in a 6 between the fifth
and<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.150> set<00:05:02.480> between<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:02.900> five<00:05:03.050> of<00:05:03.080> the

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
and the set between the five of the

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.540 
and the set between the five of the
seven<00:05:05.800> it<00:05:06.800> just<00:05:07.010> sounds<00:05:07.220> a<00:05:07.280> little<00:05:07.430> bit

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
seven it just sounds a little bit

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.790 
seven it just sounds a little bit
smoother<00:05:07.940> I<00:05:08.180> mean<00:05:08.360> it's<00:05:08.570> optional<00:05:09.110> but<00:05:09.350> makes

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
smoother I mean it's optional but makes

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.230 
smoother I mean it's optional but makes
it<00:05:09.860> sound<00:05:09.980> better<00:05:10.130> clear<00:05:10.460> so<00:05:11.120> you<00:05:11.210> got

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.550 

and<00:05:15.840> then<00:05:16.199> you<00:05:16.349> go<00:05:16.500> up<00:05:16.530> to<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:17.009> seventh

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
and then you go up to the seventh

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:28.650 
and then you go up to the seventh
seventh<00:05:19.560> fret<00:05:19.830> on<00:05:20.039> the<00:05:20.160> a<00:05:21.030> stream

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.590 

okay<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:30.130> you<00:05:30.190> do<00:05:30.280> that<00:05:30.400> 15<00:05:30.730> times<00:05:30.970> that<00:05:31.330> entire

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
okay so you do that 15 times that entire

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.020 
okay so you do that 15 times that entire
thing<00:05:31.870> three<00:05:32.410> of<00:05:32.530> the<00:05:32.770> fifth<00:05:33.610> bread<00:05:33.850> than
