with<00:00:07.080> money<00:00:13.160> 34<00:00:14.160> cents<00:00:15.500> plus<00:00:20.029> 29<00:00:21.029> cents<00:00:23.660> again

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
with money 34 cents plus 29 cents again

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.080 
with money 34 cents plus 29 cents again
it's<00:00:24.869> very<00:00:25.199> important<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.849> write

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
it's very important that you write

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.250 
it's very important that you write
neatly<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.460> that<00:00:29.460> not<00:00:29.880> only<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.390> numbers<00:00:30.869> are

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
neatly and that not only the numbers are

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.620 
neatly and that not only the numbers are
lined<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.340> right<00:00:32.369> columns<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.329> that

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
lined up in the right columns but that

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.450 
lined up in the right columns but that
the<00:00:34.880> decimal<00:00:35.880> point<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.390> also<00:00:36.989> lined<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.680> right

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the decimal point is also lined up right

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.270 
the decimal point is also lined up right
on<00:00:38.579> top<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.820> each<00:00:39.120> other<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:40.100> because<00:00:41.100> it's

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
on top of each other and because it's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.619 
on top of each other and because it's
money<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.700> need<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.879> make<00:00:42.090> sure<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
money you need to make sure you have a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.979 
money you need to make sure you have a
dollar<00:00:42.899> sign<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> other<00:00:45.000> than<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.329> we'll<00:00:45.750> add

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
dollar sign so other than that we'll add

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.810 
dollar sign so other than that we'll add
it<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> other<00:00:46.739> problems<00:00:47.280> starting<00:00:47.730> in

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
it like the other problems starting in

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.270 
it like the other problems starting in
the<00:00:47.940> ones<00:00:48.239> column<00:00:49.039> 4<00:00:50.039> plus<00:00:50.969> 9<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.660> 13<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:53.010> put

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the ones column 4 plus 9 is 13 so put

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.680 
the ones column 4 plus 9 is 13 so put
down<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.670> 3<00:00:54.000> carry<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> 1<00:00:56.090> now<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.329> 1

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
down the 3 carry the 1 now we have 1

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.390 
down the 3 carry the 1 now we have 1
plus<00:00:58.530> 3<00:00:58.980> which<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.309> 4<00:00:59.850> 4<00:01:00.809> plus<00:01:01.289> 2<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.739> 6<00:01:04.400> drop

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
plus 3 which is 4 4 plus 2 is 6 drop

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.260 
plus 3 which is 4 4 plus 2 is 6 drop
down<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.880> decimal<00:01:06.330> point<00:01:07.220> drop<00:01:08.220> down<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> 0<00:01:08.909> 0

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
down the decimal point drop down the 0 0

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.320 
down the decimal point drop down the 0 0
plus<00:01:09.479> 0<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.780> 0<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.790> drop<00:01:11.790> down<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.150> dollar

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
plus 0 is 0 and drop down the dollar

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.480 
plus 0 is 0 and drop down the dollar
sign<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:14.119> 63<00:01:15.119> cents<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.020> sum

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
sign so we have 63 cents as the sum

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.429 
sign so we have 63 cents as the sum
let's<00:01:17.490> use<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> inverse<00:01:18.330> operation<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.200> check

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
let's use the inverse operation to check

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.010 
let's use the inverse operation to check
that<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.950> again<00:01:23.040> I'm<00:01:23.310> making<00:01:23.729> sure<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.450> I

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that so again I'm making sure that I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.880 
that so again I'm making sure that I
write<00:01:25.439> neatly<00:01:26.119> this<00:01:27.119> answer<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:28.650> gonna

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
write neatly this answer and I'm gonna

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:37.850 
write neatly this answer and I'm gonna
subtract<00:01:32.210> 29<00:01:33.210> cents

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.020 

so<00:01:38.750> 3-9<00:01:39.750> doesn't<00:01:40.620> work<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.160> can<00:01:41.430> borrow<00:01:41.670> one

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
so 3-9 doesn't work so I can borrow one

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.730 
so 3-9 doesn't work so I can borrow one
from<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.420> six<00:01:42.870> the<00:01:43.650> six<00:01:43.920> becomes<00:01:44.160> a<00:01:44.520> five<00:01:45.740> this

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
from the six the six becomes a five this

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.670 
from the six the six becomes a five this
becomes<00:01:47.330> 13<00:01:48.740> 13<00:01:49.740> minus<00:01:50.310> nine<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:51.110> four<00:01:53.450> five

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
becomes 13 13 minus nine is four five

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.390 
becomes 13 13 minus nine is four five
subtract<00:01:55.680> two<00:01:55.980> is<00:01:56.340> three<00:01:57.770> we<00:01:58.770> bring<00:01:59.100> down<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
subtract two is three we bring down the

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.840 
subtract two is three we bring down the
decimal<00:02:00.030> point<00:02:00.540> zero<00:02:01.500> minus<00:02:01.890> zero<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.280> zero

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
decimal point zero minus zero is zero

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.220 
decimal point zero minus zero is zero
and<00:02:03.330> we<00:02:04.080> bring<00:02:04.320> down<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.740> dollar<00:02:04.950> sign<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:06.230> we

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
and we bring down the dollar sign and we

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.010 
and we bring down the dollar sign and we
have<00:02:07.440> 34<00:02:08.130> cents<00:02:08.580> which<00:02:09.210> is<00:02:09.420> what<00:02:09.630> we<00:02:09.780> had<00:02:09.990> up

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
have 34 cents which is what we had up

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.440 
have 34 cents which is what we had up
here<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.560> top<00:02:10.760> so<00:02:11.760> our<00:02:12.300> answer<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.810> correct<00:02:14.450> so

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
here on top so our answer is correct so

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.820 
here on top so our answer is correct so
make<00:02:15.600> sure<00:02:15.630> when<00:02:15.990> you're<00:02:16.110> doing<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
make sure when you're doing this the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.720 
make sure when you're doing this the
digits<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:18.660> decimal<00:02:19.290> point<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.520> dollar

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
digits the decimal point and the dollar

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.470 
digits the decimal point and the dollar
sign<00:02:21.120> are<00:02:21.420> all<00:02:22.020> lined<00:02:22.410> up<00:02:22.650> correctly<00:02:23.000> on<00:02:24.000> top

sign are all lined up correctly on top

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.960 
sign are all lined up correctly on top
of<00:02:24.630> each<00:02:24.750> other<00:02:24.930> let's<00:02:25.590> try<00:02:25.890> another<00:02:26.160> money

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
of each other let's try another money

everything<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:37.620> lined<00:03:37.950> up<00:03:38.220> neatly<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:39.300> if<00:03:39.390> you

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
everything is lined up neatly and if you

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.460 
everything is lined up neatly and if you
do<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.960> I<00:03:40.640> guarantee<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:42.180> will<00:03:42.300> be<00:03:42.360> easier

do that I guarantee it will be easier
so<00:03:43.890> again<00:03:44.130> just<00:03:44.160> double<00:03:44.700> check<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.090> make<00:03:45.210> sure

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
so again just double check to make sure

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.370 
so again just double check to make sure

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
is 1 drop the dollar sign down and we

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.120 
is 1 drop the dollar sign down and we
have<00:04:16.770> one<00:04:17.190> dollar<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.820> 23<00:04:18.360> cents<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.130> is

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
have one dollar and 23 cents and that is

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.250 
have one dollar and 23 cents and that is
what<00:04:20.400> we<00:04:20.520> have<00:04:20.670> up<00:04:20.820> here<00:04:20.850> so<00:04:21.750> using<00:04:22.170> the

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
what we have up here so using the

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.470 
what we have up here so using the
inverse<00:04:22.590> operation<00:04:23.010> we<00:04:23.340> know<00:04:23.520> our<00:04:23.760> answer<00:04:24.270> is

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
inverse operation we know our answer is

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:37.959
