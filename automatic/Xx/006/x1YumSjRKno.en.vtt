get stuck in it you have to do the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.060 
get stuck in it you have to do the
walking<00:00:33.059> thing<00:00:33.290> but<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.649> still<00:00:34.890> works

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
walking thing but this one still works

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.330 
walking thing but this one still works
but<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.489> kind<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.730> slow<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:37.410> this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
but it's kind of slow and this one this

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.900 
but it's kind of slow and this one this
one's<00:00:38.579> pretty<00:00:38.730> fast<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.420> less<00:00:39.780> resource

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
one's pretty fast and it's less resource

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.240 
one's pretty fast and it's less resource
needed<00:00:41.960> pretty<00:00:42.960> much<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.860> don't<00:00:44.129> know

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
needed pretty much I think I don't know

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.290 
needed pretty much I think I don't know
but<00:00:45.710> yeah<00:00:46.710> takes<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.190> up<00:00:47.309> super<00:00:47.550> fast<00:00:47.579> now

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
but yeah takes you up super fast now

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.520 
but yeah takes you up super fast now
it's<00:00:48.570> kind<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.719> glitch<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.379> that

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it's kind of glitch out like that

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.840 
it's kind of glitch out like that
sometimes<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.910> um<00:00:51.180> what<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.260> also

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
sometimes but um what you can do is also

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.600 
sometimes but um what you can do is also
let<00:00:53.850> me<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.149> do<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.300> right<00:00:54.660> quick<00:00:55.610> it's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
let me just do this right quick it's

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.970 
let me just do this right quick it's
because<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:57.559> reason<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.649> does<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.800> is

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
because like reason it does that is

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
because like reason it does that is
because<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.460> going<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.539> coming<00:01:00.660> out

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
because it's going in and coming out

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.349 
because it's going in and coming out
like<00:01:01.079> super<00:01:01.649> fast<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.640> think<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.180> pull

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
like super fast so I think if you pull

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.750 
like super fast so I think if you pull
that<00:01:03.480> all<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.660> way<00:01:03.750> back<00:01:04.100> well<00:01:05.100> yeah<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:05.640> it's

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that all the way back well yeah see it's

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.920 
that all the way back well yeah see it's
gonna<00:01:05.850> glitch<00:01:06.119> out<00:01:06.299> sometimes<00:01:07.280> there<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.430> go

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
gonna glitch out sometimes there we go

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.420 
gonna glitch out sometimes there we go
now<00:01:11.720> okay

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.980 

alright<00:01:17.430> nevermind<00:01:17.850> sorry<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.570> testing<00:01:18.900> on

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
alright nevermind sorry is testing on

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.190 
alright nevermind sorry is testing on
camera<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.680> little<00:01:20.100> bit<00:01:20.400> um<00:01:20.870> but<00:01:21.870> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.080> also

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
camera a little bit um but you can also

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.500 
camera a little bit um but you can also
set<00:01:22.530> these<00:01:22.770> repeaters<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.210> future

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
set these repeaters it in the future

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.600 
set these repeaters it in the future
I'll<00:01:24.600> I'll<00:01:24.870> show<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.410> but<00:01:25.830> when<00:01:26.100> we're

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
I'll I'll show you it but when we're

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.700 
I'll I'll show you it but when we're
building<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.720> me<00:01:27.960> set<00:01:28.140> those<00:01:28.290> repeaters

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
building it on me set those repeaters

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.640 
building it on me set those repeaters
back<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.729> will<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:29.910> slower<00:01:30.200> but<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.470> more

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
back and it will go slower but it's more

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.520 
back and it will go slower but it's more
likely<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.190> take<00:01:32.729> back<00:01:32.940> these<00:01:33.180> things<00:01:33.510> if<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
likely to take back these things if it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.870 
likely to take back these things if it
doesn't<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.280> could<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.550> set<00:01:35.700> up<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
doesn't and you could just set up a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.609 
doesn't and you could just set up a
button<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.450> where<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.690> can<00:01:36.780> retract<00:01:37.259> them<00:01:37.440> back

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
button to where it can retract them back

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.460 
button to where it can retract them back
but<00:01:38.479> I'm<00:01:39.479> gonna<00:01:39.630> show<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> how<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.050> build<00:01:40.259> it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
but I'm gonna show you how to build it

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.290 
but I'm gonna show you how to build it
now<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.400> what<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.610> want<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:41.940> is<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.150> want

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.150 
now so what you want to do is you want
to<00:01:42.360> build<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:43.530> two<00:01:44.310> by<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:45.259> thing<00:01:46.259> down<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.740> you

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
to build a two by one thing down and you

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.520 
to build a two by one thing down and you
want<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.400> have<00:01:47.460> two<00:01:48.000> blocks<00:01:48.270> downward<00:01:48.690> see<00:01:49.320> one

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
want to have two blocks downward see one

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.249 
want to have two blocks downward see one
two<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.570> what<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.690> want<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.110> take

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.290 
two and then what you want to do is take
your<00:01:52.410> block<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.649> choice<00:01:53.100> I'm<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.149> using

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
your block of choice I'm just using

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.450 
your block of choice I'm just using
wooden<00:01:54.600> planks<00:01:55.080> put<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.619> down<00:01:55.800> and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.220> put

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
wooden planks put them down and then put

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.609 
wooden planks put them down and then put
pressure<00:01:56.729> plates<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.119> top<00:01:57.300> of<00:01:57.479> them<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.470> then

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
pressure plates on top of them and then

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.190 
pressure plates on top of them and then
dig<00:01:59.009> out<00:01:59.160> two<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> little

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
dig out two like this and like a little

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.560 
dig out two like this and like a little
stair<00:02:01.410> thing<00:02:01.710> get<00:02:02.490> your<00:02:02.640> redstone<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.119> put<00:02:03.479> it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
stair thing get your redstone and put it

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.029 
stair thing get your redstone and put it
underneath<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.990> two<00:02:04.140> blocks<00:02:04.470> with<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
underneath the two blocks with the

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.730 
underneath the two blocks with the
pressure<00:02:05.310> plates<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.590> want

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
pressure plates and then what you want

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.999 
pressure plates and then what you want
to<00:02:07.800> do<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.160> want<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.239> take<00:02:09.800> want<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.860> go<00:02:10.950> two

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
to do is want to take want to go two

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.780 
to do is want to take want to go two
blocks<00:02:11.489> away<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.030> put<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.630> sticky<00:02:13.110> piston

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
blocks away and put a sticky piston

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.750 
blocks away and put a sticky piston
looking<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.940> way<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.330> then<00:02:15.870> take<00:02:16.230> another

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
looking that way and then take another

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.790 
looking that way and then take another

ones in between them so you just want to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.630 
ones in between them so you just want to
go<00:02:21.510> as<00:02:21.630> high<00:02:21.810> as<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.989> want<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.410> like<00:02:23.310> this

just like that and then you just want to
put<00:02:30.750> normal<00:02:31.590> Pistons<00:02:32.450> on<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.750> front<00:02:34.019> of<00:02:34.079> them

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
put normal Pistons on the front of them

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.990 
put normal Pistons on the front of them
just<00:02:36.420> like<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.340> then<00:02:38.340> what<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.850> want<00:02:38.970> to

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
do is you want to bring redstone up and

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.650 
do is you want to bring redstone up and
to<00:02:43.739> line<00:02:43.920> up<00:02:44.070> with<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.280> Stevi<00:02:44.489> piston<00:02:44.910> take

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
to line up with the Stevi piston take

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.130 
to line up with the Stevi piston take
your<00:02:45.840> block<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.320> choice<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:47.299> put<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.390> down<00:02:48.540> but

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
your block of choice and put it down but

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.680 
your block of choice and put it down but
I<00:02:49.410> actually<00:02:50.190> put<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.700> repeater<00:02:51.030> right<00:02:51.269> there<00:02:51.480> I

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
I actually put a repeater right there I

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.410 
I actually put a repeater right there I
put<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.470> second<00:02:52.769> tick<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.880> worked

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
put it on the second tick so it worked

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.660 
put it on the second tick so it worked
more<00:02:54.630> efficient<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.320> then<00:02:56.070> what<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.489> want<00:02:56.610> to

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
more efficient and then what you want to

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.960 
more efficient and then what you want to
do<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.090> take<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.570> wooden<00:02:58.290> planks<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.970> go

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
do is just take the wooden planks and go

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.500 
do is just take the wooden planks and go
two<00:03:00.870> blocks<00:03:01.019> out<00:03:01.320> go<00:03:02.250> up<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:03.079> then<00:03:04.079> up<00:03:04.290> again

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
two blocks out go up and then up again

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.789 
two blocks out go up and then up again
so<00:03:06.510> you're<00:03:06.690> like<00:03:06.870> always<00:03:07.140> lined<00:03:07.440> up<00:03:07.590> with<00:03:07.709> the

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
so you're like always lined up with the

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.039 
so you're like always lined up with the
sticky<00:03:08.070> pistons<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.730> then<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.810> have<00:03:09.900> one

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
sticky pistons and then you have one

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.560 
sticky pistons and then you have one
more<00:03:10.200> spot<00:03:10.650> for<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> repeater<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.450> just

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
more spot for a repeater so you just

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.800 
more spot for a repeater so you just
want<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.750> do<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.640> until<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:16.190> get<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.430> top

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
want to do that until you get to the top

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.730 
want to do that until you get to the top
here<00:03:18.810> and

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.720 

then<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.490> want<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.700> go<00:03:24.820> up<00:03:24.940> just<00:03:25.150> one<00:03:25.330> more

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
then you want to go up just one more

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.820 
then you want to go up just one more
just<00:03:27.730> like<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:27.910> so<00:03:28.810> then<00:03:28.930> it's<00:03:29.110> all<00:03:29.260> swarthy

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
just like that so then it's all swarthy

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.430 
just like that so then it's all swarthy
and<00:03:30.070> stuff<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.670> then<00:03:31.270> what<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.540> do<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.960> you

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
and stuff and then what you do is you

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.730 
and stuff and then what you do is you
want<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.650> put<00:03:32.860> some<00:03:33.480> redstone<00:03:34.530> run<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.620> like

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
want to put some redstone run it like

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.100 
want to put some redstone run it like
that<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.490> then<00:03:36.880> take<00:03:37.150> your<00:03:37.360> repeater<00:03:37.780> and

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
that and then take your repeater and

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.670 
that and then take your repeater and
face<00:03:38.800> it<00:03:38.950> at<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.100> wall<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:40.660> then<00:03:40.750> take<00:03:41.440> more

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
face it at the wall and then take more

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.820 
face it at the wall and then take more
redstone<00:03:42.600> repeater<00:03:43.600> if<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.500> wanted<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.770> go

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
redstone repeater if you wanted to go

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.320 
redstone repeater if you wanted to go
fast<00:03:45.070> you<00:03:45.220> leave<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.490> on<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.640> second<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.090> mean

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
fast you leave it on the second I mean

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.730 
fast you leave it on the second I mean
the<00:03:46.420> first<00:03:46.660> tick<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.200> then<00:03:47.320> if<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:47.470> wanted<00:03:47.650> to

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
the first tick and then if you wanted to

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.200 
the first tick and then if you wanted to
go<00:03:47.800> a<00:03:47.830> little<00:03:48.130> bit<00:03:48.310> slower<00:03:48.640> and<00:03:48.850> probably<00:03:49.120> be

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
go a little bit slower and probably be

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.750 
go a little bit slower and probably be
more<00:03:49.360> efficient<00:03:49.930> then<00:03:50.530> put<00:03:50.860> it<00:03:50.950> on<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.190> second

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
more efficient then put it on the second

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.200 
more efficient then put it on the second
one<00:03:52.800> but<00:03:53.800> fast<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.520> fine<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.910> just<00:03:55.090> have<00:03:55.180> a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
one but fast is fine you just have a

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.940 
one but fast is fine you just have a
button<00:03:55.570> to<00:03:55.690> where<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:55.930> can<00:03:56.020> reset<00:03:56.380> it<00:03:56.410> I'll

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
button to where it can reset it I'll

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.640 
button to where it can reset it I'll
show<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:57.340> what<00:03:57.550> I<00:03:57.580> mean<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.200> then<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.500> just

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
show you what I mean and then you just

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.340 
show you what I mean and then you just
keep<00:03:59.740> on<00:03:59.920> doing<00:04:00.160> this<00:04:00.370> facing<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:00.970> block

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
keep on doing this facing the block

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.110 
keep on doing this facing the block
redstone<00:04:02.400> then<00:04:03.400> once<00:04:03.550> you<00:04:03.640> get<00:04:03.760> up<00:04:03.820> here<00:04:04.060> you

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
redstone then once you get up here you

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
fence sometimes like I couldn't get it

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.530 
fence sometimes like I couldn't get it
on<00:05:03.910> my<00:05:04.090> first<00:05:04.480> try<00:05:04.800> they're<00:05:05.800> real<00:05:06.360> but<00:05:07.360> yeah

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
on my first try they're real but yeah

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.390 
on my first try they're real but yeah
it's<00:05:07.720> gonna<00:05:07.810> glitch<00:05:08.110> out<00:05:08.320> somewhat<00:05:08.740> cuz<00:05:09.220> see

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
it's gonna glitch out somewhat cuz see

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.610 
it's gonna glitch out somewhat cuz see
it's<00:05:09.520> super<00:05:09.850> fast<00:05:10.270> but<00:05:11.140> if<00:05:11.230> you<00:05:11.320> just<00:05:11.440> put<00:05:11.500> a

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
it's super fast but if you just put a

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.930 
it's super fast but if you just put a
button<00:05:11.890> right<00:05:12.100> here<00:05:12.130> then<00:05:12.400> you<00:05:12.460> could<00:05:12.520> reset

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
button right here then you could reset

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.450 
button right here then you could reset
it<00:05:13.060> easy<00:05:13.710> but<00:05:14.710> I'm<00:05:14.860> gonna<00:05:14.950> set<00:05:15.160> these<00:05:15.280> on<00:05:15.370> the

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
it easy but I'm gonna set these on the

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.370 
it easy but I'm gonna set these on the
second<00:05:15.850> tick<00:05:16.060> and<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:16.720> was<00:05:16.840> working<00:05:17.200> better

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
second tick and it was working better

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.059 
second tick and it was working better
for<00:05:17.500> me<00:05:17.800> on<00:05:17.950> the<00:05:18.040> second<00:05:18.460> one<00:05:18.750> on<00:05:19.750> my<00:05:19.990> last<00:05:20.200> test

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.040 

ya<00:05:23.699> see<00:05:23.969> it<00:05:23.999> got<00:05:24.180> me<00:05:24.330> all<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:24.449> way<00:05:24.599> up<00:05:24.629> and

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
ya see it got me all the way up and

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.219 
ya see it got me all the way up and
there's<00:05:25.949> less<00:05:26.460> likelihood<00:05:26.729> of<00:05:27.059> it<00:05:27.659> glitching

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
there's less likelihood of it glitching

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.730 
there's less likelihood of it glitching
out<00:05:29.509> so<00:05:30.509> you<00:05:30.569> just<00:05:30.869> do<00:05:30.990> that<00:05:31.169> and<00:05:31.229> you<00:05:31.559> got<00:05:31.710> a

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
out so you just do that and you got a

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.730 
out so you just do that and you got a
good<00:05:32.039> elevator<00:05:32.639> and<00:05:33.050> if<00:05:34.050> you<00:05:34.169> want<00:05:34.319> a<00:05:34.379> reset

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
good elevator and if you want a reset

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.649 
good elevator and if you want a reset
button<00:05:34.770> down<00:05:35.159> here<00:05:35.339> just<00:05:35.490> put<00:05:35.639> a<00:05:35.669> like<00:05:36.419> hide

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
button down here just put a like hide

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.019 
button down here just put a like hide
this<00:05:36.869> or<00:05:37.289> something<00:05:37.710> put<00:05:38.219> a<00:05:38.249> block<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:38.879> then

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:39.029 
this or something put a block and then

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:43.040 
this or something put a block and then
take<00:05:39.449> like<00:05:39.629> a<00:05:39.659> button<00:05:40.399> button<00:05:41.869> put<00:05:42.869> it<00:05:42.960> right

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
take like a button button put it right

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.889 
take like a button button put it right
there<00:05:43.110> and<00:05:43.559> then<00:05:43.830> just<00:05:44.099> press<00:05:44.490> it<00:05:44.779> and<00:05:45.779> it

there and then just press it and it

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:49.579 
there and then just press it and it
should<00:05:46.050> reset<00:05:46.409> it<00:05:46.559> so<00:05:47.389> yeah<00:05:48.389> there's<00:05:49.289> another

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:49.589 
should reset it so yeah there's another

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:51.559 
should reset it so yeah there's another
working<00:05:49.979> elevator<00:05:50.159> for<00:05:50.580> you<00:05:50.669> guys<00:05:50.849> I<00:05:51.149> know<00:05:51.330> you

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.019 
working elevator for you guys I know you
guys<00:05:51.719> like<00:05:52.349> different<00:05:52.979> styles<00:05:53.279> of<00:05:53.550> elevators

guys like different styles of elevators

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.389 
guys like different styles of elevators
here's<00:05:54.629> one<00:05:54.899> it<00:05:55.110> should<00:05:55.229> be<00:05:55.349> less<00:05:55.649> resource

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:56.399 
here's one it should be less resource

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.420 
here's one it should be less resource
