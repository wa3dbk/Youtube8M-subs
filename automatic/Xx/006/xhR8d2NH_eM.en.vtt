00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.840
 what does a good smell mean support 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.730
 retracted under command as an allied attack 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.130

 opponent dealer such as if there is 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.340
 our kerry team in most countries 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.869
 and damage depends on the hand why you don't 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.090
 spit up rising spoiling the hero 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.890
 senior buff or aura, or vice versa, and 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.110
 me enemy make up a large part and 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.670
 to usable abilities why 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.219
 do not put your choice to protect against them 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.980
 using bkb ability like for example u 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.880
 I have it or simply support desire 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.860
 looking for a set of stella 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.600
 if you consider the peak of professional 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.450
 commands, you can often see bundles 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.040
 flying themselves only in the last pour 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.840
 stages of the game either in specific 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.390
 exceptional situations knowing practicing 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.300
 manner of playing the enemy and stupid I do not know 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.820
 Such nuances copy this in ordinary 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.649
 pubs regarding the usual pavas which 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.480
 often found themes and moving on 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.850
 cathedral that i ner trying to help 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.799
 team will tie or even courier like 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.840
 you can interrupt simple tactics I do not know 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.880
 where the enemy lack see for frequent 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.040
 teammates death lack of survival 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.120
 Damage all this leads to the next 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.000
 I spend chatting the success of the glacier 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.740
 so let 's see what's best for 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.570
 ordinary peaves if you are confident 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.730
 deprive on want to lead your team 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.650
 victory who is the most reasonable game on 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.510
 Kerry or unit Tim heroes 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.700
 and as for support which should 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.830
 carry the myth of victory based on 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.750
 cons considered in the tap to start 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.610
 the first task is not dead but on 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.770
 initial lev important from the first minutes not 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.870
 surrender to the enemy for it will critically affect 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.970
 on further game and practice no one 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.310
 does not prevent to take support with more fat 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.130
 initial capabilities namely booking 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.040
 the pc is also quite good 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.320
 option will be with process ki and so and with 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.180
 change from the lists of heroes put 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.430
 your choice on several of these is 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.640
 inhibits treant protection and in the neck 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.240
 the manager is worth hain't renji cyrus 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.280
 the selectivity of these character 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.050
 driven by survival future 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.240
 they have a file to maximize support 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.210
 potentials are similar from selected 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.050
 select by the criterion of applying the kind of such 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.890
 the way remains 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.380
 and of 68 of the crow itself, from the first words 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.940
 so and with ultimate omniknayt damage from 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.739
 which goes when using 1 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.030
 abilities you cross at last 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.150
 the level of leveling gets the target 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.430
 for 36 points of protection option 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.590
 due to the high damage groundhog additions 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.330
 with the ability to only sit like 5 wheel 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.150
 carts are very useful with their properties 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.040
 institutions 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.920
 28 percent for four with 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.110
 half a second and damage 60 units per 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.930
 one ripple also not forget about 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.689
 such line of support as jakiro of all 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.790
 oil on your 7 skills note that 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.709
 non-platforms damage damage at 15 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.049
 units on the first level of pumping will help 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.540
 not bad harasit districts and towers all 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.220
 also very nice to practice in the most 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.209
 bohkov often have to stand under 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.890
 enemy tala 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.140
 subject to constant harass 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.810
 opponents and the right decision will be 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.579
 At least temporary urgent input does not have 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.359
 sense to pump the first ability on 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.430
 initial lego 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.440
 due to the fact that it is not always possible to choose 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.060
 correct positioning and manacost 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.340
 abilities are high enough 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.049
 by comparison 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.299
 precisely because of the high to flat 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.099
 forehead and turn on and list the types of shaker so 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.379
 that we have a clever guy that's great 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.040
 suitable against you kilo death 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.470
 character 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.849
 straight protection animation co 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.549
 porting and jixer 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.799
 against casters massively related 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.109
 Ultimate and why creatures 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.549
 thick-skinned character I'm not talking about 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.600
 heroes 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.910
 support colors 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.680
 the possibilities of which servants for these one 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.840
 coins or prokast its most 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.970
 when the opponent is most they don't 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.460
 distinguished by survival and not underground 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.080
 taller with different weaving of the end 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.150
 a support is not the case you do not squash 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.670
 teams and helps in the implementation 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.420
 tasks 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.070
 try to compare your statistics 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.350
 wars near specifically for these characters 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.670
 compared with other support in great 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.110
 regarding the position above 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.940
 unless of course you just started 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.070
 get involved and so following simple 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.690
 the above files and priority 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.050
 elect these though in three characters in 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.850
 pubs 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.480
 your and and will not swing why 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.480
 thank
