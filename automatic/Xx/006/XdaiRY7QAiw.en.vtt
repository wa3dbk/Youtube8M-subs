some it's at something I I definitely

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.400 
some it's at something I I definitely
knew<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.280> had<00:03:02.490> had<00:03:02.790> inside<00:03:03.150> me<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:04.020> hadn't

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
knew I had had inside me and it hadn't

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.160 
knew I had had inside me and it hadn't
perhaps<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.940> know<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.120> hadn't<00:03:06.450> shown<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.810> you

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
perhaps you know I hadn't shown it you

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.560 
perhaps you know I hadn't shown it you
know<00:03:07.290> always<00:03:07.830> in<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.670> last<00:03:08.850> couple<00:03:09.060> years<00:03:09.209> and

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
know always in the last couple years and

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.360 
know always in the last couple years and
I<00:03:09.690> think<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:10.050> was<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.410> big<00:03:10.860> question<00:03:11.190> mark

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
I think that was the big question mark

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.980 
I think that was the big question mark
for<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:12.090> know<00:03:12.180> for<00:03:12.420> probably<00:03:12.690> red<00:03:12.810> bull

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
for a you know for probably red bull

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.260 
for a you know for probably red bull
racing<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.650> lot<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:13.830> fans<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.970> people

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
racing and a lot of fans and people

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.240 
racing and a lot of fans and people
involved<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.840> motor<00:03:16.020> sport<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:17.010> know<00:03:17.040> they

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
involved in motor sport you know they

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.340 
involved in motor sport you know they
knew<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.430> had<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.670> speed<00:03:18.090> but<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.990> know<00:03:19.110> they

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
knew I had the speed but you know they

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.930 
knew I had the speed but you know they
weren't<00:03:19.680> probably<00:03:20.100> sure<00:03:20.220> if<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.459> had<00:03:20.580> that<00:03:20.730> that

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
weren't probably sure if I had that that

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.150 
weren't probably sure if I had that that
killer<00:03:21.180> instinct<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.720> win<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.140> race<00:03:22.350> or<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:23.010> do

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
killer instinct to win a race or to do
