00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.989
 the boxing universe 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.390
 ae 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.080
 Speak, who's talking? 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.320
 when the grid tutorials and joÃ£o 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.550
 anatalino for you a top 1 of the best 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:31.300
 game that I found is enough to lose weight 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.930
 psp for android and the name of this game 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.360
 edson is showing you now is 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.940
 More or less, what 's the game like, so let's go. 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:47.800
 there we go then the game is personal 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:51.250
 this one called dextre, which is one of the 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.559
 best games I've ever seen and now I'm going 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.809
 talking to you is more or less like 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:02.489
 I wanted and about the game is I think 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:06.160
 few people only know that this is the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.280
 Game pet as three who had 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.190
 for play 2 and I really enjoyed it 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.640
 very much this game and only in this game here 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.670
 it must be he's just himself and you're going 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.659
 have to go through the phases as it was 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.150
 previous game that was him plus one of im 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.810
 and there you had to go through several phases 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:34.090
 You won cause it by passing the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.750
 phases and this game here is I consider 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.100
 he 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.259
 I preferred jack only the number of f3 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.040
 only that this game is also very 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.850
 cool 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.180
 and you have to go through the phases you go 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.759
 have to face several bosses of the 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:57.610
 and I do not consider it a very 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:02:01.110
 easy but then how can you see there? 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.299
