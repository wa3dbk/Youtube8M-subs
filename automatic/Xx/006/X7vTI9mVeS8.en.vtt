00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
about the chair and this this is like a

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.369 
about the chair and this this is like a
cloth<00:00:14.639> version<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.780> doodoo<00:00:16.020> leatherette

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
cloth version the doodoo leatherette

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.880 
cloth version the doodoo leatherette
type<00:00:16.770> versions<00:00:17.190> other<00:00:17.369> versions<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.590> but<00:00:19.590> I

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
type versions other versions and but I

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.260 
type versions other versions and but I
opted<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.550> one<00:00:20.730> because<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> like<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
opted for this one because I like the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.019 
opted for this one because I like the
look<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.680> think<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.519> best<00:00:23.760> way<00:00:24.000> for

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
look of it so I think the best way for

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.179 
look of it so I think the best way for
me<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.330> show<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.869> chair<00:00:25.199> because<00:00:26.099> it's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
me to show you this chair because it's

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.390 
me to show you this chair because it's
quite<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> big<00:00:26.580> object<00:00:27.260> cameras<00:00:28.260> honest<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.130> I

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
quite a big object cameras honest and I

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.640 
quite a big object cameras honest and I
can't<00:00:29.670> really<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.900> used<00:00:31.199> Umarov

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
can't really do it like I used Umarov

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.920 
can't really do it like I used Umarov
uses<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.030> think<00:00:33.180> i'ma<00:00:33.329> take<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> camera<00:00:33.840> off

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
uses so I think i'ma take the camera off

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.470 
uses so I think i'ma take the camera off
the<00:00:33.989> stand<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.790> and<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:36.149> show<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.329> around

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the stand and and just show you around

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.209 
the stand and and just show you around
it<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.079> gonna<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.380> maybe<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.739> little<00:00:38.100> bit

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it so it's gonna be maybe a little bit

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.560 
it so it's gonna be maybe a little bit
wobbly<00:00:38.370> I'll<00:00:38.610> try<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.910> keep<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.180> steady<00:00:39.420> as

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
wobbly I'll try and keep it as steady as

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.380 
wobbly I'll try and keep it as steady as
possible<00:00:40.340> well<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
possible well we do this and we have a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.720 
possible well we do this and we have a
look<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.920> let's<00:00:44.430> go<00:00:44.520> ahead<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
look at it and so let's go ahead and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:54.950 
look at it and so let's go ahead and
have<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.450> nosy<00:00:52.789> alright<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.000> here<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960

freestyle it with a camera off the stand

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.369 
freestyle it with a camera off the stand
I<00:00:57.180> think<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> best<00:00:57.989> way<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.170> can

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
I think this is the best way I can

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.779 
I think this is the best way I can
present<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.010> thing<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.489> because<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.760> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
present this thing to you because it is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.270 
present this thing to you because it is
a<00:00:59.850> big<00:01:00.059> object<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
a big object as you see it's like the a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.149 
a big object as you see it's like the a
bucket<00:01:02.910> seat<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.049> car<00:01:04.290> style<00:01:04.680> racing<00:01:04.920> car

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
flat packed it's very easy to construct

one piece with the arms attached to it
and<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.090> case<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.299> bolting<00:01:24.659> these

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and it's just a case of bolting these

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.359 
and it's just a case of bolting these
sides<00:01:25.080> together<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.890> turn<00:01:26.130> this

right here and right there and this is
just<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.880> couple<00:01:33.030> bolts<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.869> hold<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> bike

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
side if we just whizz it right around

mic so you can turn them like that which
is<00:04:14.699> great<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.239> they<00:04:15.299> click<00:04:15.480> into<00:04:15.599> position<00:04:15.989> as

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
is great and they click into position as

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.279 
is great and they click into position as
you<00:04:16.199> can<00:04:16.320> hear<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.690> but<00:04:18.690> what<00:04:18.900> they<00:04:19.049> can't

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
you can hear it and but what they can't

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.060 
you can hear it and but what they can't
do<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.829> take<00:04:20.430> weight<00:04:20.760> so<00:04:21.570> I've<00:04:22.380> got<00:04:22.530> this<00:04:22.620> habit

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
do is take weight so I've got this habit

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.520 
do is take weight so I've got this habit
of<00:04:23.310> when<00:04:23.520> I<00:04:23.550> get<00:04:23.729> out<00:04:23.849> my<00:04:23.880> seat<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.539> lift<00:04:25.289> myself

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
of when I get out my seat I lift myself

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.560 
of when I get out my seat I lift myself
up<00:04:25.919> with<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:27.030> armrests

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
up with the armrests

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.140 
up with the armrests
and<00:04:27.810> then<00:04:28.700> because<00:04:29.700> we've<00:04:29.940> got<00:04:30.030> these

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
and then because we've got these

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150 
and then because we've got these
adjusters<00:04:30.630> on<00:04:30.750> them<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:31.620> can<00:04:31.770> see<00:04:31.950> like<00:04:32.130> just

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
adjusters on them you can see like just

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.710 
adjusters on them you can see like just
there<00:04:32.580> let<00:04:32.700> me<00:04:32.820> get<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.060> better<00:04:33.390> lighting

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
there let me get the better lighting

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.890 
there let me get the better lighting
listen<00:04:34.560> just<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:34.890> just<00:04:35.070> hear<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.720> it's<00:04:36.720> not

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
listen just to just hear and it's not

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.480 
listen just to just hear and it's not
strong<00:04:37.230> enough<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.680> take<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:37.980> weight<00:04:38.160> of<00:04:38.190> me

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
strong enough to take the weight of me

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.080 
strong enough to take the weight of me
so<00:04:38.970> when<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.120> lean<00:04:39.420> on<00:04:39.690> this<00:04:39.900> it<00:04:40.770> falls<00:04:41.520> down<00:04:41.850> and

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
so when I lean on this it falls down and

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.370 
so when I lean on this it falls down and
you<00:04:42.390> feel<00:04:42.540> like<00:04:42.570> you<00:04:42.720> bout<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:42.900> fall<00:04:43.110> for<00:04:43.320> the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
you feel like you bout to fall for the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.710 
you feel like you bout to fall for the
floor<00:04:43.620> that's<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.220> only<00:04:44.670> downside<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.510> this

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
floor that's the only downside to this

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.770 
floor that's the only downside to this
chair<00:04:46.080> is<00:04:46.260> that<00:04:46.890> they<00:04:47.460> don't<00:04:47.670> have<00:04:47.910> any<00:04:48.540> kind

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
chair is that they don't have any kind

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.020 
chair is that they don't have any kind
of<00:04:48.870> locking<00:04:49.380> mechanism<00:04:49.980> right<00:04:50.100> here<00:04:50.160> where

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
of locking mechanism right here where

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.270 
of locking mechanism right here where
this<00:04:51.120> adjuster<00:04:51.570> is<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:51.950> that's<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:52.980> bit<00:04:53.130> of<00:04:53.220> a

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
this adjuster is and that's a bit of a

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.360 
this adjuster is and that's a bit of a
shame<00:04:54.170> it's<00:04:55.170> just<00:04:55.560> just<00:04:55.740> a<00:04:55.860> little<00:04:55.890> bit<00:04:56.280> of<00:04:56.340> a

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
shame it's just just a little bit of a

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.090 
shame it's just just a little bit of a
letdown<00:04:56.550> for<00:04:56.790> that<00:04:57.060> for<00:04:57.240> these<00:04:57.800> what<00:04:58.800> else<00:04:58.950> can

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
letdown for that for these what else can

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.130 
letdown for that for these what else can
I<00:04:59.130> say<00:04:59.190> they<00:04:59.820> are<00:04:59.850> like<00:05:00.120> you<00:05:00.270> know<00:05:00.390> spongy<00:05:01.050> as

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
I say they are like you know spongy as
