00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 ok well great job thanks have 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.890
 found the laptop 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.929
 I knew it and they discovered but the data 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.410
 and the technicians are encrypted 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.410
 working 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.930
 I bet that laptop hides a 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.210
 secret so obscure by so lethal 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.189
 what is this about what you talk about card 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.750
 boarding 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:30.920
 cassano 6 went to washington yesterday it was 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.920
 so why 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.160
 they invited me there to do a 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.540
 interview what kind of interview for a 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.200
 work in a federal task force 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.360
 wait a minute 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.840
 you did an interview for a job at 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.670
 another city and you didn't tell me not 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.560
 I told you because it was just a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.810
 simple interview I knew who 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.730
 would have upset you already in fact are 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.470
 upset I wanted to see what it was 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.320
 it was bad that there is evil too 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.030
 melai kept hidden 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.390
 you lied to me I never would have done 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.420
 castle is not about you talking about it 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.830
 of me it is my life so it is 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.020
 will consider is 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.820
 a unique opportunity I would have the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.710
 chance to do more without me 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.479
 case we have to do so please don't 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.820
 it's about our story what it does 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.979
 don't relate to our story yes 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.960
 will get the job will transfer ie not 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.670
 I will see you more is practically would be the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.560
 end of our relationship or mistake not 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.390
 we can know it and neither can I 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.220
 they will probably not take this 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.470
 the point 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.510
 you knew well 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.530
 what could have resulted and you did not 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.920
 thought to consult me ​​or worse yet 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.220
 you thought about it but chose not to 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.240
 to do it 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.240
 and it tells you this about us 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.990
 not much if you ask me 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.990

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:17.900
