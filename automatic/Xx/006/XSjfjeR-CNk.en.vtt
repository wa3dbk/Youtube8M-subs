00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
perhaps the cross-hatching and a bit of

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.520 
perhaps the cross-hatching and a bit of
a<00:02:18.860> thicker<00:02:19.190> tool<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:22.040> make<00:02:23.530> stippling

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
a thicker tool to make stippling

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.690 
a thicker tool to make stippling
textures<00:02:25.330> or<00:02:27.670> large<00:02:28.870> areas<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:30.020> embossing

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
textures or large areas of embossing

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.000 
textures or large areas of embossing
once<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.850> get<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.390> where<00:02:32.810> I'd<00:02:33.020> like<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.320> now

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
once I get it to where I'd like it now

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.780 
once I get it to where I'd like it now
it's<00:02:34.220> time<00:02:34.460> to<00:02:34.490> apply<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.030> paint<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:36.790> foam

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
it's time to apply the paint a foam

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.460 
it's time to apply the paint a foam
brush<00:02:38.000> works<00:02:38.660> really<00:02:39.110> well<00:02:40.840> for<00:02:41.840> applying<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
brush works really well for applying the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.740 
brush works really well for applying the
paint<00:02:42.710> we'll<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.220> brush<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:43.580> right<00:02:44.330> onto<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
paint we'll just brush it right onto the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.060 
paint we'll just brush it right onto the
print<00:02:44.990> foam<00:02:45.260> here<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:47.690> doesn't<00:02:47.990> drive<00:02:48.470> very

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
print foam here it doesn't drive very

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.960 
print foam here it doesn't drive very
quickly<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.570> don't<00:02:50.750> need<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.110> rush<00:02:51.380> it<00:02:51.970> but

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
quickly so you don't need to rush it but

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.220 
quickly so you don't need to rush it but
you<00:02:53.300> can't<00:02:53.570> drag<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.080> on<00:02:54.290> too<00:02:54.890> much<00:02:55.070> either

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
you can't drag it on too much either

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.850 
you can't drag it on too much either
let's<00:02:57.230> just<00:02:57.500> apply<00:02:57.770> a<00:02:57.890> few<00:02:58.400> colors<00:02:59.710> apply<00:03:00.710> it

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
let's just apply a few colors apply it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.130 
let's just apply a few colors apply it
rather<00:03:01.460> thickly<00:03:04.180> yeah<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.540> next<00:03:05.690> thing<00:03:05.990> I'm

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
rather thickly yeah the next thing I'm

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.900 
rather thickly yeah the next thing I'm
going<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.530> do<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:06.860> use<00:03:07.040> something<00:03:07.460> called<00:03:07.490> a

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
going to do is use something called a

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.200 
going to do is use something called a
color<00:03:08.210> shaper<00:03:08.800> these<00:03:09.800> have<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.130> rubber<00:03:10.520> tip<00:03:10.910> at

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
color shaper these have a rubber tip at

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.930 
color shaper these have a rubber tip at
the<00:03:11.510> end<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:12.200> they<00:03:12.950> are<00:03:13.010> developed<00:03:13.610> for

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
the end and they are developed for

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.350 
the end and they are developed for
precisely<00:03:14.390> what<00:03:14.780> I'm<00:03:14.900> doing<00:03:15.230> right<00:03:15.530> here

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
precisely what I'm doing right here

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.860 
precisely what I'm doing right here
removing<00:03:17.360> some<00:03:17.870> areas<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.620> color<00:03:19.600> they<00:03:20.600> come

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
removing some areas of color they come

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.740 
removing some areas of color they come
in<00:03:20.990> a<00:03:21.050> set<00:03:21.080> with<00:03:21.590> some<00:03:21.770> different<00:03:22.160> shapes<00:03:22.750> so

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
in a set with some different shapes so

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.600 
in a set with some different shapes so
you<00:03:23.840> can<00:03:24.080> get<00:03:24.770> different<00:03:25.070> results<00:03:26.680> okay<00:03:27.680> once

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
you can get different results okay once

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.310 
you can get different results okay once
I<00:03:28.790> get<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.450> where<00:03:29.570> I'd<00:03:29.750> like<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.200> I'm

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
I get this to where I'd like it I'm

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.230 
I get this to where I'd like it I'm
going<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.650> try<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.070> make<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.220> print<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:32.150> I'll

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
going to try and make a print so I'll

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.630 
going to try and make a print so I'll
move<00:03:32.420> my<00:03:32.480> piece<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:33.050> muslin<00:03:33.560> back<00:03:33.800> up<00:03:34.040> here<00:03:34.340> I'm

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
move my piece of muslin back up here I'm

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.750 
move my piece of muslin back up here I'm
going<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.630> turn<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:36.050> over<00:03:36.140> gently<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.920> lay<00:03:37.610> it

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
going to turn it over gently and lay it

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.710 
going to turn it over gently and lay it
in<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.940> corner<00:03:38.410> then<00:03:39.410> I'm<00:03:39.860> going<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.160> press<00:03:40.550> down

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
in a corner then I'm going to press down

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.030 
in a corner then I'm going to press down
firmly<00:03:41.720> with<00:03:42.170> my<00:03:42.950> hands<00:03:44.320> just<00:03:45.320> firm<00:03:45.710> even

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
firmly with my hands just firm even

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.060 
firmly with my hands just firm even
pressure<00:03:47.140> like<00:03:48.140> so<00:03:49.870> now<00:03:50.870> let's<00:03:51.470> lift<00:03:51.770> it<00:03:51.920> and

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
pressure like so now let's lift it and

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.160 
pressure like so now let's lift it and
look<00:03:52.160> what<00:03:52.310> we<00:03:52.430> have<00:03:52.630> that's<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.720> pretty<00:03:53.960> nice

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
look what we have that's a pretty nice

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.570 
look what we have that's a pretty nice
print<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:55.180> could<00:03:56.180> go<00:03:56.390> back<00:03:56.570> now<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.250> ink<00:03:58.250> this

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
print I could go back now and ink this

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.030 
print I could go back now and ink this
up<00:03:58.790> apply<00:03:59.420> some<00:03:59.630> more<00:03:59.780> color<00:04:00.020> again<00:04:00.410> do

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
up apply some more color again do

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.160 
up apply some more color again do
another<00:04:01.310> print<00:04:01.670> on<00:04:01.880> top<00:04:02.150> of<00:04:02.360> that<00:04:02.570> just<00:04:02.990> to<00:04:03.050> get

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
another print on top of that just to get

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.930 
another print on top of that just to get
a<00:04:03.200> little<00:04:03.350> more<00:04:03.530> contrast<00:04:04.160> into<00:04:04.460> it<00:04:04.670> if<00:04:04.760> I'd

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
a little more contrast into it if I'd

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.000 
a little more contrast into it if I'd
like<00:04:05.150> but<00:04:05.840> for<00:04:05.900> now<00:04:06.170> I'm<00:04:06.320> going<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.650> set<00:04:06.890> this

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
like but for now I'm going to set this

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.610 
like but for now I'm going to set this
aside<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.430> dry

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
aside to dry

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.110 
aside to dry
and<00:04:09.760> I'm<00:04:10.760> going<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.090> bring<00:04:11.330> out<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.570> piece<00:04:11.930> here

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
and I'm going to bring out a piece here

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.630 
and I'm going to bring out a piece here
that's<00:04:14.120> already<00:04:14.510> dry<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.170> has<00:04:15.709> been<00:04:15.920> cut<00:04:16.400> down

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
that's already dry and has been cut down

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.090 
that's already dry and has been cut down
to<00:04:16.850> shape<00:04:17.150> now<00:04:18.109> this<00:04:18.260> looks<00:04:18.500> pretty<00:04:18.709> good<00:04:18.830> as

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
to shape now this looks pretty good as

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.340 
to shape now this looks pretty good as
it<00:04:19.250> is<00:04:19.280> but<00:04:20.060> I'd<00:04:20.180> kind<00:04:20.450> of<00:04:20.510> like<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.720> go<00:04:20.930> back<00:04:21.109> in

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
it is but I'd kind of like to go back in

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.409 
it is but I'd kind of like to go back in
there<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.799> define<00:04:22.310> some<00:04:22.340> more<00:04:22.790> of<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.030> shapes

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
there and define some more of the shapes

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.950 
there and define some more of the shapes
so<00:04:23.810> I'm<00:04:24.020> going<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.470> use<00:04:24.770> a<00:04:25.040> fabric<00:04:25.460> marker

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
so I'm going to use a fabric marker

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.409 
so I'm going to use a fabric marker
these<00:04:27.139> are<00:04:27.470> fabric<00:04:28.100> mates<00:04:28.310> superfine<00:04:28.940> markers

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
these are fabric mates superfine markers

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.779 
these are fabric mates superfine markers
as<00:04:30.259> you<00:04:30.380> can<00:04:30.500> see<00:04:30.650> they<00:04:30.800> have<00:04:30.919> a<00:04:30.949> brush<00:04:31.280> tip<00:04:31.550> so

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
as you can see they have a brush tip so

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.990 
as you can see they have a brush tip so
I<00:04:31.850> can<00:04:32.060> get<00:04:32.180> some<00:04:32.389> very<00:04:32.569> fine<00:04:33.020> lines<00:04:33.470> I<00:04:34.000> can

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
I can get some very fine lines I can

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.809 
I can get some very fine lines I can
also<00:04:35.270> turn<00:04:35.599> it<00:04:35.780> over<00:04:35.900> on<00:04:36.020> its<00:04:36.259> side<00:04:36.380> and<00:04:37.069> get

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819
