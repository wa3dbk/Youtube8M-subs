00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 I just bought this thermometer 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.220
 ecological of the new generation ones 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.070
 illusions then used research research 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.200
 but I couldn't lower it 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.900
 really given maybe so much strength and keep it 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.109
 a bit in fact but you know how it is 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.039
 could do well to me it came out well 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.140
 John to lower the thermometer 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.740
 you have to get everything down practically 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.769
 the mercury okay this is not mercury 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.840
 and gallium in his bulb to do this 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.630
 in a genre what you do you take 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.010
 tesla coil the thermometer and slams it 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.329
 so to get the liquid down inside 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.800
 the bulb however rightly with mercury 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.829
 it worked more easily because it was more 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.899
 heavy with this new substance there is to 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.879
 swear your wrist 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.050
 what invented this is the ust of 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.140
 thermometer to the two holes you need 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.469
 pass a string one thread with that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.469
 What do you want 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.810
 perfect tie with string and the two 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:23.090
 end you want to tell me that with a 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.140
 simple string we can solve 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.420
 this problem 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.130
 just you can measure your fever how much 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.750
 without a program lady provides 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.760
 now we have put the thread a 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.280
 in the case it passes from a group hole to a 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.740
 blue hole we put the thermometer back inside 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.910
 perfect but let's see maybe 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.270
 the thermometer was in fact visible 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:52.490
 39 degrees 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:54.950
 ok put it back in so-so thing 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.590
 much on the puppy a place virtually 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.630
 it's not just going to be noticed in the air 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.060
 they were always attentive to you we leave 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.979
 however it does not come out because spinning but 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.250
 against the wall which is as risky as 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.770
 so the centrifugal force does it to me is the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.150
 always force the forms of biking by doing 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:22.310
 turn the thermometer downwards 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.560
 the liquid inside the buna sales or boss 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.090
 I have already chosen has already come down to migrate 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:33.860
 enough vanti a tv bettino is believed 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:37.800
 here for 35 degrees without breaking 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.070
 strength without anything ok 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.660
 they fell completely in place like 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:48.920
 play a little less elastic on purpose 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.920
 and once more measure the earth 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.490
 here
