you can do it to avoid a lot of
obstacles<00:06:11.030> actually<00:06:16.270> yes<00:06:17.710> alright<00:06:18.710> i<00:06:20.110> think

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
obstacles actually yes alright i think

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.050 
obstacles actually yes alright i think
actually<00:06:21.350> there<00:06:21.890> are<00:06:21.980> only<00:06:22.100> two<00:06:22.430> levels<00:06:22.790> left

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
actually there are only two levels left

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:30.870 
actually there are only two levels left
to<00:06:23.240> go<00:06:24.580> so<00:06:27.850> because<00:06:28.850> i<00:06:29.140> do<00:06:30.140> have<00:06:30.260> enough<00:06:30.500> time

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
to go so because i do have enough time

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.980 
to go so because i do have enough time
you<00:06:31.880> know<00:06:32.000> what<00:06:32.150> I'm<00:06:32.240> just<00:06:32.270> going<00:06:32.450> to<00:06:32.600> complete

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
you know what I'm just going to complete

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.420 
you know what I'm just going to complete
it<00:06:33.140> now<00:06:34.570> basically<00:06:35.570> and<00:06:35.810> if<00:06:36.650> it<00:06:36.800> runs<00:06:37.010> into<00:06:37.280> two

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
it now basically and if it runs into two

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.310 
it now basically and if it runs into two
videos<00:06:37.820> it<00:06:38.120> will<00:06:38.150> have<00:06:38.330> a<00:06:38.360> part<00:06:38.660> 1<00:06:38.900> at<00:06:39.050> a<00:06:39.110> part

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
videos it will have a part 1 at a part

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:47.050 
videos it will have a part 1 at a part
to<00:06:39.760> make<00:06:40.760> sense<00:06:44.710> checkpoint<00:06:45.710> Oh<00:06:46.370> is<00:06:46.880> there<00:06:47.000> a

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
to make sense checkpoint Oh is there a

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.090 
to make sense checkpoint Oh is there a
bat<00:06:47.270> following<00:06:47.660> me<00:06:47.810> yes<00:06:47.990> there<00:06:48.200> is<00:06:48.610> die

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.910 

so<00:06:52.970> let's<00:06:53.390> see<00:06:53.750> this<00:06:54.050> is<00:06:54.200> just<00:06:54.350> this<00:06:54.860> is

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:54.920 
so let's see this is just this is

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.890 
so let's see this is just this is
actually<00:06:55.400> the<00:06:55.580> first<00:06:55.730> temple<00:06:56.330> level<00:06:56.600> repeat

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
actually the first temple level repeat

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.840 
actually the first temple level repeat
it<00:06:57.050> again<00:06:57.290> but<00:06:57.530> the<00:06:57.680> error<00:06:58.100> you<00:06:58.340> have<00:06:58.370> to<00:06:58.640> go<00:06:58.790> to

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:58.850 
it again but the error you have to go to

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.830 
it again but the error you have to go to
is<00:06:59.180> different<00:07:00.970> it's<00:07:01.970> a<00:07:02.300> little<00:07:02.450> bit<00:07:02.660> more

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 
is different it's a little bit more

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.570 
is different it's a little bit more
tricky<00:07:03.110> to<00:07:03.320> get<00:07:03.470> to<00:07:03.680> us<00:07:03.800> actually<00:07:06.550> five<00:07:07.550> I
