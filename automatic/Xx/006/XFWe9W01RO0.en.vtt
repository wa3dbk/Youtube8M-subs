a<00:00:04.680> quick<00:00:05.250> review<00:00:05.520> on<00:00:05.970> this<00:00:06.420> as<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.259> chassis<00:00:08.189> but

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
a quick review on this as to chassis but

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.419 
a quick review on this as to chassis but
I<00:00:10.190> modified<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.509> do<00:00:12.660> add<00:00:12.960> some<00:00:13.259> carbon<00:00:13.920> at

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
I modified it so I do add some carbon at

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.359 
I modified it so I do add some carbon at
the<00:00:14.460> front<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> back<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.660> bearings<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
the front and the back and bearings and

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:25.519 
the front and the back and bearings and
this<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:18.680> call<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.570> super<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.920> evil<00:00:24.529> ok

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
this I call it as the super to evil ok

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.980 
this I call it as the super to evil ok
so<00:00:26.449> it<00:00:27.449> does<00:00:27.720> looks<00:00:28.170> like<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:29.010> mess<00:00:29.519> evil<00:00:29.990> well

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
so it does looks like a mess evil well

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.130 
so it does looks like a mess evil well
the<00:00:31.230> ball<00:00:31.500> caps<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:34.969> accept<00:00:35.969> bearings<00:00:36.750> and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the ball caps the accept bearings and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.340 
the ball caps the accept bearings and
the<00:00:37.670> rims<00:00:38.670> carbon<00:00:39.239> rims<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.989> tires<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.180> the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
the rims carbon rims the tires and the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
the rims carbon rims the tires and the
internal<00:00:43.350> pot<00:00:48.710> well<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.129> something<00:00:50.670> similar

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
internal pot well it's something similar

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.029 
internal pot well it's something similar
to<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.960> MS<00:00:52.920> evil<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.719> don't<00:00:55.350> call<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.739> as

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to the MS evil so I don't call this as

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.319 
to the MS evil so I don't call this as
the<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.550> -<00:00:56.910> Evo<00:00:57.360> codes<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:57.930> quite<00:00:58.469> very<00:00:59.329> quite

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the as - Evo codes it's quite very quite

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.590 
the as - Evo codes it's quite very quite
unique<00:01:00.719> well<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.219> say<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.059> chassis

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
unique well as I say that this chassis

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.590 
unique well as I say that this chassis
just<00:01:03.899> looks<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.530> vs<00:01:04.890> zero<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:06.030> maybe<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
just looks like the vs zero so maybe I

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.330 
just looks like the vs zero so maybe I
think<00:01:06.720> maybe<00:01:07.260> comedy<00:01:09.200> as<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.619> Evo<00:01:10.950> should<00:01:11.220> be

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
think maybe comedy as to Evo should be

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.660 
think maybe comedy as to Evo should be
look<00:01:11.580> good<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> car<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.159> not

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
look good so this is a car that is not

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.270 
look good so this is a car that is not
gonna<00:01:15.600> pass<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:18.210> technical<00:01:19.170> track<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.009> it

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
gonna pass the technical track but it

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.359 
gonna pass the technical track but it
dude<00:01:20.610> pass<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.390> speech<00:01:21.960> track<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.619> but

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
dude pass the speech track I think but

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.899 
dude pass the speech track I think but
this<00:01:24.119> should<00:01:24.600> be<00:01:24.750> able<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.200> enter<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.400> stock

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
this should be able to enter the stock

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.840 
this should be able to enter the stock
race<00:01:27.180> because<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:29.130> should<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.400> fast

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
race because it's it should be fast

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.230 
race because it's it should be fast
enough<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.590> run<00:01:31.590> out<00:01:31.799> run<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> stock<00:01:33.000> race

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
enough to run out run for a stock race

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.230 
enough to run out run for a stock race
so<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.869> normal<00:01:37.530> setting<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.430> so

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
so this is the normal setting of it so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.800 
so this is the normal setting of it so
here<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.630> got<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.350> trio<00:01:40.770> bearings<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.810> then
