00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820
 no 6 thousand euros anyway on Sundays 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.309
 Easter that sucks what sucks 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.429
 easter you do n't like eggs I do n't 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.580
 like the easter because it was a loser party 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.150
 it is still a party but it is so little 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.880
 stream maestre means how the rooms the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.740
 mainstream christmas easter no because 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.380
 mid-August and never stream that centers at 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.359
 mid- August and mid-summer holidays 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.740
 Easter holidays are short of canvases 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.660
 fill with lesson 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.340
 I never did it and all that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.070
 chocolate , chocolate and chocolate 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.020
 dark milk or milk milk cheese 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.910
 sure how old you are of me 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.860
 asks the age a lady is still me 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
 like pralines not to mention the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.059
 surprises everyone likes surprises i 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.530
 speak how cable do it to insert a 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.020
 plush in an easter egg without 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.059
 break it how can you not make you come 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.500
 thoughts and open when they put us on 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.910
 plush and in any case there are not only i 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.420
 plush last year found us a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.850
 baby mouse 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.010
 then escaped and all those poor 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.570
 Lambs kill billions of animals 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.280
 all year and all worries of the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.340
 lambs but that has to do with lamb and 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.920
 cute since I know I do n't like it not 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.900
 you like d'aniello no it disgusts me 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.010
 all that fat and then when it's cooked 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.930
 it smells like my grandfather 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.490
 and then the nef but look 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.770
 a wing that sucks the lamb to me 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.820
 we must exterminate them all is then excused 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.009
 a healthier man 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.380
 no no is that every morning it burned 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.960
 the beard cut it like that was crazy 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.970
 no he didn't know about the treasures anyway 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.189
 point is that I don't like Easter 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.369
 these commercial commercial parties 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.380
 certainly the jesus where we put it to anchor 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.630
 this story of jesus is certainly easter yes 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.549
 celebrates that Jesus is risen to as 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.920
 Jesus is risen we eat the lamb 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.180
 we open the eggs fantastic and absurd not 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.680
 you like the easter but you like the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.630
 mid - August in ferragosto mica yes 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.610
 celebrates christ walking on the sea 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.970
 possible that you do not see the nuances you are 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.280
 so obtuse dull to die of the obtuse a 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.149
 me are the ones like you who gave us 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.680
 the talent shows 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.810
 now it's my fault if they do talent 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.140
 show and cooking programs and michael 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.390
 bay 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.960
 but how petulant you are but there is one thing 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.960
 that you like 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.980
 the wing art needle and why you like it 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.080
 we feel I don't know the waffle that wraps 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.390
 the cream that hides unexpectedly 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.760
 surprise the caramel is a metaphor 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.590
 you don't know about life 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.590
 ok i don't know but at least it's mainstream 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.280
 very good if you liked the video 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.989
 put on a nice like and sign up e 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.269
 go see the canteen canal does 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.220
 a very nice and good random show 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.220
