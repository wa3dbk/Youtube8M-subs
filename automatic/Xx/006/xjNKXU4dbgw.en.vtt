of you guys have friends so based on the
color<00:02:57.130> scheme<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.790> how<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.030> got<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.270> rotate

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
color scheme is how you got to rotate

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.420 
color scheme is how you got to rotate
these<00:02:58.870> dials<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.440> can't<00:03:02.739> ascribe<00:03:03.160> them

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
these dials so I can't ascribe them

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.260
