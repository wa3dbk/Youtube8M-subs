talked<00:00:13.119> to<00:00:13.209> you<00:00:13.269> I<00:00:13.329> think<00:00:13.389> we<00:00:13.690> were<00:00:13.839> still<00:00:14.110> we

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:14.379 
talked to you I think we were still we

talked to you I think we were still we
just<00:00:14.619> gettin<00:00:14.889> started<00:00:15.009> on<00:00:15.309> the<00:00:15.400> scenery<00:00:15.699> here

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
just gettin started on the scenery here

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.169 
just gettin started on the scenery here
of<00:00:16.570> the<00:00:16.720> of<00:00:17.289> the<00:00:17.439> helix<00:00:17.769> and<00:00:17.920> since<00:00:18.820> that<00:00:18.970> time

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:19.179 
of the of the helix and since that time

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.939 
of the of the helix and since that time
we've<00:00:19.449> gone<00:00:19.570> through<00:00:19.630> we've<00:00:20.050> strengthened<00:00:20.890> it

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
we've gone through we've strengthened it

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.579 
we've gone through we've strengthened it
up<00:00:21.070> with<00:00:21.220> some<00:00:21.369> more<00:00:21.490> plaster<00:00:22.019> it<00:00:23.019> was<00:00:23.169> a<00:00:23.199> it

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:23.589 
up with some more plaster it was a it

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:24.960 
up with some more plaster it was a it
was<00:00:23.650> showing<00:00:24.160> too<00:00:24.250> much<00:00:24.279> flexing<00:00:24.730> we<00:00:24.789> didn't

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
was showing too much flexing we didn't

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.540 
was showing too much flexing we didn't
like<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.119> way<00:00:25.210> it<00:00:25.240> was<00:00:25.359> going<00:00:25.390> so<00:00:26.380> I<00:00:27.039> thought

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
like the way it was going so I thought

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.040 
like the way it was going so I thought
up<00:00:27.669> there<00:00:27.849> and<00:00:28.029> now<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.480> latest<00:00:28.630> aids<00:00:28.960> were

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
up there and now the latest aids were

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.689 
up there and now the latest aids were
working<00:00:29.349> on<00:00:29.439> is<00:00:29.589> getting<00:00:29.829> some<00:00:30.009> some<00:00:30.429> tunnel

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
working on is getting some some tunnel

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.030 
working on is getting some some tunnel
portals<00:00:31.029> in<00:00:31.089> place<00:00:31.269> so<00:00:32.079> that<00:00:32.110> we<00:00:32.680> can<00:00:32.800> get<00:00:32.920> on

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
portals in place so that we can get on

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.950 
portals in place so that we can get on
with<00:00:33.070> the<00:00:33.340> rest<00:00:33.490> of<00:00:33.580> the<00:00:33.670> scenery<00:00:33.880> and<00:00:34.360> it

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
with the rest of the scenery and it

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.120 
with the rest of the scenery and it
started<00:00:35.230> getting<00:00:35.380> some<00:00:35.440> real<00:00:35.620> color<00:00:35.830> some

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
started getting some real color some

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.380 
started getting some real color some
trees<00:00:36.310> and<00:00:36.340> some<00:00:36.610> rocks<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:36.940> stuff<00:00:37.120> like<00:00:37.240> that

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
trees and some rocks and stuff like that

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.120 
trees and some rocks and stuff like that
in<00:00:37.510> place<00:00:37.720> so<00:00:37.990> we've<00:00:38.560> got<00:00:38.680> a<00:00:38.710> couple<00:00:38.950> here

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
in place so we've got a couple here

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.740 
in place so we've got a couple here
fitted<00:00:39.490> here<00:00:39.670> behind<00:00:40.000> here<00:00:40.420> we've<00:00:40.540> got<00:00:40.690> a

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
fitted here behind here we've got a

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.350 
fitted here behind here we've got a
couple<00:00:41.020> what<00:00:41.830> we<00:00:41.980> did<00:00:42.160> until<00:00:42.490> like<00:00:42.670> that<00:00:43.240> when

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
couple what we did until like that when

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.050 
couple what we did until like that when
we<00:00:44.020> have<00:00:44.110> a<00:00:44.170> couple<00:00:44.350> tunnel<00:00:44.950> portals<00:00:45.250> or<00:00:45.640> sorry

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
we have a couple tunnel portals or sorry

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.600 
we have a couple tunnel portals or sorry
tunnel<00:00:46.570> liners<00:00:46.810> and<00:00:46.990> stuff<00:00:47.170> in<00:00:47.320> place<00:00:47.410> just<00:00:47.770> to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
tunnel liners and stuff in place just to

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.250 
tunnel liners and stuff in place just to
block<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:49.000> light<00:00:49.150> as<00:00:49.330> they<00:00:49.690> come<00:00:49.960> around<00:00:50.080> the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
block the light as they come around the

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.710 
block the light as they come around the
corners<00:00:50.620> a<00:00:50.800> bridge<00:00:51.640> this<00:00:51.880> will<00:00:52.060> eventually<00:00:52.270> be

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
corners a bridge this will eventually be

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.650 
corners a bridge this will eventually be
a<00:00:53.730> series<00:00:54.730> of<00:00:56.580> deck<00:00:57.580> girders<00:00:57.910> that<00:00:58.540> we're

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
a series of deck girders that we're

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.020 
a series of deck girders that we're
basically<00:00:58.750> just<00:00:58.990> gonna<00:00:59.140> put<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.710> wood<00:01:00.670> pieces

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
basically just gonna put the wood pieces

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.460 
basically just gonna put the wood pieces
on<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.240> outside<00:01:01.570> so<00:01:01.840> kind<00:01:02.050> of<00:01:02.110> cheating<00:01:02.410> a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
on the outside so kind of cheating a

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.750 
on the outside so kind of cheating a
little<00:01:02.500> bit<00:01:02.800> but<00:01:02.980> it'll<00:01:03.130> achieve<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.580> same

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
little bit but it'll achieve the same

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.660 
little bit but it'll achieve the same
effect<00:01:04.500> down<00:01:05.500> here<00:01:05.860> we<00:01:06.340> have<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.950> guess<00:01:09.550> an

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
effect down here we have a I guess an

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.070 
effect down here we have a I guess an
avalanche<00:01:09.970> dead<00:01:10.240> protect<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.720> trains<00:01:10.930> that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
avalanche dead protect the trains that

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.600 
avalanche dead protect the trains that
come<00:01:11.290> out<00:01:11.440> of<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.590> tunnels<00:01:11.860> I'll<00:01:12.370> likely

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
come out of the tunnels I'll likely

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.340 
come out of the tunnels I'll likely
extend<00:01:13.120> the<00:01:13.270> scenery<00:01:13.690> out<00:01:13.810> here<00:01:13.960> a<00:01:13.990> little<00:01:14.230> bit

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
extend the scenery out here a little bit

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.570 
extend the scenery out here a little bit
and<00:01:14.500> make<00:01:14.650> it<00:01:14.770> look<00:01:14.890> like<00:01:15.010> some<00:01:15.220> rocks<00:01:15.430> are

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
and make it look like some rocks are

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.880 
and make it look like some rocks are
coming<00:01:15.700> down<00:01:15.940> this<00:01:16.540> is<00:01:16.750> designed<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.620> kind<00:01:17.860> of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
coming down this is designed and kind of

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.910 
coming down this is designed and kind of
modeled<00:01:18.220> after<00:01:18.370> the<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:20.050> same<00:01:20.500> avalanche

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
modeled after the the same avalanche

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.860 
modeled after the the same avalanche

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
Canyon I wouldn't be seen stuff like

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.520 
Canyon I wouldn't be seen stuff like
your<00:01:24.880> White<00:01:25.000> River<00:01:25.210> Canyon<00:01:25.990> or<00:01:26.260> something

your White River Canyon or something
like<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:26.680> I<00:01:26.800> got<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.730> mixed<00:01:27.940> up<00:01:28.030> with<00:01:28.120> it<00:01:28.240> all

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
like that I got a mixed up with it all

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.930 
like that I got a mixed up with it all
this<00:01:28.480> so<00:01:29.260> that's<00:01:29.440> some<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.680> that<00:01:29.770> there<00:01:30.040> the

river<00:01:42.820> that<00:01:43.030> we're<00:01:43.150> modeling<00:01:43.570> after<00:01:43.690> in<00:01:43.990> BC

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
river that we're modeling after in BC

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.130 
river that we're modeling after in BC
for<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.770> Mackenzie<00:01:45.130> River<00:01:45.159> Mackenzie<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:46.540> only

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
for the Mackenzie River Mackenzie I only

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.730 
for the Mackenzie River Mackenzie I only
know<00:01:47.260> if<00:01:47.350> I<00:01:47.440> think<00:01:47.799> it's<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:49.320> what<00:01:50.320> our<00:01:50.440> Frazer

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
know if I think it's the what our Frazer

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.990 
know if I think it's the what our Frazer
drivers<00:01:51.070> can<00:01:51.220> all<00:01:51.310> pray<00:01:51.490> for<00:01:51.670> their<00:01:51.760> mind<00:01:51.909> is

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
drivers can all pray for their mind is

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.110 
drivers can all pray for their mind is
what<00:01:52.150> I<00:01:52.180> have<00:01:52.330> in<00:01:52.360> mind<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:54.220> end<00:01:54.370> both<00:01:54.670> run

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
what I have in mind the end both run

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.359 
what I have in mind the end both run
through<00:01:55.330> there<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.920> spiral<00:01:56.920> tunnels<00:01:57.190> aren't

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
through there the spiral tunnels aren't

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.710 
through there the spiral tunnels aren't
too<00:01:57.490> far<00:01:57.700> from<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:57.909> area<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.330> believe<00:01:58.360> as<00:01:58.690> well

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
too far from that area I believe as well

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.109 
too far from that area I believe as well
-<00:01:59.020> yeah<00:01:59.170> so<00:01:59.650> kind<00:01:59.860> of<00:01:59.920> mimicking<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.670> area<00:02:01.000> we

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
- yeah so kind of mimicking that area we

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.390 
- yeah so kind of mimicking that area we
just<00:02:01.330> paid<00:02:01.540> some<00:02:01.720> rapids<00:02:02.080> and<00:02:02.290> some<00:02:02.590> Swift

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
just paid some rapids and some Swift

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.469

through here and you can come to what's

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.130

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
really going to be I think the pride and

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.090 
really going to be I think the pride and
joy<00:02:08.259> of<00:02:08.289> the

they're<00:02:27.790> pretty<00:02:28.060> much<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.450> scale<00:02:28.690> for<00:02:29.110> for

it's pretty cool many many hours you saw
when<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.660> want<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.930> think<00:02:35.170> about<00:02:35.230> the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
when you want to think about the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.630 
when you want to think about the
hundreds<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:35.800> hours<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.070> he's<00:02:36.220> put<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.430> there

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
hundreds of hours that he's put in there

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.740 
hundreds of hours that he's put in there
in<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.060> end<00:02:37.180> it's<00:02:37.300> going<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.480> give<00:02:37.600> us<00:02:37.630> a

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
in the end it's going to give us a

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.840 
in the end it's going to give us a
really<00:02:37.990> breathtaking<00:02:38.200> scene<00:02:38.740> that<00:02:38.980> they'd

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
really breathtaking scene that they'd

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.040 
really breathtaking scene that they'd
ever<00:02:39.880> be<00:02:40.120> able<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.390> see<00:02:40.570> as<00:02:40.690> they<00:02:40.810> come<00:02:40.960> to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
ever be able to see as they come to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.610 
ever be able to see as they come to
visit<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.410> site<00:02:42.750> as<00:02:43.750> we<00:02:44.080> progress<00:02:44.260> that

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
visit the site as we progress that

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.810 
visit the site as we progress that
Millay<00:02:44.860> oh<00:02:44.890> you'll<00:02:45.160> see<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.460> we've<00:02:45.580> ripped

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
Millay oh you'll see that we've ripped

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.630 
Millay oh you'll see that we've ripped
out<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.030> whole<00:02:46.450> bunch<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.080> track<00:02:47.460> pretty<00:02:48.460> much

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
out a whole bunch a track pretty much

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.510 
out a whole bunch a track pretty much
forty<00:02:49.240> feet<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.840> would<00:02:50.110> say<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:51.340> goal

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
forty feet of it I would say the goal

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.890 
forty feet of it I would say the goal
here<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.850> we're<00:02:52.030> never<00:02:52.150> really<00:02:52.420> happy<00:02:52.750> with

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
here is we're never really happy with

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.030 
here is we're never really happy with
the<00:02:53.020> design<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.290> we've<00:02:53.560> had<00:02:53.680> before

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
the design that we've had before

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.270 
the design that we've had before
and<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.330> idea<00:02:55.630> is<00:02:55.930> we<00:02:56.770> have<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:56.920> new<00:02:57.070> track

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
and so the idea is we have a new track

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.490 
and so the idea is we have a new track
plan<00:02:57.490> there's<00:02:57.670> going<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.820> be<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:57.940> large<00:02:58.260> yard<00:02:59.260> in

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
plan there's going to be a large yard in

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.830 
plan there's going to be a large yard in
place<00:02:59.710> modeled<00:03:00.250> after<00:03:00.370> kind<00:03:01.330> of<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.480> hybrid<00:03:01.690> of

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
place modeled after kind of a hybrid of

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.570 
place modeled after kind of a hybrid of
a<00:03:01.990> couple<00:03:02.260> yards<00:03:02.380> in<00:03:02.620> Alberta<00:03:02.950> at<00:03:03.160> meeting<00:03:03.460> at

a couple yards in Alberta at meeting at

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.540 
a couple yards in Alberta at meeting at
Calgary<00:03:03.970> area<00:03:04.290> with<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.410> main<00:03:05.560> line<00:03:05.740> passing

through along the edge of them and
things<00:03:07.750> like<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:07.900> we're<00:03:08.770> trying<00:03:08.950> something

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
things like that we're trying something

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.920 
things like that we're trying something
