00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello, how are I going to show you a 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:10.960
 tool that I do not know if they are going to give 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:14.139
 some or something like that but 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.990
 it serves for many things then this 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:22.460
 tool is called ricky show 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:26.060
 and it simply helps us to get the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.190
 chords of a youtube song 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.890
 surprising is not everything 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.500
 is a great help for newbies because 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.750
 example 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.260
 let's say the people that 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.280
 you do not have a good ear and that's fine 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.789
 that they take out their music by ear and all that 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.309
 but then you can get them out of some 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.250
 trouble of sometime or something like that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.710
 we know it 's good to have it suddenly 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.829
 you will be teaching 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.590
 some people about guitars about 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.440
 music classes and you can use this 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.100
 same so that they start to take out 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.890
 your own songs 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.570
 then how it works is on the page 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.760
 a connect and we're going to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.180
 to see an example then I even have 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.180
 a video 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.479
 attracted to me 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.159
 this group is from here of ibaguÃ© what 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.090
 I recommend a lot 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:40.390
 I do not know of them I where it ends but 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.180
 well to say so part of we have 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.640
 crossed words 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.300
 but I like I like the style of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.840
 them a little bit like that nice 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.460
 flashy to dedicate haha and I'll 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.490
 I recommend then what are we going 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.140
 to do with this let's copy the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.000
 YouTube address 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.760
 and we're going to hit the bed and we give the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.150
 sun button depp 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.150
 and ready we start we wait for a moment 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.130
 we hope we wait 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.200
 Y 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.580
 here it is 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.580
 it's how you can see in the chords 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.260
 before putting it to sound I want you to see 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.920
 something 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.930
 here the chords come out but here we can 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.420
 download it 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.829
 here it comes out I remembered obviously they are going to 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.959
 escape some weird that does not have then 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:58.359
 that's kind of a bit complicated that 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.280
 that goes perfect like this also 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.700
 are basic chords is not that they're going to 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.389
 leave chords those that are truly 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.780
 no but it's for as to take 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:13.350
 tonality that 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.040
 harmony a song if it's like to 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.170
 that use 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.959
 and let's say they are in love that they want to take 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.739
 a quick song from a person I do not know 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.049
 that is not so famous but something like that here 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.250
 we can use this program then how 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:32.740
 come there it comes out 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.740
 saleh the chords by bars 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.600
 then we are going to reproduce it so that 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.600
 see how it is 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.940
 l 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.170
 then as you can see 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.170
 ah 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:32.940
 in society 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.879
 then as you can see it works 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.530
 perfect you can lose your perfect no 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:43.949
 but if you give us the chords that of the 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.840
 harmony then you will give him 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.409
 the use that you want to this one 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.590
 but I recommend it for newbies and for 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:54.539
 those who already know a lot is also a 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.270
 good tool that you will give 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:00.599
 its one then I recommend it a lot and 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.409
 let's go see more tools more 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:07.139
 forward of different things remember 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.889
 that everything is to strengthen what is 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.860
 music and note 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:15.039
 then I say goodbye for now 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.689

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:21.669
