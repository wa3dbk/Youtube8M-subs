00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.160
 the beech hedge and the hornbeam so there run around the longest day of how you namely 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.160
 only to be pruned once 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.049
 the tops 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.710
 today pruning bass if the right ones are also awarded 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.439
 if and how people don't know is the difference between a hornbeam and one 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.029
 beech hedge 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.580
 I'll show you the difference 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.130
 the farc or articles 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.450
 breaker 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.190
 it picks up the larger leaves 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.420
 fewer cartels 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.370
 the cup in the b pool f the hornbeam 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.440
 and close to the leaves and I try scribbled 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.970
 this one 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.730
 because in the cold 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.290
 keep this way 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.230
 in the spring it becomes brown leaf 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.230
 hours are kept out by the staff 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.330
 Debate the cartels is the cabins or the artwork a blowout with paris 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
 or in the bank 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 used to pruning increased today 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.790
 the doorbell rings too large or the height can be fine with a tendency 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.820
 side scissors it works ready 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.360
 especially if I am less experienced I use scissors easier to work with 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.020
 work slower in more controllable 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.430
 and so you make minister camp 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.240
 to cut away anyway 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.240
 you can use a line 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.940
 or redeem the wrist 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.300
 that we do that 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.830
 Keep in mind though that you need the top slightly narrower this on the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.440
 bottom this is at 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.780
 enough light also at the bottom the viewers 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.900
 wouldn't do this 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.470
 but good hedge at the bottom less good 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.040
 and especially the break and for days the fastest suffered yes and what 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.310
 furthermore you have to go from the top 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.080
 its important that you unload it 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.250
 takes it off 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.949
 all packages 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.629
 but everything with a stream outside 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.999
 this a very ugly sight 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.459
 in this case it does not matter whether the first one can do it 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.679
 or the top 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.319
 the plan usually makes 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.319
 leader 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.049
 a beech hedge wrong in the afternoon 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.399
 not much of a problem 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.439
 eyi he sets incredibly fast 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.439
 we should not worry about that 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.809
 hard hedge not with much sun 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:45.129
 also here field that applies among other things to matters 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.389
 in the past quarter 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.969
 and that actually applies to all customers 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.659
 by burning the barbarians and badger just plan the face
