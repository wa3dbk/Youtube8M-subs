00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.570
 in the design of circles and circle 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:12.120
 So offer changes like one 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.260
 rounding up and down and must be at the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.460
 watch for a few more points 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:24.480
 the first point concerns the format of the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:29.760
 formats in whole circles or 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.309
 Drilling is always considered a diameter 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.780
 stated 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.239
 you'll see that even up here with the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.579
 drawing 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:42.719
 So I have to sign this diameter 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.579
 it is essential to me at the juso 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.700
 okay now this is about 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.649
 a flat and sometimes when you are 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.930
 also give a task or something 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.710
 then it is not always clear it is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.480
 is a circle or rectangle or something and so on 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 further and on the basis of this diameter 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.619
 sign you recognize okay well here 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.119
 it must necessarily be a 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.920
 speak at rounding off as here the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:17.070
 case we have to specify the radius 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.650
 Here, instead of the diameter sign 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:25.700
 its prescribed at 1 rounds 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.700
 it is the same 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.880
 that was the format that was in the house of 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.160
 the changes so circle a file 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.650
 circle is always over the 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:46.260
 center point it sees it once 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.540
 in the example here you have one 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.350
 circle and over the center 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.440
 That's exactly how it is laid out 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.110
 now here at the apartment 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.420
 I have my focus here now 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.900
 comes with line or center axes 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.610
 drawn here and by the 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.130
 center then eradicated the parties 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.190
 or the warehouse and 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.060
 here exactly the same again 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.310
 middle point if from here becomes then the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.830
 council is set speaking is yes then 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:31.200
 here too all of the camp then me 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.260
 still characterize the whole plant in the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.520
 The focus of travel always has to be 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.320
 you have to be stated 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.380
 just sorry and be it a part price 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.900
 or a whole circle and then I do 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.880
 as first small middle axis pure and 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.410
 then wear from the center to 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.020
 center point my situation from exactly like that 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.950
 it is also in the partial circles only 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.489
 once set the midpoint of 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.880
 circle and then the measure accordingly 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.880
 for sling 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.099
 as he briefly summarized again 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:18.799
 whole circles antaike will be travel 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:20.840
 the format whole circle here the format 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.780
 is very important that I here the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:32.180
 Diameter shows with indicate at dough 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:37.790
 it is here with radius tear too 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:40.069
 to deal with radios the situation measured 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.120
 conveys point from the respective 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.889
 circle or part circle 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.079
 measured 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:50.000
 is also important because I have to 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.220
 also the circle the center 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.849
 plug in and the measure is yes then too 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:04:00.530
 Decisive for me it brings nothing 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.900
 I now know the circle of this body 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:11.530
 knew far 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:11.530
 I had to take a lot of castro
