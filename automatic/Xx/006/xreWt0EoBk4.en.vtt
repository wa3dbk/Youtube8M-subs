00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
or pick it like hammering it on I I find

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.900 
or pick it like hammering it on I I find
that<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:40.700> more<00:01:40.910> little<00:01:41.210> slurs<00:01:41.509> hammers<00:01:42.200> pulls

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
that the more little slurs hammers pulls

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.029 
that the more little slurs hammers pulls
slides<00:01:44.590> etc<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:45.770> we<00:01:45.890> put<00:01:46.130> into<00:01:46.310> our<00:01:46.429> playing

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
slides etc that we put into our playing

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.400 
slides etc that we put into our playing
serve<00:01:49.039> kind<00:01:49.670> of<00:01:49.819> as<00:01:49.940> our<00:01:50.149> our<00:01:50.509> benchmark<00:01:51.170> the

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
serve kind of as our our benchmark the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.380 
serve kind of as our our benchmark the
thing<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:51.860> makes<00:01:52.100> us<00:01:52.310> sound<00:01:52.550> like<00:01:52.700> us<00:01:53.030> so

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
thing that makes us sound like us so

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.419 
thing that makes us sound like us so
where<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.140> might<00:01:54.440> hammer<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:54.950> might<00:01:55.130> pick

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
where I might hammer you might pick

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.279 
where I might hammer you might pick
where<00:01:55.759> I<00:01:55.789> might<00:01:56.090> pull<00:01:56.390> off<00:01:56.569> you<00:01:56.840> might<00:01:57.050> pick

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
where I might pull off you might pick

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.029 
where I might pull off you might pick
where<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:57.770> might<00:01:58.069> pick<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.459> might<00:01:58.640> pull<00:01:58.819> off<00:01:58.970> so

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
where you might pick I might pull off so

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.540 
where you might pick I might pull off so
anyway<00:02:01.390> let's<00:02:02.390> go<00:02:02.709> six<00:02:03.709> to<00:02:03.860> seven<00:02:04.250> on<00:02:04.369> the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
string twice and that first one's gonna

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.840 
string twice and that first one's gonna
be<00:02:34.080> cut<00:02:34.760> it's<00:02:35.760> not<00:02:37.220> because<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.340> notice<00:02:38.520> we

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
be cut it's not because you notice we

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.660 
be cut it's not because you notice we
have<00:02:38.880> yet<00:02:39.450> another<00:02:39.630> little<00:02:40.260> sixteenth<00:02:40.890> rest

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
have yet another little sixteenth rest

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.040 
have yet another little sixteenth rest
in<00:02:41.910> there<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.270> that's<00:02:42.330> just<00:02:42.510> our<00:02:42.840> way<00:02:43.020> of

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
in there and that's just our way of

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.820 
in there and that's just our way of
making<00:02:43.650> those<00:02:44.490> two<00:02:44.760> notes<00:02:45.000> have<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.830> definite

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
making those two notes have a definite

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.270 
making those two notes have a definite
spot<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.820> know<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.180> between<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:52.320> with<00:02:53.250> a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
spot you know in between and with a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.760 
spot you know in between and with a
fretted<00:02:53.730> note<00:02:53.910> that's<00:02:54.210> not<00:02:54.390> bent<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.440> very

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
fretted note that's not bent it's very

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.510 
fretted note that's not bent it's very
easy<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.690> manipulate<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.470> manage<00:02:58.650> its

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
easy to manipulate and manage its

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.060 
easy to manipulate and manage its
duration<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:00.540> by<00:03:00.690> reducing<00:03:01.290> you're

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
duration just by reducing you're

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.500 
duration just by reducing you're
releasing<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.640> pressure<00:03:02.880> with<00:03:03.180> your<00:03:03.210> left

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
releasing the pressure with your left

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.660 
releasing the pressure with your left
hand<00:03:08.060> that's<00:03:09.060> that's<00:03:09.840> very<00:03:10.170> critical<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.430> we

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
hand that's that's very critical that we

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.910 
hand that's that's very critical that we
have<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.120> be<00:03:12.270> able<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:13.640> choose<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.920> duration
