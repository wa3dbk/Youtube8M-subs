think one of the biggest things that I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.730 
think one of the biggest things that I
ever<00:02:03.450> figured<00:02:03.960> out<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.200> golf<00:02:04.380> swing<00:02:04.439> was

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
ever figured out in the golf swing was

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.340 
ever figured out in the golf swing was
that<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.460> hitting<00:02:05.729> down<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.200> absolutely<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
that that hitting down is absolutely the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.749 
that that hitting down is absolutely the
worst<00:02:07.740> thing<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.489> hitting<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
worst thing that you can do it hitting a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.530 
worst thing that you can do it hitting a
golf<00:02:08.910> ball<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.860> talked<00:02:11.459> about

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
golf ball and so I talked about

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.300 
golf ball and so I talked about
