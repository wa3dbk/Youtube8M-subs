well for what he was doing it Rockland's
but<00:01:42.719> he<00:01:42.780> thought<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.140> might<00:01:43.289> work<00:01:43.499> for<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:43.890> I

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.459 
but he thought it might work for what I
wanted<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.570> decided<00:01:46.109> to<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.350> it

together

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.880 
together
and<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.429> quite<00:01:47.759> small<00:01:48.359> and<00:01:48.659> code<00:01:48.929> it<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.289> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and it's quite small and code it is it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.819 
and it's quite small and code it is it
is<00:01:50.219> which<00:01:50.969> can<00:01:51.299> be<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> positive<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.469> it<00:01:52.679> can

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
is which can be a positive and it can

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.190 
is which can be a positive and it can
also<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.299> it<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:54.869> tough

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
also be it can be a little tough

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.660 
also be it can be a little tough
