the horizontal and vertical stabilizers

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.920 
the horizontal and vertical stabilizers
back<00:01:04.610> here<00:01:04.850> and<00:01:04.940> that's<00:01:05.089> pretty<00:01:05.300> much<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.570> and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
back here and that's pretty much it and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.390 
back here and that's pretty much it and
you're<00:01:06.350> plugging<00:01:06.560> your<00:01:06.680> battery<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.280> you

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
you're plugging your battery and you

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.950 
you're plugging your battery and you
just<00:01:07.600> sensor<00:01:08.600> everything<00:01:08.840> on<00:01:08.900> the

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
just sensor everything on the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.840 
just sensor everything on the
transmitter<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:10.250> make<00:01:10.430> sure<00:01:10.460> everything

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
transmitter and you make sure everything

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.910 
transmitter and you make sure everything
is<00:01:10.910> centered<00:01:11.180> on<00:01:11.270> your<00:01:11.450> plane<00:01:11.920> so

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
is centered on your plane so

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.680 
is centered on your plane so
everything's<00:01:13.760> already<00:01:13.880> plugged<00:01:14.120> in<00:01:14.300> we<00:01:14.450> plug

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
everything's already plugged in we plug

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.390 
everything's already plugged in we plug
it<00:01:14.810> up<00:01:14.900> battery<00:01:15.320> goes<00:01:15.500> right<00:01:15.770> up<00:01:15.860> in<00:01:15.950> here<00:01:16.100> so

everything's already plugged in and let
me<00:01:18.680> give<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:18.829> guys<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:18.950> flight<00:01:19.250> demonstration

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
me give you guys a flight demonstration

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.149 
me give you guys a flight demonstration
of<00:01:20.060> how<00:01:20.180> this<00:01:20.329> plane<00:01:20.570> flies<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.619> only<00:01:21.860> thing

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
of how this plane flies the only thing

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.370 
of how this plane flies the only thing
about<00:01:22.280> this<00:01:22.670> claim<00:01:23.000> is<00:01:23.030> that<00:01:23.210> one<00:01:24.049> more<00:01:24.170> thing

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
about this claim is that one more thing

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.460 
about this claim is that one more thing
there's<00:01:24.979> no<00:01:25.250> steerable<00:01:25.700> knows<00:01:26.689> we<00:01:26.930> all<00:01:27.020> fronts

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
there's no steerable knows we all fronts

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.870 
there's no steerable knows we all fronts
so<00:01:27.650> if<00:01:27.799> you<00:01:27.860> guys<00:01:27.979> you're<00:01:28.130> trying<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.369> no<00:01:28.640> tax

so if you guys you're trying to no tax
on<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.119> runway<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.930> pretty<00:01:30.170> much<00:01:30.229> we<00:01:30.470> have<00:01:30.590> to

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
on the runway you pretty much we have to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.139 
on the runway you pretty much we have to
point<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.130> plane<00:01:31.369> where<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.670> want<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:31.970> take

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
point the plane where you want to take

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.420 
point the plane where you want to take
off<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:32.689> that's<00:01:33.439> pretty<00:01:33.680> much<00:01:33.799> what<00:01:34.159> you<00:01:34.250> got

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
off and that's pretty much what you got

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.030 
off and that's pretty much what you got
to<00:01:34.610> work<00:01:35.060> with<00:01:35.210> this<00:01:35.540> plane<00:01:35.799> but<00:01:36.799> it's<00:01:36.920> not<00:01:37.009> a

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
to work with this plane but it's not a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.789 
to work with this plane but it's not a
bad<00:01:37.490> thing<00:01:37.520> at<00:01:37.790> all<00:01:37.880> guys<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:38.659> planes<00:01:39.049> down<00:01:39.229> let

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
bad thing at all guys so planes down let

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.980 
bad thing at all guys so planes down let
me<00:01:39.920> i'll<00:01:40.100> split<00:01:40.430> up<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.450> show<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:41.840> guys<00:01:41.899> how

me i'll split up and show you guys how

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.210 
me i'll split up and show you guys how
flies

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.920 

applies<00:01:50.220> very<00:01:50.400> simple<00:01:50.970> at<00:01:51.120> sea<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.780> you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
applies very simple at sea and you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.710 
applies very simple at sea and you
trimming<00:01:52.290> need<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:53.060> little<00:01:54.060> bit<00:01:54.330> of<00:01:54.450> right

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
trimming need it a little bit of right

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
for it to balance out that's a very good

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
stay away from the Sun and I would say

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.930 
stay away from the Sun and I would say
with<00:04:40.470> this<00:04:40.620> battery<00:04:41.069> if<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.190> guys<00:04:41.370> fly<00:04:41.759> at

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
with this battery if you guys fly at

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.610

about quarter to auto fifty percent
righto<00:04:43.919> you<00:04:44.520> could<00:04:44.699> probably<00:04:45.210> fly<00:04:45.599> for<00:04:45.900> well

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
righto you could probably fly for well

the plane when you're flying it because
the<00:05:10.560> plane<00:05:10.800> is<00:05:10.979> a<00:05:11.060> plain<00:05:12.060> white<00:05:12.270> color

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.240

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
do some rolls spring it up and I try to

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
do some snappy maneuvers not sure what i

do some snappy maneuvers not sure what i
call<00:05:23.400> this<00:05:23.610> more<00:05:23.940> like<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.090> barrel<00:05:24.510> roll

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.709 

pretty<00:05:34.629> fun<00:05:35.610> so<00:05:36.610> let<00:05:36.879> me<00:05:36.939> bring<00:05:37.209> it<00:05:37.329> down<00:05:37.449> for<00:05:37.689> a

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 
pretty fun so let me bring it down for a

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:42.689 
pretty fun so let me bring it down for a
landing<00:05:40.139> this<00:05:41.139> plane<00:05:41.199> glides<00:05:41.619> a<00:05:41.919> lot<00:05:42.099> so<00:05:42.399> make

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
landing this plane glides a lot so make

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.179 
landing this plane glides a lot so make
sure<00:05:42.729> you<00:05:42.909> guys<00:05:43.029> slow<00:05:43.809> down<00:05:44.019> and<00:05:44.409> make<00:05:45.009> your

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:45.189 
sure you guys slow down and make your

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:46.829 
sure you guys slow down and make your
landing<00:05:45.610> approach<00:05:45.849> kind<00:05:46.269> of<00:05:46.360> far<00:05:46.599> because

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:46.839 
landing approach kind of far because

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:48.899 
landing approach kind of far because
this<00:05:47.110> plane<00:05:47.349> doesn't<00:05:47.589> want<00:05:47.769> to<00:05:47.860> glide<00:05:48.069> and<00:05:48.369> if

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
this plane doesn't want to glide and if

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.269 
this plane doesn't want to glide and if
you<00:05:49.059> guys<00:05:49.209> overshoot<00:05:49.959> your<00:05:50.259> landing<00:05:50.799> mark<00:05:51.009> you

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
you guys overshoot your landing mark you

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.999 
you guys overshoot your landing mark you
most<00:05:51.819> likely<00:05:51.909> have<00:05:52.329> to<00:05:52.479> walk<00:05:52.749> to<00:05:53.079> the<00:05:53.799> runway

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:54.009 
most likely have to walk to the runway

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.219 
most likely have to walk to the runway
and<00:05:54.369> pick<00:05:54.579> up<00:05:54.699> your<00:05:54.729> plane<00:05:55.059> because<00:05:55.899> you<00:05:56.019> can't

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
and pick up your plane because you can't

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:02.459 
and pick up your plane because you can't
steer<00:05:56.529> the<00:05:56.979> play<00:05:57.129> on<00:05:57.219> the<00:05:57.279> ground<00:06:01.079> no<00:06:02.079> throttle

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:02.469 
steer the play on the ground no throttle

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:03.569 
steer the play on the ground no throttle
neither<00:06:02.619> for<00:06:02.829> the<00:06:02.889> landing<00:06:03.189> so<00:06:03.309> that's<00:06:03.459> it

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:03.579 
neither for the landing so that's it

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:06.089 
neither for the landing so that's it
very<00:06:03.610> good<00:06:04.139> hmm<00:06:05.139> there<00:06:05.349> you<00:06:05.409> guys<00:06:05.559> go<00:06:05.619> you<00:06:05.860> guys
