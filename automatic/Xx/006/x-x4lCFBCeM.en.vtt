00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:00.499 
this one offers it takes obviously you

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:02.529 
this one offers it takes obviously you
know<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.649> lithium-ion<00:02:01.340> battery<00:02:01.369> but<00:02:02.179> you<00:02:02.299> can

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
know a lithium-ion battery but you can

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.480 
know a lithium-ion battery but you can
use<00:02:02.749> doublea's<00:02:03.320> with<00:02:03.679> an<00:02:03.829> optional<00:02:04.219> little

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
use doublea's with an optional little

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.239 
use doublea's with an optional little
adapter<00:02:05.320> this<00:02:06.320> one<00:02:06.530> does<00:02:06.770> something<00:02:06.979> we're

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
adapter this one does something we're

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.460 
adapter this one does something we're
going<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:07.429> let<00:02:07.579> you<00:02:07.729> retrieve<00:02:08.270> raw<00:02:08.660> data<00:02:08.990> from

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
going to let you retrieve raw data from

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.050 
going to let you retrieve raw data from
the<00:02:09.619> buffer<00:02:09.830> if<00:02:10.250> you've<00:02:10.429> shot<00:02:10.670> something<00:02:10.909> in

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
the buffer if you've shot something in

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.790 
the buffer if you've shot something in
JPEG<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.569> decide<00:02:11.959> oh<00:02:12.140> no<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.409> should<00:02:12.680> have

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
JPEG and decide oh no I should have

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.800 
JPEG and decide oh no I should have
saved<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.099> one<00:02:13.250> is<00:02:13.430> a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
saved that one is a

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.020 
saved that one is a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
because that's going to be a killer then

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.750 
because that's going to be a killer then
you<00:02:16.720> know<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.930> can<00:02:17.200> do<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.980> also<00:02:18.400> as<00:02:18.670> you

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
you know you can do that and also as you

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.449 
you know you can do that and also as you

shutter will go all the way to one six

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.240 
shutter will go all the way to one six
thousandth<00:03:16.330> of<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.540> second<00:03:16.959> which<00:03:17.650> is<00:03:17.890> quite

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
thousandth of a second which is quite

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.940 
thousandth of a second which is quite
fast<00:03:18.610> for<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:18.940> cheap<00:03:19.150> camera<00:03:19.380> cheaper<00:03:20.380> camera

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
fast for a cheap camera cheaper camera

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.990 
fast for a cheap camera cheaper camera
and<00:03:21.160> this<00:03:22.090> one<00:03:22.299> obviously<00:03:22.840> has<00:03:23.140> embody

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
and this one obviously has embody

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.310 
and this one obviously has embody
stabilization<00:03:25.000> which<00:03:25.150> neither<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.630> Canon<00:03:26.110> or

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
stabilization which neither the Canon or

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.560 
stabilization which neither the Canon or
the<00:03:26.500> Nikon<00:03:26.860> variants<00:03:27.640> have<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:28.120> have<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.450> get

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
the Nikon variants have you have to get

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.780 
the Nikon variants have you have to get
the<00:03:28.720> lens<00:03:28.930> with<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.250> stabilization<00:03:30.250> so

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
the lens with the stabilization so

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.640 
the lens with the stabilization so
that's<00:03:31.000> really<00:03:31.180> great<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:32.079> let's<00:03:32.260> just<00:03:32.440> take<00:03:32.590> a

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
that's really great so let's just take a

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.360 
that's really great so let's just take a
look<00:03:32.860> at<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:34.209> EOS<00:03:34.540> 650d<00:03:35.019> t4i<00:03:35.950> they're

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
look at the the EOS 650d t4i they're

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.970 
look at the the EOS 650d t4i they're
calling<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.820> in<00:03:36.940> America<00:03:37.450> from<00:03:38.049> Canon<00:03:38.470> versus

being<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.790> compact<00:03:55.329> SLR<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.290> Pentax<00:03:56.769> being

a<00:03:57.250> midsize<00:03:57.850> SLR<00:03:59.549> which<00:04:00.549> generally<00:04:01.420> reflects

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
a midsize SLR which generally reflects

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.720 
a midsize SLR which generally reflects
more<00:04:02.049> than<00:04:02.290> just<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.920> sizes<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.609> dimensions

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.729 
more than just the sizes and dimensions
of<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.359> thing<00:04:04.570> both<00:04:05.140> saying<00:04:05.440> that<00:04:05.620> they've

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
of the thing both saying that they've

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.789 
of the thing both saying that they've

you<00:04:23.169> can<00:04:23.289> see<00:04:23.470> here<00:04:23.770> is<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.099> little<00:04:24.640> bit<00:04:24.760> bigger

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
you can see here is a little bit bigger

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.030

just processing engines in them and

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.600 
just processing engines in them and
they'll<00:04:30.220> both<00:04:30.550> do<00:04:30.880> through<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:32.310> 25600<00:04:33.310> on

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.430 
this looks like a really great camera
and<00:07:20.889> it<00:07:21.729> is<00:07:21.759> an<00:07:22.180> intermediate<00:07:22.509> in<00:07:23.050> the<00:07:23.110> range

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 
and it is an intermediate in the range

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.920 
and it is an intermediate in the range
but<00:07:23.770> it's<00:07:23.979> priced<00:07:24.370> at<00:07:24.729> a<00:07:25.090> fairly<00:07:25.449> entry-level
