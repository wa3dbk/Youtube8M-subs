00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:23.060
 wolverine of iphones from the series of 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.189
 marvel agents of hasbro as they can wolf 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.220
 as everyone knows this is a review 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.349
 davis had taken one that a figure 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.350
 of equal return intro with the colors 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.239
 clearer more alive a little bit more blue 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.210
 good blue in the shoulder pads for example 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.530
 and yellow in the rest and clearer and the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.530
 Fecal back image 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.820
 of course it was with its variant the variant 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.820
 is this 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.780
 and now the box of this wolverine and 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.780
 leave it 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.360
 Well, they saw the truth that is 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.980
 father this figure is I bought it because 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.780
 I did not manage to buy the other and the 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.970
 I found that's the way it was when I sent 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.610
 to see then I'm staying is fine is of 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:11.010
 high magnitude and looks like the other in 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.690
 the color as you can see here is 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:22.229
 yellow and coffee 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:22.229
 the back 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.870
 so that 's why it looked like that 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.070
 silly me now another how good that yes 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.050
 I agree that if you are not 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.590
 missing me is for example this part 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.750
 behind 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.810
 look at the common here and shock the comics 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.030
 is fine and here look at this coffee and here 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.780
 is uneven and here is not coffee and here 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.680
 already calm where we go with the head 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.130
 sideways 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.170
 upwards downwards and in detail 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.670
 of the painting is father has dots 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.110
 apart they did the modeling 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.450
 they made little dots and they put a 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.130
 little bit of darker paint what does not 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.820
 I understand is because the brown lips 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.010
 purple or something obscure is father the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.020
 expression on the face a little more or 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.000
 less but if he is a father if he meets the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.190
 mask is father in this part of here 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.720
 his ears thus simulating 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.050
 wolverine even though he will be a glutton not 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.209
 I know something like that is to cover the ears look at the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.750
 modeling this whole part is father in 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.640
 the muscles well you see peace and movement 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.110
 from the hands down up on 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.180
 the arms but they do not have no moves 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.070
 a lot is a bit hard move here 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.739
 in the hands to 162 points 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.550
 articulation in the elbows and in the hand 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.860
 down up and in this hand 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.260
 with his left hand he has movement 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.569
 per d 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.909
 although it puts it closed that puts it 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.939
 more to do invitation camera nothing 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.489
 more than in this hand and the fingers are 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.720
 all these four are together not 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.849
 they have no kind of movement 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.459
 independent in this part here the 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.590
 chest down up to 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.940
 back much in the waist has a 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.680
 movement but in the part of here 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.049
 down 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.329
 and that moves very well in the other 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.609
 leg mind to the sides serious towards 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.469
 down and it rotates apart from that it also rotates 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.090
 the one above because we're going to have very 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.519
 good positions and you are going to be able 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.760
 hold on the knees well two points 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.760
 articulation 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.660
 is super father is not right that 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.480
 want and on the cushion foot towards the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.910
 sides more than up and down 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.920
 and this part of here and apart in their 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.500
 boats look at these lines here they are 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.030
 super similar to see nothing more 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.800
 that as always in many wolverine 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.840
 which fails the claws that always 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.910
 he was doing soft tried 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.410
 accommodate them but we will try to put 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.720
 something to exhibit a position and it 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.200
 can arrange the figure is very well 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.560
 the plane was free with 1500 from 500 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.630
 to 700 pesos and the giants arrived more 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.489
 cheap at 450 so it's not a 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.120
 very clear figure that can be 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.459
 I still liked you 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.849
 think if they have it if they do not want it if 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.260
 They did not like it or they ask and well we're 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.170
 watching see you in the next video 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.980
 I hope you like the video we are 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.980
 watching bye
