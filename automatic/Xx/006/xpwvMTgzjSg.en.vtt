00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
and I was not that sure it's just who

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.170 
and I was not that sure it's just who
Samsung<00:02:50.569> spark<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.109> individual<00:02:51.829> Flair<00:02:52.180> the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
Samsung spark and individual Flair the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.370 
Samsung spark and individual Flair the
best<00:02:53.389> thing<00:02:53.540> about<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.810> was<00:02:53.959> that<00:02:54.109> there<00:02:54.260> was

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
best thing about it was that there was

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.500 
best thing about it was that there was
no<00:02:54.560> quality<00:02:54.829> control<00:02:55.130> over<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.940> contestant

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
no quality control over the contestant

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.729 
no quality control over the contestant
so<00:02:56.720> half<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.139> them<00:02:57.260> would<00:02:57.380> be<00:02:57.530> like

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
so half of them would be like

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.800 
so half of them would be like
engineering<00:02:58.459> experts<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.389> they<00:02:59.450> will<00:02:59.630> spend

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
engineering experts and they will spend

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.509 
engineering experts and they will spend
