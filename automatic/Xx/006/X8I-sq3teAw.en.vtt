00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
while then this one joint couldn't Bend

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.289 
while then this one joint couldn't Bend
sideways<00:02:22.260> where<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> iron<00:02:23.220> couldn't<00:02:23.579> bend<00:02:24.060> up

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
sideways where the iron couldn't bend up

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.580 
sideways where the iron couldn't bend up
at<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.549> it'll<00:02:26.549> convened<00:02:27.060> it'll<00:02:27.299> be<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.380> same

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
at and it'll convened it'll be the same

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.849 
at and it'll convened it'll be the same
thing<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.950> got<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.280> up<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.670> Ben's<00:02:30.480> now<00:02:33.920> see

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
thing I got it up to you Ben's now see

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.250 
thing I got it up to you Ben's now see
and<00:02:37.859> the<00:02:37.980> reasoning<00:02:38.430> behind<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:39.780> plastic

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
and the reasoning behind the plastic

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.160 
and the reasoning behind the plastic
being<00:02:40.469> like<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:40.859> is<00:02:40.920> because<00:02:42.170> McFarlane's

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
being like this is because McFarlane's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.149 
being like this is because McFarlane's
plastic<00:02:43.980> sucks<00:02:44.689> okay<00:02:45.689> seriously<00:02:46.200> if<00:02:46.980> they

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
plastic sucks okay seriously if they

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.399 
plastic sucks okay seriously if they
made<00:02:47.340> like<00:02:47.579> neca<00:02:48.329> material<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.379> this

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
made like neca material like this

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.550 
made like neca material like this
plastic<00:02:50.120> for<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.269> figure<00:02:51.629> you<00:02:52.290> know<00:02:52.379> your

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
plastic for this figure you know your

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.160 
plastic for this figure you know your
rubber<00:02:52.799> personal<00:02:53.459> shit<00:02:53.790> then<00:02:54.719> it<00:02:54.959> would<00:02:55.079> be

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
rubber personal shit then it would be

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.660 
rubber personal shit then it would be
cool<00:02:55.409> okay<00:02:56.099> seriously<00:02:57.319> but<00:02:58.319> they<00:02:58.439> usually<00:02:58.670> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
cool okay seriously but they usually the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.699 
cool okay seriously but they usually the
most<00:02:59.819> fragile<00:03:00.209> plastic<00:03:01.139> ever<00:03:02.989> just<00:03:03.989> because<00:03:04.409> a

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
most fragile plastic ever just because a

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.709 
most fragile plastic ever just because a
