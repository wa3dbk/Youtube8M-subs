00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.690
 and here we have it 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.910

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.660
 we can see the ovule logo or 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.559
 see it courses markit development kit 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.720
 course 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.530
 the presentation 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.530
 it's unbeatable 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.090
 let's open it 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.770
 we find ourselves first with a letter from 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.689
 oculus 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.460
 dear developer thank you for joining 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.460
 to the oculus community etc. and so on 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.320
 and here is 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.520
 in locus ridge with its control box 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.299
 to connect to the peje 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.840
 these are the viewers that will be coupled 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.840
 to the device 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.020
 to the horned of late currents very 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.020
 important 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.800
 an adapter hdmi dvi 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.310
 and the transformer 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.020
 very well 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.229
 First of all, comment that the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.280
 occur comes with three sets of lenses 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.319
 one that has integrated that is what 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.929
 they call the lens that is for people 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.370
 with normal vision and two more games for 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.410
 myopia 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.750
 one for mild myopia and another for myopia 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.020
 severe 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.660
 it's a very exciting time for me 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.100
 because they have been dreaming of power for many years 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.290
 to have 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.290
 a device of these in my hands 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.850
 very very very light 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.370
 the feeling that nothing weighs here is 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.099
 adjust to zoom in or out 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.540
 in the eyes in case we use glasses we will have to 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.760
 move the screen a little away so as not to scratch 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.400
 the lenses with the glasses and here inside 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.230
 we see that it already comes with two lenses 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.720
 installed that will be the set of lenses 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.480
 for normal vision and the control box 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.980
 which is the one that connects to the computer 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.890
 we see that it has a power button 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.890
 contrast brightness buttons an entry 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.650
 hdmi an input dvi a connector 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.200
 microusb and the power connector the 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.030
 usb connector works for the tracker what 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.129
 which is the device that leads to 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.720
 follow the movements of the head 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:18.010
 when we have it put we will direct 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.150
 from one side to the other up and down the 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.860
 game has to update that 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.930
 information by moving the head of 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.569
 I am looking forward to going to the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.400
 computer and plug it in I hope that we 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.799
