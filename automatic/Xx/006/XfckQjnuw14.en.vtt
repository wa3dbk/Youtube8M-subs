00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
boxing I'll show you guys what the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.110 
boxing I'll show you guys what the
system<00:00:41.460> looks<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.719> did<00:00:43.379> open<00:00:44.340> up<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> flap

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
system looks like I did open up the flap

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.360 
system looks like I did open up the flap
here<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> side<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.260> order<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> save

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
here on the side just in order to save

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.119 
here on the side just in order to save
time<00:00:47.750> because<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.050> way<00:00:49.170> they<00:00:49.350> glue<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.890> box

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
time because the way they glue this box

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.430 
time because the way they glue this box
together<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.030> hard<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.440> actually

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
together is really hard to actually

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.930 
together is really hard to actually
access<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.370> didn't<00:00:53.579> want<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.730> spend<00:00:53.910> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
access it and I didn't want to spend a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.470 
access it and I didn't want to spend a
lot<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.090> time<00:00:54.530> cutting<00:00:55.530> into<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.610> we'll

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
lot of time cutting into that so we'll

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.599 
lot of time cutting into that so we'll
just<00:00:57.539> go<00:00:57.750> ahead<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.020> jump<00:00:58.230> into<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.620> first
