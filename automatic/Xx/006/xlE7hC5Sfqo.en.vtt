00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.729 
and it cuts the other way somewhat say
it<00:02:18.799> goes<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.010> about<00:02:19.489> there<00:02:20.560> she's<00:02:21.560> pretty

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
it goes just about there she's pretty

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.009 
it goes just about there she's pretty
good<00:02:22.209> yeah<00:02:23.680> there<00:02:24.680> we<00:02:24.799> go<00:02:24.830> um<00:02:25.720> in<00:02:26.720> terms<00:02:26.750> of

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
good yeah there we go um in terms of

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.460 
good yeah there we go um in terms of
lockups<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.709> does<00:02:28.250> lock<00:02:28.700> up<00:02:28.940> sometimes<00:02:29.480> just

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
lockups it does lock up sometimes just

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.930 
lockups it does lock up sometimes just
because<00:02:30.709> if<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.310> look<00:02:31.489> at<00:02:31.580> these<00:02:31.670> pieces

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
because if you look at these pieces

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.630 
because if you look at these pieces
again<00:02:32.299> there<00:02:32.959> are<00:02:33.170> holes<00:02:33.560> instead<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.160> caps<00:02:34.430> to

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
again there are holes instead of caps to

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.670 
again there are holes instead of caps to
prevent<00:02:34.970> friction<00:02:35.420> but<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.080> holes<00:02:36.319> are<00:02:36.500> just

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
prevent friction but the holes are just

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.369 
prevent friction but the holes are just
a<00:02:36.799> little<00:02:37.160> bit<00:02:37.760> too<00:02:37.970> big<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.510> like<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:39.170> whole

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
a little bit too big and like this whole

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.930 
a little bit too big and like this whole
this<00:02:39.680> poles<00:02:39.980> right<00:02:40.190> here<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.459> way<00:02:40.730> too<00:02:41.239> big<00:02:41.269> um

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
this poles right here is way too big um

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.979 
this poles right here is way too big um
it<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.900> catches<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.799> that<00:02:46.010> pretty<00:02:46.160> often<00:02:46.400> I

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
it it catches on that pretty often I

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.930 
it it catches on that pretty often I
want<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.110> walk<00:02:48.260> Cimorelli<00:02:48.739> often<00:02:49.069> also<00:02:49.310> the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
want to walk Cimorelli often also the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.500 
want to walk Cimorelli often also the
design<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.690> pieces<00:02:51.019> here<00:02:51.940> we<00:02:52.940> disassemble

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
design of the pieces here we disassemble

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.280 
design of the pieces here we disassemble
a<00:02:53.540> whole<00:02:53.750> wagon<00:02:58.060> okay<00:02:59.060> see<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.629> looks<00:02:59.930> really

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
a whole wagon okay see that looks really

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.690 
a whole wagon okay see that looks really
cool<00:03:00.910> but<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.299> does<00:03:02.599> it's<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.349> cool<00:03:03.560> core<00:03:03.829> as

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
cool but this does it's a cool core as

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.280 
cool but this does it's a cool core as
you<00:03:04.910> can<00:03:05.030> see<00:03:05.239> like<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.629> instance<00:03:05.989> are<00:03:06.109> like

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
you can see like the instance are like

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.869 
you can see like the instance are like
ball<00:03:06.530> shape<00:03:06.799> it's<00:03:07.489> cool<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.940> then<00:03:09.700> yeah<00:03:10.700> and

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
ball shape it's cool and then yeah and

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.550 
ball shape it's cool and then yeah and
then<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.120> edges<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.750> corners<00:03:11.810> they<00:03:12.349> look

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
then the edges and corners they look

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.369 
then the edges and corners they look
really<00:03:12.890> cool<00:03:13.510> they're<00:03:14.510> sort<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:14.989> similar<00:03:15.260> to

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
really cool they're sort of similar to

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.170 
really cool they're sort of similar to
the<00:03:15.680> high<00:03:15.889> end<00:03:16.099> corners<00:03:16.819> but<00:03:17.720> not<00:03:17.930> exactly<00:03:18.470> I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
the high end corners but not exactly I

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.289 
the high end corners but not exactly I
might<00:03:20.180> modify<00:03:20.660> this<00:03:20.900> do<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.560> high<00:03:21.859> end<00:03:22.069> mod<00:03:22.310> just

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
might modify this do a high end mod just

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.229 
might modify this do a high end mod just
curve<00:03:23.599> down<00:03:23.870> those<00:03:24.169> on<00:03:25.160> this<00:03:25.910> also<00:03:26.090> has

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
curve down those on this also has

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.300 
curve down those on this also has
friction<00:03:26.750> rails<00:03:26.959> on<00:03:27.169> the<00:03:27.260> edges<00:03:27.590> which<00:03:28.190> is

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
friction rails on the edges which is

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.390 
friction rails on the edges which is
nice<00:03:28.780> we<00:03:29.780> assemble<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.650> here<00:03:33.160> I'm<00:03:34.160> not<00:03:34.250> the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
nice we assemble it here I'm not the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.190 
nice we assemble it here I'm not the
fastest<00:03:34.880> assembler<00:03:35.510> but<00:03:35.780> oh<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.900> by<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.049> way

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
fastest assembler but oh and by the way

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.699 
fastest assembler but oh and by the way
um<00:03:41.380> this<00:03:42.380> Q<00:03:42.799> again<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.260> pretty<00:03:45.260> sure<00:03:45.470> it's

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
um this Q again it is a pretty sure it's

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.089 
um this Q again it is a pretty sure it's
a<00:03:45.799> knockoff<00:03:46.780> pretty<00:03:47.780> sure<00:03:48.079> two<00:03:48.769> people<00:03:48.980> have

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
a knockoff pretty sure two people have

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.330 
a knockoff pretty sure two people have
told<00:03:49.340> me<00:03:49.459> that<00:03:49.579> it's<00:03:50.359> a<00:03:50.419> knockoff<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.930> tube<00:03:51.340> but

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
told me that it's a knockoff a tube but

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.699 
told me that it's a knockoff a tube but
if<00:03:52.489> any<00:03:52.790> of<00:03:52.849> you<00:03:52.940> guys<00:03:53.090> don't<00:03:53.870> recognize<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.500> as

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
if any of you guys don't recognize it as

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.059 
if any of you guys don't recognize it as
an<00:03:54.859> eighth<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.069> a<00:03:55.250> free<00:03:55.549> feel<00:03:55.879> free<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.090> tell<00:03:56.359> me

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
an eighth to a free feel free to tell me

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:05.349 
an eighth to a free feel free to tell me
one<00:03:58.069> hundred<00:03:58.489> percent<00:03:58.519> sure<00:04:00.940> geez<00:04:02.290> ok<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:05.150> this

but<00:04:40.050> all<00:04:40.550> one<00:04:41.550> of<00:04:41.639> them<00:04:41.729> is<00:04:41.790> light<00:04:42.000> takes<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:42.270> i

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
but all one of them is light takes so i

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.840 
but all one of them is light takes so i
ordered<00:04:42.600> from<00:04:43.110> my<00:04:43.290> take<00:04:43.500> um<00:04:44.540> and<00:04:45.540> this<00:04:46.289> cube<00:04:46.850> it

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
ordered from my take um and this cube it

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.370 
ordered from my take um and this cube it
was<00:04:48.030> only<00:04:48.180> i<00:04:48.330> believe<00:04:50.240> six<00:04:51.240> dollars<00:04:51.780> something
