00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
she would this the autofocus systems and

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.590 
she would this the autofocus systems and
of<00:06:41.170> course<00:06:41.380> the<00:06:41.470> new<00:06:41.650> you<00:06:41.710> of<00:06:41.950> the<00:06:42.300> 61<00:06:43.300> point

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
of course the new you of the 61 point

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.990 
of course the new you of the 61 point
system<00:06:44.070> yes<00:06:45.070> at<00:06:45.250> some<00:06:45.280> time

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
system yes at some time

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.050 
system yes at some time
you<00:06:46.960> know<00:06:47.080> these<00:06:47.380> 61<00:06:47.950> point<00:06:48.250> system<00:06:48.670> so<00:06:48.880> it

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
you know these 61 point system so it

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.760 
you know these 61 point system so it
should<00:06:49.240> be<00:06:49.270> very<00:06:49.660> very<00:06:49.750> good<00:06:50.080> hopefully<00:06:50.380> all

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
should be very very good hopefully all

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.320 
should be very very good hopefully all
my<00:06:50.920> jokes<00:06:51.190> about<00:06:51.340> Canon<00:06:51.820> something<00:06:52.120> will

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
my jokes about Canon something will

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.260 
my jokes about Canon something will
focus<00:06:52.570> properly<00:06:52.950> well<00:06:53.950> finally<00:06:54.370> in<00:06:54.550> we<00:06:55.090> hope

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
focus properly well finally in we hope

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.570 
focus properly well finally in we hope
so<00:06:56.020> anyways<00:06:58.050> it<00:06:59.050> is<00:06:59.200> still<00:06:59.500> 22<00:06:59.830> megapixels

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
so anyways it is still 22 megapixels

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.680 
so anyways it is still 22 megapixels
just<00:07:01.300> like<00:07:01.420> the<00:07:01.510> original<00:07:01.870> 5d<00:07:02.740> mark<00:07:02.950> ii<00:07:03.090> but<00:07:04.090> it

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:04.690 
just like the original 5d mark ii but it

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.180 
just like the original 5d mark ii but it
is<00:07:04.870> important<00:07:05.320> to<00:07:05.350> note<00:07:05.530> that<00:07:05.560> it's<00:07:05.890> actually

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
is important to note that it's actually

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.340 
is important to note that it's actually
a<00:07:06.250> different<00:07:06.280> sensor<00:07:06.880> now<00:07:07.030> so<00:07:07.540> you<00:07:08.020> know<00:07:08.140> the

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.350 
a different sensor now so you know the

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:16.260 
a different sensor now so you know the
noise<00:07:08.860> characteristics<00:07:09.280> should<00:07:09.640> be<00:07:09.760> better<00:07:15.270> I

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
noise characteristics should be better I

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.480 
noise characteristics should be better I
will<00:07:16.840> say<00:07:17.020> yeah<00:07:17.230> I<00:07:17.440> like<00:07:17.680> it<00:07:17.860> you<00:07:17.980> know<00:07:18.010> so<00:07:18.250> far

and a nikon d800 side-by-side and we're

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.880 
and a nikon d800 side-by-side and we're
gonna<00:07:40.300> have<00:07:40.540> comparisons<00:07:41.260> on<00:07:41.410> both<00:07:41.590> of<00:07:41.770> those

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:41.890 
gonna have comparisons on both of those

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.830 
gonna have comparisons on both of those
cameras<00:07:42.430> so<00:07:42.580> instead<00:07:43.180> look<00:07:43.360> out<00:07:43.480> on<00:07:43.570> a<00:07:43.600> video

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 
cameras so instead look out on a video
