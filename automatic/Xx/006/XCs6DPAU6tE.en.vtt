well<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.480> found<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.960> leak<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.440> brake

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
well I found the leak in this brake

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.280 
well I found the leak in this brake
system<00:00:08.340> wasn't<00:00:09.300> very<00:00:09.660> parent<00:00:10.050> at<00:00:10.110> first

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
system wasn't very parent at first

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.990 
system wasn't very parent at first
because<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.710> was<00:00:10.769> all<00:00:10.980> cooling<00:00:11.700> up<00:00:11.790> on<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
because it was all cooling up on the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.189 
because it was all cooling up on the
inside<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.480> rim<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.139> didn't<00:00:13.410> see<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:15.199> but

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
inside of the rim so I didn't see it but

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.560 
inside of the rim so I didn't see it but
I<00:00:18.770> found<00:00:19.770> out<00:00:20.039> where<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.699> leak<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.330> coming

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
I found out where the leak was coming

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.380 
I found out where the leak was coming
