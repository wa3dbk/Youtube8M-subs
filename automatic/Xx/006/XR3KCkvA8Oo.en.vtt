 yeah so I have square coupons you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.970
 do not understand why just now 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.380
 we will do 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.760
 I hope we will put small 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.180
 originality like that of the saint 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.210
 Jacques 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.210
 of course we're going to imbibe him with a little bit of 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.210
 cognac and because I find that the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.430
 cognac goes well with the class to 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.610
 jacques acquired at saint-jacques so a 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.030
 little originality so you see you at 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.390
 using a brush, line the dough 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.369
 puff 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.930
 yes, but we're going frankly yeah but 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.880
 group foselev anyway huh so 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.920
 simply be we can the dough 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.740
 yeah either take a tray to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.050
 others we put on 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.310
 obviously we stuff 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.570
 at 180 we have about 20 minutes then 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.730
 are going well that's crisp to 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.110
 time although you look at the camera is 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.940
 unique to people why did you put a 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.830
 plateau then the sick because actually 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.660
 we are not looking for the dough 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.410
 puffed up but in fact they 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.870
 be crisp 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:08.030
 so we put a plate on it to have 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.520
 the fries age and well here it is very 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.340
 beautiful gressier ali thank you but it's great 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.290
 so she feels a little troubled the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.850
 map does not deny 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.550
 so I follow them I accompany them and 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.200
 so the rillette yes the millefeuille 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.210
 I chose so a salad of herbs 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.080
 way with basil 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.460
 anne is a little tarragon chervil and 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.170
 a bit of chickweed then 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.670
 what is the wet of 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.440
 alarms will have birds in fact one in 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.420
 everywhere it's growing in the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.420
 gutters that grows in the bottom of 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.450
 House 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.950
 so that's actually I brought her back from the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.000
 campaign and that what taste natya tastes 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.599
 so we will take some dill 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.080
 well yes it's a little bit it's a bit 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.239
 surprising 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.480
 thanks to these friendly these is very 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:58.200
 very undermined finally not hold to the minette 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.050
 minerality of in truth it's a little the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.400
 cros have a little enough is enough 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.380
 but here I am very well so we go 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.230
 a few sprigs of dill 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.910
 we will take a little tarragon way by 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.170
 small doses in small doses so in 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.880
 same time the rillette you see the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.590
 leafing the small herb salad 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.760
 which must lead a freshness we will put 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.319
 some leaves of little bazille of 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.209
 basil 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.830
 we will put a little bit of 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.930
 chervil see go to the oven 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.640
 we will recruit must be the same time 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.500
 we already see it's twenty minutes 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:36.569
 pretty much yes it's twenty minutes 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:39.000
 hu so everything is easy we will leave 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.070
 cool does not come room temperature 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.810
 of course we will give a little bit of 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.660
 cognac because I suspected a little 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.549
 for haguenau of data here I am the 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.980
 know the seagull a way we then 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:54.209
 then using a cookie cutter 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:04:00.630
 okay, we'll cut out little ones 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:02.040
 squares we will take slats and 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.030
 for the yarrow you need 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.100
 how two of spades flap 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.220
 we will fill the small lot that the update 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.660
 cookie cutter 2 or 3 kw to 2 3 besides 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.799
 that's what you prepared mohawk 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.120
 is a certain logic between you and 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.739
 me 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:21.299
 a nice plate to tedjar mounting there 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.250
 yeah alex is super fast hyper fast 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.200
 there is no so what we will take 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.630
 we'll take the slats like that 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.729
 see folking way and there we go 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.280
 take there is 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:36.090
 so we go carpet rillettes 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.370
 I remember christian guyader so here 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.710
 you see you go up like this yeah with 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.030
 the rillettes 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.770
 we will give another little layer 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.930
 flip ben you school the 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.530
 leaves 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:51.290
 we will not be too difficult to 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.310
 unmold after not at all so look 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.310
 Rome and rillettes 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.570
 we can put as many layers as 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.370
 want it's not necessary not my not said 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.690
 either we will not say no 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.780
 more huh it's not the interest either 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.850
 no here the idea is what is a 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.200
 small lightweight entry you get a very slight 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.580
 with a little salad of herbs you see 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.370
 you see it's going to be very cool it's going to be 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.660
 very pretty and very good for me it's 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.520
 rillettes that I eat like that 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.800
 also at the entrance we are afraid of smells and 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.410
 other nations it's us and we finish 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.030
 by a layer of rillettes or rather 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.200
 by one then we will end up like 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.690
 the millefeuille we will end up with a 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:31.790
 yarrow la i la 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.170
 last and so that's the question must 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.800
 not the week season your little one 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.740
 herbs salad 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.990
 then we will deprive him of this wandering 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.940
 Once me if I if I eat too much 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.590
 rillettes like that side waiting 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.960
 absolutely no yes a little oil 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.970
 olive 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.860
 we will put a few drops elsewhere 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.290
 we can see the product there of bellezane 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:59.120
 the latte will express the goods that's good 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:06:01.700
 creamy and a pinch of salt pepper 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.620
 and vélib in his place aboard the year 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.320
 his rillettes absolutely are to sail to 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.420
 12 explains then we have a small 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.590
 mushroom who here so for now 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:15.280
 you still do not have molds and a name 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.280
 some mass like that 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:25.340
 then we will take our millefeuille 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:33.070
 you tell me when you're ready now we 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:33.070
 did not sound the trumpets ier 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.630
 rillettes 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.820
 yeah so the little herb salad 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.460
 so you see I've prepared a little 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.970
 light saffron cream at all had it 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.440
 not say that 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.540
 no what did you do there it's 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.700
 a reduced cream with saffron 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:07:00.100
 cream like that yeah and a little cognac 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:07:00.100
 I take my cream 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.820
 so we take the millefeuille 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:08.480
 we will drop in the middle there your little 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.860
 herb salad on the millefeuille and 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.230
 we will add some small washers 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.480
 reminds that in the herb salad 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.130

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.980
 love birds have birds and 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:21.770
 I added a little julienne of 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:24.260
 mushrooms I added a few 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:30.800
 small flowers of cucumbers flowers of
