we<00:00:00.450> generally<00:00:00.930> start<00:00:01.460> looking<00:00:02.460> at<00:00:02.610> value<00:00:03.030> in

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
we generally start looking at value in

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.059 
we generally start looking at value in
terms<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.840> all<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.470> different<00:00:06.680> gradations<00:00:07.680> of

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
terms of all the different gradations of

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.970 
terms of all the different gradations of
value<00:00:08.490> you<00:00:08.670> can<00:00:08.910> create<00:00:09.179> because<00:00:09.980> everything

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
value you can create because everything

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.120 
value you can create because everything
in<00:00:11.250> our<00:00:11.880> real<00:00:12.300> world<00:00:12.599> has<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> whole<00:00:13.530> range<00:00:13.559> of

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
in our real world has a whole range of

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.730 
in our real world has a whole range of
values<00:00:14.519> from<00:00:14.790> white<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.480> black<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.350> there's

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
values from white to black and there's

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.370 
values from white to black and there's
all<00:00:16.949> these<00:00:17.100> Gray's<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.670> between<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.359> first<00:00:19.109> have

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
all these Gray's in between I first have

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.400 
all these Gray's in between I first have
a<00:00:19.410> demonstration<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.939> series<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.510> charcoals

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
a demonstration of a series of charcoals

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.640 
a demonstration of a series of charcoals
that<00:00:23.100> come<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.850> variation<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:25.050> gray<00:00:25.350> of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
that come in a variation of gray of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.800 
that come in a variation of gray of
grace<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:27.060> get<00:00:27.269> from<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.570> light

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
grace so that you can get from a light

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.130 
grace so that you can get from a light
gray<00:00:28.199> all<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.099> way<00:00:29.220> down<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> black<00:00:30.140> it's

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
gray all the way down to a black it's

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.260 
gray all the way down to a black it's
much<00:00:31.529> harder<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.460> here's<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.910> black

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
much harder to do this here's a black

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.330 
much harder to do this here's a black
charcoal<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.230> only<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.770> can't<00:00:35.070> really

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
charcoal and the only you can't really

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.080 
charcoal and the only you can't really
get<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:35.910> light<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:37.129> we<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.879> can

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
get really light with this we can we can

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.170 
get really light with this we can we can
ease<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.230> way<00:00:40.469> by<00:00:40.950> smudging<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.969> and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
ease it out that way by smudging it and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.319 
ease it out that way by smudging it and
you<00:00:43.079> can<00:00:43.260> put<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.340> get<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> darker

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you can put on more and get a darker

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.720 
you can put on more and get a darker
value<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:46.379> you're<00:00:46.620> never<00:00:46.829> going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.489> with

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
value but you're never going to get with

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.160 
value but you're never going to get with
just<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.300> charcoal<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.200> whole<00:00:49.500> range<00:00:49.860> in

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
just one charcoal this whole range in

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.260 
just one charcoal this whole range in
pencil<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:55.129> normally<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.370> find<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
pencil you can normally we find that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.069 
pencil you can normally we find that
there's<00:00:57.570> between<00:00:58.289> nine<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:58.920> twelve

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
there's between nine and twelve

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.000 
there's between nine and twelve
different<00:01:01.640> scales<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.969> value<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.769> one

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
different scales of value and this one

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
different scales of value and this one
I've<00:01:05.189> done<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:05.760> different<00:01:06.030> pencils<00:01:06.600> pencils

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
I've done with different pencils pencils

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.649 
I've done with different pencils pencils
have<00:01:07.650> different<00:01:08.070> weights<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.060> here's<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.450> very

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
have different weights so here's a very

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.109 
have different weights so here's a very
light<00:01:10.049> pencil<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.770> F<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.549> good<00:01:11.909> for

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
light pencil the F and that's good for

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.660 
light pencil the F and that's good for
making<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.570> very<00:01:12.810> light<00:01:13.140> value<00:01:13.710> if<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.400> want<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
making a very light value if you want to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670 
making a very light value if you want to
make<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> very<00:01:15.060> dark<00:01:15.420> value<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.049> need<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
make a very dark value you need like a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.120 
make a very dark value you need like a
seven<00:01:17.280> eight<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.790> nine<00:01:17.850> B<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:19.170> get<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.560> close<00:01:19.830> to

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
seven eight or nine B to get as close to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.530 
seven eight or nine B to get as close to
black<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.060> with<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> pencil

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
black as you can get with a pencil

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.200 
black as you can get with a pencil
graphite<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.740> never<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.729> black

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
graphite is never going to be as black

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.640 
graphite is never going to be as black
as<00:01:24.860> charcoal<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.840> see<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.200> difference

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
as charcoal you can see the difference

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.399 
as charcoal you can see the difference
it's<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.130> not<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.610> graphite<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.780> but

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it's just not in graphite to do that but

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.280 
it's just not in graphite to do that but
you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.100> get<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.610> nice<00:01:32.939> rich<00:01:33.420> dark<00:01:33.869> with

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you can get a really nice rich dark with

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.980 
you can get a really nice rich dark with
an<00:01:34.590> 8b<00:01:36.110> again<00:01:37.110> as<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.860> charcoal<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:39.420> very

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
an 8b again as with charcoal it's very

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.950 
an 8b again as with charcoal it's very
difficult<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.159> these<00:01:41.460> very<00:01:41.820> light<00:01:42.240> values

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
difficult to get these very light values

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.219 
difficult to get these very light values
with<00:01:43.950> an<00:01:44.220> eight<00:01:44.520> I'm<00:01:44.790> working<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:45.810> my<00:01:45.840> pencil

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
with an eight I'm working with my pencil

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.120 
with an eight I'm working with my pencil
very<00:01:46.590> lightly<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.200> about<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.770> light

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
very lightly and this is about as light

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.310 
very lightly and this is about as light
as<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.299> an<00:01:51.450> eight<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.140> can

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
as I can get with an eight and you can

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.010 
as I can get with an eight and you can
see<00:01:52.619> compared<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.880> value<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.450> got<00:01:54.720> with<00:01:54.899> an

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
see compared to the value I got with an

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.429 
see compared to the value I got with an
F<00:01:55.490> this<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.939> really<00:01:57.180> down<00:01:57.509> down<00:01:58.110> about

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
F this one is really down down about

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.450 
F this one is really down down about
here<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:58.979> 3b<00:01:59.719> so<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.710> know<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.130> can

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
here with the 3b so you know you can

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.609 
here with the 3b so you know you can
create<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.060> good<00:02:03.329> range<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.780> values<00:02:04.140> with<00:02:04.320> just

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
create a good range of values with just

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.679 
create a good range of values with just
one<00:02:04.890> tool<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.360> complete

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
one tool but if you want a complete

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.779 
one tool but if you want a complete
range<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.259> values<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:08.129> might<00:02:08.310> want<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.640> give

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
range of values you might want to give

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.669 
range of values you might want to give
yourself<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.300> couple<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.690> pencils<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.349> to

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679
