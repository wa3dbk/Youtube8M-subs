00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:11.230
 The difference between right and left of the list to you Thank you for up-turn at Yes Hello set was yellow 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:17.770
 Increases and saw the people of 8 or videos that do not heal easily, but basically now 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.730
 It is right foot as a present condition It is always on the right foot State that there is a large percentage of getting on the right foot 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.120
 It sounds like 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.510
 I'm doing a turn 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.500
 Mikochi's right foot It's Miyaji's long turn and it's on the opposite turn, it's the outer foot for a moment 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.660
 Weight got 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:37.370
 The first half Kana Mac is excellent until the end of the 8 but I will be here in the second half of the turn 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.710
 And left foot eating out in it I'm riding on another here's feet got Koninge N'from the side 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.110
 Since completely rests on the person of the right foot 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.950
 First of all 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 After I that both people firm of Rutteyuu basically is 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.950
 What 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.470
 After all that the city force me it is the outer leg outer leg so because that house will continue depends more strongly than to 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.030
 Keep balance properly when saying 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:02.850
 Say will taste shot went just to the outside while not just the outer leg raised in firm ride 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.440
 However , when it comes to be able to do both things well, I adjust it after turn firmly 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.809
 Adjust the speed or 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.140
 a 3 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:13.030
 It comes to be able to say that it slips while keeping balance by 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.909
 But there is a reason why the right foot is the main and slips, so its balance 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:21.850
 It is a place that I should do for a while 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:24.800
 Yes Eto'o Well , I think I've probably tried it so far, but as a practice method 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.430
 Maybe so on foot 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.760
 I think I think I'm doing what I am going to do 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.890
 that 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:38.790
 A little slip aboard the large outer foot say it Subero firmly follow the outer leg in the outer leg main 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.000
 If you switch, you may feel that you slip on your feet and you may be doing it 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:47.580
 If you are not doing it, please try this once 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.750
 Or rather properly it will be the outer leg inner leg in turn be good to not ride also so much easier 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.680
 It's about 70% outside foot ic 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:59.650
 If you try riding in the dark and slide firmly on the outside foot main 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:04.770
 If you reset properly by switching once and enter the next end, you are the outside foot, right foot 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.600
 I put it on 7% home and turn it flat until I can switch on it properly and flat 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.770
 It's a switch , it's said that it's coming 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:16.490
 If I go here carefully once 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:22.970
 8 But I'd not mind at all if so if like say the movement will come cured 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:27.590
 It is the most effective of in a building Seriously not training that I have promoted child variety ne 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:32.720
 As we introduce that it is training to put weight on one leg and one 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.430
 As this video Shiseido has also put a link under the lymph for how to practice 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.480
 Please take a look at that 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.350
 Yes for date content 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:46.250
 Always on my left foot 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:48.140
 It feels the opposite to being all right now when you get on, so now there are more right feet, so get on the left foot 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.440
 I will do everything to go 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:57.080
 Yes Na or the first Well 8 resistance in Mr. 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.300
 It's about 7 to 3 and you do n't get on the left foot-it's always going to slide on the left foot 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.810
 It feels like 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:06.460
 Ride in the left foot as Yes I Well Points 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:10.870
 Because putting weight on one leg is a well-balanced slip, so that 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.860
 Even though I understand myself, I'm training this for a while, but the image left foot 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.560
 Towards 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.290
 In the morning as it is, let's make it so that you don't get off Hanaras from your left foot. 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.010
 Which of duck 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:28.040
 In and always stage heavy also switch also comes especially in the late turn not turn the first half also keep an armament 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.299
 Maybe because I was riding on my right foot until now 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:38.100
 The navel will turn to the right foot, so don't leave it there 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:42.030
 With the navel facing all the way to the left foot, the turn is also during the turn 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:47.100
 Go and isolated I had turn got especially It is Tanpowan rice much all away 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.940
 As you will be able to get on your left foot if you do not 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.920
 Please try 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:58.090
 Yes I think this will probably get you feeling 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:03.489
 Please try the anti-emperor again and do what you did in the end finally left foot 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.230
 Because there is a case to do and also the balance is lost a little bit in there right foot'll do the left foot 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:11.140
 Try a couple of times 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:17.139
 Now it's time to put it back in the middle, get on your feet and head in the middle first 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.109
 I 'm going to the stars, I 'm going to face you, and I'm going all the way . 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.500
 And body weight is riding on 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.770
 We will adjust what we can do for moms, though- 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:30.259
 Because it becomes possible to pile up to slide in a clean way 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.780
 Yes in when it comes possible after the skate also towards the various other also Toka another navel of direction 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:38.100
 It's going to be like that again 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:42.240
 It is a practice how to ride in the left foot by I mean entered please try to go to put more and more 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.600
 Since we introduced Thank you for moving up in the fact that er Yes Please try by all means 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.600
 There was
