00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.480
 Round balers need today 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.730
 more efficient than ever, no matter if 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.070
 farmer or contractor no matter if in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.080
 moderate climate of germany or in the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.390
 Spain's hot summer use 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.070
 safety is duty but how many 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.779
 Bales are actually in an hour 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.680
 to create when the machine on 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.920
 limit drives crown dared on 21 august 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.160
 2012 the record attempt the dlz 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.120
 Agrarmagazin and the editors of 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.540
 agrarheute.com have this 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.910
 spectacular attempt accompanied ingo 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.820
 shop engaged in sales promotion at 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.989
 Krone explains how this idea came about 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.520
 company coal very much for his 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.960
 flexibility and interesting haid 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.219
 well known and we just have a look 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.629
 thought we sat together 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.710
 a table and we thought something 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.140
 I can also do such a round baler 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.510
 really get out how much soon in the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.559
 hour I manage it 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.430
 extreme conditions like a lot of passion 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.430
 I produce there 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.440
 The location of the record attempt is a 35 hectare 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.660
 wheat double beat near by 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.030
 langweddingen in the magdeburg bay 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.280
 The conditions are not simply white 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.630
 dr martin are also design directors 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.640
 with chrome the conditions are 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.260
 difficult because it is very hot and 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.990
 even the last days even hotter 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.820
 and that's why it 's straw 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.790
 very fragile it anyway this year 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.040
 relatively small and in stock and thin 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.869
 it is relatively hard to squeeze it so 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.930
 are other wheat beats where they 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:39.850
 longer stable white so find where 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.590
 They significantly safer baling the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.710
 decisive role today 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.710
 the festive chamber presse.com plays great 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.229
 f125 xc, these are a 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.700
 ordinary serial machine of course 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.220
 We make sure that the bale 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.170
 Counter set back is driver of 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.100
 tug is ewald fehring of the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.630
 deula freren 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.820
 He was on the record attempt 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.649
 prepared and knows that it is not 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.630
 simply the challenge is 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.880
 first in it exactly the processes too 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.070
 coordinate flap on flap 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.570
 stop quickly, drive fast again 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.950
 that the bale is the appropriate form 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.170
 gets the appropriate strength 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.700
 that the corresponding network too 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.380
 come that is the great peace before 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.380
 and all in a short time 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.640
 and then we start at twelve o'clock 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:29.090
 the 21st of August 2012 is the first one 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.090
 black 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.060
 quickly became clear what Pfarrer ewald 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.260
 fehring meant when he came from one 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.140
 challenge spoke 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.120
 it only takes about 23 seconds 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.460
 average to the board of a ball in the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.710
 first black save time 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.660
 he delays to eject the ball 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:58.110
 extremely strong and already gives 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.640
 open bale chamber again gas still 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.960
 in the first black happens then 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.660
 but no one was possible 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.000
 could have stopped by the strong braking 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.160
 From the driver opens the cover of the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.990
 net roles fold and the replenishment 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.790
 The drones roll up to pick up 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.530
 However, the rolls are fast from the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.950
 Assistance team secured and it can 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.950
 go on 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.740
 bales for bales rolls on the 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.940
 stoppelacker the team is approaching 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.940
 half-time and it looks good 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.330
 over alois double time than 21 minutes 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.210
 and ten seconds 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.230
 We are at 55 bales if you are like that 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.230
 would carry on 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.220
 at minute 45 already have over 100 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.650
 Round bales leave the press room 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.019
 this corresponds to around 19,000 kilograms 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.040
 Wheat stream at this power may 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.040
 sometimes pass a fault 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.360
 The goal is already within reach 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.980
 but at minute 59 is the compressed 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.800
 the network and it has to be changed 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.510
 The clock will be stopped for this and 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.220
 then continue until the last second 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:36.180
 pressed 43 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.870
 2 the result is impressive 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.200
 The counter in the terminal shows 149 bales 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.670
 on 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.470
 that's about two and a half 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.940
 bales per minute at one 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.210
 average measured bales 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.780
 weight of 188 kilograms a strong 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.910
 power 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.110
 I am very satisfied 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.090
 that we did it 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.890
 a first thanks goes to the driver 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.180
 vacation of really great explained 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.460
 he is really at the limit 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.780
 to be highly focused on his doctor 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.190
 I hope in the pictures seen so 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.050
 We were able to live with ten of them 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.700
 on the pictures also how strong he is 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.290
 accelerated the strong braked 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.780
 So he's driven digitally so say 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.490
 So we really get the maximum out 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.830
 we have a network to give a scene 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.060
 So roll in half-finished or used up 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.100
 net want to be lost from the 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.720
 box net cash out 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.730
 through the strong brake unique 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.070
 sign that he has given everything and 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.419
 has a huge share in the success otherwise 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.620
 I am very satisfied with the press 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.800
 she had done well we had 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.240
 no technical disorder neat 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.680
 webs made everything in 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.660
 order that it be the most critical in these 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.510
 conditions to the end I believe in 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.310
 minute 59 we even have something for ourselves 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.900
 the network was speculating about the end of it 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.669
 have made more bavaria in this 1 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.140
 hour had when we actually thought 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.790
 We had to network again 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.320
 change make a stop box moderate 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.970
 net change but that too has good 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.010
 immediately worked the next ball afterwards 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.700
 was up again so we 60 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.110
 minutes to complete 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.910
 march for price record and also a 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.800
 driving report to crown com prima 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.720
 Round baler read in the 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.720
