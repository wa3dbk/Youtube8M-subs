00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
want we want the enter portal and I do

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.620 
want we want the enter portal and I do
not<00:01:31.439> know<00:01:31.710> how<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.220> got<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.390> you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
not know how I just got that but if you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.260 
not know how I just got that but if you
see<00:01:34.470> these<00:01:34.590> steel<00:01:34.950> bars<00:01:35.220> don't<00:01:35.700> go<00:01:35.850> anywhere

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
see these steel bars don't go anywhere

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.760 
see these steel bars don't go anywhere
else<00:01:36.420> because<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.840> won't<00:01:37.049> lead<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
else because it won't lead to it you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.859 
else because it won't lead to it you
want<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.070> go<00:01:38.250> through<00:01:38.490> these<00:01:38.670> then<00:01:39.630> go<00:01:39.810> to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
want to go through these then go to

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.020 
want to go through these then go to
these<00:01:40.140> other<00:01:40.290> ones<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.189> isn't<00:01:41.430> right<00:01:41.640> here

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
these other ones and it isn't right here

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.690 
these other ones and it isn't right here
I<00:01:42.229> will<00:01:43.229> put<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> coordinates<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.280> screen

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I will put the coordinates on the screen

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.639 
I will put the coordinates on the screen
of<00:01:44.880> where<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:45.119> standing<00:01:45.149> right<00:01:45.720> now<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:48.649> yeah

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
of where I'm standing right now and yeah

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.800 
of where I'm standing right now and yeah
that<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.040> basically<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.149> look<00:01:51.420> around

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that is basically it if you look around

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.270 
that is basically it if you look around
in<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> stronghold<00:01:52.649> there's<00:01:52.860> not<00:01:53.009> too<00:01:53.159> much

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
in the stronghold there's not too much

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.649 
in the stronghold there's not too much
else<00:01:53.930> like<00:01:54.930> maybe<00:01:55.140> 50<00:01:55.590> creepers<00:01:55.979> some<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.399> 10

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
else like maybe 50 creepers some like 10

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.969 
else like maybe 50 creepers some like 10
that's<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:57.960> looks<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.229> right<00:01:58.590> now<00:01:58.619> but

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that's what it looks like right now but

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.639 
that's what it looks like right now but
