00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
time let's have a look at web browsing

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.970 
time let's have a look at web browsing
now<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:39.510> we<00:03:39.630> have<00:03:39.750> loaded<00:03:40.020> up<00:03:40.200> Chrome<00:03:40.560> it's

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
bit faster but they are almost similar
in<00:03:48.630> rendering<00:03:49.050> times<00:03:50.959> scrolling<00:03:51.959> also

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
in rendering times scrolling also

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.860 
in rendering times scrolling also
remains<00:03:52.709> smooth<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.220> both<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.550> them

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.960 

pinch-to-zoom<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.260> smooth<00:03:58.620> as<00:03:58.800> well<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.880> you

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
pinch-to-zoom is smooth as well so you

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.610 
pinch-to-zoom is smooth as well so you
can<00:04:00.060> see<00:04:00.209> right<00:04:00.330> there<00:04:00.450> in<00:04:00.750> terms<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:01.170> general

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
can see right there in terms of general

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.860 
can see right there in terms of general
performance<00:04:01.800> also<00:04:02.610> these<00:04:03.090> phones<00:04:03.450> are<00:04:03.660> quite

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
performance also these phones are quite

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.140 
performance also these phones are quite
similar<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.500> why<00:04:04.950> wouldn't<00:04:05.280> they<00:04:05.370> be<00:04:05.520> they

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
similar and why wouldn't they be they

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.460 
similar and why wouldn't they be they
use<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.600> same<00:04:06.840> chip<00:04:07.170> set<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:09.050> run<00:04:10.050> Android

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.370 
4.3 right out of the box here you can
