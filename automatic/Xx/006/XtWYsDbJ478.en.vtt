I'm just hoping that they don't get the
nuke<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:17.610> cool<00:04:18.610> in<00:04:18.760> my<00:04:18.790> predator<00:04:20.910> obviously

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
nuke so cool in my predator obviously

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.280 
nuke so cool in my predator obviously
they're<00:04:22.090> running<00:04:22.330> cold<00:04:22.540> blooded<00:04:22.810> because

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
they're running cold blooded because

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.270 
they're running cold blooded because
that's<00:04:23.860> what<00:04:24.010> boosters<00:04:24.400> do<00:04:25.710> so<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:26.740> can't<00:04:27.010> find

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
that's what boosters do so I can't find

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.120 
that's what boosters do so I can't find
him<00:04:27.430> I've<00:04:27.790> got<00:04:27.970> to<00:04:28.000> predators<00:04:28.510> here<00:04:29.010> saving<00:04:30.010> up

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
him I've got to predators here saving up

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.160 
him I've got to predators here saving up
and<00:04:31.020> now<00:04:32.020> yeah<00:04:32.940> unfortunately<00:04:33.940> they<00:04:34.810> do<00:04:34.870> get

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
and now yeah unfortunately they do get

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.590 
and now yeah unfortunately they do get
the<00:04:35.290> nuke<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.800> then<00:04:36.250> he<00:04:36.430> calls<00:04:36.730> in<00:04:36.970> pretty

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
the nuke and then he calls in pretty

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.830 
the nuke and then he calls in pretty
soon<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.760> sucks<00:04:40.000> because<00:04:40.180> I<00:04:40.420> think<00:04:40.750> this

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840
