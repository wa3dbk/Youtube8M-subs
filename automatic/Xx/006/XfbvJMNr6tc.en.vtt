00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.130
 and so hello today we continue 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.740
 our lesson our course in interior design 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.299
 among 3d max 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.480
 Today I will tell you about how to create 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.340
 cornices and snack types create 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.150
 karmically book with you don't have to 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.630
 use with the plan spline and for 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:34.200
 the next button is delicious genetically 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.920
 3 and we use the gram line lines and on 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.809
 top view 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.950
 you draw out exactly where we need 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.829
 binding if you studied these basic 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.539
 enable us today very very help 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:55.620
 and begin to circle 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:57.890
 the points which we create limp after 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.820
 after you finished healing Il 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.960
 notice that I let the kids down 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.210
 from the door depth 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.260
 now the next one with panther we need 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.049
 make it create 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.290
 points outraged the country is not accepted not 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:21.200
 will be before we will plunge again than 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.200
 feelings are not from one of the news 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.270
 but 6 are not ready, we will need them a little 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.159
 a little later now we are not the same 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.159
 which we are apart and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.350
 tree to create a print on the ceiling 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.580
 you can use the spline to close 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.620
 its but it is not very comfortable and 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.330
 ceiling plinth editing 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.690
 sometimes it is especially problematic 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.760
 so we use spline again but we 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.080
 not angry with the flow and we will do 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.690
 several objects 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:02.200
 he will have two lines because 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:22.170
 we are the walls of the right transfer 2 another 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:24.100
 side of the new flame and the afternoon. we have 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.370
 the next step which is necessary 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.150
 do it create a plinth profile not 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.840
 create a profile 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:37.989
 ceiling on earlier for this we again 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.590
 remembered the functions of the wine profile can 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.739
 be absolutely any amine 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:48.890
 when you know the profile should be in advance 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.890
 you think about where you can find 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.519
 Well, since this educational baking sheet we do not 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.360
 create some abstract abyss but 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.650
 creating just was n't necessary 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.459
 do it so that it can be 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:11.700
 to acquire 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:14.069
 at least one remember if it consists now 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.569
 so put get me closed and 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.640
 can not edit it, you can 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.530
 whether a quarter of the new waited wants us can 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.079
 convenient so here's a slope 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.840
 unlocked us did not touch we need 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.180
 so that it is closed for this powerful 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.540
 and we gave these to the plan which he 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.540
 showed and create a convenient panel 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:58.260
 and now we have it was 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.900
 see our file turned out to be battles 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.100
 unspeakable and its necessary 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.640
 additional how to do therefore 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:20.540
 use the edit function 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:26.450
 if you switch to task panels a 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.450
 if you feel comfortable you can tell the difference 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:41.390
 so girl this corner at the base 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:33.099
 exits edit window 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:35.529
 but the message is to create 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.819
 take advantage of the modifier 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:42.949
 modifier which is called mr 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:45.259
 Elton John, select a line for which we 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.649
 create a baseboard 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:56.089
 dinner and now opened the bridge on the pise 

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:58.249
 and choose which we had already chosen 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:07.659
 direction to do now 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:11.959
 we need to select a folder there and choose 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:15.949
 we get the word the other side 

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:16.579
 we need it therefore when you have 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.479
 arises 

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:22.939
 and situations will be easier to create 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:28.029
 new spline which will consist not 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:28.029
 from 1 album let's find x.
