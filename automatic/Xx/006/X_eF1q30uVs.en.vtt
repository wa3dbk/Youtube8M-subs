00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.010 
assembled the third member on here the
pinion<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.579> ready<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.000> drop<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.840> just

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
pinion is ready to drop in and I just

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.899 
pinion is ready to drop in and I just
threw<00:01:52.229> some<00:01:52.470> tubes<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.950> there<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.670> can

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
threw some tubes in there so you can

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.539 
threw some tubes in there so you can
have<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> look<00:01:54.210> at<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> assembly<00:01:55.049> now<00:01:55.770> because

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
have a look at the assembly now because

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.580 
have a look at the assembly now because
these<00:01:56.700> are<00:01:56.909> rear<00:01:57.149> loading<00:01:57.420> all<00:01:58.259> you're<00:01:58.469> going

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
these are rear loading all you're going

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.450 
these are rear loading all you're going
to<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.509> assemble<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.990> carrier<00:02:01.770> onto<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
to do is assemble the carrier onto the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.190 
to do is assemble the carrier onto the
center<00:02:02.700> section<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.329> then<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.960> take<00:02:04.170> your

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
center section and then you take your

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.980 
center section and then you take your
pinion<00:02:04.619> gear<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.729> drop<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.119> in

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
pinion gear like this and you drop it in

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.979 
pinion gear like this and you drop it in
this<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> stock<00:02:07.770> axial<00:02:08.310> unit<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.959> we're<00:02:09.959> just

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
this is a stock axial unit so we're just

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.750 
this is a stock axial unit so we're just
going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.289> drop<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.590> pinion<00:02:11.190> gear<00:02:11.400> right<00:02:11.610> in

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
going to drop that pinion gear right in

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.640 
going to drop that pinion gear right in
there<00:02:11.940> like<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.720> outside<00:02:13.140> bearing<00:02:13.500> can

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
there like that the outside bearing can

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.580 
there like that the outside bearing can
go<00:02:13.770> in<00:02:13.920> at<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> end<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.849> doesn't<00:02:15.120> fall<00:02:15.239> out

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
go in at the end so it doesn't fall out

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.080 
go in at the end so it doesn't fall out
so<00:02:16.590> there<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.980> pinion<00:02:17.310> gear<00:02:17.520> ready<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.940> go

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
so there is the pinion gear ready to go

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.979 
so there is the pinion gear ready to go
and<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.709> an<00:02:19.860> assembled<00:02:20.400> stock<00:02:21.360> axial

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
and this is an assembled stock axial

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.040 
and this is an assembled stock axial
diff<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.060> just<00:02:24.269> drops<00:02:24.569> right<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.900> there

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
diff and it just drops right in there

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.680 
diff and it just drops right in there
like<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.709> you're<00:02:25.860> done<00:02:26.989> there<00:02:27.989> we<00:02:28.080> go

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
like that and you're done there we go

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.509 
like that and you're done there we go
now<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:31.019> is<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> really<00:02:31.709> tight<00:02:31.950> fit<00:02:32.280> between

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
now this is a really tight fit between

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.780 
now this is a really tight fit between
the<00:02:32.970> bearings<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.780> bearing<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.470> tube

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
the bearings the bearing and the tube

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.160 
the bearings the bearing and the tube
the<00:02:35.790> bearing<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.390> tube<00:02:36.599> on<00:02:36.780> this<00:02:36.930> side

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
the bearing and the tube on this side

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.430 
the bearing and the tube on this side
they<00:02:37.650> are<00:02:37.680> all<00:02:38.220> very<00:02:38.610> close<00:02:39.420> tolerances<00:02:40.200> so

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
they are all very close tolerances so

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.280 
they are all very close tolerances so
when<00:02:41.250> you've<00:02:41.400> got<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.730> assembled<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.959> want<00:02:43.170> to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
when you've got it assembled you want to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.900 
when you've got it assembled you want to
turn<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.650> tube<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.250> when<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.730> tooth

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
turn the tube so that when the tooth

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.610 
turn the tube so that when the tooth
goes<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.420> there<00:02:45.630> little<00:02:45.750> screw<00:02:46.080> hole<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
goes in there little screw hole on the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.920 
goes in there little screw hole on the
tube<00:02:46.799> here<00:02:47.100> lines<00:02:47.940> up<00:02:48.150> with<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.510> hole<00:02:48.750> right

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
tube here lines up with this hole right

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.259 
tube here lines up with this hole right
here<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:50.010> seems<00:02:50.220> pretty<00:02:50.400> simple<00:02:50.640> stuff<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:51.209> I

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
here it seems pretty simple stuff but I

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.430 
here it seems pretty simple stuff but I
want<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.450> tell<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.720> anyway<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.049> you<00:02:52.230> can<00:02:52.319> just

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
want to tell you anyway so you can just

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.289 
want to tell you anyway so you can just
put<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.799> in<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:52.920> give<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.280> twist<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.640> you'll

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
put it in and give it a twist and you'll

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.840 
put it in and give it a twist and you'll
see<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.900> tube<00:02:55.110> will<00:02:55.350> stop<00:02:55.620> even<00:02:56.610> if<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
see that the tube will stop even if the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.610 
see that the tube will stop even if the
dip<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.239> out<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.690> two<00:02:57.840> could<00:02:58.110> stop<00:02:58.350> right

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
dip is out the two could stop right

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.050 
dip is out the two could stop right
there<00:02:58.769> can't<00:02:59.160> go<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.400> any<00:02:59.549> further<00:02:59.819> because

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
there can't go in any further because

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.630 
there can't go in any further because
it's<00:03:00.299> machine<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:00.930> they<00:03:01.230> mate<00:03:01.470> all<00:03:02.160> just

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
it's machine so that they mate all just

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.630 
it's machine so that they mate all just
exactly<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.269> right<00:03:03.450> spot<00:03:04.099> so<00:03:05.099> then<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.489> other

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
exactly the right spot so then the other

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.680 
exactly the right spot so then the other
tube<00:03:05.880> goes<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:07.560> cover<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:09.239> rear<00:03:09.390> cover

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
tube goes in the cover the rear cover

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.690 
tube goes in the cover the rear cover
when<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.140> cover<00:03:10.440> goes<00:03:10.709> on<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.190> cover<00:03:11.430> will

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
when the cover goes on the cover will

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.819 
when the cover goes on the cover will
hold<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.329> bearings<00:03:12.750> okay<00:03:13.109> so<00:03:13.170> this<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.680> all

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
hold in the bearings okay so this is all

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.460 
hold in the bearings okay so this is all
super<00:03:14.280> tight<00:03:14.519> taller<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.030> stuff<00:03:15.359> if<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.230> want

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
super tight taller and stuff if you want

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.410 
super tight taller and stuff if you want
to<00:03:16.560> see<00:03:16.769> all<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.040> diff<00:03:17.280> you're<00:03:18.060> going<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.299> have

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
to see all the diff you're going to have

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.920 
to see all the diff you're going to have
to<00:03:18.600> use<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.810> really<00:03:19.680> small<00:03:20.070> amount<00:03:20.579> of<00:03:20.930> silicon

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
to use a really small amount of silicon

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.509 
to use a really small amount of silicon
on<00:03:22.200> here<00:03:22.470> or<00:03:22.650> whatever<00:03:22.950> you're<00:03:23.100> going<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.250> use

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
on here or whatever you're going to use

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.460 
on here or whatever you're going to use
our<00:03:23.850> TV<00:03:24.239> or<00:03:24.540> something<00:03:24.870> like<00:03:25.019> that<00:03:25.079> because

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
our TV or something like that because

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.370 
our TV or something like that because
the<00:03:25.829> tolerance<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.549> so<00:03:26.760> tight<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:28.079> don't

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
the tolerance is so tight that you don't

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.229 
the tolerance is so tight that you don't
want<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.769> plug<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.160> up<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.519> bind<00:03:30.000> on<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
want to plug it up and bind on the

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.410 
want to plug it up and bind on the
bearings<00:03:30.720> or<00:03:30.870> anything<00:03:31.609> so<00:03:32.609> we're<00:03:33.209> going<00:03:33.329> to

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
bearings or anything so we're going to

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.770 
bearings or anything so we're going to
take<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.630> couple<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.079> screws<00:03:34.410> here<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.780> I'm

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
take a couple of screws here and I'm

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.030 
take a couple of screws here and I'm
just<00:03:36.810> going<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.170> run<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.410> couple<00:03:37.590> screws

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
just going to run a couple screws

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.360 
just going to run a couple screws
through<00:03:38.340> here<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:40.470> we<00:03:40.709> get<00:03:40.890> this<00:03:41.100> all

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
through here so we get this all

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.510 
through here so we get this all
assembled<00:03:42.000> whoops<00:03:42.329> that's<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.750> wrong<00:03:42.930> key

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.150 

it's<00:03:47.520> really<00:03:47.790> simple<00:03:48.000> man<00:03:48.920> drop<00:03:49.920> in<00:03:50.130> your

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
it's really simple man drop in your

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:58.100 
it's really simple man drop in your
screws<00:03:52.280> just<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.460> this<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:57.540> got<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.810> turn

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
screws just like this you got a turn

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.590 
screws just like this you got a turn
here

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.140 

once<00:04:01.020> you<00:04:01.140> get<00:04:01.290> them<00:04:01.440> all<00:04:01.560> lined<00:04:01.950> up<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.460> they

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
once you get them all lined up and they

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.610 
once you get them all lined up and they
just<00:04:03.360> go<00:04:03.540> right<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:07.460> there<00:04:08.460> we<00:04:08.640> go<00:04:09.350> so<00:04:10.350> we're

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
just go right in there we go so we're

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.860 
just go right in there we go so we're
all<00:04:10.740> set<00:04:10.770> to<00:04:11.130> go<00:04:11.280> there<00:04:11.520> and<00:04:11.730> you'll<00:04:12.600> see<00:04:12.840> that

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
all set to go there and you'll see that

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.710 
all set to go there and you'll see that
there's<00:04:13.290> absolutely<00:04:14.040> no<00:04:14.310> plate<00:04:14.670> I'll<00:04:15.480> show

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
there's absolutely no plate I'll show

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.020 
there's absolutely no plate I'll show
you<00:04:15.780> what<00:04:15.960> this<00:04:16.080> looks<00:04:16.140> like<00:04:16.410> inside<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:20.880> can

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
you what this looks like inside you can

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.000 
you what this looks like inside you can
see<00:04:21.060> where<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.540> cover<00:04:21.780> is<00:04:22.080> holding<00:04:22.920> the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
see where the cover is holding the

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.580 
see where the cover is holding the
bearing<00:04:23.370> in<00:04:23.490> right<00:04:23.670> there<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:25.290> front<00:04:25.500> of

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
bearing in right there and the front of

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.260 
bearing in right there and the front of
the<00:04:25.680> bearing<00:04:26.010> is<00:04:26.130> connected<00:04:26.610> in<00:04:26.730> there<00:04:27.000> in<00:04:27.180> the

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
the bearing is connected in there in the

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.020 
the bearing is connected in there in the
front<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.860> there's<00:04:28.860> absolutely<00:04:29.310> no<00:04:29.580> room<00:04:29.790> for

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
front and there's absolutely no room for

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.880 
front and there's absolutely no room for
any<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.240> this<00:04:30.330> stuff<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.720> move<00:04:30.900> so<00:04:31.230> if<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.650> want

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
any of this stuff to move so if you want

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.920 
any of this stuff to move so if you want
to<00:04:31.980> shim<00:04:32.250> anything<00:04:32.760> put<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.360> shim<00:04:33.630> on<00:04:33.810> the

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
to shim anything put a shim on the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.320 
to shim anything put a shim on the
pinion<00:04:34.260> bearing<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:35.370> rear<00:04:35.610> carrier<00:04:36.060> is<00:04:36.150> not

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
pinion bearing the rear carrier is not

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.700 
pinion bearing the rear carrier is not
going<00:04:36.480> to<00:04:36.570> move<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:36.960> I've<00:04:37.050> tried<00:04:37.290> this<00:04:37.470> with

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
going to move and I've tried this with

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.410 
going to move and I've tried this with
different<00:04:38.100> lockers<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:38.820> different<00:04:39.210> gear

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
different lockers and different gear

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.730 
different lockers and different gear
sets<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:39.960> everything<00:04:40.230> that<00:04:40.320> I<00:04:40.410> could<00:04:40.470> find

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
sets and everything that I could find

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.090 
sets and everything that I could find
and<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:42.120> should<00:04:42.330> have<00:04:42.510> everything<00:04:42.840> work<00:04:43.290> it's

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
and you should have everything work it's

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.040 
and you should have everything work it's
going<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.430> be<00:04:44.520> really<00:04:44.790> really<00:04:45.000> tight<00:04:45.360> but<00:04:45.930> it's

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
going to be really really tight but it's

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.030 
going to be really really tight but it's
going<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.200> work<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:48.870> now<00:04:49.470> when<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:49.740> put<00:04:49.920> the

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
going to work so now when you put the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.900 
going to work so now when you put the
rear<00:04:50.190> tubes<00:04:50.460> in<00:04:51.440> drop<00:04:52.440> in<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.770> tube<00:04:52.980> this<00:04:53.730> can

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
rear tubes in drop in the tube this can

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.370 
rear tubes in drop in the tube this can
be<00:04:53.940> assembled<00:04:54.300> any<00:04:54.570> time<00:04:54.840> because<00:04:55.080> it's<00:04:55.230> all

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
be assembled any time because it's all

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.860 
be assembled any time because it's all
modular<00:04:55.770> so<00:04:56.070> drop<00:04:56.970> in<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.300> tube<00:04:57.480> all<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.720> way

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
modular so drop in the tube all the way

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.720 
modular so drop in the tube all the way
and<00:04:58.200> line<00:04:58.350> up<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.620> holes<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:59.220> you<00:04:59.280> can<00:04:59.580> put

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
and line up the holes so you can put

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.660 
and line up the holes so you can put
that<00:04:59.910> extra<00:05:00.360> screw<00:05:00.870> in<00:05:01.050> there<00:05:01.230> in<00:05:02.160> this<00:05:02.340> screw

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
that extra screw in there in this screw

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.130 
that extra screw in there in this screw
that<00:05:02.820> goes<00:05:03.000> in<00:05:03.180> here<00:05:03.360> actually<00:05:03.540> holds<00:05:04.050> the

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
that goes in here actually holds the

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.580 
that goes in here actually holds the
tube<00:05:04.320> right<00:05:04.560> in<00:05:05.000> so<00:05:06.050> if<00:05:07.050> we're<00:05:07.230> going<00:05:07.380> to<00:05:07.500> do

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
tube right in so if we're going to do

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.910 
tube right in so if we're going to do
the<00:05:07.710> rear<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:09.600> rear<00:05:09.630> is<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.110> longer<00:05:10.410> tube<00:05:10.710> than

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
the rear the rear is a longer tube than

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.920 
the rear the rear is a longer tube than
the<00:05:11.040> front<00:05:11.310> okay<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.090> front<00:05:12.300> is<00:05:12.390> a<00:05:12.420> short<00:05:12.720> tube

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
the front okay the front is a short tube

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.340 
the front okay the front is a short tube
so<00:05:13.830> let's<00:05:14.040> put<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.310> rear<00:05:14.520> in<00:05:15.200> we're<00:05:16.200> going<00:05:16.290> to

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
so let's put the rear in we're going to

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.460 
so let's put the rear in we're going to
take<00:05:16.590> this<00:05:16.880> rear<00:05:17.880> straight<00:05:18.360> axle<00:05:18.600> from<00:05:18.960> axial

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
take this rear straight axle from axial

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.710 
take this rear straight axle from axial
here<00:05:19.710> you'll<00:05:20.610> find<00:05:20.700> out<00:05:21.090> that<00:05:21.120> when<00:05:21.450> you<00:05:21.570> take

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
here you'll find out that when you take

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.240 
here you'll find out that when you take
the<00:05:21.870> straight<00:05:22.110> axle<00:05:22.350> it<00:05:22.650> doesn't<00:05:22.950> fit<00:05:23.100> in<00:05:23.220> the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
the straight axle it doesn't fit in the

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.330 
the straight axle it doesn't fit in the
tube<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:25.110> that's<00:05:25.200> because<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.830> hole<00:05:26.010> in<00:05:26.250> the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
tube and that's because the hole in the

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.510 
tube and that's because the hole in the
tube<00:05:26.580> is<00:05:27.140> just<00:05:28.140> the<00:05:28.350> smallest<00:05:28.680> bit<00:05:28.980> too<00:05:29.190> small

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
tube is just the smallest bit too small

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.330 
tube is just the smallest bit too small
for<00:05:29.820> this<00:05:29.940> little<00:05:30.240> part<00:05:30.600> right<00:05:30.660> here<00:05:31.100> so<00:05:32.100> this

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
for this little part right here so this

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.770 
for this little part right here so this
part<00:05:32.610> right<00:05:32.670> here<00:05:32.820> you'll<00:05:33.120> have<00:05:33.240> to<00:05:33.390> file<00:05:33.570> it

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
part right here you'll have to file it

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.300 
part right here you'll have to file it
off<00:05:33.900> or<00:05:34.080> grind<00:05:34.320> it<00:05:34.470> if<00:05:34.620> you<00:05:34.740> use<00:05:34.920> the<00:05:34.950> stock

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
off or grind it if you use the stock

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.070 
off or grind it if you use the stock
axial<00:05:35.850> if<00:05:35.940> use<00:05:36.120> three<00:05:36.420> hundreds<00:05:36.720> or<00:05:36.840> something

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
axial if use three hundreds or something

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.170 
axial if use three hundreds or something
you<00:05:37.140> don't<00:05:37.170> have<00:05:37.320> a<00:05:37.440> problem<00:05:37.650> with<00:05:37.830> that<00:05:38.180> so

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
you don't have a problem with that so

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.670 
you don't have a problem with that so
we'll<00:05:39.330> drop<00:05:39.540> that<00:05:39.750> in<00:05:39.960> there<00:05:39.990> like<00:05:40.260> that<00:05:40.290> and

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
we'll drop that in there like that and

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.910 
we'll drop that in there like that and
get<00:05:41.220> it<00:05:41.340> stuck<00:05:41.550> into<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:41.940> locker<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.920> then

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
get it stuck into the locker and then

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.580 
get it stuck into the locker and then
we'll<00:05:44.100> get<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.400> bearing<00:05:44.930> and<00:05:45.930> drop<00:05:46.410> the

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
we'll get the bearing and drop the

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.790 
we'll get the bearing and drop the
bearing<00:05:46.950> on<00:05:47.100> the<00:05:47.250> rear<00:05:47.400> tube<00:05:47.670> great<00:05:48.000> like<00:05:48.150> that

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
bearing on the rear tube great like that

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.260 
bearing on the rear tube great like that
so<00:05:49.800> there's<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.190> bearing<00:05:50.550> on<00:05:50.670> the<00:05:50.820> rear<00:05:50.970> tube

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
so there's the bearing on the rear tube

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.620 
so there's the bearing on the rear tube
so<00:05:51.780> now<00:05:52.050> we're<00:05:52.170> going<00:05:52.260> to<00:05:52.320> put<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.560> cover<00:05:52.770> on

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
so now we're going to put the cover on

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.600 
so now we're going to put the cover on
the<00:05:54.630> rear<00:05:54.870> bearing<00:05:55.530> care<00:05:55.800> cover<00:05:56.130> looks<00:05:56.400> just

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
the rear bearing care cover looks just

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.719 
the rear bearing care cover looks just
like<00:05:56.790> this<00:05:57.030> it's<00:05:57.690> just<00:05:57.900> a<00:05:58.020> tiny<00:05:58.230> little<00:05:58.350> part

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
like this it's just a tiny little part

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.399 
like this it's just a tiny little part
and<00:05:59.849> you're<00:06:00.419> going<00:06:00.569> to<00:06:00.659> drop<00:06:00.900> it<00:06:01.080> right<00:06:01.199> on

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
and you're going to drop it right on

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.469 
and you're going to drop it right on
there<00:06:01.650> line<00:06:02.039> up<00:06:02.219> the<00:06:02.249> screw<00:06:02.460> holes<00:06:02.849> so<00:06:03.150> that<00:06:03.180> it

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
there line up the screw holes so that it

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.499 
there line up the screw holes so that it
can<00:06:03.629> put<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.020> little<00:06:04.289> screw<00:06:04.589> in<00:06:04.740> at<00:06:04.889> the<00:06:04.979> end

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:05.509 
can put the little screw in at the end

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.760 
can put the little screw in at the end
you<00:06:06.509> get<00:06:06.629> that<00:06:06.809> to<00:06:06.990> slide<00:06:07.229> on<00:06:07.409> there<00:06:07.589> nice<00:06:07.710> and

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
you get that to slide on there nice and

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.980 
you get that to slide on there nice and
straight<00:06:08.189> and<00:06:08.370> it<00:06:08.969> kind<00:06:09.180> of<00:06:09.240> pops<00:06:09.419> on<00:06:09.749> there

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
straight and it kind of pops on there

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.719 
straight and it kind of pops on there
and<00:06:10.139> then<00:06:10.710> you<00:06:10.800> can<00:06:10.949> add<00:06:11.099> your<00:06:11.219> screw<00:06:11.520> and

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
and then you can add your screw and

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.749 
and then you can add your screw and
that's<00:06:11.849> it<00:06:12.029> and<00:06:12.439> the<00:06:13.439> axle<00:06:13.860> has<00:06:13.949> absolutely<00:06:14.550> no

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
that's it and the axle has absolutely no

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:18.619 
that's it and the axle has absolutely no
play<00:06:15.029> in<00:06:15.210> there<00:06:16.520> there's<00:06:17.520> this<00:06:17.699> may<00:06:18.059> be<00:06:18.120> 52

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629 
play in there there's this may be 52

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.019 
play in there there's this may be 52
hours<00:06:18.930> to<00:06:19.050> play<00:06:19.229> in<00:06:19.379> there<00:06:19.610> and<00:06:20.610> you<00:06:20.669> can<00:06:20.819> put

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
hours to play in there and you can put

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.480 
hours to play in there and you can put
the<00:06:21.180> screw<00:06:21.539> in<00:06:21.569> there<00:06:21.930> to<00:06:22.139> attach<00:06:22.469> the<00:06:22.499> thing

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
the screw in there to attach the thing

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.019 
the screw in there to attach the thing
on<00:06:23.639> both<00:06:23.789> sides<00:06:24.529> now<00:06:25.529> there's<00:06:26.460> the<00:06:26.669> rear<00:06:26.849> on

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:27.029 
on both sides now there's the rear on

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:29.570 
on both sides now there's the rear on
this<00:06:27.210> side<00:06:27.449> so<00:06:27.919> let's<00:06:28.919> suspect<00:06:29.309> that<00:06:29.430> we're

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
this side so let's suspect that we're

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.459 
this side so let's suspect that we're
going<00:06:29.669> to<00:06:29.729> put<00:06:29.909> a<00:06:29.969> front<00:06:30.270> so<00:06:31.169> instead<00:06:31.409> of

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:31.469 
going to put a front so instead of

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:32.899 
going to put a front so instead of
putting<00:06:31.589> the<00:06:31.860> rear<00:06:32.039> tubes<00:06:32.339> you<00:06:32.550> can<00:06:32.580> put<00:06:32.819> the

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
putting the rear tubes you can put the

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:34.429 
putting the rear tubes you can put the
front<00:06:33.120> tube<00:06:33.330> in<00:06:33.539> it<00:06:33.719> does<00:06:33.870> exactly<00:06:34.139> the<00:06:34.409> same

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:34.439 
front tube in it does exactly the same

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:36.889 
front tube in it does exactly the same
thing<00:06:34.789> front<00:06:35.789> tube<00:06:35.999> drops<00:06:36.360> right<00:06:36.539> in<00:06:36.719> there

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:36.899 
thing front tube drops right in there

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:38.809 
thing front tube drops right in there
just<00:06:37.080> like<00:06:37.199> that<00:06:37.279> you're<00:06:38.279> going<00:06:38.399> to<00:06:38.520> line<00:06:38.669> up

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 
just like that you're going to line up

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:42.079 
just like that you're going to line up
the<00:06:38.849> screw<00:06:39.740> and<00:06:40.740> put<00:06:41.009> your<00:06:41.189> screw<00:06:41.520> in<00:06:41.669> there<00:06:41.909> at

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:42.089 
the screw and put your screw in there at

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:47.119 
the screw and put your screw in there at
the<00:06:42.180> back<00:06:42.389> and<00:06:45.199> once<00:06:46.199> the<00:06:46.349> screw<00:06:46.620> is<00:06:46.770> in<00:06:46.949> to

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:47.129 
the back and once the screw is in to

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.820 
the back and once the screw is in to
secure<00:06:47.490> the<00:06:47.610> tube<00:06:47.839> the<00:06:48.839> tube<00:06:49.409> can't<00:06:49.680> go

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
secure the tube the tube can't go

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.510 
secure the tube the tube can't go
anywhere<00:06:51.379> like<00:06:52.379> I<00:06:52.529> said<00:06:52.740> the<00:06:52.889> tolerance<00:06:53.370> on

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
anywhere like I said the tolerance on

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.450 
anywhere like I said the tolerance on
this<00:06:53.759> is<00:06:53.969> really<00:06:54.300> really<00:06:54.599> high<00:06:54.979> so<00:06:55.979> everything

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 
this is really really high so everything

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.589 
this is really really high so everything
is<00:06:56.580> a<00:06:56.610> super<00:06:56.999> tight<00:06:57.240> fit<00:06:57.539> and<00:06:59.149> there's<00:07:00.149> no<00:07:00.240> way

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 
is a super tight fit and there's no way

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:02.989 
is a super tight fit and there's no way
that<00:07:00.870> you're<00:07:01.379> ever<00:07:01.559> going<00:07:01.710> to<00:07:01.770> break<00:07:02.009> that<00:07:02.039> no

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:02.999 
that you're ever going to break that no

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:06.949 
that you're ever going to break that no
way<00:07:03.180> ever<00:07:03.979> there's<00:07:04.979> a<00:07:05.099> front<00:07:05.449> now<00:07:06.449> if<00:07:06.629> we<00:07:06.839> were

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:06.959 
way ever there's a front now if we were

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:09.320 
way ever there's a front now if we were
going<00:07:07.110> to<00:07:07.199> use<00:07:07.379> a<00:07:07.409> super<00:07:07.889> 300<00:07:08.459> set<00:07:08.699> then<00:07:09.029> you'd

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
going to use a super 300 set then you'd

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.139 
going to use a super 300 set then you'd
have<00:07:09.360> to<00:07:09.689> install<00:07:10.110> the<00:07:10.349> super<00:07:10.649> 300<00:07:11.189> into<00:07:11.999> the

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:12.149 
have to install the super 300 into the

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:13.519 
have to install the super 300 into the
knuckle<00:07:12.509> first<00:07:12.779> because<00:07:13.110> it<00:07:13.229> won't<00:07:13.379> fit

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:13.529 
knuckle first because it won't fit

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:14.629 
knuckle first because it won't fit
through<00:07:13.589> the<00:07:13.830> sea<00:07:14.039> hub<00:07:14.219> you<00:07:14.370> know<00:07:14.459> that

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 
through the sea hub you know that

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:17.239 
through the sea hub you know that
already<00:07:14.839> so<00:07:15.839> there's<00:07:16.020> one<00:07:16.259> with<00:07:16.439> a<00:07:16.469> super<00:07:16.770> 300

00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:17.249 
already so there's one with a super 300

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:18.800 
already so there's one with a super 300
in<00:07:17.370> it<00:07:17.490> obviously<00:07:18.029> we<00:07:18.120> can't<00:07:18.330> fit<00:07:18.509> that<00:07:18.659> in

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
in it obviously we can't fit that in

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.089 
in it obviously we can't fit that in
because<00:07:19.110> we<00:07:19.229> don't<00:07:19.409> have<00:07:19.439> the<00:07:19.620> right<00:07:19.770> diff

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:20.099 
because we don't have the right diff

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:23.809 
because we don't have the right diff
hearts<00:07:20.610> inside<00:07:21.349> but<00:07:22.349> if<00:07:23.249> you<00:07:23.430> were<00:07:23.580> going<00:07:23.729> to

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:23.819 
hearts inside but if you were going to
