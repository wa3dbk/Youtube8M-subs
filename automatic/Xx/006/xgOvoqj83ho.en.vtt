00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
stick the first are these little pair of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.039 
stick the first are these little pair of
like<00:02:12.530> vans<00:02:12.950> knockoffs<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.939> they<00:02:14.450> had<00:02:14.689> these

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
like vans knockoffs and they had these

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.449 
like vans knockoffs and they had these
and<00:02:15.349> then<00:02:15.439> they<00:02:15.530> have<00:02:15.680> lace<00:02:15.950> ups<00:02:16.219> in<00:02:16.400> a

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
and then they have lace ups in a

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.759 
and then they have lace ups in a
brighter<00:02:16.790> color<00:02:16.939> but<00:02:17.390> I<00:02:17.420> thought<00:02:17.719> and<00:02:18.079> these

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
brighter color but I thought and these

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.130 
brighter color but I thought and these
have<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.069> lot<00:02:19.310> more<00:02:19.459> like<00:02:19.670> olive<00:02:20.209> khaki<00:02:20.900> tones

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
have a lot more like olive khaki tones

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.300 
have a lot more like olive khaki tones
to<00:02:21.409> them<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:21.680> i<00:02:21.709> thought<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.129> i<00:02:22.189> would

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
to them so i thought that i would

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.009 
to them so i thought that i would
probably<00:02:22.790> get<00:02:22.909> a<00:02:22.969> little<00:02:23.269> more<00:02:23.390> wear<00:02:23.719> out<00:02:23.750> of

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
probably get a little more wear out of

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.380 
probably get a little more wear out of
these<00:02:24.379> verses<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.129> brighter<00:02:25.430> color<00:02:25.790> lace-ups

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
these verses the brighter color lace-ups

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.399 
these verses the brighter color lace-ups
but<00:02:27.230> saying<00:02:28.129> that<00:02:28.480> chances<00:02:29.480> are<00:02:29.689> if<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.230> lace

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
but saying that chances are if the lace

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.410 
but saying that chances are if the lace
up<00:02:30.620> stick<00:02:30.829> around<00:02:31.040> any<00:02:31.430> amount<00:02:31.819> of<00:02:31.879> time<00:02:31.939> I<00:02:32.120> may

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
up stick around any amount of time I may
