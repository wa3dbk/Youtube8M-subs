00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.580
 we all know the flapjack that 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.340
 cartoon blond hair kid 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.910
 network always annoying the captain 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.279
 phalanx as well for those who do not know the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 an episode that the animators stopped 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.910
 off and the jack flap is very disturbing. 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.189
 was canceled a little while ago and the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.669
 animators intended to close the series 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.040
 with the shocking episode but did not 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.920
 they made a copy of the final episode 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.260
 but never cast the why they were seen 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.120
 by a small audience only for 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.510
 tests 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.719
 coincidentally I was in the middle of that 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.210
 group knew one of the animators 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.800
 he took me to a special exhibit 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.579
 but what I saw was completely 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.590
 imaginable 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.579
 the cartoon started normally 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.530
 with introduction and such the title cartoon 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.390
 for the episode was goodbye flapjack 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.380
 only one I leave simple with the background 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.229
 black 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.360
 instead of a silly and lively song in the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.360
 time to show the title card 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.049
 there was no sound but the whisper 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.590
 weak in the wake of the whisper more 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.930
 I think he said to God repeatedly 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.740
 I went to ask for the beginning of the episode here 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.579
 showed flapjack jumping around the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.180
 pier 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.890
 then the phalanx captain stops him and says 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.020
 something in Latin 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.430
 from what I could understand he had said 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.570
 climbed the eté course in the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.460
 means to run on the dock 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.259
 It's good that I caught latina 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.560
 high school but I was wondering 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.290
 because we had they would have done it 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.450
 suddenly flap jec began the region 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.090
 very scary way 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.080
 then looks at the captain as 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.800
 very empty expression 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.560
 bubble well swimming towards them 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.490
 and when he comes in he asks in a good tone 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.960
 calm what 's going on here 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.900
 phalanx you are teaching that was the 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.060
 to ask is to do phalanx begins to 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.760
 laugh very maniac 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.130
 felipe since it looked very sad bubble 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.910
 begins to scream with the captain stops 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.460
 laugh 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.260
 then all the characters in the 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.410
 design stopped 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.590
 everything was silent the check work 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.870
 to screen with an empty look then the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.160
 screen was static for about 10 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.730
 seconds 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.040
 the scene then returns to the dock oab since 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.890
 ran away from candy 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.130
 very sad look in depressive 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.980
 face he enters the candy store and 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.520
 there was nobody there it was all dark and 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.600
 suddenly flapjack sits down and starts to 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.790
 cry 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.120
 Then Luis Mint leaves the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.830
 funds wondering what was wrong 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.380
 ask here was the check in for the 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.570
 pitching with a very nervous face and 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.690
 his expression shivered until the 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.820
 emerged back then ran to 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.630
 out of the candy store towards the 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.120
 pier 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:27.580
 The captain was sitting on the bench in 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.750
 Seafront by flapjack saw it running 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.690
 for him 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.780
 then jumped into the sea and the bubble 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.840
 started running after him screaming not 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.260
 drank not the screen shows the flap jack 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.019
 sinking to the bottom of the sea ​​the city 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.739
 whole time towards the pier and 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:50.350
 captain starts to laugh bubble then comes back 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.150
 holding the corpse of sea flapjack and 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.850
 plays the places 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.769
 so good look at phalanx and screams 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.709
 with a desperate voice 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.900

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.400
 wrong with you 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.040
 was the most scary scene and 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.280
 I've seen in my life. 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.450
 one of the citizens then says it 's too late 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.070
 the doctor looks at flapjack for 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:19.010
 says a very low voice he is dead 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.239
 all the citizens went away capes 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.790
 low 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.910
 the episode ended with crying bubbles 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.660
 next to flapjack and with the captain 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.139
 away from the head down also the screen 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.510
 fades away 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.380
 it turns black for about a 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.130
 minute 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.160
 suddenly the screen quickly flashes 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.410
 body image of dead flapjack and 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.020
 mutilated with a piranha trapped in the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.889
 remains of his arms twisting by 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.919
 to then it starts flashing images 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:56.150
 many scary flapjack and by 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:59.620
