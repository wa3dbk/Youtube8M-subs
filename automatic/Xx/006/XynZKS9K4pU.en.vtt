00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
using the same seventies line dance so

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.050 
using the same seventies line dance so
we<00:03:27.350> did<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.130> song<00:03:28.430> many<00:03:28.790> years<00:03:29.000> ago<00:03:29.270> and

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
we did to that song many years ago and

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.080 
we did to that song many years ago and
it<00:03:32.060> was<00:03:32.240> ok<00:03:32.450> but<00:03:33.080> if<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:33.890> actually<00:03:34.160> had<00:03:34.610> time<00:03:34.850> and

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
it was ok but if I actually had time and

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.140 
it was ok but if I actually had time and
I<00:03:35.150> could<00:03:35.360> go<00:03:35.390> back<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.930> redo<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.410> whole<00:03:36.440> thing

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
I could go back and redo the whole thing

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.199 
I could go back and redo the whole thing
it<00:03:38.150> would<00:03:38.300> be<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.780> hundred<00:03:39.080> percent<00:03:39.230> better

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
it would be a hundred percent better

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.090 
it would be a hundred percent better

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
we'd practice it probably for a couple

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.910 
we'd practice it probably for a couple
hours<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:44.540> get<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.780> dance<00:03:44.990> moves<00:03:45.230> down<00:03:45.590> right

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920
