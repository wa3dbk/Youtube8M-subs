00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
right there but it also doesn't hurt to

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.569 
right there but it also doesn't hurt to
drop<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.650> on<00:03:22.709> your<00:03:22.739> other<00:03:22.920> monsters<00:03:23.370> or<00:03:23.519> if

you<00:03:29.549> end<00:03:29.670> up<00:03:29.760> dealing<00:03:29.970> 6<00:03:30.299> grand<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.660> they<00:03:30.720> go

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
you end up dealing 6 grand and they go

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.080 
you end up dealing 6 grand and they go
to<00:03:30.900> 2,000<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:32.100> fact<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.609> shrinks<00:03:33.030> your

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
to 2,000 the fact that it shrinks your

to 2,000 the fact that it shrinks your
found<00:03:33.630> immortal<00:03:33.959> isn't<00:03:34.170> really<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.380> big

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
found immortal isn't really a big

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.140 
found immortal isn't really a big
problem<00:03:35.040> because<00:03:35.280> they<00:03:35.430> can't<00:03:35.640> attack<00:03:35.760> him

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
problem because they can't attack him

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.960 
problem because they can't attack him
anyway<00:03:36.569> so<00:03:37.200> you'll<00:03:38.190> still<00:03:38.400> be<00:03:38.489> perfectly<00:03:38.790> fine
