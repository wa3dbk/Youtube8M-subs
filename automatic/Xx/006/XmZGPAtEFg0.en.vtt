problem that people have with our ngons
is<00:01:22.409> they<00:01:22.530> tend<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.280> even<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.549> they're

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
is they tend to that even if they're

is they tend to that even if they're
fine<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.780> happens<00:01:25.460> they<00:01:26.460> don't<00:01:26.490> get

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
head squat hips flat at a point because

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.740 
head squat hips flat at a point because
I<00:01:52.930> tended<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.770> on<00:01:53.950> my<00:01:54.070> own<00:01:54.220> videos<00:01:54.550> to<00:01:54.910> be<00:01:55.570> back

hips being flat as you're turning you're
in<00:02:02.590> one<00:02:02.860> absolutely<00:02:03.930> straight<00:02:04.930> line<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:05.800> from

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
in one absolutely straight line so from

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.950 
in one absolutely straight line so from
here<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.700> can<00:02:06.850> almost<00:02:06.970> pack<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.420> tsunami<00:02:07.780> on

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
here you can almost pack a tsunami on

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.020 
here you can almost pack a tsunami on
like<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.350> put<00:02:08.560> your<00:02:08.680> hands<00:02:08.890> here<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.399> think

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
like that put your hands here and think

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.610 
like that put your hands here and think
of<00:02:10.119> keeping<00:02:10.300> your<00:02:10.540> hands<00:02:10.810> straight<00:02:11.290> as

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
of keeping your hands straight as

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.950 
of keeping your hands straight as
opposed<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.670> break<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.300> when<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.510> do<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.660> turn

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
opposed to break it when you do a turn

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.180 
opposed to break it when you do a turn
so<00:02:14.500> we're<00:02:14.650> here<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.270> we<00:02:16.270> want<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.570> keep<00:02:16.750> them

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
so we're here and we want to keep them

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.180 
so we're here and we want to keep them
flat<00:02:18.750> around<00:02:19.750> right<00:02:20.530> as<00:02:20.770> opposed<00:02:21.160> to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
flat around right as opposed to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.040 
flat around right as opposed to
naturally<00:02:24.190> fall<00:02:24.400> over

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
naturally fall over

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.840 
naturally fall over
going<00:02:26.050> back<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.440> again<00:02:26.740> same<00:02:27.340> thing<00:02:27.580> applies

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
going back to again same thing applies

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.250 
going back to again same thing applies
for<00:02:27.880> other<00:02:28.210> terms<00:02:28.510> make<00:02:28.780> sure<00:02:28.960> you're<00:02:29.110> going

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
for other terms make sure you're going

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.800 
for other terms make sure you're going
up<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.640> principle<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.210> told<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.720> about

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
up it's that principle I told you about

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.630 
up it's that principle I told you about
before<00:02:32.050> that<00:02:32.290> somebody<00:02:32.710> has<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.100> by<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.310> ribs

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
before that somebody has you by the ribs

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.940 
before that somebody has you by the ribs
and<00:02:34.420> on<00:02:34.780> your<00:02:34.960> on<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.290> on<00:02:35.470> they<00:02:36.190> take<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.720> up

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
and on your on and on they take you up

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.870 
and on your on and on they take you up
rather<00:02:38.950> than<00:02:40.800> saying<00:02:41.800> look<00:02:42.160> I'm<00:02:42.550> exaggerating

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
rather than saying look I'm exaggerating

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.120 
rather than saying look I'm exaggerating
but<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.050> many<00:02:44.170> people<00:02:44.290> don't<00:02:44.650> realize<00:02:44.980> they're

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
but so many people don't realize they're

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.580 
but so many people don't realize they're
not<00:02:45.250> going<00:02:45.490> up<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.150> really<00:02:46.450> think<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.900> again

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
not going up so really think of again

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.620 
not going up so really think of again
you<00:02:47.710> can<00:02:47.860> try<00:02:48.010> like<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.430> arms<00:02:49.239> on<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.450> ribs

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
you can try like that arms on the ribs

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.290 
you can try like that arms on the ribs
and<00:02:49.950> somebody's<00:02:50.950> literally<00:02:51.520> taking<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.060> I'm

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
and somebody's literally taking you I'm

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.949 
and somebody's literally taking you I'm
lifting<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.340> lift<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:55.000> then<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.660> can<00:02:55.810> get

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
lifting you lift and then you can get

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.520 
lifting you lift and then you can get
around<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:57.400> almost<00:02:57.760> easier<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.330> think<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:59.080> do

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
around it's almost easier I think to do

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.400 
around it's almost easier I think to do
a<00:02:59.560> non-date<00:02:59.890> on<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.580> arms<00:03:00.850> a<00:03:00.910> bit<00:03:01.180> as<00:03:01.420> opposed

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
a non-date on the arms a bit as opposed

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.050 
a non-date on the arms a bit as opposed
to<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.650> arms<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.070> first<00:03:03.250> because<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.850> get

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
to the arms and first because you get

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.940 
to the arms and first because you get
that<00:03:04.290> feeling<00:03:05.310> right<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.900> forces<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.140> go

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
that feeling right it forces you to go

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.220 
that feeling right it forces you to go
up<00:03:09.160> rather<00:03:09.760> than<00:03:10.200> gets<00:03:11.200> us<00:03:11.940> here<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.840> if<00:03:14.080> you're

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
up rather than gets us here so if you're

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.050 
up rather than gets us here so if you're
struggling<00:03:14.470> with<00:03:14.680> your<00:03:14.800> own<00:03:14.950> videos<00:03:15.280> try<00:03:16.000> it

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
struggling with your own videos try it

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.790 
struggling with your own videos try it
lift<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.360> arms<00:03:16.600> up<00:03:16.750> see<00:03:17.290> what<00:03:17.440> happens

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
lift the arms up see what happens

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.940 
lift the arms up see what happens
because<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.640> want<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:18.910> have<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.390> feeling

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
because you want to have that feeling

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.580 
because you want to have that feeling
even<00:03:20.950> if<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.430> arms<00:03:21.790> aren't<00:03:22.269> first<00:03:22.720> right<00:03:23.440> is

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
even if the arms aren't first right is

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.949 
even if the arms aren't first right is
that<00:03:23.620> lifts<00:03:24.130> through<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.550> waist<00:03:24.959> while

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
that lifts through the waist while

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.660 
that lifts through the waist while
keeping<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.470> hips<00:03:26.620> wet<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.130> staying<00:03:27.310> forward

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
keeping the hips wet and staying forward

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.370 
keeping the hips wet and staying forward
obviously<00:03:28.300> there<00:03:28.750> are<00:03:28.810> two<00:03:28.989> different<00:03:29.260> types

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
obviously there are two different types

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.290 
obviously there are two different types

trains this leg it train to get over
that<00:03:49.739> leg<00:03:49.950> immediately<00:03:50.870> because<00:03:51.870> if<00:03:52.110> you're

Lego<00:03:52.409> side<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:53.280> have<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.819> get<00:03:53.940> over<00:03:54.150> that

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
Lego side you have to get over that

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.770 
Lego side you have to get over that

that is if the arms are going up you

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.180 
that is if the arms are going up you
want<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:05.970> think<00:05:06.210> of<00:05:06.300> them<00:05:06.539> going<00:05:07.380> together<00:05:07.680> I

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
want to think of them going together I

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.279 
want to think of them going together I
see<00:05:08.729> a<00:05:08.760> lot<00:05:09.000> of<00:05:09.030> people<00:05:09.240> do<00:05:09.630> on<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:09.960> ons<00:05:10.110> like

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
see a lot of people do on it ons like

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.190 
see a lot of people do on it ons like
this<00:05:10.520> one<00:05:12.440> too<00:05:13.470> you<00:05:14.310> want<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:14.580> make<00:05:14.729> they<00:05:14.880> are

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
this one too you want to make they are

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.760 
this one too you want to make they are
completely<00:05:16.200> in<00:05:16.620> sync<00:05:17.340> because<00:05:18.000> this<00:05:18.770> gives

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
completely in sync because this gives

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.409 
completely in sync because this gives
you<00:05:19.950> momentum<00:05:20.550> watch<00:05:21.090> this<00:05:21.360> is<00:05:21.479> the<00:05:21.630> wrong<00:05:21.810> way

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
you momentum watch this is the wrong way

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.960 
you momentum watch this is the wrong way
right<00:05:24.419> you<00:05:24.660> have<00:05:25.020> your<00:05:25.260> boss<00:05:25.530> as<00:05:25.919> opposed<00:05:26.639> to

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
right you have your boss as opposed to

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:33.420 
right you have your boss as opposed to
them<00:05:27.180> being<00:05:27.229> together<00:05:30.830> see<00:05:31.830> it<00:05:32.400> gives

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
them being together see it gives

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.290 
them being together see it gives
you<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:34.210> force<00:05:34.540> and<00:05:35.010> somehow<00:05:36.010> to<00:05:36.640> reckon<00:05:37.120> line

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
you the force and somehow to reckon line

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.870 
you the force and somehow to reckon line
so<00:05:37.870> if<00:05:38.080> you're<00:05:38.230> even<00:05:39.070> the<00:05:39.160> times<00:05:39.370> are<00:05:39.580> cursed

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
so if you're even the times are cursed

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.440 
so if you're even the times are cursed
think<00:05:40.630> of<00:05:40.750> them<00:05:40.900> going<00:05:41.140> together<00:05:42.060> as<00:05:43.060> opposed

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
think of them going together as opposed

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.530 
think of them going together as opposed
to<00:05:45.060> this<00:05:46.060> one<00:05:46.240> being<00:05:46.420> way<00:05:46.660> right<00:05:47.610> that's<00:05:48.610> your

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
to this one being way right that's your

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.160 
to this one being way right that's your
position<00:05:50.010> that's<00:05:51.010> your<00:05:51.910> position<00:05:52.170> last

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
position that's your position last

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.080 
position that's your position last
little<00:05:53.500> thing<00:05:53.590> and<00:05:54.310> I'll<00:05:54.460> give<00:05:54.640> you<00:05:54.790> a<00:05:54.820> lot<00:05:54.970> to

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
little thing and I'll give you a lot to

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.770 
little thing and I'll give you a lot to
think<00:05:55.270> about

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
think about

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.200 
think about
make<00:05:56.230> sure<00:05:56.410> you're<00:05:56.590> using<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:57.010> backswing<00:05:57.490> if

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
make sure you're using the backswing if

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.960 
make sure you're using the backswing if
you<00:05:58.510> rely<00:05:58.870> from<00:05:59.440> the<00:05:59.560> side<00:05:59.770> and<00:05:59.950> if<00:06:00.460> you<00:06:00.640> rely

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
you rely from the side and if you rely

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.270 
you rely from the side and if you rely
on<00:06:01.420> just<00:06:02.050> this<00:06:02.260> leg<00:06:03.090> to<00:06:04.090> get<00:06:04.630> you<00:06:04.840> up<00:06:05.020> you<00:06:05.980> have

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
on just this leg to get you up you have

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.110 
on just this leg to get you up you have
nothing

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
nothing

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.420 
nothing
so<00:06:07.690> really<00:06:07.990> walk<00:06:08.290> the<00:06:08.440> late<00:06:08.650> weight<00:06:08.890> has<00:06:09.190> to<00:06:09.220> be

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
so really walk the late weight has to be

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.510 
so really walk the late weight has to be
here<00:06:09.910> use<00:06:10.540> that<00:06:10.810> back<00:06:11.140> foot<00:06:11.530> we<00:06:12.250> should<00:06:12.430> do

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
here use that back foot we should do

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.890 
here use that back foot we should do
this<00:06:12.640> way<00:06:12.820> use<00:06:13.360> that<00:06:13.630> exit<00:06:14.260> as<00:06:14.440> your<00:06:14.920> power

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
this way use that exit as your power

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.180 
this way use that exit as your power
right<00:06:16.900> so<00:06:17.380> we're<00:06:17.560> not<00:06:18.510> like<00:06:19.510> this<00:06:19.780> and<00:06:20.260> then

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
right so we're not like this and then

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.720 
right so we're not like this and then
this<00:06:21.420> okay<00:06:22.450> so<00:06:23.050> again<00:06:23.410> it's<00:06:23.620> that<00:06:23.730> almost

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
this okay so again it's that almost

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.880 
this okay so again it's that almost
think<00:06:24.970> here's<00:06:25.420> how<00:06:25.570> you<00:06:25.630> can<00:06:25.750> do<00:06:25.900> this<00:06:26.110> think

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
think here's how you can do this think

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.640 
think here's how you can do this think
of<00:06:27.010> this<00:06:27.280> opposite<00:06:27.970> arm<00:06:28.150> going<00:06:28.960> to<00:06:29.170> fifth<00:06:29.440> and

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
of this opposite arm going to fifth and
