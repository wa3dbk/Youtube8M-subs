at<00:02:27.050> some<00:02:27.260> point

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
at some point

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.920 
at some point
ah<00:02:30.240> yeah<00:02:31.240> so<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.380> was<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:33.330> European<00:02:34.920> model

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
ah yeah so this was a European model

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.550 
ah yeah so this was a European model
4955<00:02:37.930> or<00:02:38.910> 4960<00:02:39.910> as<00:02:40.120> they<00:02:41.020> would<00:02:41.170> call<00:02:41.350> them

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
4955 or 4960 as they would call them

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.830 
4955 or 4960 as they would call them
here<00:02:41.970> all<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.180> parts<00:02:43.510> for<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> 4960<00:02:44.880> fit<00:02:45.880> this

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
here all the parts for the 4960 fit this

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.690 
here all the parts for the 4960 fit this
thing<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.160> doesn't<00:02:48.400> matter<00:02:48.490> whether

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
thing so it doesn't matter whether

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.880 
thing so it doesn't matter whether
there's<00:02:48.880> a<00:02:48.940> 4955<00:02:49.870> clout<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.350> would<00:02:50.470> matter<00:02:50.620> for

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
there's a 4955 clout it would matter for

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.130 
there's a 4955 clout it would matter for
4955<00:02:51.700> cab<00:02:52.030> because<00:02:52.270> there's<00:02:52.540> some<00:02:52.720> things<00:02:52.960> in

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
4955 cab because there's some things in

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.570 
4955 cab because there's some things in
the<00:02:53.260> cab<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.530> are<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.860> little<00:02:54.010> different<00:02:54.130> than

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
the cab that are a little different than

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.500 
the cab that are a little different than
the<00:02:55.620> 4960<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:56.860> what<00:02:57.730> I'm<00:02:57.850> going<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.210> be<00:02:58.360> doing

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
the 4960 so what I'm going to be doing

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.870 
the 4960 so what I'm going to be doing
is<00:02:58.720> actually<00:02:58.930> getting<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.440> 4960<00:03:00.310> cab<00:03:00.580> and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
is actually getting a 4960 cab and

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.030 
is actually getting a 4960 cab and
putting<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.240> on<00:03:01.390> here<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.870> then<00:03:02.770> you're<00:03:02.920> not

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
putting it on here and then you're not

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.750 
putting it on here and then you're not
even<00:03:03.250> going<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.460> know<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.730> difference

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
even going to know the difference

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.850 
even going to know the difference
whether<00:03:04.270> it<00:03:04.510> was<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> European<00:03:05.110> model<00:03:05.560> or<00:03:05.800> not

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
whether it was a European model or not

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.650 
whether it was a European model or not
there<00:03:06.160> was<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.310> lot<00:03:06.460> of<00:03:06.550> things<00:03:06.790> inside<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.450> cab

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
there was a lot of things inside the cab

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.310 
there was a lot of things inside the cab
on<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.870> dashboard<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.710> looked<00:03:09.370> different

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
on the dashboard that looked different

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.520 
on the dashboard that looked different
than<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.470> 4955<00:03:12.400> of<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.970> US<00:03:13.270> or<00:03:13.480> even<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.780> 4960

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
than the 4955 of the US or even the 4960

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.680 
than the 4955 of the US or even the 4960
of<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.710> US<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.910> it's<00:03:16.180> actually<00:03:16.330> going<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.600> look

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
of the US so it's actually going to look

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.970 
of the US so it's actually going to look
normal

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
normal

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.950 
normal
and<00:03:18.820> it<00:03:18.940> isn't<00:03:19.060> really<00:03:19.210> going<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.480> matter<00:03:19.690> too

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
and it isn't really going to matter too

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.180 
and it isn't really going to matter too
much<00:03:19.990> because<00:03:20.410> everything<00:03:21.130> up<00:03:21.310> here<00:03:21.610> is<00:03:23.190> 4960

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
much because everything up here is 4960

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.350 
much because everything up here is 4960
the<00:03:24.760> thing<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.090> am<00:03:25.240> going<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.720> do<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.880> just<00:03:27.880> just

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
the thing I am going to do is just just

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.000 
the thing I am going to do is just just
start<00:03:28.600> replacing<00:03:28.960> everything<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:29.740> bad

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
start replacing everything that is bad

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.699 
start replacing everything that is bad
but<00:03:30.880> right<00:03:31.060> now<00:03:31.240> first<00:03:31.930> things<00:03:32.170> first<00:03:32.260> we're

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
but right now first things first we're

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.949 
but right now first things first we're
going<00:03:32.800> to<00:03:32.890> pull<00:03:33.100> this<00:03:33.250> panel<00:03:34.239> off<00:03:34.390> of<00:03:34.420> here<00:03:34.750> at

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
going to pull this panel off of here at

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.840 
going to pull this panel off of here at
the<00:03:35.290> battery<00:03:35.620> box<00:03:35.800> pull<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.250> step<00:03:36.520> off<00:03:36.670> the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
the battery box pull the step off the

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.140 
the battery box pull the step off the
bottom<00:03:37.209> if<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.410> just<00:03:38.640> get<00:03:39.640> in<00:03:39.760> here<00:03:40.030> so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
I can get under that cab and pull those

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.890 
I can get under that cab and pull those
mounts<00:03:42.160> off<00:03:42.340> then<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.060> got<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.450> see<00:03:43.480> what<00:03:43.720> kind

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
mounts off then I got to see what kind

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.479 
mounts off then I got to see what kind
of<00:03:43.959> wiring<00:03:44.380> harness<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:44.860> that<00:03:45.010> I'm<00:03:45.100> going<00:03:45.310> to

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
of wiring harness is that I'm going to

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.160 
of wiring harness is that I'm going to
just<00:03:45.670> cut

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
just cut

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.770 
just cut

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
here's that cable there's the brake fork

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.140 
here's that cable there's the brake fork
right<00:03:49.989> there<00:03:50.320> there's<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:50.980> brake<00:03:51.400> pack<00:03:51.700> right

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.360 
at the tip of my finger which the
American<00:03:55.480> version<00:03:56.020> of<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.200> 4960<00:03:56.980> doesn't

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
American version of the 4960 doesn't

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.259 
American version of the 4960 doesn't
have<00:03:57.610> so<00:03:59.220> I'm<00:04:00.220> not<00:04:00.400> going<00:04:00.580> to<00:04:00.640> change<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.120> I'm

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
have so I'm not going to change it I'm

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.330 
have so I'm not going to change it I'm
just<00:04:01.480> going<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.690> disable<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.620> because<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.280> never

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
just going to disable it because I never

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.680 
just going to disable it because I never
used<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.910> to<00:04:03.940> be<00:04:04.090> honest<00:04:04.300> with<00:04:04.360> as<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.510> matter<00:04:04.660> of

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
used it to be honest with as a matter of

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.710 
used it to be honest with as a matter of
fact<00:04:04.870> it's<00:04:05.080> got<00:04:05.320> it<00:04:06.000> somewhere<00:04:07.000> someone<00:04:07.510> had

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
fact it's got it somewhere someone had

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.920 
fact it's got it somewhere someone had
put<00:04:07.930> too<00:04:08.110> many<00:04:08.790> well<00:04:09.790> they<00:04:10.360> never<00:04:10.540> took<00:04:10.780> the

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
put too many well they never took the

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.110 
put too many well they never took the
brake<00:04:11.140> off<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:12.220> burned<00:04:12.550> them<00:04:12.760> out

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
brake off and burned them out

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.750 
brake off and burned them out
so<00:04:13.600> those<00:04:13.959> brake<00:04:14.440> packs<00:04:14.800> aren't<00:04:15.430> even<00:04:15.640> in

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
so those brake packs aren't even in

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.710 
so those brake packs aren't even in
there<00:04:17.040> yeah<00:04:18.040> they<00:04:18.310> never<00:04:18.459> work<00:04:18.790> from<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.540> day
