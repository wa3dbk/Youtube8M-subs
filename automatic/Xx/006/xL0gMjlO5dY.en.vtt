00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.390
 look at the food of bayer presents 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.570
 animal office 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.639
 the walks on very cold nights do not dry 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.459
 well the mantle of our dogs or the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.230
 sudden changes in temperature favor 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.779
 multiply the cases of the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.910
 food two of the kennels that this 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.550
 pathology is characterized by being very 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.849
 contagious although it does not usually present 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.019
 complications and is located 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.949
 exclusively in the upper part of the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.020
 airways his real name is 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.880
 infectious canine tracheobronchitis but 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.040
 everyone knows her as all of 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.770
 the kennels since the casualties 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.239
 temperatures and overcrowding make 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.000
 the disease spreads quickly 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.030
 through shelters or in places where 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.890
 many dogs live together 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.920
 transmission is done by contact 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.019
 direct the entrance is by air and 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.239
 that occurs through the drops that 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.179
 expels the canal when sneezing or 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.149
 cough this makes a single copy 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:06.180
 can infect many to the place in the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.240
 park on the street or when sleeping near 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.340
 they at this point must be warned that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.300
 in no way can it be transmitted to 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.520
 people 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.800
 it is more frequent in communities of 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.350
 animals as hatcheries and residences 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.410
 canines since stress overcrowding 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.410
 and environmental factors such as lack 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.760
 of ventilation or poor hygiene 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.370
 can alter the immune system 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.030
 of those making them 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.580
 vulnerable to the virus the most 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.500
 highlighted is the very marked dry cough that 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.650
 It is usually exacerbated with physical exercise 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.140
 in a state of excitement or when 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.720
 press the neck with the strap on 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.150
 chances are also observed discharge 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.520
 nasal in most cases the 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.040
 Sick dogs eat well and remain 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.530
 active in these patients so 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.750
 general the clinical signs are resolved 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.390
 spontaneously sometimes without 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.950
 need to go to the vet there 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.110
 that extreme precautions in 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.630
 puppies too small or in dogs with 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.730
 previous pulmonary alterations since 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.490
 they can have complications 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.320
 like pneumonia this disease is not 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.510
 serious for the animal since in the 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.030
 Most of the cases usually refer to 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.940
 two weeks after the process was established 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.950
 antitussives can always be prescribed 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.170
 and when there is no suspicion of the presence of 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.080
 fluid in the lungs and advise 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.390
 rest for at least seven days what 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.040
 precautions we can take the most 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.290
 It is advisable to have our pet 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.630
 the best nutritional conditions and 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.239
 hygienic avoiding situations of 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.200
 stress in this way even in case of 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.680
 contagion 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.850
 the forecast will always be favorable 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.650
 logically we can not prevent that 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.170
 our pet relates to others 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.269
 dogs in the park and play next to 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.489
 them so there is always a 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.890
 small risk in the case of 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.630
 animals that live in shelters 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.940
 protective or canine residences is 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.160
 advisable to vaccinate annually 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.590
 since they are much more exposed to 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.720
 virus that a dog that lives at home that 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.030
 has a correct diet and a 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.220
 strong immune system in 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.680
 definitively our pets with the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.870
 arrival of the cold suffer a kind of 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.580
 canine flu that has no major 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.610
 complications that we usually 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.569
 suffer us in any case please 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.599
 always consult your veterinarian 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.629
 this section was presented by look at the 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:32.049
 bayer's food and if it's bayern it's 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.049
 good
