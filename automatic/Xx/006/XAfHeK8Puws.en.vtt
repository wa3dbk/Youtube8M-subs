00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
bit that I had come up and it looks very

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.150 
bit that I had come up and it looks very
buildable<00:00:27.140> which<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.320> another<00:00:28.619> very<00:00:28.710> nice

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160

thing I like the brush that's on here it

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.470 
thing I like the brush that's on here it
doesn't<00:00:35.070> seem<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.640> settling<00:00:36.059> into<00:00:36.300> any

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
doesn't seem like it's settling into any

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.760 
doesn't seem like it's settling into any
fine<00:00:36.780> lines

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020

of just a little bit that I put on there

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.150 
of just a little bit that I put on there
and<00:00:49.270> because<00:00:49.600> I<00:00:49.630> am<00:00:49.900> wanting<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.320> do<00:00:50.470> some

highlighting there I'm going to kind of

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.090 
highlighting there I'm going to kind of
take<00:00:54.160> it<00:00:54.310> out<00:00:54.430> a<00:00:54.460> little<00:00:54.670> bit<00:00:54.910> more<00:00:55.060> like<00:00:55.300> that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
getting before I put any more use

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.130 
getting before I put any more use
anything<00:01:03.940> else<00:01:04.210> so<00:01:04.510> I'm<00:01:04.630> getting<00:01:04.750> quite<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:05.050> bit

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
and I feel it is definitely giving me

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.940 
and I feel it is definitely giving me
the<00:01:07.840> right<00:01:08.020> corrupting<00:01:08.790> coverage<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.710> very

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
the right corrupting coverage it's very

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.800 
the right corrupting coverage it's very
thin<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:15.400> at<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.850> same<00:01:16.000> time<00:01:16.270> it's<00:01:16.420> covering

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
thin but at the same time it's covering

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.930 
thin but at the same time it's covering
up<00:01:17.190> quite<00:01:18.190> well<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:24.369> buildable

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
up quite well and it's buildable

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.780 
up quite well and it's buildable
it's<00:01:25.660> very<00:01:25.869> buildable<00:01:26.260> that's<00:01:26.979> another<00:01:27.369> key

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
it's very buildable that's another key
