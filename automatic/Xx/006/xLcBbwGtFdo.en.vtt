microphone<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.770> easily<00:02:35.160> pulled<00:02:35.520> out

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
microphone and it's easily pulled out

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.490 
microphone and it's easily pulled out
it's<00:02:36.270> also<00:02:36.390> very<00:02:36.630> flexible<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.350> can

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
it's also very flexible so you can

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.900 
it's also very flexible so you can
re-enter<00:02:37.830> wherever<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.220> want<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.790> doesn't

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
re-enter wherever you want so it doesn't

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.580 
re-enter wherever you want so it doesn't
matter<00:02:39.180> if<00:02:39.270> your<00:02:39.420> air<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.750> up<00:02:39.930> here<00:02:40.170> all<00:02:40.350> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
matter if your air is up here all the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.020 
matter if your air is up here all the
way<00:02:40.620> down<00:02:40.920> here<00:02:41.190> it's<00:02:41.310> going<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.520> reach<00:02:41.700> and

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
way down here it's going to reach and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.550 
way down here it's going to reach and
the<00:02:42.510> good<00:02:42.660> thing<00:02:42.840> about<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.110> retractable

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
the good thing about the retractable

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.810 
the good thing about the retractable
side<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.040> if<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.190> want<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.400> show<00:02:44.580> off<00:02:44.610> the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
side is if you want to show off the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.400 
side is if you want to show off the
headset<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.270> public<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:46.050> can<00:02:46.200> choose<00:02:46.380> to

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
headset in public you can choose to

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.930 
headset in public you can choose to
conceal<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.250> it's<00:02:47.400> not<00:02:47.490> going<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.730> be<00:02:47.820> in

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
conceal it so it's not going to be in

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.480 
conceal it so it's not going to be in
the<00:02:48.030> way<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:49.470> taking<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.830> closer<00:02:50.100> look<00:02:50.220> at<00:02:50.430> the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
the way so taking a closer look at the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.890 
the way so taking a closer look at the
air<00:02:50.640> cups<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.240> made<00:02:51.510> out<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.630> leather

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
air cups it's made out of leather

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.870 
air cups it's made out of leather
material<00:02:52.470> with<00:02:52.650> some<00:02:52.860> sound<00:02:53.190> dampening<00:02:53.520> foam

material with some sound dampening foam

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.490 
material with some sound dampening foam
the<00:02:54.090> inside<00:02:54.450> which<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.780> good<00:02:54.990> for<00:02:55.020> noise

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
the inside which is good for noise

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.040 
the inside which is good for noise
cancelling<00:02:56.270> so<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.390> overall<00:02:57.510> construction

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
cancelling so the overall construction

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.020 
cancelling so the overall construction
of<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.560> headset<00:02:58.950> uses<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.400> nice<00:02:59.670> hard

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
mic and their audio is so taking a look

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.699 
mic and their audio is so taking a look
at<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.060> cable<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.600> comes<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.050> at<00:03:40.170> one<00:03:40.410> meter

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
at the cable it comes in at one meter

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.350 
at the cable it comes in at one meter
long<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.370> should<00:03:41.580> reach<00:03:41.790> about<00:03:42.030> wherever

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
long so it should reach about wherever

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.020 
long so it should reach about wherever
your<00:03:42.690> system<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.260> but<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.370> case<00:03:44.400> they've

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
your system is but just in case they've

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.090 
your system is but just in case they've
included<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.570> extension<00:03:46.019> cable<00:03:46.470> which<00:03:46.890> has
