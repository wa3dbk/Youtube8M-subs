00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.479
 what do you want 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.220
 Now I'm going to explain a little 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.439
 what has been the news itself already 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.600
 Tell me what I think about everything 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.939
 bit 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.470
 retirement in September 2015 is 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.840
 boiling 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.540
 because because they are going to create a new 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.770
 program and flipnote studio says in some 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.120
 point of the year nintendo will launch 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.730
 a new affiliate program that 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.680
 he replaces his old club and for those who 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.360
 register during the during their 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.600
 first weeks there will be a gift in this 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.190
 case flipnote studio 3 that if you do not 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.590
 you know is this little program with what 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.900
 can do animations and draw in 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.000
 different layers is very very very cool 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.680
 it's a program that I love and I 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.120
 I would like very much to have and more if it is 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.860
 free digitally they give you this way 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.530
 because if simply to be part of 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.740
 of the new club nintendo that you do not know 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.070
 even when will it open 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.360
 Do not know doors are already going to close 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.159
 the nintendo club that has been now 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.989
 where is the star catalog I know where 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.550
 It's all because they want to do 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.849
 one better up here we have all arrived 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.160
 well I want to know if the one that will be 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.910
 better or they say it will be better going to 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.290
 be released before later during the 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.569
 same day that closes in which there is 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.140
 currently you do not know that is in the 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.200
 air 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.610
 that yes in which in the attempt 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.930
 the nintendo catalog that we have 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.390
 now in the nintendo club there 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.890
 currently all the stars everything 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.470
 what you have will be lost if you have not 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.110
 spent before that September day 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.060
 it's so good I think that from here to 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.160
 September you have plenty of time to 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.190
 record the games you have and 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.900
 buy what you like with the 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.600
 stars that you consider good we continue 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.280
 with this it's ok it came out japan even had 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.540
 his own direct attempt in Spanish 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.380
 they are talking here about flipnote studio 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.030
 3d 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.670
 says the calendar of the stars of 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.310
 nintendo club attention and this is very 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.560
 important 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.330
 worth the program is that way according to your 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.400
 own statement from day 1 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.709
 April 2015 that is to say within three 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.180
 months from this date nintendo 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.459
 will stop including registration cards 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.080
 in its games in physical format you have 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.060
 understood as of April 1, 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.800
 2015 all the nintendo games that 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.530
 they take out that they take out and when 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.050
 I will know I will not find this 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.360
 inside this will no longer be there did not exist 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.910
 they do not leave what they leave they leave it not anymore 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.769
 more nor one more from day 1 of 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.330
 April we will not find that little piece of paper 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.390
 in physical nintendo games 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.760
 from April 20 will be left 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.319
 to register in the club nintendo all 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.580
 the digital products that we 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.989
 let's get you know that when 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.450
 we bought a game in the exxon or 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.650
 We buy a console or whatever there 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.480
 times that simply digitally 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.920
 it automatically registers it does not 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.480
 you need to enter the code 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.310
 because they do not give you the new purchases 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.690
 physical you do not have code but you 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.420
 shopping in the eshop and automatically 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.519
 they give the points equally well well that 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.560
 will not happen from the 20th day of 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.709

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.240

 as a new member login 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.890

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.780
 stars will be unavailable 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.910

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.600

 the one that never again and so on 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.700
 Etcetera Etcetera doubts that create here 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.740
 you if you have a nintendo 3ds 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.540
 nintendo 3ds nintendo wii 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.120
 we will know that this console 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.910
 links to the club nintendo what the hell is going 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.260
 to go through with that you do not know what we're going 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.550
 to be able to spend the stars 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.960
 well tried promised that they will leave 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.790
 a lot of super nice things super 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.020
 happy that we will love everyone and 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.660
 that over these eight months 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.400
 next we will be able to perfectly 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:54.680
 I will have 12 or 13 games right now 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.840
 register more new 3ds plus 3ds console 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.090
 that goes with capturing then there 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.860
 There is a colt with points in addition to 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.080
 I already have 3500 points like that in the catalog 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.020
 stars that I will be me with that then 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.790
 let's hope they get something very very nice 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.650
 that makes us very happy to start 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.570
 and here begins my opinion and not that 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.220
 that seems to me because I do not 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.900
 it seems bad that is to say it seems to me 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.610
 It would seem wrong if they said this is the 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.650
 last month of the star catalog and you 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.900
 you would see people as completely crazy 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.479
 average normal to 2 we spent the points 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.940
 in buying shit to waste it but 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:29.690
 there are not 8 months left eight months of 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.870
 which four months will not come out anymore 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.130
 games with points is to say those games and 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.860
 the games you buy is here 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.120
 April will have points is fine and you will 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.770
 you will spend in the star catalog of 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.960
 that you want but those that buy 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.320
 from April to October or forgiveness 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.940
 until September because there they will not leave 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.680
 points is not going to have anything you do not have to 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.720
 eat your mother's head just 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.270
 I have 22 games are 500 dubious points 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.100
 no no you do not care because you do not care 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.650
 no points come so you sub-20 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.539
 brings to pairo if in the group system of 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.370
 nintendo games can be registered 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.840
 that we buy from then or the 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.850
 method that will lead well that will already be seen 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.350
 at the moment what comes out but good 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.870
 I think it's not so bad, so if 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.300
 It really is to give us something better and 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.580
 then they give us flipnote 3d 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.380
 What else do we want? I do not see everything wrong 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.840
 what changes that is better well yes that 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.060
 change to worse because I hope it is not 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.639
 there is time to spare 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.620
 I hope and I want you to take out cool things 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.900
 of what the points spent but 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.790
 Nor is the end of the world do not know there 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.950
 many people who say my mother this already 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.180
 it's the end from now on it started 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.919
 speculate 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.540
 the club lying will be paid 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.790
 better yes but will be paid monthly fee 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.860
 I know that of not seconds that until 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.690
 they do not present it or it can not be me until 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.790
 that the new nintendo club does not arrive and 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.560
 be a shit or do not be a shit not 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.200
 I will neither praise him nor criticize him 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.000
 you can simply tell us what there is 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.980
 nintendo club closes forever 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.930
 from September 30 from 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.150
 on April 1, the 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.350
 physical games the code that starting 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.210
 from April 20 all purchases 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.800
 that you do not register 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.110
 the story the story 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.030
 the game in your club account 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.560
 This is how easy it is to spend 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:10.280
 stars with heads in moderation 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.280
 because you only have how many months 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.389
 eight months and something to spend but 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.370
 well I think it's time to spare 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:19.100
 so you think you expect that 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.720
 you say ok do not convince me next month 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.180
 to see what's in the star catalog 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.130
 I'm not convinced next month to see what 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.440
 there is in the star catalog this 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:30.190
 it's brutal to take five thousand stars 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.290
 stay then and send me the gift home 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:36.620
 I do not know what's wrong with their pros 

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:38.360
 if I do not know connection has its cons if 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.460
 I do not know what a reason is because I do not know 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.510
 know nothing about the new club nintendo this 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.580
 hehe 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.380
 there are sad people I do not understand there 

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.850
 happy people I do not understand it until 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.100
 it is not known how will be the new no 

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.630
 we can criticize it or anything at all that 

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.160
 yes it seems good to me that they try 

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.710
 improve as long as it remains 

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.270
 free and be better there I leave many 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.500
