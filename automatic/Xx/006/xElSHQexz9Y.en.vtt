here<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.710> have<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> couple<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.340> clubs<00:00:17.750> which<00:00:18.750> one

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
here I have a couple of clubs which one

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.580 
here I have a couple of clubs which one
relates<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.490> my<00:00:21.150> clubface<00:00:21.750> alignment<00:00:22.380> which

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
relates to my clubface alignment which

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.769 
relates to my clubface alignment which
is<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> target<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.359> other<00:00:24.510> one

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
is going to the target and the other one

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.300 
is going to the target and the other one
is<00:00:24.990> my<00:00:25.470> feet<00:00:26.090> hips<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.359> shoulders<00:00:28.099> it's<00:00:29.099> these

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
is my feet hips and shoulders it's these

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.609 
is my feet hips and shoulders it's these
two<00:00:29.580> factors<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.840> going<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.080> give<00:00:31.260> me

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
two factors that are going to give me

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.280 
two factors that are going to give me
the<00:00:32.340> opportunity<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:33.030> work<00:00:33.450> across<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.110> ball

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the opportunity to work across the ball

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.160 
the opportunity to work across the ball
here<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> create<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.969> spin<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.630> will<00:00:36.989> give

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
here and create the spin that will give

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.810 
here and create the spin that will give
us<00:00:37.320> our<00:00:37.469> left-to-right<00:00:38.190> shot<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:41.370> important

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
us our left-to-right shot the important

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.639 
us our left-to-right shot the important
thing<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> relationship<00:00:42.329> between<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
thing is the relationship between the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.510 
thing is the relationship between the
clubface<00:00:44.280> our<00:00:44.940> target<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.750> our<00:00:46.620> feet<00:00:47.370> and

clubface our target and our feet and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.840 
clubface our target and our feet and
body<00:00:47.670> alignment<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.800> club<00:00:49.980> face<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.219> open<00:00:50.399> to

body alignment the club face is open to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.840 
body alignment the club face is open to
me<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.840> Square<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.379> target<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.129> it's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
me but is Square to the target and it's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.639 
me but is Square to the target and it's
these<00:00:54.030> two<00:00:54.300> factors<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.899> will<00:00:55.050> create<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
these two factors that will create the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.010 
these two factors that will create the
side<00:00:55.920> spin<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.910> need<00:00:57.180> through<00:00:57.629> impact

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
side spin that you need through impact

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.229 
side spin that you need through impact
to<00:00:58.469> give<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> shape<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.430> shot<00:00:59.670> that<00:01:00.149> you

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
to give you the shape of shot that you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.650 
to give you the shape of shot that you
require<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:02.760> interesting<00:01:03.210> thing<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.629> is

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
require the interesting thing here is

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
require the interesting thing here is
though<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.290> will<00:01:04.470> battle<00:01:04.710> yourself<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.400> many

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
though you will battle yourself and many

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.520 
though you will battle yourself and many
of<00:01:05.670> my<00:01:05.700> students<00:01:06.390> will<00:01:06.510> say<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.900> same<00:01:07.200> thing

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
of my students will say this same thing

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.840 
of my students will say this same thing
that<00:01:08.750> whilst<00:01:09.750> you're<00:01:10.020> setting<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.619> this

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
that whilst you're setting up to this

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.370 
that whilst you're setting up to this
there<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.030> tendency<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.110> fiddle

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
there is a tendency for you to fiddle

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.560 
there is a tendency for you to fiddle
around<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.920> get<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> clubface<00:01:14.670> back<00:01:15.119> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
around and get the clubface back to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.300 
around and get the clubface back to
where<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:15.869> familiar<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.470> familiar<00:01:17.100> would

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
where it's familiar and familiar would

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.730 
where it's familiar and familiar would
be<00:01:17.490> obviously<00:01:17.820> Square<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.630> try<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.560> avoid

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
be obviously Square to you try and avoid

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.440 
be obviously Square to you try and avoid
this<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.220> very<00:01:20.280> important<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.090> keep<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
this it's very important to keep the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.740 
this it's very important to keep the
face<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.900> our<00:01:21.930> target<00:01:23.270> once<00:01:24.270> we're<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.600> this

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
face on our target once we're in this

face on our target once we're in this
position<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.409> are<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:25.770> ready<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.759> actually

position we are then ready to actually
perform<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.750> shot<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.380> set<00:01:28.560> up<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.829> do

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
perform the shot that we set up to do

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.219

that commitment is everything you're
going<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.159> standing<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.729> slightly

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
going to be standing in a slightly

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.480 
going to be standing in a slightly
awkward<00:01:39.270> position<00:01:39.960> different<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.979> normal

aiming to the left and that's going to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.700 
aiming to the left and that's going to
feel<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> little<00:01:48.479> awkward<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:49.500> very

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
feel a little awkward it's very

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.370 
feel a little awkward it's very
important<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.130> mention<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.610> point<00:01:50.729> that

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
important to mention at this point that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.660 
important to mention at this point that
every<00:01:52.380> time<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.740> look<00:01:52.890> up<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.250> will<00:01:53.399> engage

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
every time you look up you will engage

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.850 
every time you look up you will engage
naturally<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.360> your<00:01:54.479> target<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.170> sometimes

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
naturally with your target and sometimes

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.469 
naturally with your target and sometimes
what<00:01:56.009> happens<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.610> my<00:01:56.729> students<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.299> lot<00:01:57.329> of

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
what happens with my students a lot of

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.209 
what happens with my students a lot of
the<00:01:57.600> time<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.590> they<00:01:58.740> take<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> club

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the time is that as they take the club

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.609 
the time is that as they take the club
back<00:01:59.340> naturally<00:02:00.210> they<00:02:00.750> work<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.200> club<00:02:01.439> on

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
back naturally they work the club on

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.530 
back naturally they work the club on
line<00:02:02.009> with<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.189> target<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.299> like<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
line with the target it's just like to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.700 
line with the target it's just like to
come<00:02:03.659> around<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:03.930> I'll<00:02:04.140> show<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.350> exactly

so<00:02:06.420> my<00:02:06.540> clubs<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:06.960> target<00:02:07.500> feet<00:02:07.799> hips<00:02:08.369> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
so my clubs on the target feet hips and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.889 
so my clubs on the target feet hips and
body<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.030> left

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
body to the left

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.740 
body to the left
as<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.920> look<00:02:11.099> up<00:02:11.280> I'm<00:02:11.489> seeing<00:02:11.790> my<00:02:11.879> target<00:02:12.450> it's

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
as I look up I'm seeing my target it's

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.170 
as I look up I'm seeing my target it's
very<00:02:13.079> easy<00:02:13.379> then<00:02:13.769> just<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> reroute<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.939> club

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
very easy then just to reroute the club

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.390 
very easy then just to reroute the club
and<00:02:15.360> take<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.959> on<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.170> normal<00:02:16.620> line<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
and take it on a normal line to the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.670 
and take it on a normal line to the
target<00:02:17.909> unfortunately<00:02:18.900> now<00:02:19.110> what<00:02:19.319> we<00:02:19.439> have<00:02:19.470> is

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
target unfortunately now what we have is

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.460 
target unfortunately now what we have is
we<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:19.950> direction<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:21.090> club<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.689> direction

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
we have direction of club and direction

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.039 
we have direction of club and direction
of<00:02:22.560> body<00:02:22.890> really<00:02:23.610> mixing<00:02:24.510> with<00:02:24.659> each<00:02:24.780> other

of body really mixing with each other

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.440 
of body really mixing with each other
and<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.709> effect<00:02:26.099> of<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.849> is<00:02:26.909> that<00:02:27.150> you're

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
and the effect of that is that you're

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.660
