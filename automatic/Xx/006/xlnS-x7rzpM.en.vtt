00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090
 welcome in the new year as discreetly late 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.090
 one would like to think 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.620
 but we have something really great 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:10.910
 spanned when we catch up today 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.539
 a series of deals with small car 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.129
 but not busy with normal 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.600
 small car for the city but with 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.539
 Small car rather for the highway 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.230
 He made for the winding country road 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.950
 we also start with a whole 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.300
 special at the of his great 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.699
 brother in quotation marks from the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.699
 vw group is directly off 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.660
 yes, unfortunately, will disappear 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.199
 and maybe you can already 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.030
 think what would be his big 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:52.360
 corporation brother from wolfsburg right 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.910
 according to the skoda fabia rs 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.100
 the good piece in steel gray metallic 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.100
 deposed with beautiful sweetheart 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.120
 7 gear dsg and a small 1.4 liter 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.680
 motor with a charge but not 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.500
 double turbocharging and my kids 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.770
 should be unrestrained more complex and scarce 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.229
 3000 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.990
 The chassis is a bit optimized 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.310
 and we have others sitting in them and that 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.310
 let's look now a try 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.479
 are now in the interior and how to 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.990
 I already see myself competent 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.000
 so help me brought in where 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.939
 support the complete series because 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.229
 such a small car is still clichÃ©d me 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:56.609
 rather sv with ever he could do better 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.899
 judge as our editor as 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:05.380
 first opinion to skoda fabia 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:08.079
 he is after paying something i would be one 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.299
 I have to say woman I am 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:14.200
 here primarily the fun factor but he is 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:16.299
 also very practical that I mean in the sense of it 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.590
 is somewhere a skoda and they are yes 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.260
 well-known simply clever 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.819
 that 's why we have in the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.069
 Trunk space many possibilities still 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.840
 the things to the situation on the film set too 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.849
 fix 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.829
 but here too everything is still in 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.170
 the skoda kept typical because I 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.060
 his find many auto seeking man 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.040
 nowadays it was the Skoda driver's 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.650
 is just up here in the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.900
 Center console is called there can be fun 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.060
 then have mfa start relatively quickly 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.799
 We also find the engine very much 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.060
 important an advertisement for the 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:51.910
 Oil temperature only at 90 degrees you should 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.889
 actually one may also just say that 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.569
 Spurs because before then for then 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.030
 rather to engine damage because of the engine 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.889
 not with the new eu six regulations 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.680
 he will be out of the program 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:06.669
 pulled back also quite good that if 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.799
 then you have gotten and the 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.419
 color of the octavia the actually mortara 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.690
 it was introduced to him completely 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.690
 Well 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:22.139
 I think it suits him and analogy 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.980
 to the interior 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:29.380
 the biggest change is very switching 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.970
 multifunction steering wheel gets going now 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.010
 s known switched area as well 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.599
 zigzag and is ideally an engine with 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.099
 this double recording is just 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.799
 therefore known as a suction motor 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.130
 easy average turns high and 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.620
 we have 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.790
 no no hole nothing pulls it 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.990
 Just up and we always have 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.060
 the responsiveness we want 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.860
 so I'm going for saas and it occurs 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.240
 card delay it right there and 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.340
 Immediately push on 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.940
 To the negative points incredible 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:05.110
 you best and say the door handles the 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.150
 to unlock the door was not like that 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.490
 so optimal for me everything is more 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.020
 as well as a bend shaped not now 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:16.120
 that typical mouth and I have that 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.040
 problem then that with my poor 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.930
 somehow so diagonally behind the first 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.270
 seat must or behind me then the 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.270
 door open so a little drawback for 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.280
 I noticed me directly 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.700
 but somehow I am interested in 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.700
 this dare 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.780
 had luck 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:43.200
 where would he make us one? 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.610
 series and drive now makes the beginning 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:51.150
 The engine has its problems 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:57.550
 one often reads recall oil problem 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:59.080
 dead oil the clean and clear we notice 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.780
 now in two weeks not so extreme 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.390
 but of course it is one of those 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.460
 It does not sound like a little bit 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.380
 the the super motor of mine 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.250
 he keeps life long where he is with me 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.140
 many workshop 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.790
 he makes fun makes a lot of fun the 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.500
 was disturbed honestly says a bit 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.120
 wise, someone needs 20 - bit 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.590
 being patient is worth it 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.820
 to be patient but then that will 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.230
 Of course, skip it 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.510
 Of course, that's obvious 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.490
 then first has to slow down what me 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.690
 rather disturbing is the steering translation because 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.770
 somehow it does not seem to me that 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.509
 rs read 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.370
 to be attacked because I have to 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.930
 still steer relatively much for 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.360
 a little bend and it bothers me then 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.940
 of course with the sporty car already 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:49.150
 considering him I want a curve 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.069
 Rheinfahrt and then almost 180 degrees 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.650
 turn and then I'm already in this 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:57.940
 position if something should come 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.990
 I attack again and I think so 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.729
 not quite optimal 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:08.099
 ok my view but I have my wife 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:11.289
 this is what one says the woman 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.150
 You can stay here more typically 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.289
 lift everything up somehow and that's nice 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.580
 Do not build together anymore 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:20.830
 Request race I feel find it 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:25.650
 just a smitten it is a skoda 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:28.060
 driver with a really nice extra 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.889
 you just have a lot of fun with that 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.159
 forest in my opinion the small ones 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.690
 saver machine handy you had that 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:38.469
 addressed with the trunk also the 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:42.610
 okay there and I think because cuts 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:44.729
 quite well off I also want such a good 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.810
 start in the series 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.659
 Soon it will be from the Czech Republic 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:53.279
 to france it will be when 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.279
 see the next episode
