of your hand and roll it like that so if
you<00:01:53.790> make<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.150> bread<00:01:54.420> roll<00:01:56.450> that's

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
you make a little bread roll that's

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.150 
you make a little bread roll that's
better<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.930> let<00:01:58.050> them<00:01:58.230> firm<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.920> fridge

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
better to let them firm up in the fridge

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.940 
better to let them firm up in the fridge
so<00:01:59.460> that<00:02:00.240> they're<00:02:00.540> much<00:02:00.720> easier<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.260> work<00:02:01.890> with

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
so that they're much easier to work with

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.060 
so that they're much easier to work with
and<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.430> cook<00:02:02.610> with<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> parchment<00:02:04.860> paper

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
and to cook with and the parchment paper

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.370 
and to cook with and the parchment paper
would<00:02:05.430> stop<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.760> from<00:02:05.880> sticking<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:06.990> tray

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
would stop the from sticking to the tray

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.669 
would stop the from sticking to the tray
so<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.490> do<00:02:08.580> six<00:02:08.850> of<00:02:09.000> these<00:02:09.290> try<00:02:10.290> and<00:02:10.440> having

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
so just do six of these try and having

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.770 
so just do six of these try and having
all<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.130> even<00:02:11.460> size<00:02:11.670> cut<00:02:12.360> then<00:02:12.480> they'll<00:02:12.630> cook

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
all the even size cut then they'll cook

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.230 
all the even size cut then they'll cook
more<00:02:13.020> easily<00:02:13.290> when<00:02:13.470> they<00:02:13.620> go<00:02:13.740> onto<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.070> pan<00:02:14.280> so

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
more easily when they go onto the pan so

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.320 
more easily when they go onto the pan so
I<00:02:15.270> have<00:02:15.540> already<00:02:15.720> some<00:02:16.250> which<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.430> placed<00:02:18.120> in

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
I have already some which I placed in

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.030 
I have already some which I placed in
the<00:02:18.420> fridge<00:02:18.660> covered<00:02:19.320> in<00:02:19.410> cling<00:02:19.590> film<00:02:19.740> and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
the fridge covered in cling film and

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.620 
the fridge covered in cling film and
let's<00:02:20.490> just<00:02:20.640> chill<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:20.850> about<00:02:21.030> an<00:02:21.210> hour<00:02:21.300> so

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
let's just chill for about an hour so

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.230 
let's just chill for about an hour so
they're<00:02:22.050> nice<00:02:22.230> chilled<00:02:22.950> nice<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.730> firm<00:02:23.940> -
