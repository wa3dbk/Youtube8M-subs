to<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.180> very<00:01:18.290> reasonable<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.710> be

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
to be very reasonable it's going to be

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.800 
to be very reasonable it's going to be
priced<00:01:20.759> right<00:01:21.090> there's<00:01:21.360> going<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> lot

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
priced right there's going to be a lot

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.999 
priced right there's going to be a lot
they've<00:01:22.020> been<00:01:22.170> talking<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.590> lot<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
they've been talking a lot about the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.170 
they've been talking a lot about the
price<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.400> how<00:01:23.460> they<00:01:23.610> think<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
price and how they think it's going to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.719 
price and how they think it's going to
be<00:01:24.270> really<00:01:24.390> reasonable<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.310> best<00:01:26.490> way<00:01:26.700> I

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
be really reasonable so the best way I

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520 
be really reasonable so the best way I
can<00:01:26.850> kind<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.450> about<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> compared

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
can kind of think about that is compared

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
can kind of think about that is compared
to<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.799> 3ds<00:01:29.250> which<00:01:29.549> courses<00:01:29.909> two<00:01:30.150> hundred

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
to the 3ds which courses two hundred

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.690 
to the 3ds which courses two hundred
fifty<00:01:30.509> dollars<00:01:31.020> now<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.130> come<00:01:32.369> close

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
fifty dollars now if they can come close

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.130 
fifty dollars now if they can come close
or<00:01:32.970> match<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.600> think<00:01:33.840> they<00:01:33.930> will<00:01:34.049> be

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
or match that I think they will be

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.230 
or match that I think they will be
absolutely<00:01:34.619> golden<00:01:35.100> i<00:01:35.189> think<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> NGP

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
absolutely golden i think that the NGP

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
absolutely golden i think that the NGP
is<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> lot<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:36.840> hardware<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> lot<00:01:37.920> more

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
is a lot more hardware it's a lot more

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.950 
is a lot more hardware it's a lot more
you<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:38.700> technical<00:01:39.210> power<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.780> all<00:01:39.840> that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
you know technical power and all that

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.080 
you know technical power and all that
kind<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.140> stuff<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.829> 3ds<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.850> they

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
kind of stuff then the 3ds so if they

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.700 
kind of stuff then the 3ds so if they
can<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.630> around<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.110> slaw<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.500> think

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
can get in around that slaw I think

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.080 
can get in around that slaw I think
they'll<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:43.979> no<00:01:44.220> problem<00:01:44.549> selling<00:01:44.729> millions

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
they'll have no problem selling millions

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.940 
they'll have no problem selling millions
and<00:01:45.329> millions<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.630> millions<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:46.079> them<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.740> as

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and millions and millions of them up as

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.830 
and millions and millions of them up as
far<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.759> Vita<00:01:48.240> goes<00:01:48.450> that's<00:01:48.600> about

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
far as that the Vita goes that's about

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.719 
far as that the Vita goes that's about
as<00:01:48.990> far<00:01:49.020> as<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.470> know<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:50.189> course<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.610> know

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
as far as we know of course we know

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.130 
as far as we know of course we know
pretty<00:01:50.970> much<00:01:51.030> everything<00:01:51.360> else<00:01:51.570> course<00:01:51.990> I'm

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
pretty much everything else course I'm

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
pretty much everything else course I'm
sure<00:01:52.350> they'll<00:01:52.560> show<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.920> some<00:01:53.159> software

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
sure they'll show like some software

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.609 
sure they'll show like some software
stuff<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.450> everything<00:01:54.659> but<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
stuff and everything but that's going to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.380 
stuff and everything but that's going to
be<00:01:55.710> about<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.100> far<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.549> goes<00:01:56.610> now

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
be about it as far as that goes now

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.429 
be about it as far as that goes now
probably<00:01:57.600> going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> little<00:01:58.140> bit<00:01:58.259> more

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
probably going to be a little bit more

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.660 
probably going to be a little bit more
important<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> next<00:01:59.310> generation

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
important is the next generation

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.550 
important is the next generation
Nintendo<00:02:00.450> Wii<00:02:00.659> which<00:02:00.930> I'm<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.469> be

Nintendo Wii which I'm just going to be
calling<00:02:01.740> way<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.219> I'm<00:02:02.430> almost<00:02:02.640> sure<00:02:02.939> they'll

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
calling way to I'm almost sure they'll

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.550 
calling way to I'm almost sure they'll
come<00:02:03.270> up<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.630> better<00:02:03.750> name<00:02:03.869> than<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.290> but

whatever so the next generation we has
been<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> long<00:02:07.829> time<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> coming<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.640> long

that phrase goes it's been expected for

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.150 
that phrase goes it's been expected for
several<00:02:12.870> years<00:02:13.080> now<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.500> there's<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:13.920> lot<00:02:14.100> of

what I think and what I hope to see so

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.680 
what I think and what I hope to see so
the<00:02:35.400> first<00:02:35.580> thing<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.240> that<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.480> should

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the first thing is is that it should

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.110 
the first thing is is that it should
have<00:02:36.870> some<00:02:37.050> really<00:02:37.290> interesting<00:02:37.560> controls<00:02:38.220> so

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
have some really interesting controls so

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.580 
have some really interesting controls so
as<00:02:39.330> opposed<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.930> know<00:02:39.960> using<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.530> you

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
as opposed to you know using the you

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.410 
as opposed to you know using the you
know<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.010> motion<00:02:41.700> controls<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.270> way

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
know the motion controls of the way

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.120 
know the motion controls of the way
which<00:02:42.690> was<00:02:42.870> really<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.260> number<00:02:43.830> one<00:02:43.980> reason

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
which was really the number one reason

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.860 
which was really the number one reason
why<00:02:44.370> people<00:02:44.550> bought<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.030> way<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.330> my<00:02:45.660> opinion

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
why people bought the way in my opinion

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.110 
why people bought the way in my opinion
anyway<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:47.040> actually<00:02:47.400> seems<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.820> will<00:02:47.940> have

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
anyway this actually seems to will have

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.090 
anyway this actually seems to will have
some<00:02:48.390> sort<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.050> touch<00:02:49.290> screen<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:49.800> as<00:02:49.860> far<00:02:50.040> as

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
some sort of touch screen now as far as

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.190 
some sort of touch screen now as far as
the<00:02:50.280> size<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:51.210> button<00:02:51.510> layout<00:02:51.750> all<00:02:51.900> can't

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
the size the button layout all can't

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.900 
the size the button layout all can't
stop<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.500> honestly<00:02:52.830> have<00:02:53.160> no<00:02:53.310> idea<00:02:53.340> we'll<00:02:53.730> have

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
stop I honestly have no idea we'll have

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.030 
stop I honestly have no idea we'll have
to<00:02:54.000> wait<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.150> see<00:02:54.330> but<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.960> do<00:02:55.410> expect<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.920> have

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
to wait and see but I do expect to have

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.680 
to wait and see but I do expect to have
some<00:02:56.280> kind<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.520> controller<00:02:56.940> with<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.210> screen

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
some kind of controller with a screen

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.390 
some kind of controller with a screen
with<00:02:57.990> some<00:02:58.290> physical<00:02:58.620> buttons<00:02:58.890> as<00:02:58.980> well<00:02:59.160> and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
with some physical buttons as well and

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.100 
with some physical buttons as well and
most<00:02:59.820> likely<00:03:00.000> with<00:03:00.270> some<00:03:00.420> motion<00:03:00.750> sensing

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
most likely with some motion sensing

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.290 
most likely with some motion sensing
perhaps<00:03:01.350> even<00:03:01.470> cameras<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.250> that's<00:03:03.090> really

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
perhaps even cameras so that's really

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.670 
perhaps even cameras so that's really
interesting<00:03:03.540> on<00:03:03.900> one<00:03:04.020> hand<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.290> think<00:03:04.530> that

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
interesting on one hand I think that

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.620 
interesting on one hand I think that
having<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:05.070> controller<00:03:05.460> that's<00:03:05.760> basically<00:03:06.090> you

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
having a controller that's basically you

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.030 
having a controller that's basically you
know<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.750> lot<00:03:06.930> like<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.290> NGP<00:03:07.680> it's<00:03:07.800> got<00:03:07.920> all

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
know a lot like the NGP it's got all

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.710 
know a lot like the NGP it's got all
kinds<00:03:08.070> of<00:03:08.490> you<00:03:08.640> know<00:03:08.730> fancy<00:03:09.030> touch<00:03:09.390> screens

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
kinds of you know fancy touch screens

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.020 
kinds of you know fancy touch screens
and<00:03:09.960> whatnot<00:03:10.290> on<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.250> other<00:03:11.400> hand<00:03:11.490> though<00:03:11.820> I'm

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
and whatnot on the other hand though I'm

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.030 
and whatnot on the other hand though I'm
absolutely<00:03:12.360> dreading<00:03:12.720> going<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.740> go<00:03:13.830> down<00:03:14.010> to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
absolutely dreading going to go down to

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.920 
absolutely dreading going to go down to
my<00:03:14.670> local<00:03:14.760> video<00:03:15.060> game<00:03:15.270> store<00:03:15.510> buy<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.720> new

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
my local video game store buy a new

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.570 
my local video game store buy a new
controller<00:03:16.350> it's<00:03:16.590> going<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.800> cost<00:03:16.920> like<00:03:17.160> you

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
controller it's going to cost like you

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.010 
controller it's going to cost like you
know<00:03:17.670> an<00:03:17.790> arm<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.180> leg<00:03:18.210> to<00:03:18.510> buy<00:03:18.630> us<00:03:18.840> but

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
know an arm and a leg to buy us but

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.000 
know an arm and a leg to buy us but
that's<00:03:19.170> kind<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.410> besides<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:19.860> point

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
that's kind of besides the point

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.320 
that's kind of besides the point
hopefully<00:03:20.250> they'll<00:03:20.520> include<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.940> couple<00:03:21.270> of

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
hopefully they'll include a couple of

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.760 
hopefully they'll include a couple of
them<00:03:21.450> in<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.630> package<00:03:21.990> but<00:03:22.170> who<00:03:22.320> knows<00:03:22.500> but

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
them in the package but who knows but

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.680 
them in the package but who knows but
anyway<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.760> control<00:03:24.090> looks<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.390> be<00:03:24.480> really

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
anyway the control looks to be really

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.540 
anyway the control looks to be really
impressive<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.320> as<00:03:25.770> far<00:03:25.920> as<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.130> console

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
impressive and as far as the console

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.980 
impressive and as far as the console
itself<00:03:26.670> goes<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.240> actually<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.540> should<00:03:27.690> be<00:03:27.810> no

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
itself goes is actually you should be no

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.650 
itself goes is actually you should be no
slouch<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:29.040> pretty<00:03:29.670> famously<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.330> wii<00:03:30.480> has

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
slouch so pretty famously the wii has

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.650 
slouch so pretty famously the wii has
been<00:03:30.810> very<00:03:31.260> very<00:03:32.210> another<00:03:33.210> word<00:03:33.360> i<00:03:33.480> guess

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
been very very another word i guess

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.930 
been very very another word i guess
capote<00:03:34.200> it's<00:03:34.380> been<00:03:34.590> very<00:03:34.800> very<00:03:34.920> slow<00:03:35.460> compared

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
capote it's been very very slow compared

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.750 
capote it's been very very slow compared
to<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.120> playstation<00:03:36.660> 3<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:36.960> the<00:03:37.380> xbox<00:03:38.250> 360

PlayStation might have it on the pc but
there's<00:03:55.350> no<00:03:55.440> way<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.830> game<00:03:56.100> which<00:03:56.400> is

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
there's no way that that game which is

there's no way that that game which is

for<00:05:23.860> the<00:05:24.009> past<00:05:24.159> couple<00:05:24.340> years<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.879> i<00:05:25.750> really

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
for the past couple years and i really

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.920 
for the past couple years and i really
hope<00:05:26.529> that<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.800> wii<00:05:26.979> too<00:05:27.250> i<00:05:27.639> I<00:05:28.000> don't<00:05:28.449> hope<00:05:28.750> I'm

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
hope that the wii too i I don't hope I'm

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.300 
hope that the wii too i I don't hope I'm
almost<00:05:29.199> sure<00:05:29.440> that<00:05:29.469> the<00:05:29.680> way<00:05:29.800> to<00:05:29.860> will<00:05:30.190> be<00:05:30.279> a

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
almost sure that the way to will be a

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.159 
almost sure that the way to will be a
lot<00:05:30.639> better<00:05:30.849> as<00:05:31.060> far<00:05:31.210> as<00:05:31.360> for<00:05:31.539> hardcore<00:05:31.750> gamers

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
lot better as far as for hardcore gamers

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.689 
lot better as far as for hardcore gamers
like<00:05:32.259> myself<00:05:32.469> but<00:05:33.009> I<00:05:33.039> will<00:05:33.279> definitely<00:05:33.430> have

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
like myself but I will definitely have

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.369 
like myself but I will definitely have
to<00:05:33.759> wait<00:05:33.879> and<00:05:33.969> say<00:05:34.089> about<00:05:34.240> that<00:05:34.419> do<00:05:35.259> I<00:05:35.319> think

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:35.379 
to wait and say about that do I think

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:37.140 
to wait and say about that do I think

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
that but again yet that would be a

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.200 
that but again yet that would be a
fantastic<00:05:51.610> idea<00:05:53.550> letting<00:05:54.550> the<00:05:54.729> way<00:05:54.879> too<00:05:54.939> will

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
fantastic idea letting the way too will

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.219 
fantastic idea letting the way too will
be<00:05:55.270> more<00:05:55.449> expensive<00:05:55.689> than<00:05:55.870> the<00:05:55.960> first

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
be more expensive than the first

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.829 
be more expensive than the first
duration<00:05:56.729> almost<00:05:57.729> definitely<00:05:58.150> consoles

00:05:58.829 --> 00:05:58.839 
duration almost definitely consoles

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
pretty much always every year rather

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
every generation you know if it's

hundred<00:06:02.650> dollars<00:06:02.949> well<00:06:03.129> the<00:06:03.189> next<00:06:03.279> one's

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
hundred dollars well the next one's

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.800 
hundred dollars well the next one's
going<00:06:03.580> to<00:06:03.639> be<00:06:03.729> two<00:06:03.909> hundred<00:06:03.969> dollars<00:06:04.300> or<00:06:04.479> etc

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
going to be two hundred dollars or etc

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.269 
going to be two hundred dollars or etc
etc<00:06:04.870> so<00:06:05.139> yeah<00:06:05.379> especially<00:06:05.650> with<00:06:06.039> some

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:06.279 
etc so yeah especially with some

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.950 
etc so yeah especially with some
touchscreen<00:06:06.759> controllers<00:06:07.389> and<00:06:07.689> whatnot

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
touchscreen controllers and whatnot

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.600 
touchscreen controllers and whatnot
although<00:06:08.650> expect<00:06:09.039> it<00:06:09.159> would<00:06:09.250> be<00:06:09.430> more

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
although expect it would be more

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.089 
although expect it would be more
expensive<00:06:09.849> but<00:06:10.300> I<00:06:10.689> don't<00:06:11.469> see<00:06:11.620> anything<00:06:11.860> from

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
expensive but I don't see anything from

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.619 
expensive but I don't see anything from
what<00:06:12.310> I've<00:06:12.400> seen<00:06:12.430> besides<00:06:13.029> the<00:06:13.150> controllers

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:13.629 
what I've seen besides the controllers

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:14.969 
what I've seen besides the controllers
it<00:06:13.810> should<00:06:13.990> be<00:06:14.080> like<00:06:14.229> outrageously<00:06:14.860> expensive

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
it should be like outrageously expensive

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.920 
it should be like outrageously expensive
like<00:06:15.610> you<00:06:15.849> know<00:06:15.909> the<00:06:16.060> PlayStation<00:06:16.569> 3<00:06:16.750> was

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
like you know the PlayStation 3 was

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.450 
like you know the PlayStation 3 was
super<00:06:17.289> super<00:06:17.439> expensive<00:06:17.800> went<00:06:18.099> first<00:06:18.279> came

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
super super expensive went first came

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.610 
super super expensive went first came
out<00:06:18.580> I<00:06:18.819> don't<00:06:19.479> see<00:06:19.629> anything<00:06:19.870> any<00:06:20.319> reason<00:06:20.469> why

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
out I don't see anything any reason why

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.619 
out I don't see anything any reason why
would<00:06:20.770> be<00:06:20.860> that<00:06:21.129> expensive<00:06:21.400> I<00:06:21.879> would

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:22.629 
would be that expensive I would

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:24.450 
would be that expensive I would
definitely<00:06:22.719> expect<00:06:23.139> you<00:06:23.289> to<00:06:23.409> be<00:06:23.529> probably<00:06:24.370> a

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
definitely expect you to be probably a

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.579 
definitely expect you to be probably a
good<00:06:24.759> bit<00:06:24.939> more<00:06:25.120> than<00:06:25.419> the<00:06:25.629> weed<00:06:25.960> was<00:06:26.379> with

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:26.589 
good bit more than the weed was with

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:28.890 
good bit more than the weed was with
brand<00:06:26.919> new<00:06:27.039> but<00:06:27.430> I<00:06:27.669> don't<00:06:28.330> think<00:06:28.539> it'll<00:06:28.719> be

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
brand new but I don't think it'll be

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.329 
brand new but I don't think it'll be
we'll<00:06:29.169> see<00:06:29.319> like<00:06:29.560> a<00:06:29.589> eight<00:06:29.949> hundred<00:06:30.219> dollar

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:30.339 
we'll see like a eight hundred dollar

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.820 
we'll see like a eight hundred dollar
way<00:06:30.610> to<00:06:30.849> any<00:06:31.000> time<00:06:31.209> soon<00:06:31.479> are<00:06:32.409> they<00:06:32.620> still

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
way to any time soon are they still

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.350 
way to any time soon are they still
aiming<00:06:33.009> the<00:06:33.190> way<00:06:33.339> to<00:06:33.399> for<00:06:33.789> families<00:06:34.149> instead

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
aiming the way to for families instead

you<00:06:35.780> know<00:06:35.870> that's<00:06:36.080> a<00:06:36.230> good<00:06:36.590> question<00:06:36.740> um

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
you know that's a good question um

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.670 
you know that's a good question um
personally<00:06:38.570> I<00:06:38.600> think<00:06:38.780> they<00:06:39.230> really<00:06:39.440> need<00:06:39.620> to

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
personally I think they really need to

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.350 
personally I think they really need to
strike<00:06:39.950> a<00:06:40.040> good<00:06:40.070> balance<00:06:40.220> now<00:06:40.790> you<00:06:41.270> know

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
strike a good balance now you know

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.730 
strike a good balance now you know
before<00:06:41.600> the<00:06:41.840> Gamecube<00:06:42.260> it<00:06:42.380> was<00:06:42.470> pretty<00:06:42.590> much

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
before the Gamecube it was pretty much

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.140 
before the Gamecube it was pretty much
well<00:06:43.040> it<00:06:43.220> was<00:06:43.340> kind<00:06:43.550> of<00:06:43.610> in<00:06:43.730> the<00:06:43.790> middle<00:06:43.940> that

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
well it was kind of in the middle that

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.280 
well it was kind of in the middle that
is<00:06:44.210> kind<00:06:44.570> of<00:06:44.600> a<00:06:44.660> little<00:06:44.720> bit<00:06:44.930> more<00:06:45.050> towards

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
is kind of a little bit more towards

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.140 
is kind of a little bit more towards
gamers<00:06:45.740> but<00:06:45.890> with<00:06:46.220> the<00:06:46.340> way<00:06:46.490> they<00:06:46.700> basically
