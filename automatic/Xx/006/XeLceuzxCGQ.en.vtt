00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
showed us if you pull while you're

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.089 
showed us if you pull while you're
rotating<00:00:14.730> counterclockwise<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:16.740> emblem

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:17.099 
rotating counterclockwise the emblem

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.570 
rotating counterclockwise the emblem
would<00:00:17.699> just<00:00:17.910> come<00:00:18.060> out<00:00:18.210> or<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.509> don't<00:00:18.570> know<00:00:18.779> push

would just come out or I don't know push

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.040 
would just come out or I don't know push
either<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.849> that<00:00:21.029> worked<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.630> try<00:00:22.619> 10<00:00:22.830> times<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050

either of that worked I try 10 times and
I<00:00:25.050> figured<00:00:25.980> maybe<00:00:26.249> this<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.880> not<00:00:27.029> possible

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330
