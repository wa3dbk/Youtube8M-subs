00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.699
 In this quicktipp video we talk about 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.859
 head coaching resp 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.510
 new battlefield 4 mechanics and what 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.430
 you can do it effectively 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.260
 as you have already noticed 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.320
 pull infantrymen when they hit 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.750
 We'll turn our heads off 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.460
 this example sees this now first 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.219
 but not very dramatic 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.530
 quite a not to be underestimated 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.239
 relevance if the infantryman is a good one 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.370
 cover it uses the so-called 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.590
 The connection here allows 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.420
 is that the balls are not actually 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.070
 the weapons are fired from the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.539
 you here completely by this cover 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.100
 but are always hidden from the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.320
 eyes are closed 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.699
 Let's look at what happens when 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.350
 the same infantryman here this one 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.930
 Cover used in the head hit 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.730
 then he pulls his head away and is 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.409
 for a split second, so to speak 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.890
 invulnerable because you can not meet him 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.619
 can 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.720
 at medium distances you would have to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.150
 always land three hedge in a row 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.869
 one puts the usual damage model of the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.840
 sv 3 1 ahead for example it 23 the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.180
 on short distance 25 harms with 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.520
 damage waste at distances over 10 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.580
 meter so if it has three headshots 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.229
 you have to land here two hits 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.780
 you get here usually rows of 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.250
 but shooting is mostly 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.500
 weggeduckt and goes into the void 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.820
 also with very high firing rate weapons 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.200
 you have some difficulties here 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.640
 we show that here by the example of 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.290
 formerly 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.810
 our tip in this regard is quite 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.640
 just because you have the third headshot in 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.770
 which usually does not land will be worth it 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.780
 to try the skaters 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.520
 this has a different model of damage than 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.369
 most other truce namely 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.510
 34 damage at a short distance and 25 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.330
 damage minimal 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.250
 Here you have to land only two hits and 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.700
 thus always gets a secured kill 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.020
 on the hatcher you see in the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.150
 background still some examples the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.979
 show how relatively easy it is 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.030
 is with the kh in this regard 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.830
 to be succesfull 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.350
 that should be the reason 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.750
 why this kh is now common in 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.690
 the ms and general competitive of 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.700
 five sees another possibility 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.340
 it is a matter of course 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.950
 A pump action shotgun with ammo 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.709
 that works great too 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.300
 Well, as always we reach 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.530
 Thank you for turning it on when 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.850
 we liked it then we link 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.550
 here also to our last quicktipp 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.959
 video as well as a disassembly of 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.959
 Mexico is well worth seeing
