00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.910
 from vania for all the guys here and 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.190
 mister black and talks to you today 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.049
 finally let's see how to build e 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.510
 find all the pieces of the calendar 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.550
 just what you're wondering 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.680
 these days I wanted first of all 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.019
 make a small introduction to do the 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.269
 air fee four are required 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.210
 pieces not three like all and all 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.380
 other small buildings we do 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.880
 within the game 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.920
 we get on the bus and we leave 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.600
 towards the second stop 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.990
 be careful though because there is something to take 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.600
 the first piece of the cannon as soon as 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.960
 enter a gallery and see the 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.870
 truck parked on the right thing 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.910
 go down and retrieve the 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.160
 first piece you can't miss it 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.230
 if you don't see it look good on the side 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.020
 right of the gallery because you can 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.280
 find it on the ground between the machines 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.230
 you look very well they are found 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.320
 attentions 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:11.840
 ok done this we leave and if 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:13.910
 we go back on the bus arrived at 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.550
 second stop actually not much 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.130
 to do in the sense that we do not find gods 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.910
 pieces and useful for the construction of 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.280
 Cannon 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.620
 then we continue to the third stop 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.860
 even here there will be nothing to from 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.920
 take for the cannon and take advantage 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.330
 for the fourth stop attention because 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.630
 here we will have to take ours 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.540
 second piece is right between the third the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.220
 fourth stop we should get off 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.550
 then look very carefully 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.860
 while traveling out of the window 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.110
 you will notice a wheat field go down not 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.450
 as soon as you see destroyed cars 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.450
 or a hole inside the grain 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:01.159
 as you get off, notice small flames 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.840
 on the ground with craters and impossibility 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.500
 of the lamppost entered inside the 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.989
 path then continue always rituals and 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.950
 as soon as you see on your right a 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.290
 little gash go in it for 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.409
 get up to the old map 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.980
 of world tour but let's see a little bit 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:24.500
 how and where to enter the wheat field 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.159
 then it is clear from this recovery 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.409
 very well which way to follow 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.379
 and we rebuilt it just for 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:36.049
 to show you the right path because 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.420
 many have lost you see this 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.250
 small path here is this here if 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.680
 run too much you don't see it you know 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.269
 Also on the monster it is made 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.379
 difficulty seeing it anyway you a 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.859
 stabbing well once you get here is 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.900
 the only thing you need to do is search 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.900
 the other piece can be found 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.310
 above this this iron bin 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.280
 or and above the staircase and the piece 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.620
 the handle is to be searched 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.439
 but be careful because you can find 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.909
 also here on the right and the same piece 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:16.879
 above that thing shelf and above the 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:20.299
 tilted steel cabinet you can 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:24.440
 finding the radio will help you later 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:28.280
 the good egg said this we can 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.400
 also to get out of munster a totem and the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.159
 old map of gi world at war il 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.769
 old call of duty and can get out 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:40.699
 both on the right and on the left of the grain 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.979
 I remind you that it will be fundamental and first 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:46.099
 to do all of them to move into these 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:49.940
 dark areas and in the grain area and will be 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:53.389
 fundamental to make one or more zombies 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.690
 cripples or means this for example has 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:59.960
 fact that if you fall into these dark areas 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.240
 and we will be attacked by 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.210
 we say our partner will be 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:10.210
 attacked by the monster that then 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:13.070
 it will hardly be able to revive itself and 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.350
 so having said that help yourself by following 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.739
 the fiery crack you see on the 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:22.610
 left to get to the map at 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.940
 next stop then we enter the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.500
 laboratory and activate the current one 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.890
 once activated current we can find 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.230
 the piece in this area 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.390
 well it is possible to open the gate 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:40.420
 as I said with activation a 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:43.000
 current or with the turbine 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.250
 well arrived in this area we can 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.090
 find our piece in this case 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.080
 the vault and where I'm taking it in 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.930
 this moment 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.260
 or we can find it here on the right in 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.200
 low here or even above these 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.820
 these steel classes or even here to 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.010
 land 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.370
 once we find the cable we start again 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:09.010
 with our bus 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.810
 be careful because now between one 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.730
 taranta form we must trichet andrÃ¨ 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.600
 just as before will be very important 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:20.650
 also at this point go down at least in 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.260
 two so let yourself be accompanied by dal 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.850
 your teammate and look 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.630
 trichet in the impossibility of this 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:32.940
 sample and you see it looks very good in the 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:35.680
 video above you can see the climb 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.950
 which will then bring the next stop 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:43.240
 you go in the opposite direction and see 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:45.640
 just a small climb on 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.410
 then right and flames 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.890
 approach these entrances in this one 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:53.520
 home this will be the hidden house that 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.740
 just reasons therefore you were looking for 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.930
 look inside the fireplace and the other 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.460
 piece the bar in this case of barometer 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.000
 been found 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:08.350
 or always with in bed in the bed 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.050
 broken without a class and on the right 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:15.790
 domes on the left between the shelves 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:19.570
 in short, therefore we succeed from the room by 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:23.010
 this house is here will be crucial 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:27.840
 come out of this side always going by 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:30.870
 always towards the light of the cash register e 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.880
 be sure that you will arrive anyway 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:37.390
 in the next stop once 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.080
 reached the next stop we must 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.240
 to open 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.949
 one of these doors here then 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:47.789
 recapping we have the cable the 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:51.090
 barometer and the handle and finally the tube 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:56.050
 now all four together we must 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:59.219
 enter inside the building 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:02.590
 and mount the pieces on the work table 

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:06.669
 having done this we will have completed the 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:10.050
 air cannon and which then will serve for 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:12.969
 complete and all the witches anyway 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.199
 don't worry if the air fee is 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:17.530
 It does not last long 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:20.229
 this is simply because one 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:25.180
 tool to perform e 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:28.270
 to complete it would therefore not also 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.690
 if you use how much the zombies will last 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:35.020
 really very little a little further away 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:38.620
 don't get angry because like I said e 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.319
 it only serves ex plaster however it is 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.539
 if you asked, we did it 

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:46.539
 see a step by step 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:49.900
 if you have any problems do not hesitate 

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:52.379
 write in the comments those who do not yet 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.379
 had done 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.520
 recommend channel description for 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.560
 to be able to see the next witches that 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.960
 we will load say we will load 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:05.289
 from being complete and step by step e 

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.389
 what to say 

00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:09.669
 so much desire for everyone and the 

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:12.180
 next here mixed black a greeting from 

00:08:09.669 --> 00:08:12.180
 all the staff
