I want the secondaries to go back to the
way<00:02:40.959> they<00:02:40.989> were<00:02:41.170> on<00:02:41.260> black<00:02:41.590> ops<00:02:41.799> 1<00:02:42.159> I'd<00:02:43.030> like<00:02:43.239> to

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
way they were on black ops 1 I'd like to

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.849 
way they were on black ops 1 I'd like to
see<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.599> snipers<00:02:44.109> go<00:02:44.290> back<00:02:44.469> to<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.709> way<00:02:44.829> they

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
were on black ops 1 also but I guess

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.929 
were on black ops 1 also but I guess
going<00:02:47.530> backwards<00:02:48.129> isn't<00:02:48.400> really<00:02:48.760> being

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
going backwards isn't really being

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.289 
going backwards isn't really being
innovative<00:02:49.540> now<00:02:49.689> is<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:50.109> so<00:02:50.709> what<00:02:50.980> would<00:02:51.189> be

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
innovative now is it so what would be

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.129 
innovative now is it so what would be
innovative<00:02:52.299> for<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.540> next<00:02:52.780> Call<00:02:52.959> of<00:02:52.989> Duty

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
innovative for the next Call of Duty

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.629 
innovative for the next Call of Duty
game<00:02:53.500> well<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.709> don't<00:02:53.950> think<00:02:54.099> this<00:02:54.250> next<00:02:54.430> Call

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
game well I don't think this next Call

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.190 
game well I don't think this next Call
of<00:02:54.669> Duty<00:02:54.790> game<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.329> gonna<00:02:55.450> use<00:02:55.659> the<00:02:55.810> pic<00:02:56.019> 10

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.199 
of Duty game is gonna use the pic 10
system<00:02:56.470> because<00:02:57.370> that's<00:02:57.489> kind<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.849> like<00:02:57.969> Trey

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209

arks<00:02:58.480> thing<00:02:58.689> now<00:02:58.840> I<00:02:58.870> guess<00:02:59.609> so<00:03:00.639> I<00:03:01.079> mean<00:03:02.079> Pro

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319
