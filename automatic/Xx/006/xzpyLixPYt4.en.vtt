00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 a jumping kangaroo robot for the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.880
 research that is aim I am hartz 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.099
 iv and those are the basket now there is 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.170
 the world's first kangaroo robot 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.509
 was festo by the swedish company 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.400
 built and in cooperation with the uni 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.039
 developed in ulm the kangaroo is a 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.980
 meter forty tall and can be 80 cm wide 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.900
 and jump 40 cm high it is packed 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.849
 with every set of sensors that exactly 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.560
 the airspeed only calculate like that 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.510
 The robot manages to land when landing 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.309
 to find the right position and 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.870
 not to fall over is covered the whole 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.850
 The technique of white represents the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.380
 kangaroos give a real look though 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.120
 The robot is not only super cute 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.770
 to look at it serves above all the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.300
 research the scientists have it 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.950
 namely the energy of one 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.140
 jump store and for the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.170
 To use the next one just do the same 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.070
 Also kangaroos they move especially 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.230
 energy efficient and brown for walking 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.820
 almost as much energy for your own 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.110
 big quick jumps like that in the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.640
 detail worked 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.800
 scientist examines and that 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.809
 principle now rebuilt for the robots 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.699
 the process phenomena from nature 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 to transfer to technology is called 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.570
 bio scientists assume that 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.220
 nature through evolution many 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.990
 Processes and structures already optimized 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.909
 the human has the existing one 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.619
 Solutions then, so to speak, look and 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.360
 Technically implement a special 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.950
 well-known bionic principle is to 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.840
 For example, the velcro on 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.040
 the barbs of ribs oriented 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.720
 in the meantime, dirt is getting dirty 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.500
 repellent colors and surfaces 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.420
 They made that 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.369
 Self-cleaning effect of the lotus leaves 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.900
 imitate kangaroos can with little 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.820
 Energy expenditure so far and fast 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.439
 jump because they are extremely elastic 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.000
 Muscle bands have the energy 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.290
 save and at the next jump 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.479
 again give up especially the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.610
 Achilles tendon is extra at kangaroos 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.350
 pronounced and powerful this is seen 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.030
 By the way, also in humans the thickest 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.740
 and strongest in the body the explorers 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.659
 have the little robot kangaroo 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.610
 elastic rubbers installed the exact 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.009
 take over this function and the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.110
 caching energy can be fifth 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.790
 make the kangaroo one by one 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.560
 There is one in his bag 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.119
 high pressure bottle the electric 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.070
 energy for controlling the processes 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.530
 comes from a battery is controlled 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.420
 the kangaroo per gestures the kangaroo no 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.310
 be waved and then hops up 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.350
 the person to carry the researchers 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.310
 an electronic bracelet it sets the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.140
 muscle movements in commands 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.940
 and ours wears it via bluetooth 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.860
 kangaroo but what exactly did that become 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.390
 kangaroo actually develops what you want 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.250
 the researchers do it with them 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.989
 above all, therefore, the principles of the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.280
 nature to explore someday 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.750
 Once in the process 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.520
 industry can improve for that 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.870
 kangaroo has become the firm festo 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.090
 decided to start marketing 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.890
 The kangaroo robot provides for measuring 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.480
 especially much attention as well 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.489
 has the development of animal robots 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.959
 at festo, so to speak, already tradition 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.760
 The company has its own 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.130
 Development Department the bionic 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.180
 learning network that is just there 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.180
 replicating animals 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.930
 while working hard with many unis 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.310
 research facilities and startup 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.350
 they already have something in common 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.819
 Artificial penguins jellyfish smelt 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.590
 dragonflies and an elephant's trunk 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.480
 other companies are also developing 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.519
 to deal with the replica of animals the 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.140
 For example, company mat robotics has one 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.819
 electronic snake develops it 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.040
 can be in small format in medicine 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.599
 Be used to patients from the inside 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.280
 with a camera in the 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.780
 she is used for large format 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.380
 survivors of earthquakes in 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.569
 you have ideas to look for fields of rubble 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.220
 what one can use the kangaroo for and 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.750
 you find it in principle good or 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.400
 bad if more and more robot in 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.200
 to be used in our everyday life 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.760
 your opinion in the comments here 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.650
 you come to two more videos from 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.660
 You can subscribe to us below me 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.220
 I come to this text caliber our 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.510
 social medias and our channels 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.370
 Of course we will link you in the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.560
 infobox West that the what is going on 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.560
 shorts and we are missing out exactly
