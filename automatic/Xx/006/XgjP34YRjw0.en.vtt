00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
opened over a thousand packs so i'll be

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.830

madden<00:02:49.530> 16<00:02:49.739> ultimate<00:02:50.280> team<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.670> it'll

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
madden 16 ultimate team and it'll

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.240 
madden 16 ultimate team and it'll
actually<00:02:51.540> give<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.019> rewards<00:02:52.200> based<00:02:52.739> on<00:02:53.069> your

actually give you rewards based on your

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.949 
actually give you rewards based on your
tier<00:02:53.549> so<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.090> have<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.269> open<00:02:54.360> up<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.569> thousand

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
tier so you have to open up a thousand

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.440 
tier so you have to open up a thousand
packs<00:02:55.140> for<00:02:55.319> legendary<00:02:55.760> 250<00:02:56.760> packs<00:02:56.970> for<00:02:57.330> all

pro and 50 packs for the pro level i

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.520

think this will actually carry over to

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.410 
think this will actually carry over to

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.409 
previous game really is irrelevant and I
at<00:05:49.710> some<00:05:49.979> part<00:05:50.190> I<00:05:50.280> really<00:05:50.610> don't<00:05:50.789> like<00:05:51.000> now<00:05:51.240> are

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
at some part I really don't like now are

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:52.760 
at some part I really don't like now are
these<00:05:51.539> loyal<00:05:51.840> to<00:05:51.990> your<00:05:52.050> rewards<00:05:52.469> going<00:05:52.620> to<00:05:52.680> be

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
these loyal to your rewards going to be

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.760 
these loyal to your rewards going to be
amazing<00:05:53.039> I<00:05:53.490> don't<00:05:54.330> know<00:05:54.479> do<00:05:55.289> I<00:05:55.320> think<00:05:55.650> they're

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
amazing I don't know do I think they're

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.810 
amazing I don't know do I think they're
gonna<00:05:55.830> be<00:05:56.039> amazing<00:05:57.680> mm<00:05:58.680> probably<00:05:59.130> not<00:05:59.310> I<00:05:59.610> don't

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
gonna be amazing mm probably not I don't

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.130 
gonna be amazing mm probably not I don't
think<00:06:00.090> these<00:06:00.240> rewards<00:06:00.450> are<00:06:00.690> going<00:06:00.810> to<00:06:00.870> be<00:06:00.960> good

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
think these rewards are going to be good

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.810 
think these rewards are going to be good
at<00:06:01.260> all<00:06:01.380> you're<00:06:01.860> probably<00:06:02.010> gonna<00:06:02.190> get<00:06:02.310> up<00:06:02.460> like

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
at all you're probably gonna get up like

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.230 
at all you're probably gonna get up like
a<00:06:02.849> contract<00:06:03.479> pack<00:06:04.320> maybe<00:06:05.039> gonna<00:06:05.250> get<00:06:05.430> like<00:06:05.520> 250

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
a contract pack maybe gonna get like 250

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.640 
a contract pack maybe gonna get like 250
contracts<00:06:06.780> you're<00:06:06.960> probably<00:06:07.140> gonna<00:06:07.320> get<00:06:07.469> some

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
contracts you're probably gonna get some

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.649 
contracts you're probably gonna get some
rookies<00:06:08.039> when<00:06:08.640> it<00:06:08.729> says<00:06:08.880> player<00:06:09.120> items<00:06:09.570> I

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
rookies when it says player items I

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:10.909 
rookies when it says player items I
think<00:06:09.810> we're<00:06:09.900> gonna<00:06:09.990> get<00:06:10.080> like<00:06:10.169> 80<00:06:10.440> over<00:06:10.800> all

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
probably won't even matter like overall

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.959 
probably won't even matter like overall
booster<00:06:19.440> plug<00:06:19.620> it<00:06:19.740> like<00:06:19.860> a<00:06:19.919> plus<00:06:20.190> 32<00:06:20.700> overall
