00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.290
 solo alone and you have them 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.549

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.249
 to dwell on the options I'm going to 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.769
 to go I play solo so here I have 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:15.469
 already created two giant worlds created a 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.829
 other for you here you go so 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:20.419

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.919
 but here you have two modes 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.070
 of play so either survival flies so where 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.630

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.320

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.419
 map and you have you have nothing in 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.570
 your inventory you must search 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.830
 resources and from its resources 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.729
