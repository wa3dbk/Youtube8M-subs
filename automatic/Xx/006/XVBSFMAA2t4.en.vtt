chimera at this point will be very

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.330 
chimera at this point will be very
pivotal<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.620> it's<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.800> very<00:02:28.980> small

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
pivotal to this and it's a very small

pivotal to this and it's a very small
seed<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.790> like<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.030> know<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.210> starts<00:02:30.420> off<00:02:30.540> with

further than okay you know these two

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.970 
further than okay you know these two

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
so I got a little chuckle out of that

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.410 
so I got a little chuckle out of that
for<00:02:49.680> some<00:02:49.860> reason<00:02:50.130> but<00:02:50.300> there's<00:02:51.300> definitely

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
for some reason but there's definitely

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.060 
for some reason but there's definitely
something<00:02:51.870> very<00:02:52.170> interesting<00:02:52.410> about<00:02:52.710> that<00:02:53.040> I

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
something very interesting about that I

something very interesting about that I
like<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.790> little<00:02:54.210> too<00:02:54.360> seed<00:02:54.600> like<00:02:54.810> that

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
like that a little too seed like that

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.840 
like that a little too seed like that
that<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.500> thought<00:02:55.740> would<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:55.980> never<00:02:56.640> go

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
that I thought would have never go

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
that I thought would have never go
anywhere<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.120> thought<00:02:57.270> it<00:02:57.330> was<00:02:57.420> gonna<00:02:57.600> be<00:02:57.750> like

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
anywhere I thought it was gonna be like

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.200 
anywhere I thought it was gonna be like
the<00:02:58.020> other<00:02:58.170> kids<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.590> was<00:02:59.460> gonna<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.120> know

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
the other kids I was gonna you know

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.060 
the other kids I was gonna you know
ultimately<00:03:00.390> keep<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.080> going<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.680> there's

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
ultimately keep on going so there's

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.320 
ultimately keep on going so there's
something<00:03:02.220> interesting<00:03:02.490> with<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:02.880> as<00:03:03.120> well

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
something interesting with that as well

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.770 
something interesting with that as well
episode<00:03:04.230> pretty<00:03:04.890> much<00:03:05.070> set<00:03:05.430> up<00:03:05.460> not<00:03:06.390> too<00:03:06.570> much

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
a very dangerous thing and they're like

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.580 
a very dangerous thing and they're like
no<00:03:18.060> no<00:03:18.090> we're<00:03:18.660> gonna<00:03:18.750> go<00:03:18.930> everybody<00:03:19.440> we're

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
no no we're gonna go everybody we're

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.580 
no no we're gonna go everybody we're
going<00:03:19.860> so<00:03:20.430> it's<00:03:21.390> really<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.810> lot<00:03:21.990> of<00:03:22.260> buildup

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
going so it's really a lot of buildup

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.470 
going so it's really a lot of buildup
with<00:03:22.770> this<00:03:22.920> one<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:23.430> building<00:03:24.180> up<00:03:24.300> the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
with this one and just building up the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.600 
with this one and just building up the
Queen<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.170> ultimately<00:03:25.980> seeing<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.370> like

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
Queen and ultimately seeing that like

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.640 
Queen and ultimately seeing that like
the<00:03:27.270> thing<00:03:27.480> about<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.750> ants<00:03:28.020> -<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.380> makes<00:03:28.530> it

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
the thing about the ants - that makes it

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.530 
the thing about the ants - that makes it
even<00:03:28.830> more<00:03:28.980> creepier<00:03:29.550> for<00:03:29.760> me<00:03:29.880> personally<00:03:30.060> is

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
even more creepier for me personally is

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.290 
even more creepier for me personally is
that<00:03:30.840> like<00:03:31.140> they<00:03:31.290> they're<00:03:31.890> curious<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.210> they

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
that like they they're curious and they

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.210 
that like they they're curious and they
wanna<00:03:33.540> they<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.470> seemed<00:03:34.710> as<00:03:34.830> though<00:03:34.890> it's<00:03:35.100> like

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
wanna they it seemed as though it's like

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.160 
wanna they it seemed as though it's like
evolution<00:03:35.850> they<00:03:35.970> want<00:03:36.210> to<00:03:36.330> now<00:03:36.630> have<00:03:36.660> names

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
evolution they want to now have names

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.600 
evolution they want to now have names
and<00:03:37.500> they<00:03:37.590> asked<00:03:37.860> me<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.040> Queen<00:03:38.220> can<00:03:38.400> we<00:03:38.490> have

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
and they asked me the Queen can we have

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.340 
and they asked me the Queen can we have
names<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.540> Queen<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.840> like<00:03:39.930> why<00:03:40.050> do<00:03:40.110> I

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.960 
names and the Queen is like why do I
want<00:03:40.650> these<00:03:40.830> you<00:03:41.130> know<00:03:41.220> codes<00:03:41.490> or<00:03:41.730> whatever

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
want these you know codes or whatever

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.460

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
and it's just really like the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.230 
and it's just really like the
intelligence<00:03:44.070> aspect<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.640> these<00:03:44.820> ants<00:03:45.150> is

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
intelligence aspect to these ants is

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.150 
intelligence aspect to these ants is
what<00:03:45.600> make<00:03:45.750> any<00:03:45.960> bit<00:03:46.110> more<00:03:46.290> creepier<00:03:46.650> like<00:03:46.800> how

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
what make any bit more creepier like how

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.100 
what make any bit more creepier like how
far<00:03:47.430> will<00:03:47.610> their<00:03:47.760> intelligence<00:03:48.240> go<00:03:48.420> how<00:03:48.810> far

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
far will their intelligence go how far

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.410 
far will their intelligence go how far
will<00:03:49.260> they<00:03:49.380> evolve<00:03:49.740> and<00:03:50.070> that<00:03:50.820> son<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.270> she

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
will they evolve and that son that she

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.180 
will they evolve and that son that she
wants<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.690> have<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.020> king<00:03:52.290> what<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.070> know

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
wants to have the king what you know

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.340 
wants to have the king what you know
everything<00:03:54.000> about<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.240> is<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.600> really<00:03:54.810> like<00:03:55.080> as

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
everything about it is is really like as

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.470 
everything about it is is really like as
far<00:03:55.500> as<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.710> ants<00:03:55.980> go<00:03:56.130> their<00:03:56.910> intellect<00:03:57.360> is

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
far as the ants go their intellect is

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.300 
far as the ants go their intellect is
what's<00:03:57.660> just<00:03:58.110> making<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.590> such<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.890> freaking

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
what's just making it such a freaking

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.820 
what's just making it such a freaking
creepy<00:03:59.700> event<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.210> overall<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:01.050> this<00:04:01.590> art

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
creepy event and overall just this art

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.770 
creepy event and overall just this art
so<00:04:02.040> far<00:04:02.070> it's<00:04:02.400> like<00:04:02.520> I<00:04:02.790> guess<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.450> best<00:04:03.600> way<00:04:03.750> to

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
so far it's like I guess the best way to

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.210 
so far it's like I guess the best way to
put<00:04:03.960> it's<00:04:04.110> creepy<00:04:04.410> I've<00:04:04.530> said<00:04:04.770> creepy<00:04:05.070> many

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
times but that that's really what it is

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.470 
times but that that's really what it is
with<00:04:07.470> this<00:04:07.620> episode<00:04:07.890> but<00:04:08.700> again<00:04:08.880> creepy<00:04:09.270> build

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
with this episode but again creepy build

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.840 
with this episode but again creepy build
up<00:04:09.660> um<00:04:09.870> not<00:04:10.650> too<00:04:10.920> much<00:04:11.130> other<00:04:11.370> than<00:04:11.580> you<00:04:11.730> know

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
up um not too much other than you know

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.420 
up um not too much other than you know
certain<00:04:12.510> aspects<00:04:13.020> seem<00:04:13.170> like<00:04:13.320> this<00:04:13.530> key<00:04:14.220> Mara

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
certain aspects seem like this key Mara

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.039 
certain aspects seem like this key Mara
and<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:14.880> think<00:04:15.240> he's<00:04:15.360> gonna<00:04:15.480> have<00:04:15.690> again<00:04:15.930> an

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
and I think he's gonna have again an

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.900 
and I think he's gonna have again an
important<00:04:16.440> part<00:04:16.710> I<00:04:16.920> don't<00:04:17.250> know<00:04:17.460> how<00:04:17.640> much<00:04:17.850> of

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
important part I don't know how much of

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.310 
important part I don't know how much of
an<00:04:18.150> important<00:04:18.480> part<00:04:18.600> but<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.750> definitely<00:04:19.170> see

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
an important part but I definitely see

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.170 
an important part but I definitely see
him<00:04:19.500> being<00:04:19.980> more<00:04:20.310> than<00:04:20.520> just<00:04:20.820> like<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.090> know

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
him being more than just like you know
