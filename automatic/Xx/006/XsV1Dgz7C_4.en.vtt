whatever<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.739> think<00:03:31.980> it's<00:03:32.100> gonna<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.310> it's

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
whatever you think it's gonna be it's

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.490 
whatever you think it's gonna be it's
not<00:03:32.760> it's<00:03:33.330> going<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.540> be<00:03:33.630> something<00:03:33.900> else<00:03:34.049> but

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
not it's going to be something else but

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.199 
not it's going to be something else but
at<00:03:34.620> least<00:03:34.950> if<00:03:35.190> you've<00:03:35.310> had<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.580> little<00:03:35.940> bit<00:03:36.060> of

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
at least if you've had a little bit of

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.690 
at least if you've had a little bit of
preparation<00:03:36.769> even<00:03:37.769> if<00:03:37.860> it's<00:03:37.980> just<00:03:38.160> mentally

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
preparation even if it's just mentally

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.150

you know if this plane went down what
would<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.340> do

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
would I do

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.060 
would I do
just<00:03:42.420> asking<00:03:43.380> yourself<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:43.860> question

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
just asking yourself that question

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.069

you've<00:03:44.489> already<00:03:44.700> put<00:03:44.940> yourself<00:03:45.269> well<00:03:45.780> ahead

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
you've already put yourself well ahead

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.900 
you've already put yourself well ahead
of<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.260> game<00:03:46.290> for<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.100> person<00:03:47.489> who<00:03:47.610> now

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
of the game for the person who now

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.270 
of the game for the person who now
didn't<00:03:48.720> think<00:03:48.900> like<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.620> plane<00:03:49.860> crashed

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
didn't think like that the plane crashed

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.039 
didn't think like that the plane crashed
their<00:03:50.610> leg<00:03:50.850> hurts<00:03:51.150> there's<00:03:51.450> smoke<00:03:51.780> there's

their leg hurts there's smoke there's
fire<00:03:52.110> there's<00:03:52.350> screaming<00:03:53.010> they're<00:03:53.130> yelling

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
fire there's screaming they're yelling

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.860 
fire there's screaming they're yelling
and<00:03:53.640> now<00:03:53.970> they're<00:03:54.150> like<00:03:54.239> what<00:03:54.480> do<00:03:54.570> I<00:03:54.660> do

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
and now they're like what do I do

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.600 
and now they're like what do I do
you've<00:03:55.320> already<00:03:55.470> thought<00:03:55.739> about<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.100> so<00:03:56.220> just

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
you've already thought about it so just

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.420 
you've already thought about it so just
a<00:03:56.760> little<00:03:56.880> bit<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.180> planning<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.350> think<00:03:58.980> will<00:03:59.310> go

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
a little bit of planning I think will go

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.390 
a little bit of planning I think will go
a<00:03:59.459> long<00:03:59.670> way<00:03:59.850> I<00:04:00.350> consider<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.680> Special<00:04:02.100> Forces

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
a long way I consider the Special Forces

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.550 
a long way I consider the Special Forces
primarily<00:04:03.329> to<00:04:03.480> be<00:04:03.600> teachers<00:04:03.989> I<00:04:04.260> mean<00:04:04.410> that's

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
primarily to be teachers I mean that's

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.020 
primarily to be teachers I mean that's
what<00:04:04.709> we<00:04:04.829> do<00:04:04.950> we<00:04:05.130> go<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.430> we<00:04:05.489> teach<00:04:05.760> these

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
what we do we go in and we teach these

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.340 
what we do we go in and we teach these
people<00:04:06.060> how<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.570> do<00:04:06.780> things<00:04:06.959> for<00:04:07.170> themselves

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
people how to do things for themselves

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.860 
people how to do things for themselves
so<00:04:07.980> I've<00:04:08.489> always<00:04:08.820> enjoyed<00:04:08.970> teaching<00:04:09.600> and
