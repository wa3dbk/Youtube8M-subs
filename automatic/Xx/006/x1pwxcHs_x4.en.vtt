00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.700
 very good to all and welcome from 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.710
 new here to the channel and how are you seeing 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.410
 Trevor airport you know what 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.369
 means a new creator tutorial 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.580
 of contents 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.949
 today I finally come to show you how to do 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.050
 those looping of those loopings that both 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.949
 you asked for how much desire you have of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.170
 know how they are made and finally here what 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.239
 we have today as you always know that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.710
 let's make a ramp of those giants 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.530
 we always have to start with a 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.329
 big ramp so good let's cut 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.980
 we put the big ramp and now we're going to 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.410
 put a few signs out there 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 because you already know what we have to do 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.910
 the trick of superimposing objects and so 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.340
 it will be much easier because they will already be 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.399
 So, good, let's start 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.940
 make this giant ramp and we have to 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.430
 make up to seven ramps 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.030
 consecutive because because the seventh already 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.510
 it is very vertical and therefore 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.490
 we can put anything else on top of us 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.670
 that also know that they are 7 including 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.670
 the big ramp that is to say will be six of 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.680
 the small ones and with the big one they would be 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.350
 seven this I'm going to put on camera 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.090
 fast you all know how this is done 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.399
 overlay so there is no 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.520
 problem and if you do not know, I 'm going to 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.979
 leave a link here for you to see 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.020
 how do you do that it was the first tutorial 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.420
 or the second one does not agree right now but 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.560
 it was a tutorial and I have it uploaded here 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.170
 in the channel and you can see it 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.330
 perfectly well, we are already 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.700
 getting there to the 7th ramp as you have 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.210
 seen we have put them all all 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.060
 and now it's time to put the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.090
 ramps in another way as we're going to 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.280
 then put the signal and we'll take 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.500
 we will go to the back 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.229
 as you can see there you can not put any 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.549
 no signal and we'll go here to the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.500
 back as you are seeing there yes 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.179
 that leaves me to install but that 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.709
 we have to do we have to look for that 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.980
 the ramp is left as follows 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.480
 well because because that way we can do the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.550
 jump as you are seeing there yes that I 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.000
 let's put the signal and we can put 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.790
 well this ramp 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.830
 the correct way is to say upside down 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.480
 of how were the others here that 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.910
 we have to do so we will look for the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.800
 highest point where it lets us put 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.470
 this signal because now we 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.290
 I'll let you put them all forgiveness and 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.020
 search there we are look for the point in 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.330
 super put again and now then 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.640
 let's put a few I'm going to put 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.550
 the fast camera because to create it is 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.600
 I do not cheat 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.820
 I'm just putting them little by little 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.040
 and some cost more some cost 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.540
 less but you know that that depends already 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.690
 of each one's ability to the best 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.430
 you do it to the first one and to me it is me 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.080
 costing a little bit more depends some 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.690
 ramps some ramps are placed 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.989
 first and others maybe it took seven 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.550
 attempts but hey this is everyone 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.020
 how it works out does not always come out 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.360
 all the first because we're not going there 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.190
 we are already putting the ramps this is 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.830
 a little fast camera not much 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.030
 either but there it is then good 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.420
 we follow 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.040
 putting these ramps the ramps that by 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.050
 example this one is pretty stubborn to not 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.760
 I wanted to put in but nothing happens because 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.560
 finally yes that they place it I move away a 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.770
 little bit the camera and stops the first 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.410
 that I have moved away the camera is put then 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.290
 we will continue and what are tips that I 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.050
 give when you do a test with the car 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.180
 you know what you can press select and in 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.310
 this case as it is a race what 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.490
 I'm creating appearing with a car and 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.520
 we will try this ramp and we will see it 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.330
 now I'm going to put one last 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.900
 here 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.900
 we go 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.710
 is going a little bit now so now 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.600
 I'm just going to do the test before 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.700
 with the car to know that this ramp 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.350
 It is well done because it is about to end 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.320
 the ramp and you have the car 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.570
 hooked at several points and neither is 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.620
 well that's how you're looking at the ramp 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.480
 It works 100% and then we can continue 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.150
 creating now I'm going to put it back to 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.710
 fast camera so you can see also 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.780
 I have to say one thing what we are 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.810
 doing now is a looping of the 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.480
 small this looping will end in a 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.450
 height is to say the 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.660
 completion completion now of this 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.070
 looking to make it normal what 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.950
 we would have to do is when we get there 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.120
 to the point that we see that the ramps that 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.180
 we are putting on top 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.940
 are straight we would start doing the 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.980
 looping on the bottom and we would do 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.600
 an exact copy of what we are 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.610
 doing in one part in the other 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.400
 we just have to do two 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.250
 times the average loop and now for example 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.650
 in that part that we are right now 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.090
 we put one more and I think this is already the 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.129
 straight 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.639
 now we will see it 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:12.580
 let's put we're going to put said no 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:16.569
 he wants he does not want to be there that would be 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.149
 the straight because we would take and make another 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:22.179
 half looking a crescent of these with 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:24.669
 ramps and we would simply put them together in 

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:26.080
 the air is quite simple you know 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.089
 as we have already done a part 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.749
 we just have to do another one in 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:33.699
 front and that will connect in the air 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:35.409
 that is to do a looping that is 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.050
 stay on the ground that is to say that it arrives 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.459
 down to the ground because if not the looping 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.800
 what are we currently doing as I have 

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:43.430
 said will remain elevated and to whom we 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.220
 it reaches 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.980
 frank soil will simply stay a 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.850
 little bit high, well, how are you? 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:55.010
 seeing I keep superimposing and this is the 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.710
 tutorial of creator loopings 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.050
 content if you liked it you already know 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.020
 you can give to like you are not obligated 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.000
 but if it has served you I would like to know 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.370
 if it really has served you and you can 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.720
 comment too and you can tell me what 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.690
 you want a tutorial you know that you have 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.060
 a broad a wide range of tutorials 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.010
 but if you have any doubt, always 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.470
 you can say it and I will try to make you 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.290
 a tutorial that serves you as good as 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.120
 I said this has been the tutorial I hope 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.670
 that you liked us has served us 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.960
 course we are going to do another test and as 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.120
 I said if it was like that 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.090
 if it has served you and you liked it you can 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.300
 give it up like I say goodbye see you in the 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.900
 next video 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.900
 God
