00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.030
 a lot to say type together 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.480
 I think 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.040
 the game was lost the game was tied we could not be champions 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:12.619
 I think it would be written if the team has run has not played too much 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:13.829
 all right 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.829
 in contained a lot of blockages maybe you go to an elvio sos 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.339
 he did not miss scoring a goal because he seals that counterattack a couple of times two 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.230
 Sometimes I fear a lot of danger 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.350
 the one who carried the weight of the game was the sport but not with good sense 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.679
 with good tone 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.420
 could not be what we are going to do to him since I have to say for the great 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.200
 dislike that the team has 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.000
 for the great displeasure 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 that I still think that I have to congratulate the world 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.260
 because they have left the skin because it is expected to head all year 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.530
 have been persecuted by a large team have tried to stabilize them have 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.200
 nervous post 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.620
 they have done what they could have done well locke or they are the rules of the 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.300
 game 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.740
 and I think I do not have much else to say 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.740
 it's been a shame once we had it 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.510
 at a good level the possibilities 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.580
 it is sad and it is hard especially because possibly once in a lifetime 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.460
 we could have got 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.830
 and it could not be 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.130
 I believe that she 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.440
 more questions I could not answer because I do not know what to say 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.620
 the evidence 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.310
 thank you 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.430
 because a bad day has already passed but once you pass it so bad now I was 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.280
 very whole 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.940
 while some players were not going very badly 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.510
 really bad 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.080
 I feel a great sadness for those people on the street that I saw all 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.910
 the days 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.280
 Monday or Tuesday are older people of their children who had such an illusion 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.820
 tremendous and that I thought we could say the soldiers because I could pass 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.389
 this 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:14.689
 because it's not the first time it happens to me no 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.329
 or what happens to people 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:17.959
 past ipa 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.159
 let's celebrate a penalty when there was no time to breathe 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.509
 had to give all and 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.069
 thank you 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.699
 until next time 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:27.489
 God distribute luck
