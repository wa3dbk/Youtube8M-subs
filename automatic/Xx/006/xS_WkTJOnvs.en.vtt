let's<00:00:00.840> start<00:00:01.170> by<00:00:01.350> establishing<00:00:01.500> an<00:00:02.220> important

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
let's start by establishing an important

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.920 
let's start by establishing an important
fact<00:00:03.210> our<00:00:03.899> planet<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.890> black<00:00:05.279> female

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
fact our planet is a black female

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.480 
fact our planet is a black female
starting<00:00:06.930> with<00:00:07.049> gender<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.950> planet<00:00:08.370> is

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
starting with gender the planet is

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.430 
starting with gender the planet is
certainly<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.940> female<00:00:09.480> as<00:00:09.690> she<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:09.960> able<00:00:10.320> to

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
certainly a female as she is able to

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.830 
certainly a female as she is able to
continually<00:00:11.040> give<00:00:11.400> birth<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.030> maintain<00:00:12.570> life

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
continually give birth and maintain life

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.289 
continually give birth and maintain life
later<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.679> we<00:00:14.040> will<00:00:14.160> discuss<00:00:14.610> our<00:00:14.790> planets

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
later on we will discuss our planets

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.830 
later on we will discuss our planets

now<00:00:18.349> to<00:00:18.410> talk<00:00:18.769> about<00:00:19.130> color<00:00:19.460> what<00:00:20.060> is<00:00:20.180> black

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
now to talk about color what is black

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.019 
now to talk about color what is black
black<00:00:21.349> is<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.800> color<00:00:22.039> that<00:00:22.160> takes<00:00:22.550> in<00:00:22.789> all

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
black is the color that takes in all

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.450 
black is the color that takes in all
wavelengths<00:00:23.419> of<00:00:24.020> light<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.830> concept<00:00:25.369> of

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
wavelengths of light the concept of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.519 
wavelengths of light the concept of
black<00:00:25.759> can<00:00:26.180> apply<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.539> many<00:00:26.840> different<00:00:27.320> things

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
black can apply to many different things

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.609 
black can apply to many different things
including<00:00:28.340> of<00:00:28.460> course<00:00:28.489> people<00:00:29.180> to<00:00:30.050> understand
