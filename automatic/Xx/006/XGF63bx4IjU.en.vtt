Oh

00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:03.609 
so this is a new card game that I'm

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:06.360 
so this is a new card game that I'm
working<00:00:03.909> on<00:00:04.029> in<00:00:04.359> game<00:00:04.690> maker<00:00:04.900> studio<00:00:05.370> I've

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.370 
working on in game maker studio I've

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.950 
working on in game maker studio I've
made<00:00:06.669> one<00:00:06.910> in<00:00:07.120> game<00:00:07.509> maker<00:00:07.779> 8.1<00:00:07.959> before<00:00:08.890> but<00:00:09.340> it

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
made one in game maker 8.1 before but it

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.270 
made one in game maker 8.1 before but it
it<00:00:10.960> wasn't<00:00:11.290> really<00:00:11.530> originally<00:00:11.950> supposed<00:00:12.160> to

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
it wasn't really originally supposed to

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.250 
it wasn't really originally supposed to
be<00:00:12.370> much<00:00:12.820> so<00:00:13.150> the<00:00:13.360> code<00:00:13.600> is<00:00:13.630> just<00:00:13.780> pretty

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
be much so the code is just pretty

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.560 
be much so the code is just pretty
crappy<00:00:14.710> it<00:00:14.830> wasn't<00:00:15.190> really<00:00:15.940> thought<00:00:16.180> out<00:00:16.359> and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
crappy it wasn't really thought out and

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.200 
crappy it wasn't really thought out and
this<00:00:17.380> time<00:00:17.650> around<00:00:17.980> I<00:00:18.490> have<00:00:18.670> actually<00:00:19.030> thought

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
this time around I have actually thought

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.380 
this time around I have actually thought
about<00:00:19.270> it<00:00:19.660> and<00:00:20.190> everything<00:00:21.190> is<00:00:21.760> just<00:00:21.789> much

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
about it and everything is just much

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.460 
about it and everything is just much
neater<00:00:22.840> and<00:00:23.020> nicer<00:00:23.710> and<00:00:25.260> unfortunately<00:00:26.260> I'm

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
neater and nicer and unfortunately I'm

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.400 
neater and nicer and unfortunately I'm
terrible<00:00:27.130> at<00:00:27.220> spriting<00:00:27.940> so<00:00:28.300> I<00:00:28.660> guess<00:00:29.080> not<00:00:29.230> just

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
terrible at spriting so I guess not just

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.990 
terrible at spriting so I guess not just
writing<00:00:29.590> or<00:00:29.710> just<00:00:29.800> like<00:00:30.010> drawing<00:00:30.250> images<00:00:30.760> in

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
writing or just like drawing images in

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.510 
writing or just like drawing images in
general<00:00:31.390> so<00:00:32.140> I<00:00:32.500> just<00:00:32.770> use<00:00:32.920> some<00:00:33.039> images<00:00:33.190> online

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
general so I just use some images online

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.069 
general so I just use some images online
like<00:00:33.970> some<00:00:34.660> anime<00:00:35.050> stuff<00:00:35.410> and<00:00:36.120> there<00:00:37.120> is<00:00:37.300> music

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
like some anime stuff and there is music

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.540 
like some anime stuff and there is music
although<00:00:38.710> I<00:00:38.739> don't<00:00:38.860> know<00:00:38.950> how<00:00:39.130> about<00:00:39.220> it's

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
although I don't know how about it's

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.100 
although I don't know how about it's
going<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:39.820> be<00:00:39.910> in<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.059> video<00:00:40.239> so<00:00:40.809> I'll<00:00:40.960> just

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
going to be in the video so I'll just

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.620 
going to be in the video so I'll just
keep<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.380> kind<00:00:41.559> of<00:00:41.620> low<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:43.180> right<00:00:43.360> there<00:00:43.600> and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
keep the kind of low all right there and

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.540 
keep the kind of low all right there and
there's<00:00:44.350> no<00:00:44.470> quest<00:00:44.739> right<00:00:45.010> now<00:00:45.130> but<00:00:45.309> there<00:00:45.460> is

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
there's no quest right now but there is

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.400 
there's no quest right now but there is
like<00:00:45.670> a<00:00:45.760> free<00:00:46.090> play<00:00:46.450> which<00:00:46.870> right<00:00:47.860> now<00:00:48.190> is<00:00:48.550> just

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410

your deck which these decks right now is

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.069 
your deck which these decks right now is

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
just that deck versus randomly generated

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.790 
just that deck versus randomly generated
cards<00:00:56.320> from<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.500> enemy<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.989> for<00:00:59.379> cards

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.940 
cards from the enemy and it's for cards
and<00:00:59.920> a<00:01:00.039> hand<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:02.320> now<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.500> click<00:01:02.739> on<00:01:02.860> the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
and a hand right now you click on the

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.709 
and a hand right now you click on the

deck to get your cards in the beginning

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:06.630 
deck to get your cards in the beginning

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
but that's just that's just what I write

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.830 
but that's just that's just what I write
have<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:06.909> is<00:01:07.030> easy<00:01:07.570> so<00:01:08.560> it's<00:01:08.710> it's<00:01:09.100> four

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
have that is easy so it's it's four

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.020 
have that is easy so it's it's four
cards<00:01:10.840> max<00:01:11.380> in<00:01:11.560> your<00:01:11.650> hands<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.460> play<00:01:12.700> card

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
cards max in your hands the play card

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.670 
cards max in your hands the play card
and<00:01:13.360> these<00:01:13.570> little<00:01:13.840> two<00:01:14.830> things<00:01:15.159> here<00:01:15.520> is<00:01:15.790> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and these little two things here is the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
and these little two things here is the
deactivation<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:18.220> as<00:01:18.640> long<00:01:19.540> as<00:01:19.869> there<00:01:20.409> is<00:01:20.920> like

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
deactivation so as long as there is like

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.149 
deactivation so as long as there is like
full<00:01:21.970> red<00:01:22.180> bars<00:01:22.420> that's<00:01:22.689> activated<00:01:23.260> so<00:01:23.560> this

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
full red bars that's activated so this

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.560 
full red bars that's activated so this
takes<00:01:24.400> another<00:01:24.610> four<00:01:24.909> turns<00:01:25.180> or<00:01:25.420> both<00:01:25.540> of

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
takes another four turns or both of

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.320 
takes another four turns or both of
these<00:01:25.750> cards<00:01:26.049> and<00:01:26.290> then<00:01:26.950> I<00:01:27.070> like<00:01:27.250> consumer<00:01:27.970> to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
these cards and then I like consumer to

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.890 
these cards and then I like consumer to
to<00:01:29.110> turn<00:01:29.530> activation<00:01:30.250> card<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.450> click<00:01:31.720> that

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
to turn activation card so I click that

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.640 
to turn activation card so I click that
and<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:33.009> play<00:01:33.220> card<00:01:33.549> ends<00:01:33.970> your<00:01:34.060> turn<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:34.720> I

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
and you play card ends your turn and I

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.230 
and you play card ends your turn and I
don't<00:01:35.740> know<00:01:35.860> if<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.009> can<00:01:36.100> see<00:01:36.640> it<00:01:36.790> but<00:01:36.970> it's<00:01:37.090> up

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
don't know if you can see it but it's up

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.020 
don't know if you can see it but it's up
here<00:01:37.830> that<00:01:38.830> controls<00:01:39.280> all<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.490> turns<00:01:39.790> and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
here that controls all the turns and

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.350 
here that controls all the turns and
stuff

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
stuff

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.890 
stuff
and<00:01:42.550> right<00:01:43.550> now<00:01:43.760> it's<00:01:43.970> pretty<00:01:44.150> basic<00:01:44.300> I<00:01:44.720> I

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
and right now it's pretty basic I I

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
like placement and I got the Dex working

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.240 
like placement and I got the Dex working
damage<00:01:54.350> works<00:01:54.760> all<00:01:55.760> that<00:01:56.090> stuff<00:01:56.330> works<00:01:56.540> but<00:01:56.780> I

cards like the anime characters stuff so

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.690 
cards like the anime characters stuff so

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
it doesn't look really good and I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.190 
it doesn't look really good and I

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
you know that I got on Google but

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.060 
you know that I got on Google but
everything<00:02:37.970> else<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.900> my<00:02:39.260> crappy<00:02:39.830> yard

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
everything else is my crappy yard

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.990

working um
you<00:02:43.990> can<00:02:44.170> just<00:02:44.320> see<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.680> there's<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.010> glitch

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
you can just see like there's a glitch

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.830 
you can just see like there's a glitch
right<00:02:45.670> now<00:02:45.730> where<00:02:46.480> cards<00:02:47.410> attack<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.840> a

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
right now where cards attack in a in a

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.960 
right now where cards attack in a in a
strange<00:02:50.170> order<00:02:50.530> I'm<00:02:50.920> not<00:02:51.070> sure<00:02:51.220> why<00:02:51.400> yet<00:02:51.670> but

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
strange order I'm not sure why yet but

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.610 
strange order I'm not sure why yet but
clear<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.840> out<00:02:52.990> later

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
clear that out later

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.970 
clear that out later
that's<00:02:54.040> weird<00:02:54.340> never<00:02:54.640> had<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:54.880> before<00:02:55.980> but

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
that's weird never had that before but

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.270 
that's weird never had that before but
as<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.270> see<00:02:58.450> like<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.620> reverse<00:02:59.980> order

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
as you see like it is a reverse order

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.680 
as you see like it is a reverse order
which<00:03:00.490> is<00:03:00.520> strange<00:03:00.970> I'm<00:03:01.180> not<00:03:01.330> sure<00:03:01.450> why<00:03:01.570> it's

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
which is strange I'm not sure why it's

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.350 
which is strange I'm not sure why it's
doing<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:01.990> I'm<00:03:02.140> still<00:03:02.380> looking<00:03:02.650> into<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.010> but

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
doing that I'm still looking into it but

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.470 
doing that I'm still looking into it but

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.820 
this is more of just like an archive of
my<00:03:07.480> process<00:03:07.780> because<00:03:08.290> I'm<00:03:08.410> probably<00:03:08.560> gonna<00:03:08.740> be
