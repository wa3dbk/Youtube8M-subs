00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.799
 elson 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:26.980
 relapse 76 percent chance of the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.859
 target and reckless 50% chance of 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.169
 failure and this is not a 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.820
 acceptable to reach training 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.210
 even the best players of the moment 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.909
 they make mistakes they risk a lot after all 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.329
 of accounts are only human but if not 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:46.540
 I would like to present to you the future of 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.390
 football our krones taken from 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.030
 perfect decision guaranteed results 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:58.870
 this is what the people who is football 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:01.719
 changed 100% of the match but now it has 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.219
 knocked over for now sp a purple lipstick for 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.040
 flowers have entered the head 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.490
 now what we see in being replaced 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.520
 it's the ipi back on campus 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.189
 for football and students will receive this 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.470
 last time we will see cristiano ronaldo 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.090
 the question now is whether this will be the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.090
 phenomenal football 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.630
 I love basketball, that's not what counts. 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.820
 itself is to have a shock that the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.650
 football is a business that we saw today or 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.090
 santo and ii 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.680
 What do you think happened to the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.000
 traditional you mean what they 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.700
 they are doing and where they are now who 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.979
 I am I am indeed who looks here 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.979
 I play nothing, I miss it and cry 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.240
 the manager knows this 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.209
 the cheese lets you guess the same in 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.930
 last week realizing that if not 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.930
 permanent 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.750
 It's a joke and thaÃ­s lauton. 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.430
 leaves that happened because everything 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.310
 world here to prove they are 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.310
 wrong to save football 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.170
 I liked what you did in this place. 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.720
 the game that we the hand is dying 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.200
 clones are breaking up with him 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.940
 we should say he 's sorry 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.260
 leave your post at the time we want 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.510
 end the fighting but they are 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.340
 invincible latam agree nobody 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.730
 believes they can be defeated 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.520
 but you guys can do 10 of what 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.440
 tell you all together 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.560
 remember what makes you 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.410
 you better not be afraid to risk 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.660
 you play like a game it 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.420
 play like a nail you play 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:16.230
 risk everything to win everything 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.530
 there is no greater risk than playing without 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.540
 To risk is official the originals are of 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.000
 back and challenged the bonuses for the game 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.060
 ufpb and promise to leave everything to 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.670
 good forever 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.840
 the question is did not want yesterday 6 were 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.849
 remade 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.010
 this is the stage of most of the planet 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.260
 the whole world is watching who 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.560
 score first we won on Monday 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.560
 chance 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.770
 leave with it 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:08.959
 there is no greater risk than show grace in 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:08.959
 home here 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.160
 I'm passing 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.620
 in this fight 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.930
 it 's not that easy 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.930
 james rock 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.970
 look at this
