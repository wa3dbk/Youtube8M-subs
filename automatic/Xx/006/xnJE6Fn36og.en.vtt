00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.309
 euromaxx week two after the release and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.019
 that means two new dlcs await us 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.230
 and I want to show you where again today 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.130
 you get it because there is one 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.770
 a witch mission and another 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.990
 It's an alternative outfit for Jennifer 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.029
 and I'll start it now 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.590
 that I show you the mission and then 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.449
 look at the outfit because maybe 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.330
 some of those from the game have not yet 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.759
 seen so the mission finds her 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.300
 the scilly islands that is a place that 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.770
 visit animal so from level 15 I am 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.290
 really daring at level 7 already 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.460
 once over and if you go 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.320
 If we ask, that is relative 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.000
 simply and you will automatically 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.570
 actually through a mission there 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.539
 guided 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.719
 that leads you to novi grad and afterwards 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.579
 Here in the harbor you will then boats 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.360
 investigate and boats hire that 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.579
 costs you almost 1000 kroner and there 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.710
 can you make a crossing to the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.890
 buy islands as I said is an area 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.650
 that was originally thought of as stage 14 15 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.250
 is so it does not exaggerate as well as 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.530
 come 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.470
 I myself noticed how hard you there 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.180
 partly on the pros and gets the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.350
 worth it down the beach states what me 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.200
 just showed and then goes 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.020
 over to such a small village it is 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.630
 a huge island but here it is 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.729
 your destination where he wanted to go and exactly 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.909
 There is a message board in there 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:35.310
 small village and there is the dlc 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:38.250
 order missing miners and the pact 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.570
 you in the bag and could one 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.939
 so have fun so you can, of course 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.439
 say the game already has so many 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.360
 orders really need more 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.369
 which is now the orders but that 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.630
 actually an extra order and the 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.030
 so, what was very special 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.229
 have special monster in it and the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.060
 promises a special one 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.070
 to be a challenge because you see 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.630
 the level 27 so there I am still one 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.219
 I have to go a long way from there 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.450
 still a lot of monster bad up 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.240
 I get there 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.649
 you may already be ready and that 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.360
 maybe exactly the mission you are looking for 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.190
 I would say we would have waited 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.590
 At least look at what the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.379
 quest donor has to say and then 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.480
 let's jump and look at what it is 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.010
 with the outfit of jennifer on it 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.970
 because there is actually one 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:30.310
 other thing to pay attention to 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.989
 Greetings witch I am because of 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.769
 Missing miners may be missing here 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.569
 can I help 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:40.269
 what happened in the northern 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.970
 it should be self-imposed because we are 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.730
 Money for the long ships need for 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.349
 We have a few barren raids 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.599
 sent to look 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.599
 they did not come back 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.620
 There is not much silver in the hills 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.130
 but monster I see if that 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.010
 miners who have come across 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.710
 I thank you witch like that and then want 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.210
 Let's take a look at how you like that 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.830
 come out of jennifer outfit that is 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.020
 actually conceivably easy for you 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.030
 can you the dlc for it in the 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.800
 corresponding store you download 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.620
 now see the new one in the big window 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.810
 Outfit top I have the dress the age 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.450
 outfit and I find this 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.800
 new outfit looks really fantastic 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.380
 really great has a little something 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.520
 From tomorrow you almost want to say now 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.790
 there's a thing that would have to 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.739
 note if you console player since 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.150
 and that's where I'm talking primarily the ps4 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.850
 people because I do not know how it works 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.250
 the xbox will work as soon as you do 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.770
 decides to download the tea elzie 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.600
 Will he be the outfit of 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.430
 replace Jennifer in the game 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.350
 this is now called this example 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.670
 see how we saw danger runs 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.890
 with the new outfit 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.620
 in every other scene in the game becomes 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.060
 you also have the new outfit on it 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.380
 value on bets could not be a problem 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.450
 you might think it if you can 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.459
 Cattle could optionally activate that is 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.370
 but not so there is no option in 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.769
 the options that you can say new 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.390
 or old outfit is on the console 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.580
 really so if you guys are now 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.830
 Download it here is on yours 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.070
 console it and replace the whole 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.930
 the problem is thus on the ps4 that 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.760
 you have to complete meuren complete 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.620
 the witcher 3 folders delete the 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.220
 savegames are of course included 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.570
 but it looks like everything else 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.130
 so fly away if you have to play the game 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.110
 completely reinstall you must all 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.790
 Download patches again and then 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.580
 just do not download in the elz ii 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.040
 if you want the old outfit 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.740
 So just think about it well 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.630
 on the ps4 if you like this new outfit 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.270
 want to have if he use the old one 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.040
 I would like to tell you 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.380
 is connecting because you could click that 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.120
 get rid of it all but it is at least 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.340
 very very elaborate if you really 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.710
 jump back out of old outfit 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.220
 wanted and you can hope that in the 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.960
 future a more elegant solution 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.789
 yes that was pretty much everything today too 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.229
 the two new dlc m 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.220
 i hope you like it i have mine 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.080
 spend a little night around the ears 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.659
 beaten to the new quest place 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.000
 We'll see you next week 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.569
 then the locations of the next two 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.569
 the educator
