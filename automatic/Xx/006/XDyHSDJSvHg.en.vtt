00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 we are going to the kitchen to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.470
 those who understand gastronomy say 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.990
 which is a very good season for 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.220
 find good cod laura is in 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.200
 barbastro and they are going to prepare us this 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.680
 late a dish of cod with sauce 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.440
 laura peppers 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.970
 Well, that's healthy cod and salsa 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.860
 peppers is a conjugation that I believe 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.690
 that can not disappoint many people and 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.270
 as a guide in the kitchen today we have very 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.950
 good afternoon but the name name 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.860
 itself of the dish as it comes in the 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.380
 letter how is your mediterranean cod has 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.910
 been consulted at low temperature yes 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.010
 with the same sauce of roasted peppers 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.650
 then it is clear that the ingredients 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.320
 main ones have to be cod and 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.870
 the roasted red pepper and what more or I 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.850
 then we will use as olive garnish 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.760
 black and olive green a bit of 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.370
 onion to decorate olive oil 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.160
 virgin cream sauce for the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.870
 first step confital to cod what 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.300
 we conquer in virgin olive oil 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.969
 with unpeeled garlic heads and a 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.100
 bunch of thyme and this is the cod 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.739
 that we have to wake up so I already 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.960
 I pass it to you to leave it to your slow fire 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.000
 that's why it is said by quoting it to low 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.340
 temperature that approximately goyo 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.700
 how many minutes should we leave it there in 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.540
 that pot with thyme and garlic half an hour 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.060
 approximately 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.830
 the fourth half hour and while we leave 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.500
 this on a very slow fire as he said today 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.520
 or let's make the sauce not making you 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.960
 the sauces and the sauce is composed then of 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:32.050
 a piece of roasted red pepper 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.230
 and a splash of olive oil 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.740
 extra virgin also exact and a little 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.740
 of liquid cream 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 a spoonful of peppers meat 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.150
 choriceros choricero pepper meat 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.250
 this seems unusual against 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.409
 brawn find in the super quiet 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.820
 and that commented joana that is easy to 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.430
 find supermarkets questions 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.550
 for the choricero pepper and it says 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.170
 quickly where are you and 6 and a little bit 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.630
 of garlic and parsley will also be used to 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.240
 the sauce or pears and the where where not 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.009
 are almost miracle itself 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.080
 well this we already had it for the tour 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.050
 hard minister we went through the turn and if 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.180
 anna the look of this sauce is this 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.250
 we have here as you see not too much 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.760
 thick but not too liquid is 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.500
 one thing one intermediate thing 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.840
 then this sauce we have to 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.340
 add to a cod that as in 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.930
 set it up we take a half hour what 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.930
 we have already here prepared 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.060
 so we're going to prepare it as besana 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.680
 in a stainless steel dish so that 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.659
 the oven can withstand the temperature 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.790
 perfectly and do not spoil then that 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.290
 if it is in silver then in one more beautiful 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.080
 that the one where you eat in the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.940
 restaurant and in the oven how long 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.319
 we'll leave it bun is about ten minutes 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.959
 approximately 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:56.519
 and in minutes temperature 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:00.540
 about 180 degrees plus or minus 180 degrees and 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.510
 the stainless steel plate we are going to 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.510
 change for the one to place what is this 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.709
 so big anna that it looks like they're 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.900
 easy to find also in the 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.980
 restaurants lately the most dishes 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.650
 big and this is now the result 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.780
 to leave that cod in the oven during 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.469
 about 10 minutes we remember that is 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.230
 confit at low temperature and with a 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:29.170
 roasted red pepper sauce 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.269
 we are adding a little bit of salsita 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.930
 cheese in addition also this is one of the 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.120
 dishes that more games do not know how is the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.379
 flavor of the sauce more or less as it is a 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.120
 intense flavor to pepper and so very rich 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.060
 good by the way 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.830
