00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
I just got ahold of a set of center caps

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.979 
I just got ahold of a set of center caps
today<00:00:56.920> on<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.100> inside<00:00:58.460> it's<00:00:58.670> really<00:00:59.149> not<00:00:59.809> bad

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
at all except no headliner and dome

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.580

light<00:01:09.740> is<00:01:09.890> blown<00:01:11.020> there<00:01:12.020> was<00:01:12.200> no<00:01:12.350> radio<00:01:12.500> in<00:01:12.860> it

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
light is blown there was no radio in it

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.270 
light is blown there was no radio in it
so<00:01:13.490> I<00:01:13.520> got<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.760> radio<00:01:14.119> and<00:01:14.830> they<00:01:15.830> had<00:01:16.040> all<00:01:16.250> kinds

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
so I got a radio and they had all kinds

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.670 
so I got a radio and they had all kinds
of<00:01:16.640> wrong<00:01:16.790> fuses<00:01:17.360> in<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:17.990> they<00:01:18.320> had<00:01:18.500> too<00:01:18.650> big

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
of wrong fuses in and they had too big

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.109 
of wrong fuses in and they had too big
of<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:18.979> fuse<00:01:19.220> for<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.400> radio<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:19.939> didn't

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
of a fuse for the radio so it didn't

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.420 
of a fuse for the radio so it didn't
work<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:20.330> I<00:01:20.540> had<00:01:20.689> to<00:01:20.780> replace<00:01:21.049> that<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.680> gonna

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
be getting the installation kit soon

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.070 
be getting the installation kit soon
here<00:01:24.760> for<00:01:25.760> the<00:01:25.850> shifter<00:01:26.210> there<00:01:26.420> was<00:01:26.689> no<00:01:26.869> knob

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
here for the shifter there was no knob

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.910 
here for the shifter there was no knob
and<00:01:27.439> no<00:01:27.560> boot<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:29.240> I<00:01:29.270> got<00:01:30.080> ahold<00:01:30.229> of<00:01:30.470> a<00:01:30.590> boot<00:01:30.770> out

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
and no boot so I got ahold of a boot out

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.700 
and no boot so I got ahold of a boot out
of<00:01:31.040> an<00:01:31.130> MX<00:01:31.369> 6<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:32.060> I<00:01:32.330> bought<00:01:32.900> a<00:01:32.930> knob<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.229> I<00:01:33.530> put

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
of an MX 6 and I bought a knob and I put

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.499 
of an MX 6 and I bought a knob and I put
it<00:01:33.799> on<00:01:34.960> our<00:01:36.220> p.m.<00:01:37.220> gauge<00:01:37.460> did<00:01:37.759> not<00:01:37.939> work<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:38.479> I

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
it on our p.m. gauge did not work so I

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.219 
it on our p.m. gauge did not work so I
had<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.810> get<00:01:38.960> one<00:01:39.049> out<00:01:39.110> of<00:01:39.229> another<00:01:40.030> 66<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.450> I

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
had to get one out of another 66 and I

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.319 
had to get one out of another 66 and I
also<00:01:42.770> discovered<00:01:43.400> recently<00:01:43.549> my<00:01:43.909> gas<00:01:44.119> gauge

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
also discovered recently my gas gauge

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:45.789 
also discovered recently my gas gauge
doesn't<00:01:44.630> work<00:01:44.900> right<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.439> temperature

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
doesn't work right and the temperature

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.340 
doesn't work right and the temperature
gauge<00:01:45.950> doesn't<00:01:46.159> work<00:01:46.460> at<00:01:46.610> all<00:01:46.869> so<00:01:47.869> I<00:01:47.900> replace

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
gauge doesn't work at all so I replace

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.380 
gauge doesn't work at all so I replace
the<00:01:48.470> thermostat<00:01:48.979> thinking<00:01:49.820> that<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.150> was<00:01:50.270> that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
the thermostat thinking that it was that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.450 
the thermostat thinking that it was that
but<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:50.659> wasn't<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:51.259> now<00:01:51.470> I<00:01:51.500> need<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.799> get<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:52.159> new

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
but it wasn't so now I need to get a new

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.840 
but it wasn't so now I need to get a new
gauge<00:01:52.670> for<00:01:52.880> that<00:01:54.130> but<00:01:55.130> yeah<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.369> interior<00:01:55.790> is

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
gauge for that but yeah the interior is

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.100 
gauge for that but yeah the interior is
not<00:01:55.970> bad<00:01:56.180> at<00:01:56.329> all<00:01:56.450> really<00:01:56.810> oh<00:01:58.960> yeah<00:01:59.960> in<00:02:00.020> the
