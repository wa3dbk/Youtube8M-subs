00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
all right so this video is just going to

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.249 
all right so this video is just going to
be<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.659> short<00:00:03.990> video<00:00:05.390> kind<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.480> mini<00:00:06.660> tutorial

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
be a short video kind of a mini tutorial

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.400 
be a short video kind of a mini tutorial
on<00:00:07.470> how<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.099> do<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.910> difficult<00:00:09.510> fold<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:10.110> the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
on how to do a difficult fold in the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.640 
on how to do a difficult fold in the
Doodlebug<00:00:11.210> this<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.509> step<00:00:12.750> 9<00:00:12.990> step<00:00:13.019> 10

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
Doodlebug this is the step 9 step 10

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.700 
Doodlebug this is the step 9 step 10
fold<00:00:14.070> now<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.330> don't<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.900> any<00:00:16.020> index<00:00:16.350> cards

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
fold now I don't have any index cards

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.890 
fold now I don't have any index cards
today<00:00:16.890> but<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.490> got<00:00:17.670> some<00:00:17.940> pieces<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.359> paper<00:00:18.539> of

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
today but I got some pieces of paper of

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.099 
today but I got some pieces of paper of
an<00:00:19.289> equivalent<00:00:19.560> size<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.699> cut<00:00:20.939> as<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.990> can

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
an equivalent size that I cut as you can

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.210 
an equivalent size that I cut as you can
see<00:00:22.289> I've<00:00:22.410> already<00:00:22.500> divided<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.310> into<00:00:24.560> 5<00:00:25.560> by<00:00:25.590> 3

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
see I've already divided it into 5 by 3

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.019 
see I've already divided it into 5 by 3
folds<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.380> we<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.590> 5<00:00:28.859> going<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.340> way<00:00:29.550> 3

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
folds so we have 5 going this way 3

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.479 
folds so we have 5 going this way 3
going<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.539> way<00:00:30.720> now<00:00:31.710> when<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.309> that

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
going this way now when you do that

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.580 
going this way now when you do that
you're<00:00:32.669> going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.850> flip<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.239> over<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.350> you're

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you're going to flip it over and you're

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.850 
you're going to flip it over and you're
going<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.920> then<00:00:35.610> fold<00:00:36.000> an<00:00:36.329> X<00:00:36.840> shape<00:00:36.989> into<00:00:37.649> this

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
going to then fold an X shape into this

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.330 
going to then fold an X shape into this
square<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.390> square<00:00:39.629> here<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.320> then<00:00:41.070> do

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
square and this square here and then do

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.069 
square and this square here and then do
another<00:00:41.370> fold<00:00:42.410> intersecting<00:00:43.410> those<00:00:43.559> 2<00:00:43.829> X's<00:00:44.340> so

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
another fold intersecting those 2 X's so

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.170 
another fold intersecting those 2 X's so
like<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:47.180> again<00:00:48.379> here<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:50.180> so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
like that and again here like that so

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.819 
like that and again here like that so
the<00:00:51.449> next<00:00:51.600> step<00:00:51.899> where<00:00:52.350> you're<00:00:52.469> going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> be

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the next step where you're going to be

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.400 
the next step where you're going to be
folding<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.890> little<00:00:55.890> bit<00:00:56.010> tricky<00:00:57.410> fold

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
folding it is a little bit tricky fold

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.889 
folding it is a little bit tricky fold
it<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> bit<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
it up like that so you have a bit of a

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.290 
it up like that so you have a bit of a
kind<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> long<00:01:02.190> table<00:01:02.489> tower<00:01:02.910> shape

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
kind of a like a long table tower shape

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.020 
kind of a like a long table tower shape
kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.750> thing<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.640> you're<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.820> want

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
kind of thing and you're going to want

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.090 
kind of thing and you're going to want
to<00:01:06.090> pinch<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.689> sides<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.619> inwards<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:10.100> let

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
to pinch the sides here inwards and let

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.480 
to pinch the sides here inwards and let
the<00:01:11.729> sides<00:01:12.000> collapse<00:01:12.630> inwards<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.220> top

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the sides collapse inwards and the top

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.109 
the sides collapse inwards and the top
collapse<00:01:15.000> downwards<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.369> folds<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.880> like

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
collapse downwards so it folds in like

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.950 
collapse downwards so it folds in like
that<00:01:19.820> you'll<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.119> closer<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.810> see

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that you'll get it closer so you can see

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.910 
that you'll get it closer so you can see
that<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:23.970> see<00:01:24.150> how<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.570> collapses<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.320> so

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
that you can see how it collapses in so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.120 
that you can see how it collapses in so
the<00:01:26.040> sides<00:01:26.250> are<00:01:26.520> being<00:01:26.909> pushed<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.619> top<00:01:28.890> is

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the sides are being pushed in the top is

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.520 
the sides are being pushed in the top is
being<00:01:29.369> pushed<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.290> again

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
being pushed down and you do that again

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.700 
being pushed down and you do that again
with<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> next<00:01:31.890> one

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.410 

all<00:01:38.130> right<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:39.270> once<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:39.990> those<00:01:40.619> two

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
all right now once we get those two

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.710 
all right now once we get those two
pinched<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.070> folded<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.510> that's<00:01:45.510> what

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
pinched and folded like that that's what

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.530 
pinched and folded like that that's what
gives<00:01:45.900> us<00:01:46.020> our<00:01:46.200> springing<00:01:46.770> action<00:01:47.180> these<00:01:48.180> two

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
gives us our springing action these two

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.149 
gives us our springing action these two
pieces<00:01:49.670> all<00:01:50.670> right<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.060> from<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:53.009> order

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
pieces all right and from here in order

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.420 
pieces all right and from here in order
to<00:01:53.520> connect<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> pieces<00:01:54.390> together<00:01:55.430> what

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
to connect the pieces together what

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.820 
to connect the pieces together what
you'll<00:01:56.580> want<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.509> kind<00:01:58.050> of<00:01:58.170> unfold<00:01:58.710> it

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
you'll want to do is kind of unfold it

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.649 
you'll want to do is kind of unfold it
again<00:02:00.830> take<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:02.070> top<00:02:02.940> two<00:02:03.360> columns<00:02:04.290> here<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
again take the top two columns here and

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.580 
again take the top two columns here and
fold<00:02:06.659> them<00:02:06.810> as<00:02:07.080> such

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
fold them as such

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.080 
fold them as such
take<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> top<00:02:09.440> column<00:02:10.440> fold<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.489> down<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
take the top column fold it down and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.030 
take the top column fold it down and
then<00:02:12.660> fold<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.140> one<00:02:13.350> over

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
then fold this one over

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.460 
then fold this one over
all<00:02:14.850> right<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.239> kind<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.450> accordion<00:02:15.930> folded

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
all right just kind of accordion folded

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.340 
all right just kind of accordion folded
like<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:18.769> one<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.130> two<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:21.660> then<00:02:21.989> we<00:02:22.080> fold

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
like that one and two and then we fold

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.160 
like that one and two and then we fold
it<00:02:22.440> again<00:02:22.650> into<00:02:22.800> our<00:02:22.950> table<00:02:23.250> shape<00:02:25.220> and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
it again into our table shape and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:37.970 
it again into our table shape and
collapse<00:02:28.170> those<00:02:28.470> two<00:02:29.150> squares<00:02:30.150> again

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.059 

all<00:02:38.550> right<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.440> that's<00:02:40.440> what<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.739> finished

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
all right so that's what the finished

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.490

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
it goes and then to make sure that it

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.179

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
bottom corner here and fold it up this

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.319 
bottom corner here and fold it up this
is<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.260> sloppy<00:03:38.590> job<00:03:38.890> here<00:03:39.159> but<00:03:39.310> just<00:03:40.120> pull<00:03:40.299> that

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
is a sloppy job here but just pull that

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.990 
is a sloppy job here but just pull that
into<00:03:40.659> place<00:03:40.930> like<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.400> on<00:03:42.400> either<00:03:42.639> side

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
into place like that on either side

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.729 
into place like that on either side
that's<00:03:43.750> what's<00:03:43.900> going<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.049> make<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.560> bugs

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
that's what's going to make the bugs

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.410 
that's what's going to make the bugs
look<00:03:44.889> like<00:03:45.159> it<00:03:45.250> has<00:03:45.370> little<00:03:45.549> feet<00:03:45.819> sticking<00:03:45.879> up

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
look like it has little feet sticking up

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.459 
look like it has little feet sticking up
and<00:03:46.709> that's<00:03:47.709> how<00:03:47.829> you<00:03:47.889> connect<00:03:48.310> them<00:03:52.469> there

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:53.469 
and that's how you connect them there

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:55.680 
and that's how you connect them there
you<00:03:53.530> go
