00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.330 
weaknesses and shortcomings as all of us
are<00:03:53.069> supposed<00:03:53.639> to<00:03:53.790> be<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.599> know<00:03:54.919> success<00:03:55.919> in

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
are supposed to be you know success in

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.809 
are supposed to be you know success in
my<00:03:56.609> in<00:03:57.030> my<00:03:57.090> mind<00:03:57.599> success<00:03:58.049> is<00:03:58.259> nothing<00:03:58.819> but

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
my in my mind success is nothing but

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.330 
my in my mind success is nothing but
your<00:04:00.030> weaknesses<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:01.040> you've<00:04:02.040> turned

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
your weaknesses that you've turned

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.990 
your weaknesses that you've turned
inside<00:04:03.030> out<00:04:03.919> so<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:05.040> more<00:04:05.280> weaknesses<00:04:05.819> you

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
inside out so the more weaknesses you

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.759 
inside out so the more weaknesses you
have<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.419> more<00:04:06.599> shortcomings<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.379> have<00:04:07.560> the

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
have the more shortcomings you have the

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.699 
have the more shortcomings you have the
more<00:04:08.009> of<00:04:08.400> an<00:04:09.389> opportunity<00:04:09.599> you<00:04:10.109> have<00:04:10.349> to<00:04:10.590> be

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
more of an opportunity you have to be

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.939 
more of an opportunity you have to be
more<00:04:11.009> successful<00:04:11.989> because<00:04:12.989> its<00:04:14.269> weaknesses

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
more successful because its weaknesses

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:21.170 
more successful because its weaknesses
turned<00:04:16.949> inside<00:04:17.310> out<00:04:17.340> equals<00:04:17.940> success<00:04:20.180> so

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
turned inside out equals success so

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.100 
turned inside out equals success so
anyways<00:04:23.000> what<00:04:24.000> I'm<00:04:24.090> trying<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.389> say<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.659> that

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
try and remember that we are all the

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.050 
try and remember that we are all the
same<00:05:12.720> you<00:05:12.780> me<00:05:13.440> everyone<00:05:14.159> with<00:05:14.610> all<00:05:14.729> the<00:05:14.849> same

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.839 
and that I think is one easy way to
spread<00:05:18.300> peace<00:05:18.569> just<00:05:18.930> within<00:05:19.139> and<00:05:19.530> around
