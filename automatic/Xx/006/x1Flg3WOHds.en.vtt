00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.340
 Wearing the clothes I bought for you 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.800
 Spraying the perfume I bought for you 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.580
 Now you should meet her. 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.280
 Still laughing very happy 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.920
 I used to like it so much. 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.540
 Like to abandon me and leave me 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.940
 How much better to do 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.780
 How can I do better? 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.420
 No matter how you erase it 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.180
 But how many days are there? 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.700
 Although the past time always sheds tears because of grievances 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.660
 Will let you see completely different me 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.220
 Will let you see me becoming more beautiful 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.820
 No longer crying because of foolish love and leaving you 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.160
 Meet the more handsome man 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.000
 Will definitely let you see me happier than you. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.420
 Without you, you won’t be sad, you won’t fall. 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.600
 Boy you gotta be aware 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.420
 Laralararara 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.940
 Change your hair style 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.120
 Carefully dressed up 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.140
 Put on high heels and skirts 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.500
 Look back all 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.940
 Even if you meet with you by chance 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.740
 I will also smile at you. 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.220
 Leave you scared and leave behind 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.240
 Will let you see completely different me 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.460
 Will let you see me becoming more beautiful 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.600
 No longer crying because of foolish love and leaving you 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.940

 Will definitely let you see me happier than you. 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.200
 Without you, you won’t be sad, you won’t fall. 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.700
 Boy you gotta be aware 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.060
 Lalaralara 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.440
 Lose the ring you gave 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.240
 Tear off the letter you wrote 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.860
 No fascination, no regrets, forget you 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.780
 Will you forget to erase you 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.280
 Will let you see completely different me 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.880
 Will let you see me becoming more beautiful 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.240
 No longer crying because of foolish love and leaving you 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.620
 Meet the more handsome man 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.400
 Will definitely let you see me happier than you. 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.060
 Without you, you won’t be sad, you won’t fall. 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.500
 Boy you gotta be aware 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.300
