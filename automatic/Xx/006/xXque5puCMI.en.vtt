you're<00:01:43.259> going<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> different<00:01:43.890> look

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
you're going to get a different look

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.240 
you're going to get a different look
because<00:01:44.869> parts<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> pattern<00:01:46.530> d<00:01:47.009> boss

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
because parts of the pattern d boss

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.460 
because parts of the pattern d boss
while<00:01:47.610> other<00:01:47.819> parts<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.300> pattern<00:01:48.690> emboss

while other parts of the pattern emboss

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.040 
while other parts of the pattern emboss
so<00:01:50.130> try<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.729> both<00:01:50.940> ways<00:01:51.209> because<00:01:51.599> both<00:01:51.810> ways

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
so try it both ways because both ways

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.660 
so try it both ways because both ways
look<00:01:52.289> really<00:01:52.619> pretty<00:01:52.830> and<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.429> decide

the first color I'm going to apply is
the<00:02:22.150> aged<00:02:22.329> mahogany<00:02:23.200> now<00:02:24.099> one<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.489> things

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
the aged mahogany now one of the things

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.119 
the aged mahogany now one of the things
to<00:02:24.909> keep<00:02:25.090> in<00:02:25.239> mind<00:02:25.299> when<00:02:25.780> you're<00:02:25.900> using<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.620> thin

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
to keep in mind when you're using a thin

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.399 
to keep in mind when you're using a thin
patterned<00:02:27.700> paper<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.749> kind<00:02:29.019> of<00:02:29.079> easy<00:02:29.260> to

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
patterned paper it's kind of easy to

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:30.989 
patterned paper it's kind of easy to
wrinkle<00:02:29.889> it<00:02:30.010> when<00:02:30.159> you're<00:02:30.310> rubbing<00:02:30.730> really

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:30.999 
wrinkle it when you're rubbing really

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:32.489 
wrinkle it when you're rubbing really
hard<00:02:31.209> on<00:02:31.359> top<00:02:31.659> because<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.079> kind<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.349> moves

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:32.499 
hard on top because it kind of moves

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.979 
hard on top because it kind of moves
around<00:02:32.889> so<00:02:33.609> try<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:33.909> hold<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:34.299> down<00:02:34.329> as<00:02:34.659> flat<00:02:34.959> as

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
around so try to hold it down as flat as

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.110 
around so try to hold it down as flat as
you<00:02:35.139> can<00:02:35.469> but<00:02:36.010> if<00:02:36.159> you<00:02:36.250> do<00:02:36.430> wrinkle<00:02:36.849> it<00:02:36.969> a

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
you can but if you do wrinkle it a

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.569 
you can but if you do wrinkle it a
little<00:02:37.420> bit<00:02:37.659> it<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.109> ok<00:02:38.560> because<00:02:39.069> all<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.430> have

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
little bit it is ok because all you have

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.250 
little bit it is ok because all you have
to<00:02:39.700> do<00:02:39.819> is<00:02:39.939> make<00:02:40.120> sure<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.389> have<00:02:40.540> enough<00:02:40.569> tape

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
to do is make sure you have enough tape

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.309 
to do is make sure you have enough tape
on<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.859> back<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.430> then<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.719> can<00:02:43.870> press<00:02:44.139> it

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
on the back and then you can press it

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.050 
on the back and then you can press it
down<00:02:44.349> flat<00:02:44.799> again<00:02:45.129> and<00:02:45.159> those<00:02:45.400> wrinkles<00:02:45.819> won't

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
down flat again and those wrinkles won't

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.319 
down flat again and those wrinkles won't
show<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.739> I'm<00:02:47.799> going<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:48.099> ink<00:02:48.400> up<00:02:48.609> this<00:02:48.939> foam

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
show so I'm going to ink up this foam

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.849 
show so I'm going to ink up this foam
applicator<00:02:49.569> with<00:02:50.230> some<00:02:50.439> of<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.620> aged

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859

applicator with some of the aged
mahogany<00:02:51.700> ink<00:02:51.939> and<00:02:52.269> then<00:02:53.169> using<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.739> circular

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
mahogany ink and then using a circular

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.170 
mahogany ink and then using a circular
motion<00:02:55.150> I'm<00:02:55.359> going<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:57.310> lightly<00:02:57.819> go<00:02:58.150> over

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
motion I'm going to just lightly go over

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.720 
motion I'm going to just lightly go over
the<00:02:58.689> entire<00:02:59.079> surface<00:02:59.109> of<00:02:59.829> this<00:02:59.949> pattern<00:03:00.400> paper

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
the entire surface of this pattern paper

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.659 
the entire surface of this pattern paper
and<00:03:01.449> you<00:03:01.569> can<00:03:01.719> see<00:03:02.139> how<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.620> pattern<00:03:03.069> now

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
and you can see how the pattern now

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.959 
and you can see how the pattern now
starts<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.389> really<00:03:04.629> pop<00:03:05.049> out<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:06.430> what's<00:03:06.609> left

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:06.969 
starts to really pop out but what's left

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.270 
starts to really pop out but what's left
underneath<00:03:07.359> isn't<00:03:08.019> just<00:03:08.139> a<00:03:08.230> plain<00:03:08.469> color<00:03:08.859> it's

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280

pattern a little bit more ink and the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.140 
pattern a little bit more ink and the
color<00:03:19.389> really<00:03:19.959> grabs<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:21.400> parts<00:03:21.849> that<00:03:21.939> are

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
because if you press too hard you can

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.800 
because if you press too hard you can
actually<00:03:32.530> get<00:03:32.949> ink<00:03:33.250> on<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.759> D<00:03:33.939> bust<00:03:34.180> areas<00:03:34.659> and

actually get ink on the D bust areas and

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.879 
actually get ink on the D bust areas and
then<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.049> will<00:03:35.169> all<00:03:35.290> just<00:03:35.439> look<00:03:35.680> like<00:03:35.709> one

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.869 
then it will all just look like one
color<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:38.530> that's<00:03:38.739> my<00:03:38.979> first<00:03:39.009> color<00:03:39.669> I've
