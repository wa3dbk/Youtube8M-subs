that all chocolate is made out of in
fact<00:00:17.150> I<00:00:17.240> can<00:00:17.390> feel<00:00:17.570> it<00:00:17.720> you<00:00:17.840> can<00:00:17.960> see<00:00:18.080> the

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
fact I can feel it you can see the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.340 
fact I can feel it you can see the
chocolate<00:00:18.529> right<00:00:18.680> on<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:18.830> inside<00:00:18.950> this<00:00:19.880> food

constituents of flavor alone the next

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.860 
constituents of flavor alone the next
highest<00:00:38.220> would<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.820> royal<00:00:39.210> jelly<00:00:39.600> with

three or four hundred constituents in it

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.930 
three or four hundred constituents in it
this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> highest<00:00:43.710> antioxidant<00:00:44.129> food<00:00:44.790> in

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
this is the highest antioxidant food in

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
this is the highest antioxidant food in
the<00:00:45.059> world<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.480> blows<00:00:45.720> away<00:00:45.930> red<00:00:46.290> wine<00:00:46.530> and

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the world it blows away red wine and

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.049 
the world it blows away red wine and
green<00:00:46.980> team<00:00:47.160> they're<00:00:47.400> not<00:00:47.550> even<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.879> same

green team they're not even in the same
category<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.900> cacao<00:00:49.260> there<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.340> we're

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
category as cacao there it's we're

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.520 
category as cacao there it's we're
talking<00:00:50.940> orders<00:00:51.540> of<00:00:51.750> magnitude<00:00:52.500> greater

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530

15<00:01:03.059> times<00:01:03.420> higher<00:01:03.600> than<00:01:03.719> blueberries<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
15 times higher than blueberries and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
15 times higher than blueberries and
that<00:01:05.070> that's<00:01:05.280> where<00:01:05.580> that's<00:01:05.940> how<00:01:06.119> powerful<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
that that's where that's how powerful it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.840 
that that's where that's how powerful it
is<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.009> the<00:01:08.160> food<00:01:08.399> that<00:01:08.550> all<00:01:08.700> those

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
is this is the food that all those

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.420 
is this is the food that all those
studies<00:01:09.240> about<00:01:09.450> chocolate<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.310> pointing<00:01:11.310> at

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
studies about chocolate is pointing at

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.520 
studies about chocolate is pointing at
right<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.300> not<00:01:12.420> some<00:01:12.750> kind<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.960> sugar<00:01:13.290> in

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
right it's not some kind of sugar in

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
right it's not some kind of sugar in
there<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.830> not<00:01:13.920> some<00:01:14.070> kind<00:01:14.160> of<00:01:14.250> dairy

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
there it's not some kind of dairy

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.430 
there it's not some kind of dairy
product<00:01:15.030> came<00:01:15.149> from<00:01:15.300> some<00:01:15.570> factory<00:01:15.990> farm<00:01:16.229> cow

it's<00:01:17.250> actually<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.080> nut<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.649> all

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
it's actually this the nut that all

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.290 
it's actually this the nut that all
