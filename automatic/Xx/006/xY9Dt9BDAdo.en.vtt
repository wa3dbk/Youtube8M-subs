00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.540
 hello girls it 's a pleasure to say hello 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.910
 again this time I'm going to 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.610
 share this simple decoration 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.629
 pretty and fast then what 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.629
 we are going to need 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.650
 we start our video as the first 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.740
 step we are going to place this white paint 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.750
 in each of our nails once we 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.240
 we arrived applied one more layer of 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.240
 painting let's work right away with 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.640
 she in this step we are going to use this 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.980
 color rosita I'm going to just put a 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.440
 droplet after is green 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.960
 I will apply in the corner part one 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.170
 drop nothing else and then the peach color 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.780
 on the other corner 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.590
 then with a thin brush let's 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.050
 Mix all the colors in this way 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.690
 we make sure that all the fields 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.780
 of the white paint are covered 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 the colors that we are mixing as 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.120
 you can see it 's not difficult to do this 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.260
 decoration the same thing that we are doing 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.600
 here we are going to do it with the other nails 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.570
 If the painting you are using is 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.980
 very liquid simply apply a 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.590
 droplet not too much 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.010
 so we will avoid that the painting 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.440
 water and then be difficult to remove 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.570
 if you want each of the nails to be 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.810
 different and do not have the same finish 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.080
 equally applies a color more than 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.150
 another and likewise in each of them 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.150
 will admire in a different way 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.920
 in this way we are achieving this 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.270
 super easy decoration I hope that you 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.270
 inspire with your favorite colors 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.040
 we are about to finish we will give by 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.250
 last a small touch-up to our 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.250
 decor 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.290
 finally let's put a layer of 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.659
 shine to this decoration 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.810
 one of the ways so that the paint does not 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:29.420
 It is bar is to apply the brightness with 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.069
 little soft little touches so that 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.069
 paint is becoming firm 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.720
 with this last nail is how we arrived 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.720
 to the end of this decoration 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.420
 these are the final result of our 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.010
 decoration I hope you liked it
