00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
two matches that you play in the sheets

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.080 
two matches that you play in the sheets
we<00:03:06.110> won<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.470> but<00:03:06.800> out<00:03:07.220> of<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.430> three<00:03:07.580> ones<00:03:07.850> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
we won and but out of the three ones the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.880 
we won and but out of the three ones the
most<00:03:08.210> content<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.810> get<00:03:08.990> regarding<00:03:09.470> gameplay

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
most content you get regarding gameplay

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.760 
most content you get regarding gameplay
is<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.700> Akatsuki<00:03:11.570> one<00:03:11.750> because<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.350> Akatsuki

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
is the Akatsuki one because the Akatsuki

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.170 
is the Akatsuki one because the Akatsuki
one<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:12.950> think<00:03:13.070> is<00:03:13.280> like<00:03:13.400> four<00:03:13.610> or<00:03:13.670> five<00:03:13.730> battles

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180

this one is only two matches but a lot
of<00:03:24.560> good<00:03:24.770> story<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.370> then<00:03:25.520> the<00:03:25.580> third<00:03:25.760> one<00:03:25.940> I

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
of good story and then the third one I

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.010 
of good story and then the third one I
don't<00:03:26.180> even<00:03:26.420> think<00:03:26.570> there's<00:03:26.690> any<00:03:26.780> gameplay

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
don't even think there's any gameplay

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.590 
don't even think there's any gameplay
it's<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.650> thing<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.400> Kushina<00:03:28.880> is<00:03:29.270> basically

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
it's a thing of Kushina is basically

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.720 
it's a thing of Kushina is basically
like<00:03:29.780> an<00:03:29.900> OB<00:03:30.170> in<00:03:30.320> a<00:03:30.410> sense<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.770> Kushina<00:03:31.370> and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
like an OB in a sense of Kushina and

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.520 
like an OB in a sense of Kushina and
what<00:03:32.090> she<00:03:32.270> thought<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.510> OB<00:03:32.780> twice<00:03:33.050> a<00:03:33.080> child<00:03:33.380> and
