the wrong order but they go there's to

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.880 
the wrong order but they go there's to
do<00:06:25.640> lash<00:06:25.820> and<00:06:26.090> the<00:06:26.810> conical<00:06:27.229> ones<00:06:27.380> now<00:06:27.650> this

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790 
got because for two reasons they stop

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.670 
got because for two reasons they stop
making<00:06:32.000> the<00:06:32.090> model<00:06:32.330> lot<00:06:32.420> I've<00:06:32.540> got<00:06:32.810> and<00:06:33.110> also
