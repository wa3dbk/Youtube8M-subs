00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
preventable so with soft drinks you can

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.069 
preventable so with soft drinks you can

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
go to the diet soft drinks but the

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.550 
go to the diet soft drinks but the
acidity<00:03:12.829> or<00:03:13.099> the<00:03:13.400> pH<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:14.090> diet<00:03:14.690> coke<00:03:15.049> is<00:03:15.319> two

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
acidity or the pH of diet coke is two

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.470 
acidity or the pH of diet coke is two
point<00:03:15.920> seven<00:03:17.200> seven<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.560> normal<00:03:19.190> acidity<00:03:19.670> two

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
point seven seven is normal acidity two

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.740 
point seven seven is normal acidity two
point<00:03:20.780> seven<00:03:21.350> is<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.980> higher<00:03:22.519> acidity<00:03:23.000> than

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
point seven is a higher acidity than

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.900 
point seven is a higher acidity than
what<00:03:23.959> we<00:03:24.139> use<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.680> what<00:03:24.829> we<00:03:24.920> call<00:03:25.160> each<00:03:25.370> teeth

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
what we use to what we call each teeth

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.580 
what we use to what we call each teeth
before<00:03:26.239> we<00:03:26.540> bond<00:03:26.840> them<00:03:27.079> in<00:03:27.170> other<00:03:27.290> words<00:03:27.470> we

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
before we bond them in other words we

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.960 
before we bond them in other words we
want<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.799> roughen<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.190> surface<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.760> teeth

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
want to roughen the surface of teeth

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.349 
want to roughen the surface of teeth
before<00:03:29.269> we<00:03:29.420> bond<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.430> it's<00:03:31.430> not<00:03:31.609> that<00:03:31.819> acidic

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
before we bond and it's not that acidic

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.710 
before we bond and it's not that acidic
so<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.470> acidity<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.220> diet<00:03:34.549> coke<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:35.239> an<00:03:35.450> issue

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
so the acidity of diet coke is an issue

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.020 
so the acidity of diet coke is an issue
and<00:03:36.200> then<00:03:36.530> you<00:03:36.620> put<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.889> sugar<00:03:36.950> with<00:03:37.609> it<00:03:37.790> and

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
and then you put the sugar with it and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.240 
and then you put the sugar with it and
it's<00:03:38.750> really<00:03:38.900> like<00:03:39.139> battery<00:03:39.620> acid<00:03:39.799> on<00:03:40.069> your

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
it's really like battery acid on your

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.809 
it's really like battery acid on your
teeth<00:03:40.519> almost<00:03:40.790> it's<00:03:41.239> very<00:03:41.600> very<00:03:41.870> destructive

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
teeth almost it's very very destructive

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.150 
teeth almost it's very very destructive
