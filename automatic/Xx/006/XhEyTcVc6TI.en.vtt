thoughts on this and really where i'm

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.669 
thoughts on this and really where i'm
taking<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.960> look<00:00:12.990> at<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.380> how<00:00:13.500> does<00:00:13.620> this

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
taking a look at this is how does this

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.890

the lines here a bit i'll talk about
that<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.809> course<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.140> big<00:00:40.290> new<00:00:40.469> design

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
that but of course the big new design

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.580 
that but of course the big new design
here<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.700> ipad<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.960> thinner<00:00:43.230> so

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
here of the ipad is it is thinner so

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.680 
here of the ipad is it is thinner so
it's<00:00:43.739> actually<00:00:43.860> thinner<00:00:44.309> product<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.120> also

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
it's actually thinner product and also

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.600 
it's actually thinner product and also
it's<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.379> little<00:00:46.590> bit<00:00:46.739> smaller<00:00:47.100> has<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> little

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
it's a little bit smaller has a little

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.549 
it's a little bit smaller has a little
smaller<00:00:47.850> footprint<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.410> see

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
smaller footprint on it so you can see

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.229 
smaller footprint on it so you can see
the<00:00:49.680> edges<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:50.219> are<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> little<00:00:50.700> bit<00:00:50.940> thinner

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the edges here are a little bit thinner

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.529 
the edges here are a little bit thinner
there's<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> little<00:00:51.750> less<00:00:51.920> margin<00:00:53.030> around<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
there's a little less margin around the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810 
there's a little less margin around the
screen<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.530> side<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> also<00:00:56.699> it's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
screen here on the side and also it's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.310 
screen here on the side and also it's
lighter<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.480> together<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.870> makes<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
lighter and all together that makes it a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.500 
lighter and all together that makes it a
nice<00:00:58.500> product<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.730> hold<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.149> know<00:01:00.239> for

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
nice product to to hold you know for

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.750 
nice product to to hold you know for
that<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.829> bed<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.640> you're

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that you know in in bed and when you're

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.920 
that you know in in bed and when you're
reading<00:01:02.910> stuff<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.359> makes<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.629> much<00:01:03.750> more

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
reading stuff it makes it much more

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.329 
reading stuff it makes it much more
comfortable<00:01:04.350> yeah<00:01:04.650> kids<00:01:04.860> not<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.129> heavy

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
comfortable yeah kids not like heavy

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.039 
comfortable yeah kids not like heavy
heavy<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:05.880> when<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.119> hold<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> little

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
heavy but when you hold it for a little

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.630 
heavy but when you hold it for a little
while<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.409> does<00:01:07.590> start<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> little

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
while it does start to get a little

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640 
while it does start to get a little
heavy<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> i<00:01:09.840> think<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.140> does<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> nice

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
heavy and i think this does a nice

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.469 
heavy and i think this does a nice
improvement<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.390> I'm

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
improvement for that and you see I'm

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.030 
improvement for that and you see I'm

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
part of that is its smaller width wise

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.770 
part of that is its smaller width wise
but<00:01:23.580> also<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> lighter<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.299> know<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.540> feel<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
but also is lighter you know so feel a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.450 
but also is lighter you know so feel a
little<00:01:24.900> more<00:01:25.020> comfortable<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.340> is

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
little more comfortable on this this is

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.010 
little more comfortable on this this is
a<00:01:26.520> space<00:01:26.759> gray<00:01:27.030> I'm<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.689> kind<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
a space gray I'm you know I just kind of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.899 
a space gray I'm you know I just kind of
picked<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.290> matches<00:01:28.680> my<00:01:28.710> iphone<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.579> don't

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
picked that matches my iphone I don't

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:30.530 
picked that matches my iphone I don't
know<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.000> didn't<00:01:30.180> really<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.360> much<00:01:30.450> of

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
know I didn't really have much of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.929 
know I didn't really have much of
opinion<00:01:30.960> which<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:31.890> that's<00:01:32.729> this

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
opinion which one to get but that's this

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.490 
opinion which one to get but that's this
is<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.479> picked<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.290> get

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
is the one that I picked up you can get

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.730 
is the one that I picked up you can get
it<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.740> silver<00:01:35.040> also<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:37.470> that's<00:01:37.590> one

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
it in silver also and I think that's one

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.080 
it in silver also and I think that's one
of<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.829> biggest<00:01:38.040> advantages<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
of the biggest advantages here of the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
of the biggest advantages here of the
new<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.960> new<00:01:40.110> iPad<00:01:40.770> air<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
new one of the new iPad air but the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.340 
new one of the new iPad air but the
other<00:01:41.310> big<00:01:41.790> difference<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.479> a7<00:01:43.170> processor

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
other big difference is the a7 processor

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.590 
other big difference is the a7 processor
a7<00:01:44.130> processor<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.640> significantly<00:01:45.360> faster

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
a7 processor is significantly faster

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.950 
a7 processor is significantly faster
than<00:01:46.049> what<00:01:46.770> we<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.189> fortune<00:01:47.700> iPad<00:01:48.689> it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
than what we have in the fortune iPad it

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.679 
than what we have in the fortune iPad it
benchmarks<00:01:49.740> great<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.670> also<00:01:50.790> has<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.149> m7

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
benchmarks great and it also has the m7

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.929 
benchmarks great and it also has the m7
processor<00:01:52.170> which<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.220> interesting<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:53.700> I

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
processor which is interesting because I

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
processor which is interesting because I
could<00:01:54.390> really<00:01:54.479> see<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> m7<00:01:55.140> being<00:01:55.320> great<00:01:55.619> on

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
could really see the m7 being great on

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.170 
could really see the m7 being great on
the<00:01:56.070> iPhone<00:01:56.430> because<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> carry<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the iPhone because you carry with you

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.389 
the iPhone because you carry with you
all<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> time<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> records<00:01:58.680> all<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.219> that

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
all the time and it records all of that

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.459 
all the time and it records all of that
activity<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.600> don't<00:02:00.750> carry<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:01.049> iPad<00:02:01.320> with

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
activity you don't carry your iPad with

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.959 
activity you don't carry your iPad with
you<00:02:01.619> everywhere<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.159> interesting<00:02:02.399> what

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
you everywhere so it's interesting what

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.050 
you everywhere so it's interesting what
might<00:02:03.299> might<00:02:03.719> work<00:02:03.899> out<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:05.060> but

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
might might work out on this on that but

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.249 
might might work out on this on that but
the<00:02:06.180> big<00:02:06.329> thing<00:02:06.360> here<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.810> course<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the big thing here of course is the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.419 
the big thing here of course is the
processor<00:02:07.710> speed<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.160> don't<00:02:08.340> really

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
processor speed but I don't really

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.400 
processor speed but I don't really
notice<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.060> much<00:02:09.239> over<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.989> 4th<00:02:10.200> gen

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
notice it that much over the 4th gen

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.140 
notice it that much over the 4th gen
ipad<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.099> an<00:02:11.190> older<00:02:11.459> ipad<00:02:12.000> you're

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
ipad if you have an older ipad you're

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.430 
ipad if you have an older ipad you're
going<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> notice<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.780> more<00:02:12.959> but

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
going to notice it more but

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.100 
going to notice it more but
um<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:14.280> only<00:02:14.520> spot<00:02:14.730> i<00:02:14.790> really<00:02:15.210> noticed<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:15.930> and

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
um the only spot i really noticed it and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.540 
um the only spot i really noticed it and
it's<00:02:16.350> really<00:02:16.470> not<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.740> big<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.130> deal<00:02:17.280> is

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
it's really not that big of a deal is

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.150 
it's really not that big of a deal is
with<00:02:17.700> ios7<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.690> feel<00:02:19.230> like<00:02:19.320> Iowa<00:02:19.680> seven<00:02:20.040> you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
with ios7 I feel like Iowa seven you

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.190 
with ios7 I feel like Iowa seven you
know<00:02:20.190> right<00:02:20.460> now<00:02:20.640> anyways<00:02:21.090> was<00:02:21.360> 7<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.750> 0<00:02:21.840> 3<00:02:22.140> is

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
know right now anyways was 7 and 0 3 is

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.950 
know right now anyways was 7 and 0 3 is
that<00:02:22.380> we're<00:02:22.500> at<00:02:22.680> isn't<00:02:23.550> really<00:02:23.910> running<00:02:24.690> great

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
that we're at isn't really running great

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.930 
that we're at isn't really running great
on<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.170> ipad<00:02:25.530> i<00:02:25.560> think<00:02:25.920> it's<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.550> runs<00:02:26.760> much

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
on the ipad i think it's it runs much

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.670 
on the ipad i think it's it runs much
better<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.390> iphone<00:02:27.780> i<00:02:27.810> think<00:02:28.140> they<00:02:28.500> need

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
better on the iphone i think they need

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.920 
better on the iphone i think they need
another<00:02:29.010> another<00:02:29.400> update<00:02:30.060> for<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.390> ipad<00:02:30.750> and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
another another update for the ipad and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.600 
another another update for the ipad and
i<00:02:30.960> expect<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.380> we'll<00:02:31.530> get<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.800> here<00:02:32.010> then<00:02:32.490> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
i expect that we'll get it here then the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.370 
i expect that we'll get it here then the
not-too-distant<00:02:32.940> future<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:34.050> one<00:02:34.170> thing<00:02:34.320> I

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
not-too-distant future but one thing I

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.110 
not-too-distant future but one thing I
do<00:02:34.440> notice<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.370> does<00:02:35.520> seem<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> little<00:02:35.910> more

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
do notice is it does seem a little more

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.330 
do notice is it does seem a little more
responsive<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.680> doesn't<00:02:37.800> kind<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.130> leg

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
responsive it's it doesn't kind of leg

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.220 
responsive it's it doesn't kind of leg
it's<00:02:38.610> snappier<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.270> just<00:02:39.600> like<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.110> little

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
it's snappier and just like the little

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.470 
it's snappier and just like the little
spotlight<00:02:40.590> search<00:02:40.950> for<00:02:41.280> example<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.910> then

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
spotlight search for example and then

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.640 
spotlight search for example and then
when<00:02:42.570> you're<00:02:42.630> bringing<00:02:42.810> up<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.140> little<00:02:43.290> other

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
when you're bringing up the little other

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.620 
when you're bringing up the little other
sections<00:02:44.400> here<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.970> just<00:02:45.030> seems<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.450> flow

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
sections here it just seems the flow

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.150 
sections here it just seems the flow
better<00:02:45.810> seems<00:02:46.110> much<00:02:46.320> more<00:02:46.380> fluid<00:02:46.770> because<00:02:47.070> we

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
better seems much more fluid because we

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.340 
better seems much more fluid because we
have<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.370> much<00:02:47.460> more<00:02:47.520> horsepower<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.630> but

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
have so much more horsepower in this but

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.780 
have so much more horsepower in this but
again<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.590> expect<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:50.310> gonna<00:02:50.400> be<00:02:50.460> ironed

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
again I expect that it's gonna be ironed

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.670 
again I expect that it's gonna be ironed
out<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.090> future<00:02:51.420> version<00:02:51.630> apps<00:02:52.320> and

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
out in a future version apps and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.470 
out in a future version apps and
everything<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.070> seemed<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.400> be<00:02:53.520> pretty<00:02:54.270> much

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
everything that seemed to be pretty much

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.970 
everything that seemed to be pretty much

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
like oh wow this is so much faster or

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.930 
like oh wow this is so much faster or
even<00:02:58.140> using<00:02:58.410> any<00:02:58.530> apps<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.460> really<00:02:59.670> see<00:02:59.790> too

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
even using any apps so I really see too

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.430 
even using any apps so I really see too

example is infinity blade is an app that

example is infinity blade is an app that
that<00:03:15.000> really<00:03:15.210> takes<00:03:15.630> advantage<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.620> iPads

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
that really takes advantage of the iPads

and the iphones you know cpu and GPU and
all<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.330> think<00:03:22.080> that's<00:03:22.200> well<00:03:22.350> we'll<00:03:22.470> see

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
all that I think that's well we'll see

all that I think that's well we'll see
some<00:03:22.800> advantages<00:03:23.250> with<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:23.790> more

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
just kind of general a processing stuff

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.140 
just kind of general a processing stuff
you<00:03:28.770> could<00:03:28.890> do<00:03:28.980> an<00:03:29.100> iMovie<00:03:29.610> for<00:03:29.640> example

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
you could do an iMovie for example

you could do an iMovie for example
exporting<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.720> probably<00:03:30.989> realize<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:32.040> much

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
exporting you probably realize that much

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.280 
exporting you probably realize that much
more<00:03:32.430> than<00:03:32.610> just<00:03:32.640> watching<00:03:33.090> movies<00:03:33.570> or<00:03:33.870> videos

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
more than just watching movies or videos

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
or surfing around the web so speed I

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.479 
or surfing around the web so speed I
don't<00:03:36.870> think<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.080> too<00:03:37.230> big<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.560> deal<00:03:37.770> right

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
don't think is too big of a deal right

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
and now with this lighter design it's a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.220 
and now with this lighter design it's a
little<00:04:34.950> bit<00:04:35.040> smaller<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.820> thinner<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:36.540> feel

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
just me you know a lot of people may

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.450 
just me you know a lot of people may
think<00:04:42.420> differently<00:04:43.050> um<00:04:43.380> like<00:04:43.950> I<00:04:44.070> love<00:04:44.340> my

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
think differently um like I love my

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.950 
think differently um like I love my
macbook<00:04:44.850> air<00:04:45.000> for<00:04:45.030> example<00:04:45.570> it'd<00:04:45.780> probably

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
macbook air for example it'd probably

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.630 
macbook air for example it'd probably
make<00:04:46.140> more<00:04:46.260> sense<00:04:46.680> from<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:46.950> have<00:04:47.070> a<00:04:47.100> mini<00:04:47.340> and

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
make more sense from you have a mini and

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.060 
make more sense from you have a mini and
a<00:04:47.730> macbook<00:04:48.090> air<00:04:48.320> but<00:04:49.320> I<00:04:49.350> just<00:04:49.830> kind<00:04:50.040> of

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
a macbook air but I just kind of

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.620 
a macbook air but I just kind of
gravitate<00:04:50.550> towards<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:50.940> larger<00:04:51.210> screen<00:04:51.480> I

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
gravitate towards the larger screen I

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.990 
gravitate towards the larger screen I
always<00:04:51.870> liked<00:04:52.050> having<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.410> bigger<00:04:53.310> better

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
always liked having the bigger better

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.760 
always liked having the bigger better
approach<00:04:54.360> on<00:04:54.570> this<00:04:54.720> so<00:04:54.900> that's<00:04:55.380> just<00:04:55.470> kind<00:04:55.710> of

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
approach on this so that's just kind of

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.110 
approach on this so that's just kind of
me<00:04:55.920> on<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.040> really<00:04:56.460> decide<00:04:56.730> I<00:04:56.760> guess<00:04:56.970> what

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
me on that really decide I guess what

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.340 
me on that really decide I guess what
you're<00:04:57.240> looking<00:04:57.480> for<00:04:57.660> but<00:04:57.780> if<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.080> have<00:04:58.230> the

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
you're looking for but if you have the

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.870 
you're looking for but if you have the
fortune<00:04:58.560> iPad<00:04:59.130> not<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.460> whole<00:04:59.670> lot<00:04:59.820> of

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
fortune iPad not a whole lot of

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.540 
fortune iPad not a whole lot of
difference<00:05:00.060> in<00:05:00.450> speed<00:05:00.600> performance<00:05:01.410> at<00:05:02.370> least

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
difference in speed performance at least

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.100 
difference in speed performance at least
right<00:05:02.760> now<00:05:02.790> down<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.480> road<00:05:03.630> maybe<00:05:03.660> we'll<00:05:03.990> see

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
right now down the road maybe we'll see

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.050 
right now down the road maybe we'll see
some<00:05:04.260> stuff<00:05:04.440> with<00:05:04.590> apps<00:05:04.830> and<00:05:05.040> really<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.000> think

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
some stuff with apps and really I think

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.610 
some stuff with apps and really I think
