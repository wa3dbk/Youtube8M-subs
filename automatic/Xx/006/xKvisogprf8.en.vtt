organic material that they use and it's

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.440

actually<00:00:35.040> food<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.520> plants<00:00:35.610> but<00:00:36.090> it's<00:00:36.210> also

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
actually food for plants but it's also

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.540

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.600 
this one needs to be professionally
installed<00:00:54.710> mainly<00:00:55.710> because<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
installed mainly because you have to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.950

because<00:00:58.829> green<00:00:59.100> roofs<00:00:59.399> actually<00:00:59.910> store<00:01:00.210> water

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
because green roofs actually store water

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.100 
because green roofs actually store water
rather<00:01:00.840> than<00:01:01.079> sending<00:01:01.379> them<00:01:01.440> sewage<00:01:02.960> next<00:01:03.960> up
