00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
wanted to show you a Minecraft related

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.470 
wanted to show you a Minecraft related
tool<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:11.040> i've<00:00:11.280> been<00:00:11.309> using<00:00:11.730> quite<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> bit

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
tool that i've been using quite a bit

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.930 
tool that i've been using quite a bit
and<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.440> incredibly<00:00:13.920> useful<00:00:14.099> if<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.700> run

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
and that is incredibly useful if you run

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.300 
and that is incredibly useful if you run
a<00:00:15.179> server<00:00:15.599> or<00:00:15.900> if<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.650> play<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> server

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
a server or if you play on a server

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.680 
a server or if you play on a server
where<00:00:17.520> you're<00:00:17.609> working<00:00:17.730> with<00:00:18.029> other<00:00:18.330> people

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
where you're working with other people

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
where you're working with other people
and<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.900> want<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.350> plan<00:00:19.619> out<00:00:19.920> some<00:00:20.789> sort<00:00:21.029> of

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
and you want to plan out some sort of

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.620 
and you want to plan out some sort of
project<00:00:22.710> but<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.789> don't<00:00:23.970> want<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.420> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
project but you don't want to have to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.200 
project but you don't want to have to
build<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> game<00:00:25.670> you<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.910> make<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
build it in the game you can make a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.300 
build it in the game you can make a
classic<00:00:27.449> server<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.710> way<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
classic server but this way is just a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.040 
classic server but this way is just a
little<00:00:29.519> bit<00:00:29.699> quicker<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.150> lets<00:00:30.929> you

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
little bit quicker and lets you

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.450 
little bit quicker and lets you
experiment<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.619> bit<00:00:31.650> more<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> type<00:00:32.430> of

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
experiment a bit more with the type of

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.260 
experiment a bit more with the type of
blocks<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.300> find<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:34.170> SMP<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:36.059> what<00:00:36.180> this

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
blocks you can find in SMP so what this

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.100 
blocks you can find in SMP so what this
basically<00:00:36.510> else<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.680> really<00:00:38.010> simple

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
basically else is like I really simple

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.100 
basically else is like I really simple
computer<00:00:40.110> aided<00:00:40.620> design<00:00:41.210> program<00:00:42.210> thing<00:00:42.480> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
computer aided design program thing a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.720 
computer aided design program thing a
bit<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.739> complicated<00:00:44.250> ones<00:00:44.430> that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
bit like the complicated ones that

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.080 
bit like the complicated ones that
people<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.629> make<00:00:45.780> games<00:00:45.989> use<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:47.059> nice<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
people that make games use but nice and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.610 
people that make games use but nice and
simple<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.809> even<00:00:49.020> people<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.379> me<00:00:49.590> that

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
simple that even people like me that

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.799 
simple that even people like me that
can't<00:00:50.039> really<00:00:50.250> use<00:00:50.940> these<00:00:51.180> sort<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.390> programs

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
can't really use these sort of programs

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.750 
can't really use these sort of programs
can<00:00:52.110> figure<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.920> don't<00:00:53.520> know<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.670> it

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
can figure it out I don't know what it

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.520 
can figure it out I don't know what it
actually<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.809> some<00:00:55.230> sort<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.789> Japanese

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
actually is it's some sort of Japanese

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.380 
actually is it's some sort of Japanese
program<00:00:58.530> called<00:00:59.250> cube<00:00:59.550> kingdom<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.120> really

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
program called cube kingdom I really

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.470 
program called cube kingdom I really
looked<00:01:00.539> into<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.010> but<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.250> modded<00:01:03.030> for

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
looked into it but it was modded for

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.380 
looked into it but it was modded for
English<00:01:04.199> language<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.890> now<00:01:05.040> has<00:01:05.309> all<00:01:06.119> of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
English language so it now has all of

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.780 
English language so it now has all of
the<00:01:06.570> English<00:01:07.290> names<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.710> things<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.610> very

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the English names of things it's very

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.300 
the English names of things it's very
simple<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.240> use<00:01:09.860> basically<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.159> this

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
simple to use basically you have this

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.390 
simple to use basically you have this
starting<00:01:11.909> block<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.979> select

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
starting block here and you can select

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.609 
starting block here and you can select
any<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.390> blocks<00:01:15.720> from<00:01:15.869> minecraft<00:01:16.140> here

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
any of the blocks from minecraft here

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.370 
any of the blocks from minecraft here
now<00:01:17.520> these<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.970> textures<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:18.990> are<00:01:19.110> loaded

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
now these are textures that are loaded

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.090 
now these are textures that are loaded
in<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.509> program

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
in to the program

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.620 
in to the program
so<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:23.970> load<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.210> any<00:01:24.360> number<00:01:24.479> of

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
so you can load in any number of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
so you can load in any number of
textures<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.680> these<00:01:28.770> red<00:01:28.979> textures

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
textures so you have these red textures

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
textures so you have these red textures
that<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.580> default<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> game<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.810> those

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
that are default in the game and those

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.600 
that are default in the game and those
can<00:01:31.409> be<00:01:31.440> useful<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.190> mapping<00:01:32.430> out

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
can be useful just for mapping out

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.910 
can be useful just for mapping out
blocks<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:33.360> want<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
blocks if you really want to but the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.139 
blocks if you really want to but the
best<00:01:35.100> way<00:01:36.049> to<00:01:37.049> use<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.580> use<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
best way to use it is to just use the

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.719 
best way to use it is to just use the
Minecraft<00:01:39.659> ones<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.770> let's<00:01:41.369> say<00:01:41.580> we're

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
Minecraft ones so let's say we're

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.600 
Minecraft ones so let's say we're
building<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.180> small<00:01:42.659> house<00:01:42.930> out<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.289> wood<00:01:43.619> we

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
building a small house out of wood we

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.820 
building a small house out of wood we
can<00:01:44.820> put<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.049> like<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> build<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.820> up

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
can put it up like this and build it up

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.160 
can put it up like this and build it up
rotate<00:01:49.830> it<00:01:50.009> around<00:01:50.720> this<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.899> going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> be

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
rotate it around this is going to be

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.700 
rotate it around this is going to be
quite<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.350> rectangular<00:01:52.890> house<00:01:53.039> I'm<00:01:53.280> sorry<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
quite a rectangular house I'm sorry and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.249 
quite a rectangular house I'm sorry and
then<00:01:55.710> zeen<00:01:56.130> up<00:01:56.300> all<00:01:57.300> of<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.569> is<00:01:57.720> done<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:57.960> by

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
then zeen up all of this is done just by

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.160 
then zeen up all of this is done just by
dragging<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.740> mouse<00:01:59.119> it's<00:02:00.119> very<00:02:00.509> simple<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
dragging the mouse it's very simple and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.260

can<00:02:59.520> add<00:02:59.790> in<00:03:00.440> different<00:03:01.440> textures<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.430> we<00:03:02.520> can

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
can add in different textures so we can

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.390 
can add in different textures so we can
make<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:03.480> cabin<00:03:03.900> here<00:03:04.730> more<00:03:05.730> woody<00:03:07.400> some

with it that's one of the things you can
do<00:03:40.700> here<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:41.880> one<00:03:42.240> I<00:03:42.480> made<00:03:42.690> for<00:03:42.750> my<00:03:43.050> own<00:03:43.260> house

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
on the apogee game server as you can see

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.670 
on the apogee game server as you can see
I<00:03:47.670> don't<00:03:47.790> finish<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.600> roof<00:03:48.990> or<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.320> back<00:03:49.500> of

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
I don't finish the roof or the back of

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.730 
I don't finish the roof or the back of
it<00:03:49.770> because<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.310> didn't<00:03:50.700> really<00:03:50.880> need<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.740> go

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
it because I didn't really need to go

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.310 
it because I didn't really need to go
through<00:03:52.950> in<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.489> program<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.120> make<00:03:55.050> the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
through in this program and make the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.949 
through in this program and make the
entire<00:03:55.910> roof<00:03:56.910> because<00:03:57.570> I<00:03:57.630> knew<00:03:57.750> what<00:03:57.840> it's

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
entire roof because I knew what it's

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.420 
entire roof because I knew what it's
going<00:03:58.050> to<00:03:58.110> look<00:03:58.200> like<00:03:58.320> just<00:03:58.830> from<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.100> model

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
going to look like just from this model

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.800 
going to look like just from this model
so<00:03:59.850> you<00:03:59.910> don't<00:04:00.060> always<00:04:00.150> have<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:00.360> finish<00:04:00.540> it

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
so you don't always have to finish it

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.470 
so you don't always have to finish it
the<00:04:00.900> Frank<00:04:01.020> there's<00:04:02.010> took<00:04:02.220> me<00:04:02.340> about<00:04:02.520> 30

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
the Frank there's took me about 30

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.290 
the Frank there's took me about 30
minutes<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.140> do<00:04:04.320> in<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:06.510> program<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.170> about

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
minutes to do in this program and about

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.540 
minutes to do in this program and about
six<00:04:09.300> or<00:04:09.450> seven<00:04:09.570> hours<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.959> do<00:04:10.230> in<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.190> game<00:04:11.400> you

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
six or seven hours to do in the game you

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.850 
six or seven hours to do in the game you
couldn't<00:04:11.850> get<00:04:12.000> in<00:04:12.090> all<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.390> materials<00:04:12.870> and

I'm<00:04:14.340> quite<00:04:14.520> slow<00:04:14.730> builder<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.290> you've<00:04:16.290> got<00:04:16.320> a

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
I'm quite slow builder so you've got a

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.409 
I'm quite slow builder so you've got a

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
tree there for scale and as you can see

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.229 
tree there for scale and as you can see
it's<00:04:19.079> a<00:04:19.410> straight<00:04:20.160> round<00:04:20.340> it's<00:04:20.519> like<00:04:20.640> a<00:04:20.669> Tudor

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
it's a straight round it's like a Tudor

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.740 
it's a straight round it's like a Tudor
mansion<00:04:21.900> sort<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.470> thing<00:04:23.180> just<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.270> rough

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
design and anything that I wanted to

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.700

the<00:04:28.740> scale<00:04:29.130> right<00:04:29.340> in<00:04:29.580> here<00:04:29.940> first<00:04:30.270> without

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
the scale right in here first without

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.480 
the scale right in here first without
having<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:30.930> worry<00:04:31.140> too<00:04:31.380> much<00:04:31.410> about<00:04:31.530> messing

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
having to worry too much about messing

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.370 
having to worry too much about messing
up<00:04:32.610> in<00:04:32.760> Minecraft<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.450> evil<00:04:33.750> wasted<00:04:34.260> and

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
up in Minecraft and the evil wasted and

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.680 
up in Minecraft and the evil wasted and
resources<00:04:34.770> are<00:04:34.890> just<00:04:35.040> wasting<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.430> lot<00:04:35.520> of<00:04:35.580> time

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
resources are just wasting a lot of time

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.360 
resources are just wasting a lot of time
so<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:36.720> thought<00:04:36.960> I'd<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.350> throw<00:04:37.860> this<00:04:38.070> one<00:04:38.100> up

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
so I thought I'd and throw this one up

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.430 
so I thought I'd and throw this one up
as<00:04:38.580> it's<00:04:38.880> such<00:04:39.000> an<00:04:39.120> incredibly<00:04:39.870> useful<00:04:40.050> tool
