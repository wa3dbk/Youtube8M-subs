real thick double zipper on the outside
all<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.740> way<00:01:52.829> around<00:01:53.240> on<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.299> top<00:01:54.689> you've<00:01:54.840> got

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
all the way around on the top you've got

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.840 
all the way around on the top you've got
a<00:01:54.990> nice<00:01:55.170> strong<00:01:55.470> handle<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.219> another<00:01:56.610> little

a nice strong handle and another little

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.010 
a nice strong handle and another little
bit<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.030> padding<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.390> which<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.719> did<00:01:57.899> myself

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
bit of padding here which I did myself

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.590 
bit of padding here which I did myself
reason<00:01:58.979> being<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.310> because<00:01:59.430> the<00:02:00.180> actual<00:02:00.420> bob

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
reason being is because the actual bob

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.990 
reason being is because the actual bob
trailer<00:02:00.960> put<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.350> any<00:02:01.530> dropouts<00:02:02.490> are<00:02:02.820> quite

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
trailer put in any dropouts are quite

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.090 
trailer put in any dropouts are quite
tight<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> top<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:03.990> bag<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.439> thought

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
tight on the top of the bag I thought

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.499 
tight on the top of the bag I thought
they've<00:02:05.280> been<00:02:05.430> probably<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.090> little<00:02:06.210> bit<00:02:06.390> more

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
they've been probably a little bit more

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.779 
they've been probably a little bit more
room<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.899> there<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.920> will<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.310> about<00:02:08.580> go

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
room in there but it will just about go

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.130 
room in there but it will just about go
in<00:02:08.869> there<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> shoulder<00:02:10.440> strap<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.709> comes

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
in there is a shoulder strap that comes

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.570 
in there is a shoulder strap that comes
