00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and bad lighting and things like that

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.899 
and bad lighting and things like that
and<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> wanted<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> kind<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.130> all<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.880> same

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
and I wanted to kind of all be the same

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.260 
and I wanted to kind of all be the same
quality<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:55.890> didn't<00:01:56.700> make<00:01:56.820> videos<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.180> this

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
channel for a few different reasons for

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.740 
channel for a few different reasons for
a<00:01:59.250> little<00:01:59.490> while<00:01:59.640> mainly<00:02:00.119> because<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.630> was

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
a little while mainly because I just was

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.330 
a little while mainly because I just was
a<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:00.960> bit<00:02:01.079> unmotivated<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:02.009> make<00:02:02.159> them

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
a little bit unmotivated to make them

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.490 
a little bit unmotivated to make them
but<00:02:03.180> also<00:02:03.750> because<00:02:04.680> um<00:02:05.990> how<00:02:06.990> do<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.140> put<00:02:07.320> this

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
but also because um how do I put this

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.169 
but also because um how do I put this
and<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:08.160> didn't<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:08.759> know<00:02:08.910> where<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> go

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
and things like that and it was kind of

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.730 
and things like that and it was kind of
about<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.720> getting<00:02:52.870> healthier<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.440> getting

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
fit and everything and I felt like this

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.230 
fit and everything and I felt like this
video<00:02:57.010> became<00:02:57.340> more<00:02:57.520> like<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.790> weight<00:02:58.000> loss

video became more like a weight loss

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.360 
video became more like a weight loss
thing<00:02:58.480> rather<00:02:58.720> than<00:02:59.050> being<00:02:59.470> healthy<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.220> just

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
thing rather than being healthy and just

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.250 
thing rather than being healthy and just
like<00:03:00.610> healthy<00:03:01.240> living<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.660> lifestyle<00:03:02.080> and

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
discussing things like that and also

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.700 
discussing things like that and also
because<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:07.540> did<00:03:07.780> use<00:03:07.990> Weight<00:03:08.170> Watchers<00:03:08.200> for<00:03:08.530> a

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.400 
because I did use Weight Watchers for a
little<00:03:08.920> bit<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.160> shift<00:03:09.370> away<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:10.050> I<00:03:11.050> felt<00:03:11.320> like

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
little bit to shift away and I felt like

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.930 
little bit to shift away and I felt like
it<00:03:11.530> also<00:03:11.650> became<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.010> Weight<00:03:12.220> Watchers<00:03:12.250> Channel
