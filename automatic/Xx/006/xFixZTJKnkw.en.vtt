00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.070 

I<00:00:01.220> think<00:00:02.220> in<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.610> end<00:00:02.639> there<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.000> one<00:00:03.840> thing

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080

that has been to certain extent blown
out<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:07.319> proportion<00:00:07.919> in<00:00:08.550> some<00:00:08.760> way<00:00:08.880> because

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
out of proportion in some way because

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.320 
out of proportion in some way because
this<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.410> certainly<00:00:10.800> not<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.190> personal<00:00:12.150> matter
