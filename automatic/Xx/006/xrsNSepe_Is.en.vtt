00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
great things but I know a lot of people

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.180 
great things but I know a lot of people
complain<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.690> lot<00:02:21.930> about<00:02:22.110> work<00:02:22.500> rates<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.100> in

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
complain a lot about work rates and in

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.250 
complain a lot about work rates and in
being<00:02:23.370> out<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.700> position<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.240> sometimes<00:02:25.110> I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
being out of position and sometimes I

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.230 
being out of position and sometimes I
think<00:02:25.440> people<00:02:25.560> are<00:02:25.710> just<00:02:25.860> hating<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.370> don't

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
think people are just hating I don't

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.090 
think people are just hating I don't
think<00:02:27.330> work<00:02:27.630> rates<00:02:27.870> are<00:02:28.110> quite<00:02:28.470> as<00:02:28.650> important

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
think work rates are quite as important

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.710 
think work rates are quite as important
as<00:02:29.160> we<00:02:29.280> get<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> sweaty<00:02:29.790> alert<00:02:30.090> goal<00:02:30.300> there<00:02:30.540> from

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
as we get a sweaty alert goal there from

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.570 
as we get a sweaty alert goal there from
Russell<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.320> don't<00:02:31.920> think<00:02:31.980> work<00:02:32.220> rates<00:02:32.430> are

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
Russell I don't think work rates are

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.190 
Russell I don't think work rates are
quite<00:02:32.730> as<00:02:32.880> important<00:02:33.300> as<00:02:33.360> people<00:02:33.540> emphasize

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
quite as important as people emphasize

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.680 
quite as important as people emphasize
this<00:02:35.010> year<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.340> FIFA<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.850> know<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.150> they<00:02:36.570> are

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
this year in FIFA I know that they are

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.150 
this year in FIFA I know that they are
important<00:02:37.170> they'll<00:02:37.290> get<00:02:37.410> me<00:02:37.500> wrong<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.890> agree

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
important they'll get me wrong I agree

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.580 
important they'll get me wrong I agree
with<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:39.210> positioning<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.020> still<00:02:40.380> very

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
with that but positioning is still very

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.430 
with that but positioning is still very
relevant<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.400> some<00:02:42.120> players<00:02:42.360> naturally<00:02:42.990> fall

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
relevant and some players naturally fall

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.890 
relevant and some players naturally fall
in<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:43.860> out<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.010> position<00:02:44.540> positions<00:02:45.540> easier

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
in and out of position positions easier

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.510 
in and out of position positions easier
than<00:02:46.050> others<00:02:46.140> Cavani<00:02:46.770> may<00:02:47.010> track<00:02:47.280> back<00:02:47.490> a
