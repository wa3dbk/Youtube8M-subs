00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 zherlitsa very ancient tackle known 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.719
 she has since time immemorial and is 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.389
 time she was different and all 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.360
 constructions tested practices and today 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.340
 work fine but like they all have 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.340
 both its strengths and weaknesses 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:28.230
 Today we fish on the same on zherlitsy 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.300
 the words to get fat went precisely from ancient 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.610
 ways of catching, that is, such here 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.219
 flyers that is actually zherlitsy 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.379
 called exactly flyer tackle itself 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:46.590
 this is more modern designs 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.840
 which is this quite fresh this 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.340
 homemade it is underwater that is 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.320
 ice dock as a separate category 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.710
 because they astana you are inserted into 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:01.680
 mostly overnight for a few days and their 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.660
 become where they already know the places and people 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.850
 knows where they will leave falling asleep with snow and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.799
 only you can then find her even 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.290
 other people who can catch around 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.350
 fish on no stumble 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.320
 it's almost impossible to catch a fish 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.780
 can all of them 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.790
 The issue of convenience The main two conditions are 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.420
 so that the live bait doesnâ€™t fall for chips and after 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.950
 bite free gathering of fishing line 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:36.420
 other conditions are secondary and not only 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:40.470
 For convenience, for example, the head of a toyota 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.560
 sonnets I really do not like them in the first place 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.509
 they are uncomfortable when i'm going they 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.500
 built decay it all starts 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.500
 hang out and get confused 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.850
 then feet 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.619
 often when the pike starts to pull out 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.560
 side to side they are in the market just 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.280
 add up and she leaves just together 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.280
 with a pike there 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.009
 nothing in the box that is normally live bait 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:14.050
 can be quite large on it landmarks at 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.390
 poklevke she still turns over often 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.820
 that is, due to the fact that the gods are light and 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.500
 she bounces and rolls over 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.500
 then I can pike too well 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.560
 next we have homemade ie here 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.830
 the only thing that does not save is that 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.780
 pretty tight flag we can attach 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.380
 rather large falls on not somewhere 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.540
 weak 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.630
 that is which is very convenient on large 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.620
 the depths of early winter 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.480
 that is, 1 on the ice and in the deaf 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.080
 Do she have Russian with the wind often 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.840
 falls 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.270
 I'll put a good box pretty big 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.130
 his color is very good you can see it on 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.090
 light ice is good on dark of course 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.310
 Seen badly iron coil she, too, 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.030
 often freezing cold and very 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.060
 soft wood often fishing line over here in 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.860
 tree bump naturally pike after 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.860
 this feeling of gravity throws live bait 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.430
 and further from it closes pretty 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.310
 most of the hole and so all the same 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.129
 well so freezes 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.840
 when it's snowing and not falling asleep and even 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.019
 if you get a lot of sleep it was all the same 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:43.170
 you can find what is not convenient for me 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:48.010
 and the design is not very comfortable 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:51.940
 Granovsky turns out and this is all if 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.280
 their 10 is already a decent weight and sometimes 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.099
 fishing has to go and kilometers 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.260
 2 to the place here today we are about two 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.890
 kilometers passed to stupidly catch him 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.890
 good fish 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.540
 farther here is a more modern purchased 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.540
 stumblers 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.239
 tass here is a nice rather tall box 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.630
 resistant fabric can be seen both on dark 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.320
 the ice 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.570
 so in the snow it can be clearly seen that is 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.140
 went into a rather large one but i would do 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.710
 To be honest, it's even bigger, that is, it does not 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.920
 when the coil pokes up everything 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.590
 fasten separately it's all laid out 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.900
 bucket and 20 pieces bucket is very convenient 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.460
 well, let's say one of the drawbacks 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:49.990
 this is what this stand is 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.330
 breaks coil unbreakable is good 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.880
 because if curling over here 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.160
 the plan of the fishing reel 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.080
 never knock then each other bags 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.610
 and very often the coil breaks and 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.770
 then you have to redo the light 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.640
 zherlitsu home and already fishing or 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.640
 can not be used 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:14.740
 convenient that the coil itself is so 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.450
 buns for them you can catch wounds in 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.940
 second when we approach and see what 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.920
 pike was shaking in was somewhere for this 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.920
 holes we see how she shakes 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:36.029
 here is also a modern zovat that amount 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.339
 close the hole 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.680
 that is, what is the difference between closed 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:44.879
 uncovered hole if i put here 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.279
 same street at -10 and leave for the night and 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:51.389
 in the morning I will come I will have about two 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:53.270
 centimeters to freezing cheval yes bitch 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.919
 pull a maximum of half a centimeter 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.599
 painless centimeter already spit 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.900
 spit out live bait on feel this 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:03.599
 severity that is if the market is closed 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.129
 if it is loudly shut after 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.139
 -10 night stand 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:10.050
 I'll come pick up this plastic 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:13.919
 progul so well the foot there is growing 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.139
 literally a few millimeters that is 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:20.399
 we have more chances are the amount of pike 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:23.189
 I'll catch an attack on a rather tall husband 

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:25.770
 it is very difficult to put snow on that wall 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:26.899
 and still we find her coil not 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.029
 falls out 

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:35.430
 the only thing she has sometimes with 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:37.139
 poklevke jumps out the box here this 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.029
 there she seems to be charged 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.029
 from afar do not need it to work
