00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.080
 good to all this is going to be my first 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.960
 review is about the deluxe gamer keyboard 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.870
 of 9 what I bought in the express has 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.790
 cost about 30 euros a little more and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.169
 It has come to me as it was wrapped in 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.489
 typical bubble envelope of the Chinese and 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:23.289
 sufficiently packed but in this 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:26.750
 case I have good conditions 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:30.350
 then simply a plastic 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.640
 It weighs about 500 grams a pound 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 that the heavy and 500 6 grams for 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.579
 make that trunk included 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.410
 the cable is one meter 70 it 's pretty 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.470
 well we are going to have problems for 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.560
 connect it to the computer 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.550
 and we start 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:53.210
 the keys of the membrane keyboard is not 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.640
 mechanical for the price that we have not 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.060
 let's find no mechanic or 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.280
 far 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.990
 it is not configurable it does not have software 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 own then the only thing we're going to 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.190
 have is the keys that puts everything here 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.930
 in each game you will have to change the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.650
 game to adapt it to the keyboard and not to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.350
 reverse all your fault and I think it's a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.130
 pretty big bug but also good 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.130
 for the price that we have 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:25.150
 keyboard I enter the keys do not have 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.540
 a lot of travel and they are like curves 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.020
 that improves the economy a bit 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:38.440
 everything on the four red keys has 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:41.770
 two spaces actually this space 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.800
 are changed we see that here the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.980
 keys should tie but good and other 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.470
 small row we 're going 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:56.090
 the model button what it does is that it changes 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.420
 the s wv like staying using 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.400
 the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.030
 the little arrows the crosspiece of the part 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.700
 right of the keyboard 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.860
 has on this side the home button that 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.289
 It brings me to the desktop button 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.990
 control the backlighting that in 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.500
 this case is blue I do not know if there is more 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.550
 colors 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.550
 came keys 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.750
 button this volume - and multi all 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.780
 work perfectly in windows 8.1 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.450
 these rubber surfaces in hard coma 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.450
 but it's not uncomfortable due to the callus 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.719
 of the wrist and little else 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.239
 I've tried it with the pate filtres va 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:44.810
 pretty good although it bothers me a little 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.069
 that the control key has been changed and 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.340
 I had to configure it within the 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.500
 game 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.970
 I have to try it in the place that is not 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.159
 I piss it off maybe it's a little bit more 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.900
 uncomfortable about the issue of numbers 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.799
 it seems that they are close but in reality 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.799
 it costs to give 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.440
 and little more in my opinion without having 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.690
 tried a lot I think that for 30 euros there 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.770
 it's bad especially to fidget if 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.720
 you are like me what I have that has the 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.940
 trust and me out there 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.160
 in the bottom that we have seen 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.410
 It has rubber studs that are quite 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.630
 well do not move on with the weight that 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.130
 has does not move detail of 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.130
 hitman that subsist title 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.430
 good 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.890
 a little more I decided to upload the review 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.730
 because at the time when I went to 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.800
 buy my mom and in Spanish and although not 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.210
 There is a lot to say but know that no 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.550
 you have configurable eyes that you have 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.940
 a couple of details to improve though 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.060
 well it's pretty good 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.920
 and then I see it well if you have any 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.740
 questions or something to make a comment and 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.070
 I will try to solve it and nothing else 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.070
 Thank you
