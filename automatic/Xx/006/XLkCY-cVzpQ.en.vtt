00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
energy starting to brew here because we

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.730 
energy starting to brew here because we
have<00:01:38.670> mercury<00:01:39.270> which<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.810> still<00:01:39.960> retrograding

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
and it's in aquarius so if you really

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.749 
and it's in aquarius so if you really
think<00:01:42.689> about<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.159> odd<00:01:44.460> we

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759
