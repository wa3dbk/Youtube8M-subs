00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.770 
think that I would probably be someone
who<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.250> likely<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:48.030> break<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.390> window<00:01:48.720> to

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
who is more likely to break a window to

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.600 
who is more likely to break a window to
save<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> dog<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.680> thought<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> was<00:01:50.070> necessary

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
save a dog if I thought it was necessary

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.039 
save a dog if I thought it was necessary
and<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.070> uh<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:54.060> don't<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.020> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
and you know uh I don't have that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.170 
and you know uh I don't have that
attitude<00:01:55.380> where<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.100> know<00:01:56.219> if<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.759> your<00:01:56.969> dog

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
attitude where you know if it's your dog

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.590 
attitude where you know if it's your dog
if<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.810> know<00:01:58.350> let<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.009> die<00:01:59.189> III<00:02:00.000> don't<00:02:00.270> think<00:02:00.540> I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
if you know let it die III don't think I

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.330 
if you know let it die III don't think I
could<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.409> other<00:02:01.530> reaction<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.219> this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
could do that the other reaction to this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.249 
could do that the other reaction to this
has<00:02:02.549> been<00:02:02.729> will<00:02:03.000> hold<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.360> second<00:02:03.780> now<00:02:04.200> you

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
has been will hold on a second now you

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.840 
has been will hold on a second now you
could<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.890> people<00:02:05.040> breaking<00:02:05.549> into

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
could just have people breaking into

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.600 
could just have people breaking into
cars<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.600> saying<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.740> uh<00:02:07.950> taking

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
cars and saying and and uh taking

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.630 
cars and saying and and uh taking
valuables<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.660> then<00:02:10.379> saying<00:02:10.830> oh<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.430> don't

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
valuables and then saying oh I don't

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.860 
valuables and then saying oh I don't
know<00:02:11.790> anything<00:02:12.000> about<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.300> valuables<00:02:12.720> being

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
know anything about the valuables being

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.500 
know anything about the valuables being
gone<00:02:13.050> I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
gone I

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.660 
gone I
just<00:02:13.629> got<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:13.989> here<00:02:14.260> because<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.769> dog<00:02:15.040> but

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
just got in here because of the dog but

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.479 
just got in here because of the dog but
I<00:02:15.849> think<00:02:15.909> the<00:02:16.120> idea<00:02:16.209> of<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.680> stipulations

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
I think the idea of the the stipulations

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.250 
I think the idea of the the stipulations
is<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.790> prevent<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.329> right<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.750> have<00:02:19.989> to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
is to prevent that right you have to

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.530 
is to prevent that right you have to
first<00:02:20.799> look<00:02:21.069> for<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.340> owner<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.879> then

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
first look for the owner and then

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.809 
first look for the owner and then
already<00:02:23.049> have<00:02:23.319> notified<00:02:23.860> law<00:02:23.920> enforcement

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
already have notified law enforcement

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.729 
already have notified law enforcement
and<00:02:25.000> yes<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.450> could<00:02:25.599> probably<00:02:25.959> game<00:02:26.470> the

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
and yes you could probably game the

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.319 
and yes you could probably game the
system<00:02:26.980> in<00:02:27.310> some<00:02:27.579> way<00:02:27.760> where<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.150> not

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
system in some way where it's not

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.539 
system in some way where it's not
totally<00:02:28.840> clear<00:02:29.019> that<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:29.920> actually<00:02:30.129> took<00:02:30.489> a

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
totally clear that you actually took a

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.130 
totally clear that you actually took a
wallet<00:02:31.120> or<00:02:31.150> something<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.629> was<00:02:31.750> in<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.930> car

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
wallet or something that was in the car

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.259 
wallet or something that was in the car
but<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.650> think<00:02:32.890> for<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.129> most<00:02:33.489> part<00:02:33.700> it's<00:02:34.120> gonna

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
but I think for the most part it's gonna

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.990 
but I think for the most part it's gonna
be<00:02:34.450> pretty<00:02:34.599> tough<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.959> have<00:02:35.430> persistent<00:02:36.430> theft

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
be pretty tough to have persistent theft

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.009 
be pretty tough to have persistent theft
as<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.480> result<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:38.440> law<00:02:39.299> yeah<00:02:40.299> I<00:02:40.329> think<00:02:40.569> it

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
as a result of this law yeah I think it

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.929 
as a result of this law yeah I think it
seems<00:02:41.409> like<00:02:41.650> they<00:02:41.799> have<00:02:41.980> established<00:02:42.370> a

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
seems like they have established a

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.569 
seems like they have established a
reasonable<00:02:43.840> framework<00:02:44.290> here<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.829> I<00:02:45.280> don't

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
reasonable framework here and I don't

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.890 
reasonable framework here and I don't
see<00:02:45.849> really<00:02:46.420> don't<00:02:46.629> see<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:46.900> being<00:02:46.959> abused
