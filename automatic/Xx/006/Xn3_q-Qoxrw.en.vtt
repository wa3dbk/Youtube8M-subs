increase<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:29.060> pressure<00:01:29.450> yeah<00:01:30.430> that's<00:01:31.430> what<00:01:31.640> I

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
increase in pressure yeah that's what I

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.640 
increase in pressure yeah that's what I
thought<00:01:31.790> too<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:32.810> they<00:01:32.990> got<00:01:33.140> me<00:01:33.229> thinking<00:01:33.619> that

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
thought too so they got me thinking that

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.080 
thought too so they got me thinking that
I<00:01:33.800> should<00:01:33.830> check<00:01:34.160> his<00:01:34.310> epithelial<00:01:34.880> cells

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
I should check his epithelial cells

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.340 
I should check his epithelial cells
around<00:01:35.270> his<00:01:35.420> head<00:01:35.570> for<00:01:35.780> any<00:01:35.869> country<00:01:36.200> coupe

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
all I found was the pulmonary contusion

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.620 
all I found was the pulmonary contusion
that<00:01:40.369> was<00:01:40.460> behind<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.880> edema<00:01:41.119> fluid<00:01:41.330> and

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
that was behind the edema fluid and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.120 
that was behind the edema fluid and
blood<00:01:41.720> in<00:01:41.960> his<00:01:42.080> lungs<00:01:42.110> however<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:42.979> was

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
blood in his lungs however that was

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.890 
blood in his lungs however that was
exactly<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.729> clue<00:01:43.970> i<00:01:44.000> needed<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.660> realize

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
exactly the clue i needed to realize

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.750 
exactly the clue i needed to realize
that<00:01:44.960> carotid<00:01:45.650> artery<00:01:45.920> was<00:01:46.100> covered<00:01:46.400> in<00:01:46.460> hilt

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
that carotid artery was covered in hilt

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.250 
that carotid artery was covered in hilt
marks<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:47.240> suggests<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.750> cause<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.020> death

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
marks that suggests the cause of death

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.170 
marks that suggests the cause of death
was<00:01:48.740> from<00:01:48.860> an<00:01:49.010> incision<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.640> epidermal

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
was from an incision to the epidermal

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.700 
was from an incision to the epidermal
layer<00:01:50.330> of<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.570> skin<00:01:50.750> all<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.290> way<00:01:51.440> through

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
layer of the skin all the way through

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.530 
layer of the skin all the way through
the<00:01:51.740> perivascular<00:01:52.220> tissue<00:01:52.790> to<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.240> occipital

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
the perivascular tissue to the occipital

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.420 
the perivascular tissue to the occipital
bone<00:01:53.900> connecting<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.500> back<00:01:54.710> of<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:54.979> cranium

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
bone connecting the back of the cranium

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.390 
bone connecting the back of the cranium
so<00:01:56.410> he<00:01:57.410> did<00:01:57.650> exactly<00:01:59.800> is<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:00.950> possible<00:02:01.370> to

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
so he did exactly is it possible to

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.680 
so he did exactly is it possible to
figure<00:02:01.640> out<00:02:01.730> by<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.910> wound<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:02.270> exactly

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
figure out by the wound just exactly

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.450 
figure out by the wound just exactly
whose<00:02:03.050> large<00:02:03.320> weapon<00:02:03.770> hammer<00:02:04.010> type<00:02:04.280> thing

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
whose large weapon hammer type thing

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.620 
whose large weapon hammer type thing
like<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.700> one<00:02:04.820> I'm<00:02:04.940> carrying<00:02:05.330> killed<00:02:05.540> this

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
like the one I'm carrying killed this

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.470 
like the one I'm carrying killed this
man<00:02:05.840> of<00:02:06.320> course<00:02:06.760> but<00:02:07.760> that<00:02:07.940> is<00:02:08.090> if<00:02:08.239> he<00:02:08.330> was

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.480 
man of course but that is if he was

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.570 
man of course but that is if he was
actually<00:02:08.660> killed<00:02:09.140> by<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.440> blunt<00:02:09.739> weapon<00:02:09.920> what

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
actually killed by a blunt weapon what

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.670 
actually killed by a blunt weapon what
do<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.700> mean<00:02:10.880> getting<00:02:11.750> killed<00:02:12.110> by<00:02:12.350> a<00:02:12.380> blunt

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
do you mean getting killed by a blunt

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.460 
do you mean getting killed by a blunt
weapon<00:02:12.950> seems<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.580> cut<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:13.910> dry<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.230> took<00:02:15.320> a

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
weapon seems to cut and dry so I took a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.900 
weapon seems to cut and dry so I took a
sample<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.860> found<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.130> he<00:02:16.310> had<00:02:16.340> has<00:02:16.700> this

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
sample and found that he had has this

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.699 
sample and found that he had has this
permian<00:02:17.420> right<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:18.080> inflammation<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.680> the

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
permian right the inflammation of the

the<00:02:52.120> glute<00:02:52.870> machine<00:02:53.640> nye<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:55.150> even<00:02:55.360> real

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
the glute machine nye is that even real

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.600 
the glute machine nye is that even real
not<00:02:56.140> only<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.560> real<00:02:56.830> but<00:02:57.099> he<00:02:57.190> discovered
