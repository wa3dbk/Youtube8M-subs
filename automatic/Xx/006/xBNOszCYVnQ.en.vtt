00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
alright here's a another update video on

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.230 
alright here's a another update video on
the<00:00:03.030> Jacobson<00:00:03.600> lawn<00:00:03.810> king<00:00:04.730> short<00:00:05.730> if<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.060> saw

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
the Jacobson lawn king short if you saw

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.480 
the Jacobson lawn king short if you saw
my<00:00:06.390> other<00:00:06.420> video<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:07.710> run<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.040> shortly<00:00:08.309> out

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
my other video of it run and shortly out

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.430 
my other video of it run and shortly out
there<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.670> shut<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.000> video<00:00:09.120> off<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.900> was<00:00:10.230> mowin

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
there I shut the video off I was mowin

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.370 
there I shut the video off I was mowin
with<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:10.969> the<00:00:11.969> engine<00:00:12.300> lost<00:00:12.540> all<00:00:12.780> power<00:00:12.990> then

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
with it the engine lost all power then

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.829 
with it the engine lost all power then
it<00:00:13.920> just<00:00:14.130> died<00:00:14.670> completely<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.509> checked<00:00:15.780> for

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
it just died completely so I checked for

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.800 
it just died completely so I checked for
spark<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.470> didn't<00:00:16.770> have<00:00:16.949> any<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.750> so<00:00:18.750> I

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
spark and it didn't have any and so I

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.040 
spark and it didn't have any and so I
had<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.320> take<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.090> old<00:00:21.090> coil<00:00:21.330> up<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.779> put<00:00:21.930> it

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
had to take the old coil up and put it

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.140 
had to take the old coil up and put it
in<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.380> West<00:00:22.769> one<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.220> had<00:00:23.490> an<00:00:23.670> eight<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.000> now

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
in a West one that I had an eight so now

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.089 
in a West one that I had an eight so now
it's<00:00:24.300> up<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.660> running<00:00:24.750> great<00:00:25.170> again<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.920> nice

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
it's up and running great again the nice

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.160 
it's up and running great again the nice
hot<00:00:26.789> spark<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:28.130> so<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.550> thought<00:00:30.539> I'd<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
hot spark and so I thought I'd do a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.049 
hot spark and so I thought I'd do a
little<00:00:31.260> walk<00:00:31.920> around<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.369> bit<00:00:32.520> which<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.820> didn't

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
little walk around a bit which I didn't

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.700 
little walk around a bit which I didn't
really<00:00:33.390> do<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.660> other<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.680> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
really do in the other one and do a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.709 
really do in the other one and do a
little<00:00:34.920> explanation<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.640> power<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:36.360> how<00:00:36.600> it

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
little explanation of power of how it

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.180 
little explanation of power of how it
works<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.879> this<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> throw<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.840> here<00:00:40.260> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
works so this is a throw out here that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.880 
works so this is a throw out here that
you<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.520> engage<00:00:42.510> right<00:00:43.020> now<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.590> reel<00:00:43.860> is

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
you can engage right now the reel is

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.100 
you can engage right now the reel is
engaged<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> move<00:00:45.930> this

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
engaged but you can if you move this

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.930 
engaged but you can if you move this
lever<00:00:46.350> over<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> side<00:00:47.129> disengages<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
lever over to the side disengages the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.270 
lever over to the side disengages the
reel<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.750> engage<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.800> drive<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
reel so when you engage the drive it

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.310 
reel so when you engage the drive it
just<00:00:50.489> drives<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.360> mower<00:00:51.539> without<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> reel

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
just drives the mower without the reel

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.110 
just drives the mower without the reel
spinning<00:00:52.860> at<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> same<00:00:53.190> time<00:00:53.610> which<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.820> kind

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
spinning at the same time which is kind

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.040 
spinning at the same time which is kind
of<00:00:54.149> nice<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:56.390> I'll<00:00:57.390> show<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> how<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
of nice and I'll show you the how the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.290 
of nice and I'll show you the how the
throttle<00:00:58.620> where<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.160> sits<00:00:59.340> at<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.879> throttle

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
throttle where it sits at the throttle

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.970 
throttle where it sits at the throttle
is<00:01:00.359> basically<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.140> wheel<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.649> turn

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
is basically just a wheel that you turn

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.479 
is basically just a wheel that you turn
back<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.399> forth<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
back and forth like that and this is the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.850 
back and forth like that and this is the
drive<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.970> course<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.689> lock<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.530> out<00:01:07.680> or

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
drive of course you can lock it out or

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.440 
drive of course you can lock it out or
just<00:01:07.890> hold<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:09.200> move<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.380> mower<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.450> this

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
just hold it to move the mower and this

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.530 
just hold it to move the mower and this
is<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.530> caster<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.850> replaced<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
is that that caster that I replaced the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
is that that caster that I replaced the
original<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.040> steel<00:01:17.430> wheel

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
original is actually just a steel wheel

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.510 
original is actually just a steel wheel
and<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.710> kind<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.250> better

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and I like I kind of like this better

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.670 
and I like I kind of like this better
because<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.880> has<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.840> tire<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.439> kind

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
because it has it it's a tire so it kind

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.429 
because it has it it's a tire so it kind
of<00:01:22.740> matches<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.250> other<00:01:23.400> ones<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.509> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
of matches the other ones on there and I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.660 
of matches the other ones on there and I
think<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.979> little<00:01:26.100> maybe<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.430> little

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
think it's a little maybe a little

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.520 
think it's a little maybe a little
smoother<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.270> being<00:01:27.659> that's<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:28.020> rubber<00:01:28.229> tire

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
smoother to being that's a rubber tire

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.249 
smoother to being that's a rubber tire
and<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.850> doesn't<00:01:30.119> make<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.390> annoyed<00:01:30.960> cleany

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and it doesn't make that annoyed cleany

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.050 
and it doesn't make that annoyed cleany
sound<00:01:31.680> when<00:01:31.920> you're<00:01:32.070> when<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.670> move<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.970> on

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
sound when you're when you move it on

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.130 
sound when you're when you move it on
any<00:01:33.270> kind<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.659> type<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.259> hard<00:01:34.470> surface<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
any kind of type of hard surface and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.859 
any kind of type of hard surface and
I'll<00:01:37.140> show<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:38.600> nova<00:01:39.600> two

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
I'll show you that will nova two

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.170 
I'll show you that will nova two
conversion<00:01:40.650> kit<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> put<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> under<00:01:41.430> put<00:01:42.090> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
conversion kit I put it under put it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.670 
conversion kit I put it under put it
right<00:01:42.299> there<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.750> I'll<00:01:42.810> probably<00:01:43.110> move

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
right there but I'll probably move

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.770 
right there but I'll probably move
eventually<00:01:44.159> tuck<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.210> underneath<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
eventually tuck it up underneath the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.399 
eventually tuck it up underneath the
flywheel<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.710> not<00:01:46.860> exposed<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.579> that

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
flywheel so it's not exposed like that

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.100 
flywheel so it's not exposed like that
mmm<00:01:49.670> but<00:01:50.670> yeah<00:01:51.149> when<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.329> first<00:01:51.360> got<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
mmm but yeah when I first got it the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.800 
mmm but yeah when I first got it the
engine<00:01:52.439> was<00:01:52.880> slightly<00:01:53.880> seasoned<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.570> use<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
engine was slightly seasoned I use the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.410 
engine was slightly seasoned I use the
word<00:01:54.960> slightly<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:55.700> all<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.850> had<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.270> is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
word slightly because all I had to do is

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.940 
word slightly because all I had to do is
just<00:01:57.600> pull<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> spark<00:01:58.200> plug<00:01:58.530> loop<00:01:58.770> is

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
just pull the spark plug loop is

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.679 
just pull the spark plug loop is
cylinder<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.790> was<00:01:59.939> able<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.210> free<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.570> up

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
cylinder and I was able to free it up

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.350 
cylinder and I was able to free it up
using<00:02:00.960> my<00:02:01.259> hand<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.549> worked<00:02:02.939> out<00:02:03.149> pretty

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
using my hand so that worked out pretty

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.969 
using my hand so that worked out pretty
well<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:05.360> other<00:02:06.360> than<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.829> one<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
well and other than that one of the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.969 
well and other than that one of the
tires<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.929> really<00:02:09.929> dry<00:02:10.200> rodded<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.860> it

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
tires was a really dry rodded and it

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.940 
tires was a really dry rodded and it
wouldn't<00:02:11.730> hold<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> year<00:02:12.420> so

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
wouldn't hold in a year so

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.770 
wouldn't hold in a year so
I<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.340> replace<00:02:14.670> both<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.090> tires<00:02:15.330> with<00:02:15.600> new

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
of a big job in itself the take paint

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.510 
of a big job in itself the take paint
gas<00:02:26.910> tank<00:02:27.210> was<00:02:27.330> already<00:02:27.630> clean<00:02:27.930> as<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:29.400> that

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
gas tank was already clean as so that

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.600 
gas tank was already clean as so that
was<00:02:29.700> nice

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
was nice

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.580 
was nice
let's<00:02:32.610> see<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:32.970> also<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.450> if<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.870> read<00:02:34.110> add

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
let's see and also that if you read add

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.150 
let's see and also that if you read add
the<00:02:34.830> replace<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:36.630> key<00:02:36.930> inside<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.890> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
the replace that the key inside the the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.800 
the replace that the key inside the the
starter<00:02:38.610> because<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.090> don't<00:02:39.270> know<00:02:39.360> why<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.540> was

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
starter because I don't know why it was

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.560 
starter because I don't know why it was
gone<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.380> when<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.590> would<00:02:40.710> pull<00:02:40.950> pull<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.880> it

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
gone so when you would pull pull it it

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.440 
gone so when you would pull pull it it
wouldn't<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:44.400> wouldn't<00:02:44.580> turn<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.120> engine

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
wouldn't it wouldn't turn the engine

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.270 
wouldn't it wouldn't turn the engine
over<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.750> would<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.110> pull<00:02:46.350> out<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
over it would just pull out that the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.750 
over it would just pull out that the
whole<00:02:47.460> recoil<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.100> don't<00:02:50.310> know<00:02:50.430> why<00:02:50.580> that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
whole recoil so so I don't know why that

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.650 
whole recoil so so I don't know why that
was<00:02:50.940> missing<00:02:51.440> but<00:02:52.670> yeah<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.700> cleaned<00:02:54.420> out<00:02:54.480> the
