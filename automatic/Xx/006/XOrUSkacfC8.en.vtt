trouble with this only seen it's not

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.630 
trouble with this only seen it's not
working<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.810> them<00:01:31.130> that's<00:01:32.130> because<00:01:32.460> you're

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
working for them that's because you're

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.899 
working for them that's because you're
going<00:01:33.299> around<00:01:33.600> as<00:01:34.470> fast<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.579> trying

times<00:01:38.700> too<00:01:38.970> close<00:01:39.210> together<00:01:39.360> say<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.500> go

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
times too close together say you can go

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.770

millisecond and only it won't give you
the<00:01:52.079> points<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.549> did<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.970> did<00:01:54.149> 40<00:01:54.720> 35<00:01:55.380> 30<00:01:56.899> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the points so we did we did 40 35 30 so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.539 
the points so we did we did 40 35 30 so
the<00:01:58.049> first<00:01:58.290> level<00:01:58.409> room<00:01:58.649> get<00:01:58.860> 40<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.369> then<00:01:59.460> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the first level room get 40 and then you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.280 
the first level room get 40 and then you
get<00:01:59.670> 3,500<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.439> second<00:02:01.740> lap<00:02:01.979> we<00:02:02.460> did<00:02:03.290> 35

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
get 3,500 and the second lap we did 35

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.819 
get 3,500 and the second lap we did 35
and<00:02:04.619> then<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.860> get<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.100> 3,500<00:02:06.619> try<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.680> keep

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
and then you get the 3,500 try to keep

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.869 
and then you get the 3,500 try to keep
it<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.039> couple<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.310> seconds<00:02:08.610> apart<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:10.760> try<00:02:11.760> not

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
it a couple of seconds apart and try not

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.700 
it a couple of seconds apart and try not
to<00:02:11.940> stop<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> vehicles<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.110> last<00:02:13.290> time<00:02:13.440> we

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
to stop the vehicles the last time we

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.010 
to stop the vehicles the last time we
and<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:15.060> stopped<00:02:15.510> giving<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.930> her

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
and it stopped giving it to her

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.290 
and it stopped giving it to her
sometimes<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.880> see<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.150> get<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.390> 3,500<00:02:19.230> and

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
sometimes so see you get the 3,500 and

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.880 
sometimes so see you get the 3,500 and
the<00:02:21.300> next<00:02:21.570> lap<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.900> just<00:02:22.110> beat<00:02:22.470> your<00:02:22.590> score

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the next lap you just beat your score

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.520 
the next lap you just beat your score
I'm<00:02:23.280> being<00:02:23.490> beat<00:02:23.730> your<00:02:23.850> time<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.380> should

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
I'm being beat your time and you should

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.250 
I'm being beat your time and you should
be<00:02:25.620> good<00:02:26.000> like<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.120> said<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.510> get<00:02:27.570> 10,000

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
be good like I said you can get 10,000

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.130 
be good like I said you can get 10,000
from<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.710> title<00:02:29.040> that's<00:02:30.000> from<00:02:30.390> four<00:02:30.720> four

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
from the title that's from four four

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.410 
from the title that's from four four
four<00:02:31.410> laps<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.920> can<00:02:32.100> do<00:02:32.250> four<00:02:32.520> laps<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:33.210> it's

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
four laps you can do four laps but it's

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.570 
four laps you can do four laps but it's
a<00:02:33.510> little<00:02:33.660> trickier<00:02:34.170> sometimes<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.250> gives<00:02:35.370> it

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
a little trickier sometimes it gives it

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.950 
a little trickier sometimes it gives it
to<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> third<00:02:36.180> lap<00:02:36.360> sometimes<00:02:36.810> it

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
to you on the third lap sometimes it

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.900 
to you on the third lap sometimes it
doesn't<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.500> don't<00:02:38.190> know<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.520> still<00:02:38.670> haven't

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
doesn't I don't know I still haven't

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.820 
doesn't I don't know I still haven't
figured<00:02:39.390> out<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.720> time<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.170> should<00:02:40.320> get<00:02:40.530> on

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
figured out the time you should get on

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.270 
figured out the time you should get on
with<00:02:41.520> their<00:02:41.700> lap<00:02:42.410> but<00:02:43.410> uh<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:44.070> more

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
with their lap but uh it's more

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.670 
with their lap but uh it's more
consistent<00:02:44.580> on<00:02:44.910> three<00:02:45.360> laps<00:02:45.570> only<00:02:45.960> but<00:02:46.620> you

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
consistent on three laps only but you

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.250 
consistent on three laps only but you
can<00:02:46.860> get<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.160> on<00:02:47.250> four<00:02:47.580> laps<00:02:47.900> I've<00:02:48.900> done<00:02:49.110> it

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
can get it on four laps I've done it

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.680 
can get it on four laps I've done it
once

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
once

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.270 
once
putting<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.840> uh<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.380> think<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.770> was<00:02:52.860> just<00:02:53.040> luck

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
putting that uh I think it was just luck

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.190 
putting that uh I think it was just luck
I<00:02:53.550> think<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.240> got<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.450> time<00:02:54.690> barely<00:02:55.020> right

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
I think I just got the time barely right

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.300 
I think I just got the time barely right
maybe<00:02:55.440> no<00:02:56.310> idea<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:58.560> can't<00:02:58.770> do<00:02:58.890> five<00:02:59.100> lap

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
maybe no idea you can't do five lap

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.670 
maybe no idea you can't do five lap
because<00:02:59.520> if<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.540> do<00:03:00.660> five<00:03:00.870> laps<00:03:01.170> it'll<00:03:01.410> max

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
because if you do five laps it'll max

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.590 
because if you do five laps it'll max
out<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.100> RP<00:03:02.700> points<00:03:03.030> you've<00:03:03.150> gained<00:03:03.330> in<00:03:03.450> this
