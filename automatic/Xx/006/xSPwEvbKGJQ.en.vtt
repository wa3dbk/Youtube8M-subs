of<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.230> exhaust<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:18.769> that<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:19.610> basically

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
of the exhaust so that it basically

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.120 
of the exhaust so that it basically
equalizes<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.810> pressure<00:02:20.920> but<00:02:21.920> it's<00:02:22.070> an

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
equalizes the pressure but it's an

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.820 
equalizes the pressure but it's an
engine<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.550> loves<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.850> rep<00:02:23.030> -<00:02:23.300> that's<00:02:24.290> fire<00:02:24.560> -

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
engine that loves a rep - that's fire -

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.430 
engine that loves a rep - that's fire -
everything<00:02:25.310> goes<00:02:26.300> up<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.570> almost<00:02:26.660> 7,000

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
everything goes up to almost 7,000

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.670 
everything goes up to almost 7,000
dreads

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.500 

this<00:02:31.250> is<00:02:31.400> one<00:02:31.579> of<00:02:31.609> the<00:02:31.730> biggest<00:02:32.030> challenges

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
this is one of the biggest challenges

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.679 
this is one of the biggest challenges
for<00:02:32.689> a<00:02:32.750> car<00:02:32.959> like<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.349> I'm<00:02:33.560> at<00:02:33.680> Laguna<00:02:34.069> Seca

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
for a car like this I'm at Laguna Seca

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.000 
for a car like this I'm at Laguna Seca
which<00:02:35.689> is<00:02:35.840> one<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.140> America's<00:02:36.650> most

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
which is one of the America's most

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.970 
which is one of the America's most
iconic<00:02:37.519> tracks

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.700 

you<00:02:41.980> can't<00:02:42.220> actually<00:02:42.400> see<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:43.440> second<00:02:44.440> corner

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
you can't actually see the second corner

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.080 
you can't actually see the second corner
of<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.860> corkscrew<00:02:45.370> because<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:45.880> length

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
of the corkscrew because of the length

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.470 
of the corkscrew because of the length
of<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.330> bonnet<00:02:46.600> on<00:02:46.660> this<00:02:46.840> car<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.060> GT

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
of the bonnet on this car but the GT

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.390 
of the bonnet on this car but the GT
isn't<00:02:50.020> just<00:02:50.200> about<00:02:50.320> getting<00:02:50.920> up<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.310> speed

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
isn't just about getting up to speed

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.770 
isn't just about getting up to speed
quickly<00:02:51.550> something<00:02:52.240> it<00:02:52.330> does<00:02:52.650> very<00:02:53.650> very<00:02:53.740> well

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
quickly something it does very very well

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.300 
quickly something it does very very well
it's<00:02:55.780> also<00:02:55.930> extremely<00:02:56.530> sharp<00:02:56.920> through<00:02:57.220> the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
it's also extremely sharp through the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.120 
it's also extremely sharp through the
bend<00:02:57.520> so<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.150> steering<00:02:58.570> is<00:02:58.720> really<00:02:59.130> sharp

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
bend so the steering is really sharp

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.040 
bend so the steering is really sharp
you've<00:03:01.090> got<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.270> take<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> little<00:03:01.630> bit<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.900> time

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
you've got to take a little bit of time

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.860 
you've got to take a little bit of time
to<00:03:02.170> get<00:03:02.260> used<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:04.150> once<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.450> do<00:03:04.690> it

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
to get used to it but once you do it

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.600 
to get used to it but once you do it
directs<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.380> car<00:03:05.590> brilliantly<00:03:06.040> almost<00:03:06.490> a

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
directs the car brilliantly almost a

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.940 
directs the car brilliantly almost a
perfect<00:03:07.000> white<00:03:07.150> balance<00:03:07.680> 47%<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:08.770> weight

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
perfect white balance 47% of the weight

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.430 
perfect white balance 47% of the weight
over<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.280> front<00:03:09.490> wheels<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:10.480> other<00:03:10.510> 53<00:03:11.200> over

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
over the front wheels the other 53 over

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.750 
over the front wheels the other 53 over
the<00:03:11.470> rear

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.610 

so<00:03:15.360> when<00:03:15.599> you're<00:03:15.750> challenging<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.409> through

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
so when you're challenging and through

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.089 
so when you're challenging and through
some<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:16.920> those<00:03:17.010> faster<00:03:17.519> bends<00:03:18.739> it's<00:03:19.739> it's

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
some of those faster bends it's it's

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.339 
some of those faster bends it's it's
really<00:03:20.400> well

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.410 

but<00:03:24.349> still<00:03:24.860> has<00:03:25.040> those<00:03:25.250> rear<00:03:25.580> truck<00:03:25.819> tendency

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
but still has those rear truck tendency

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.630 
but still has those rear truck tendency
so<00:03:26.659> the<00:03:27.319> rear<00:03:27.530> end<00:03:27.739> wanting<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.099> step<00:03:28.310> out<00:03:28.489> it's

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
so the rear end wanting to step out it's

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.479 
so the rear end wanting to step out it's
certainly<00:03:28.879> got<00:03:29.030> enough<00:03:29.090> power<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.540> do<00:03:29.720> that

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
certainly got enough power to do that

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.619 
certainly got enough power to do that
response<00:03:31.489> is<00:03:31.670> certainly<00:03:32.030> something<00:03:32.299> it<00:03:32.480> has

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
response is certainly something it has

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:40.300 
response is certainly something it has
in<00:03:32.780> space<00:03:37.959> but<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.110> GT<00:03:39.500> is<00:03:39.560> more<00:03:39.920> than<00:03:40.099> just

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
in space but the GT is more than just

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.819 
in space but the GT is more than just
hot<00:03:40.489> laps<00:03:40.730> on<00:03:40.879> the<00:03:40.970> track<00:03:41.290> Merc<00:03:42.290> basically

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
hot laps on the track Merc basically

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.259 
hot laps on the track Merc basically
acknowledged<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.459> this<00:03:43.610> car<00:03:43.909> could<00:03:44.150> be<00:03:44.180> a

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
acknowledged is that this car could be a

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.030 
acknowledged is that this car could be a
daily<00:03:44.480> driver<00:03:44.840> for<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.140> lot<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.290> people<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:45.860> it's

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
daily driver for a lot of people so it's

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.680 
daily driver for a lot of people so it's
important<00:03:46.579> that<00:03:46.610> it's<00:03:46.849> comfortable<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.540> drive

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
important that it's comfortable to drive

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.649 
important that it's comfortable to drive
and<00:03:47.989> saving<00:03:48.860> position<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.280> really<00:03:49.610> good<00:03:49.819> the

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
and saving position is really good the

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.360 
and saving position is really good the
seats<00:03:50.959> are<00:03:51.140> quite<00:03:51.230> comfortable<00:03:51.829> favored<00:03:52.220> to

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
seats are quite comfortable favored to

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.160 
seats are quite comfortable favored to
support<00:03:52.819> and<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.299> controls<00:03:53.720> are<00:03:53.900> just<00:03:53.989> as

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
support and the controls are just as

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.990

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
logical as any other Merc and it's

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.640 
logical as any other Merc and it's
surprisingly<00:03:56.540> comfortable<00:03:56.629> on<00:03:57.230> regular

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
surprisingly comfortable on regular

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.470 
surprisingly comfortable on regular
roads<00:03:57.829> it<00:03:58.129> can<00:03:58.280> get<00:03:58.400> a<00:03:58.579> little<00:03:58.670> bit<00:03:58.910> harsh<00:03:59.120> over

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
roads it can get a little bit harsh over

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.449 
roads it can get a little bit harsh over
the<00:03:59.569> sharper<00:03:59.959> bumps<00:04:00.290> sort<00:04:00.920> of<00:04:01.010> thunder<00:04:01.310> into

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
the sharper bumps sort of thunder into

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.819 
the sharper bumps sort of thunder into
them<00:04:01.640> but<00:04:01.930> generally<00:04:02.930> that's<00:04:03.410> pretty<00:04:03.680> good

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
them but generally that's pretty good

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.190 
them but generally that's pretty good

that<00:04:14.510> response<00:04:14.959> one<00:04:15.170> of<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.319> things<00:04:15.530> Merc<00:04:15.769> did

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
that response one of the things Merc did

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.340 
that response one of the things Merc did
with<00:04:16.160> this<00:04:16.280> engine<00:04:16.729> was<00:04:17.539> put<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.900> turbos

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
with this engine was put the turbos

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.590 
with this engine was put the turbos
inside<00:04:18.919> the<00:04:19.160> feed<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.820> they<00:04:19.970> say<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.389> gives
