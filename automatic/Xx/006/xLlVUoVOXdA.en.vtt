00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.900 
these a couple of years ago and they've
worked<00:02:25.590> really<00:02:25.739> good<00:02:26.100> they<00:02:26.250> move<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> lot<00:02:26.790> of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
worked really good they move a lot of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.000 
worked really good they move a lot of
water<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.750> fish<00:02:28.020> can<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:28.410> them<00:02:28.530> from<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.830> long

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
water the fish can see them from a long

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.890 
water the fish can see them from a long
ways<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.340> feel<00:02:29.790> them<00:02:29.940> from<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.209> long<00:02:30.360> ways<00:02:30.630> and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
ways and feel them from a long ways and

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.860 
ways and feel them from a long ways and
they<00:02:31.380> really<00:02:31.819> accentuate<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.270> spinning<00:02:33.690> glow

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
they really accentuate the spinning glow

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.830 
they really accentuate the spinning glow
that<00:02:34.319> goes<00:02:34.560> behind<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:37.050> flasher<00:02:37.790> and

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
that goes behind the the flasher and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.860 
that goes behind the the flasher and
spin<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:39.959> glow<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.260> something<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.709> we<00:02:40.830> use

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
spin and glow is something that we use

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.990 
spin and glow is something that we use
every<00:02:42.870> day<00:02:43.019> out<00:02:43.260> here<00:02:43.290> for<00:02:43.800> lake<00:02:44.250> trout<00:02:44.280> it's

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
every day out here for lake trout it's

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.479 
every day out here for lake trout it's
where<00:02:45.510> they<00:02:45.630> really<00:02:45.959> work<00:02:46.200> well<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:47.250> these

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
where they really work well is on these

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.470 
where they really work well is on these
big<00:02:48.360> flat<00:02:48.750> areas<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.620> get<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.820> know<00:02:50.940> out

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
big flat areas you get you know out

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.660 
big flat areas you get you know out
behind<00:02:52.110> madelung<00:02:52.680> island<00:02:53.070> there's<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.370> spot

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
behind madelung island there's a spot

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.580 
behind madelung island there's a spot
out<00:02:53.820> there<00:02:54.000> called<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.300> flats<00:02:54.630> I'll<00:02:55.290> show<00:02:55.500> you

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
out there called the flats I'll show you

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.120 
out there called the flats I'll show you
that<00:02:55.739> on<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> map<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.670> then<00:02:57.239> also<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.980> get

that on a map here and then also you get
you<00:02:59.700> know<00:02:59.790> by<00:03:00.440> up<00:03:01.440> off<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.860> Stockton<00:03:02.280> Island

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
you know by up off of Stockton Island

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.270 
you know by up off of Stockton Island
there's<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.880> big<00:03:03.030> flat<00:03:03.330> up<00:03:03.569> there<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.110> then<00:03:04.650> off

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
there's a big flat up there and then off

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.860 
there's a big flat up there and then off
by<00:03:05.489> outer<00:03:05.670> island<00:03:06.120> there's<00:03:06.269> some<00:03:06.420> big<00:03:06.570> flats

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
by outer island there's some big flats

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.840 
by outer island there's some big flats
as<00:03:07.140> well<00:03:07.290> they<00:03:07.829> worked<00:03:08.070> really<00:03:08.160> well<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.579> those

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
as well they worked really well in those

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.210 
as well they worked really well in those
types<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.299> situations<00:03:09.540> because<00:03:10.200> they<00:03:10.920> fit

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
types of situations because they fit

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.729 
types of situations because they fit
well<00:03:11.519> on<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.030> bottom<00:03:12.420> they<00:03:12.600> they<00:03:12.959> swim<00:03:13.260> really

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
well on the bottom they they swim really

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.380 
well on the bottom they they swim really
well<00:03:13.980> where<00:03:14.250> there's<00:03:14.430> not<00:03:14.640> much<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:15.060> bottom

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
well where there's not much of a bottom

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.240 
well where there's not much of a bottom
fluctuation<00:03:15.989> or<00:03:16.140> where<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.769> can<00:03:16.950> slowly

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
fluctuation or where you can slowly

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.069 
fluctuation or where you can slowly
raise<00:03:17.730> them<00:03:17.910> up<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.209> down<00:03:18.360> when<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.930> get

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
raise them up and down when you get

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.780 
raise them up and down when you get
gradual<00:03:20.180> depth<00:03:21.180> depth<00:03:21.720> changes<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.739> flats<00:03:23.489> and

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
gradual depth depth changes so flats and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.850 
gradual depth depth changes so flats and
flat<00:03:24.000> areas<00:03:24.390> but<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:24.930> pretty<00:03:25.260> simple<00:03:25.709> it's

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
flat areas but it's pretty simple it's

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.630 
flat areas but it's pretty simple it's
just<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.220> use<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.540> 50<00:03:27.540> pound<00:03:27.810> piece<00:03:28.530> of

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
just I use a 50 pound piece of

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.640 
just I use a 50 pound piece of
fluorocarbon<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:30.110> barrel<00:03:31.110> swivel<00:03:31.230> here

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
fluorocarbon on a barrel swivel here

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.090 
fluorocarbon on a barrel swivel here
just<00:03:32.310> terminated<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.150> number<00:03:33.810> two<00:03:34.049> must<00:03:34.890> add

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
just terminated to a number two must add

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.880 
just terminated to a number two must add
triple<00:03:35.519> grip<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.329> just<00:03:36.630> use<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.200> Snell<00:03:37.590> not

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
triple grip and I just use a Snell not

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.860 
triple grip and I just use a Snell not
to<00:03:38.370> hook<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.640> together<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.090> put<00:03:39.390> three<00:03:39.630> beads

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
to hook that together I put three beads

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.259 
to hook that together I put three beads
on<00:03:40.170> there<00:03:40.410> see<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.370> usually<00:03:41.519> use<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.090> same

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
on there see I usually use the same

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.360 
on there see I usually use the same
color<00:03:42.540> as<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.720> spinning<00:03:43.140> low<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.500> then<00:03:43.950> like

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
color as a spinning low and then like

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.039 
color as a spinning low and then like
here<00:03:44.610> this<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:44.970> purple<00:03:45.359> spinning<00:03:45.720> glue<00:03:45.870> I

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
here this is a purple spinning glue I

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.240 
here this is a purple spinning glue I
also<00:03:46.140> use<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:47.459> know<00:03:48.109> chartreuse<00:03:49.250> spinning

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
also use you know chartreuse spinning

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.960 
also use you know chartreuse spinning
glows<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:51.600> know<00:03:51.859> also<00:03:52.859> another<00:03:53.549> one<00:03:53.790> a

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
glows and you know also another one a

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.060 
glows and you know also another one a
good<00:03:54.150> one<00:03:54.209> as<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.480> glow<00:03:54.810> glow<00:03:55.470> spin<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:55.920> gloom

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
good one as a glow glow spin and gloom

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.210 
good one as a glow glow spin and gloom
but<00:03:56.430> pretty<00:03:56.640> simple<00:03:57.090> leave<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.019> about<00:03:58.170> 16<00:03:58.890> to

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
but pretty simple leave it about 16 to

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.160 
but pretty simple leave it about 16 to
12<00:03:59.489> inches<00:03:59.820> you<00:03:59.940> want<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.239> short<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.959> the

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
12 inches you want it short and the

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.390 
12 inches you want it short and the
reason<00:04:01.440> why<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.620> want<00:04:01.859> that<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.220> want

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
reason why you want that is you want

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.310 
reason why you want that is you want
this<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:02.760> whip<00:04:02.940> back<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.450> forth<00:04:03.720> really<00:04:04.049> well

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
this to whip back and forth really well

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.990 
this to whip back and forth really well
because<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:05.040> fish<00:04:05.250> are<00:04:05.430> actually<00:04:05.609> coming

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
because the fish are actually coming

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.330 
because the fish are actually coming
into<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:06.570> big<00:04:07.200> flasher<00:04:07.769> that's<00:04:07.980> what<00:04:08.190> they

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
into this big flasher that's what they

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.400 
into this big flasher that's what they
see<00:04:08.400> as<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:09.299> bait<00:04:09.510> fish<00:04:09.780> swimming<00:04:10.140> through

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
see as the bait fish swimming through

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.140 
see as the bait fish swimming through
the<00:04:10.470> water<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.949> they<00:04:11.040> get<00:04:11.220> there<00:04:11.459> they<00:04:11.790> follow

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
the water and they get there they follow
