the<00:02:22.920> way<00:02:23.040> I've<00:02:23.160> got<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.700> twenty

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
the way I've got to that is twenty

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.930 
the way I've got to that is twenty
percent<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.330> 200<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:25.080> 40<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.160> 200<00:02:26.580> minus

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
percent of 200 it's 40 so 200 minus

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.540 
percent of 200 it's 40 so 200 minus
party<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.660> 160<00:02:28.410> which<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.250> your<00:02:29.400> lean<00:02:29.520> body

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
more protein generally try and keep it

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.540 
more protein generally try and keep it
within<00:03:43.350> that<00:03:43.590> range<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.100> you'll<00:03:44.310> be<00:03:44.430> all

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
within that range and you'll be all

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.100 
within that range and you'll be all
right<00:03:46.459> next<00:03:47.459> up<00:03:47.640> then<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.120> your<00:03:48.450> caps<00:03:48.870> now<00:03:49.050> the

protein and the car is from your fat and

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.040 
protein and the car is from your fat and
whatever<00:03:54.930> is<00:03:55.260> remaining<00:03:55.590> from<00:03:56.130> your<00:03:56.280> total

whatever is remaining from your total

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.900 
whatever is remaining from your total
needs<00:03:58.050> here<00:03:58.380> that<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.250> how<00:03:59.340> many<00:03:59.400> calves<00:03:59.760> you

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
needs here that is how many calves you

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.550 
needs here that is how many calves you
can<00:03:59.940> have<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:00.420> for<00:04:00.600> this<00:04:00.690> guy<00:04:00.930> it's<00:04:01.380> going<00:04:01.500> to

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
can have so for this guy it's going to

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.780 
can have so for this guy it's going to
be<00:04:01.650> 900<00:04:02.130> calories<00:04:02.370> plus<00:04:02.730> 640<00:04:03.690> calories<00:04:04.080> that's

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
be 900 calories plus 640 calories that's

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.120 
be 900 calories plus 640 calories that's
1500<00:04:05.790> fight<00:04:05.970> calories<00:04:06.450> consumed<00:04:07.080> already<00:04:07.380> so

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
1500 fight calories consumed already so

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.150 
1500 fight calories consumed already so
two<00:04:08.430> thousand<00:04:08.820> three<00:04:08.910> hundred<00:04:09.000> minus<00:04:10.160> 1540

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
two thousand three hundred minus 1540

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.580 
two thousand three hundred minus 1540
equals<00:04:11.880> 760<00:04:12.870> calories<00:04:13.290> now<00:04:13.890> if<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.610> divide

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
equals 760 calories now if you divide

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.979 
equals 760 calories now if you divide
760<00:04:16.590> calories<00:04:16.980> by<00:04:17.250> 4<00:04:17.730> which<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.600> how<00:04:18.810> many

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
760 calories by 4 which is how many

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.659 
760 calories by 4 which is how many
calories<00:04:19.200> one<00:04:19.560> gram<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.769> carbohydrates<00:04:20.549> as

calories one gram of carbohydrates as

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.360 
calories one gram of carbohydrates as
you<00:04:21.239> are<00:04:21.419> given<00:04:21.930> 100

you are given 100
grams<00:04:22.820> of<00:04:23.030> carbs<00:04:23.419> so<00:04:24.199> that<00:04:24.680> brings<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:24.979> back

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
grams of carbs so that brings you back

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.030 
grams of carbs so that brings you back
to<00:04:25.190> hear<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:26.000> macros<00:04:26.360> for<00:04:26.389> this<00:04:26.660> guy<00:04:26.870> is<00:04:27.199> 160

say a pound a week is you don't need to

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.350 
say a pound a week is you don't need to
worry<00:04:42.139> about<00:04:42.440> on<00:04:42.590> them<00:04:42.919> for<00:04:43.639> quite<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.150> while

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
worry about on them for quite a while

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.659 
worry about on them for quite a while
anytime<00:04:45.320> I<00:04:45.350> would<00:04:45.560> start<00:04:45.770> to<00:04:45.919> reassess<00:04:46.400> them

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
anytime I would start to reassess them

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.159 
anytime I would start to reassess them
and<00:04:46.820> start<00:04:47.030> changing<00:04:47.240> them<00:04:47.540> is<00:04:47.660> maybe<00:04:47.870> say

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
and start changing them is maybe say

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.219 
and start changing them is maybe say
eight<00:04:48.680> weeks<00:04:49.040> in<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.760> a<00:04:49.790> diet<00:04:50.090> or<00:04:50.300> if<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:50.990> stop

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
eight weeks in to a diet or if you stop

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.540 
eight weeks in to a diet or if you stop
losing<00:04:51.650> where<00:04:51.800> if<00:04:51.949> you<00:04:52.040> found<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.370> you're

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
losing where if you found that you're

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.029 
losing where if you found that you're
not<00:04:52.669> losing<00:04:52.820> where<00:04:53.150> anymore<00:04:53.830> reassess<00:04:54.830> them

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
not losing where anymore reassess them

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.529 
not losing where anymore reassess them
you<00:04:55.370> might<00:04:55.550> need<00:04:55.669> to<00:04:55.820> drop<00:04:55.940> your<00:04:56.060> cars<00:04:56.270> down

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
you might need to drop your cars down

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:57.610 
you might need to drop your cars down
and<00:04:56.690> then<00:04:56.810> you<00:04:56.930> need<00:04:57.139> to<00:04:57.289> shift<00:04:57.500> your

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
and then you need to shift your

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.540 
and then you need to shift your
percentages<00:04:58.310> about<00:04:58.780> but<00:04:59.780> really<00:05:00.500> once<00:05:01.430> you

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
percentages about but really once you

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.120 
percentages about but really once you
lose<00:05:01.789> him<00:05:01.940> we're<00:05:02.120> just<00:05:03.110> go<00:05:03.289> with<00:05:03.440> that<00:05:03.470> do<00:05:03.979> not

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
lose him we're just go with that do not

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.620 
lose him we're just go with that do not
I<00:05:04.160> mean<00:05:04.280> don't<00:05:04.699> worry<00:05:04.850> about<00:05:05.120> so<00:05:05.360> much<00:05:05.479> the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
I mean don't worry about so much the

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.000 
I mean don't worry about so much the
whole<00:05:05.780> goal<00:05:05.990> you<00:05:06.229> should<00:05:06.410> never<00:05:06.560> really<00:05:06.800> need

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
whole goal you should never really need

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.409 
whole goal you should never really need
to<00:05:07.130> change<00:05:07.400> your<00:05:07.490> pro<00:05:07.729> team<00:05:07.940> on<00:05:08.150> because

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
to change your pro team on because

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.600 
to change your pro team on because
ideally<00:05:09.229> you're<00:05:09.979> not<00:05:10.100> going<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.370> lose<00:05:10.550> any

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
ideally you're not going to lose any
