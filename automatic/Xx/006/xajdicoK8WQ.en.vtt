one<00:00:25.220> of<00:00:25.250> our<00:00:25.460> skips<00:00:26.450> homes<00:00:26.770> why<00:00:27.770> don't<00:00:27.890> you

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
one of our skips homes why don't you

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.749 
one of our skips homes why don't you
come<00:00:28.099> inside<00:00:28.250> now<00:00:28.640> let's<00:00:29.000> take<00:00:29.150> a<00:00:29.180> look<00:00:30.759> the

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
come inside now let's take a look the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.730 
come inside now let's take a look the
reason<00:00:31.880> we<00:00:32.119> work<00:00:32.390> through<00:00:32.750> our<00:00:33.050> pastures<00:00:33.710> is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
reason we work through our pastures is

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.200 
reason we work through our pastures is
because<00:00:36.740> they<00:00:37.310> know<00:00:37.490> their<00:00:37.640> community<00:00:38.090> better

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
because they know their community better

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
because they know their community better
than<00:00:38.480> we<00:00:38.630> do

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
than we do

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.220 
than we do
and<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.010> we<00:00:40.460> we<00:00:40.880> do<00:00:41.000> not<00:00:41.210> want<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.570> be<00:00:41.720> the<00:00:42.020> white

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
and so we we do not want to be the white

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.320 
and so we we do not want to be the white
people<00:00:42.590> coming<00:00:42.980> in<00:00:43.100> here<00:00:43.400> making<00:00:44.120> all<00:00:44.210> the

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
people coming in here making all the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.710 
people coming in here making all the
decisions<00:00:44.450> and<00:00:45.170> choosing<00:00:46.330> ignorantly<00:00:47.330> who

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
decisions and choosing ignorantly who

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.440 
decisions and choosing ignorantly who
gets<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.170> home<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:48.560> who<00:00:48.650> doesn't<00:00:48.950> get<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.070> home

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
gets a home and who doesn't get a home

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.180 
gets a home and who doesn't get a home
each<00:00:50.450> house<00:00:50.660> is<00:00:50.690> made<00:00:51.110> out<00:00:51.230> of<00:00:51.260> 85<00:00:51.920> different

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
each house is made out of 85 different

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.760 
each house is made out of 85 different
panels<00:00:52.880> panels<00:00:53.810> and<00:00:54.760> so<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:56.300> panel's<00:00:56.770> either

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
panels panels and so the panel's either

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.890 
panels panels and so the panel's either
anywhere<00:00:58.340> between<00:00:58.490> two<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.090> four<00:00:59.300> panels<00:00:59.780> are

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
anywhere between two and four panels are

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.380 
anywhere between two and four panels are
assembled<00:01:00.020> on<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.680> ground<00:01:01.090> and<00:01:02.090> they're

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
assembled on the ground and they're

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.550 
assembled on the ground and they're
wired<00:01:02.810> together<00:01:03.729> and<00:01:04.729> then<00:01:05.119> covered<00:01:05.869> in<00:01:06.080> a

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
wired together and then covered in a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.820 
wired together and then covered in a
piece<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.130> flat<00:01:07.610> mesh<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.360> then<00:01:08.840> we<00:01:08.990> lift<00:01:09.590> up

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
piece of flat mesh and then we lift up

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.219 
piece of flat mesh and then we lift up
you<00:01:10.790> know<00:01:10.880> those<00:01:11.030> two<00:01:11.270> two<00:01:11.630> panels<00:01:11.990> are<00:01:12.080> now

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
you know those two two panels are now

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.560 
you know those two two panels are now
combined<00:01:12.680> into<00:01:13.100> one<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.210> then<00:01:14.390> they're

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
combined into one and so then they're

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
combined into one and so then they're
lifted<00:01:14.990> up<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.799> they<00:01:15.950> sit<00:01:16.280> over<00:01:16.579> that<00:01:16.729> rebar

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
lifted up and they sit over that rebar

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.380 
lifted up and they sit over that rebar
and<00:01:18.590> then<00:01:18.770> we<00:01:18.950> we<00:01:19.280> do<00:01:19.460> that<00:01:19.609> again<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:19.939> we<00:01:20.240> go

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
and then we we do that again and we go

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.169 
and then we we do that again and we go
all<00:01:20.600> around<00:01:20.749> the<00:01:20.990> house<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:21.289> then<00:01:21.909> we<00:01:22.909> just

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
all around the house and then we just

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.830 
all around the house and then we just
wire<00:01:23.810> all<00:01:24.229> of<00:01:24.469> the<00:01:24.560> joints<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.219> and<00:01:26.149> then<00:01:26.450> mesh

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
wire all of the joints and and then mesh

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.169 
wire all of the joints and and then mesh
all<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.439> joints<00:01:27.770> together<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.920> then

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
all of the joints together and then

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.139 
all of the joints together and then
after<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:32.479> walls<00:01:32.719> are<00:01:32.929> up<00:01:33.109> and<00:01:34.149> similar

process for the roof once the roof is on
we<00:01:38.630> will<00:01:38.780> go<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.200> we'll<00:01:39.979> run<00:01:40.189> electrical<00:01:40.609> wire

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:42.639 
we will go and we'll run electrical wire

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:46.989 
we will go and we'll run electrical wire
wire<00:01:43.639> and<00:01:44.060> boxes<00:01:45.249> and<00:01:46.249> then<00:01:46.549> after<00:01:46.880> the

go<00:01:49.850> ahead<00:01:49.969> and<00:01:50.210> we'll<00:01:50.389> put<00:01:50.420> two<00:01:51.259> coats<00:01:51.530> of

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
go ahead and we'll put two coats of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.870 
go ahead and we'll put two coats of
stucco<00:01:52.130> on<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.969> interior<00:01:53.780> walls<00:01:54.049> as<00:01:54.289> well

the wire mesh so all of that is covered
we<00:02:16.630> hook<00:02:16.960> it<00:02:16.990> up<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.470> an<00:02:18.190> air<00:02:18.400> compressor<00:02:18.930> it's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
we hook it up to an air compressor it's

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.050 
we hook it up to an air compressor it's
like<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.490> 12<00:02:21.490> CFM<00:02:22.090> air<00:02:22.510> compressor<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:24.060> stucco
