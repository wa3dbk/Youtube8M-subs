00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
have any elasticity to it and I prefer

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.240 
have any elasticity to it and I prefer
the<00:05:35.610> one<00:05:35.790> that<00:05:36.330> doesn't<00:05:36.750> have<00:05:36.950> elasticity<00:05:37.950> to

it I find that it's easier to fling

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.900 
it I find that it's easier to fling
around<00:05:41.730> than<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:42.720> other<00:05:42.840> ones<00:05:43.110> I<00:05:43.760> don't<00:05:44.760> know
