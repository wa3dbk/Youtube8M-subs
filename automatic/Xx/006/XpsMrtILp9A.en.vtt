00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.450
 is to do many more and good 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.629
 starting with this today I want you 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.700
 talk about concerts concerts 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.130
 that obviously everyone already knows what 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.410
 they are and for those who do not know is a 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.110
 live presentation usually of 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.840
 music by an artist or various artists 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.270
 whether they are men or women before a 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.700
 public there are two types of concerts 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.740
 classical or virtuoso concerts like 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.650
 he is also told that they are the orchestras 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.450
 symphonic or opera that I 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.740
 sincerely in this type of concerts 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.740
 I would sleep 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.670
 wakes up 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.550
 what happened what with what happened and we are 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.790
 listening beautiful melody the steps 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.790
 I do not have the maximum I think it is 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:18.130
 way but here while these and this time 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.350
 that Mexico is not postponed but in 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.179
 serious in this kind of concepts would give me 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.460
 a lot of sleep but if I really like the 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.450
 classical music once in this type 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.000
 of concerts 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.250
 I miss the other kind of concerts that 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.200

 and its derivatives there are tours 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.009
 charities that are a concert of 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.900
 quality where musicians meet 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.240

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.800

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.560
 no other concert net to women 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.510
 they shout a shit for a net artist 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.180

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.730
 singer and much less when the 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.670
 singer to sing to then be able 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.819

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:35.800
 [Music] 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.830
 to quiet women there is no reason why 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.680
 get upset and it's not that I'm super 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.940

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.000
 the air 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.669
 to see me and calm down me this level is 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.009
 a normal person is not a god like 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:59.039
 so that at the same time you have to maintain 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:02.360
 a quiet firm stance do not riot 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.360
