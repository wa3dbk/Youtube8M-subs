00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
closely monitor anything that people eat

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.380 
closely monitor anything that people eat
fish<00:03:13.360> marine<00:03:14.200> mammals<00:03:14.760> terrible<00:03:15.760> anything

fish marine mammals terrible anything

fish marine mammals terrible anything

but<00:03:22.700> where<00:03:22.909> do<00:03:23.030> these<00:03:23.120> chemicals<00:03:23.659> come<00:03:23.870> from

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
but where do these chemicals come from

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.709 
but where do these chemicals come from
and<00:03:24.980> how<00:03:25.189> did<00:03:25.340> they<00:03:25.459> get<00:03:25.640> here<00:03:27.400> in<00:03:28.719> a

and how did they get here in a

and how did they get here in a
phenomenon<00:03:30.260> scientists<00:03:30.890> call<00:03:31.099> the

work<00:04:18.570> in<00:04:18.690> factories<00:04:19.019> but<00:04:19.980> what<00:04:20.130> they<00:04:20.280> do<00:04:20.340> is

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
work in factories but what they do is

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.940 
work in factories but what they do is
they're<00:04:21.030> at<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.180> top<00:04:21.389> of<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.600> food<00:04:21.750> chain

concern
