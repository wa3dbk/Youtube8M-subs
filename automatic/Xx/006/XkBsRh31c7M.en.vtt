00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
products I don't think I gave it a real

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.180 
products I don't think I gave it a real
fair<00:00:35.550> shot<00:00:35.969> being<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.899> probably<00:00:37.680> most

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
fair shot being that I probably most

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.150 
fair shot being that I probably most
likely<00:00:38.250> did<00:00:38.700> not<00:00:38.730> apply<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.480> correctly<00:00:40.100> so<00:00:41.100> I

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
likely did not apply it correctly so I

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.450 
likely did not apply it correctly so I
