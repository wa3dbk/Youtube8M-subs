00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.180
 Well, that's it everyone knows 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.100
 that they canine ac and today I am 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.600
 with my friend nico and we find ourselves 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.820
 today for my third tutorial so 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.650
 tutorial called how to start his 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.599
 bike to the stroller so in this tutorial 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.939
 will show you this technique 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.699
 this technique forgive blows in the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.830
 mouth this technique that allows you 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.050
 to start your bike if I ever know 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.300
 not your electric starter and break 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.949
 your battery is dead or even if you 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.090
 have lost your kit but hey it takes 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:39.449
 be strong enough still lose his 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.180
 kick 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.250
 finally here we are all going to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.710
 following you show the basic principle 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.420
 of this technique principle that will be the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.020
 even for different methods 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.340
 who used 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.600
 and then well I'll leave you with 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.370
 nico right now for him to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.440
 explain this method a little bit 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.850
 had already then like who cagnina that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.440
 you said it's exactly the same 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.210
 principle every time it's just the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.680
 way to push the bike that goes 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.329
 switch 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.970
 ok there before pushing I noticed that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.649
 my bike do not start we'll do a little 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.250
 at edge but the second that is 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.479
 that we even think the contact and we put 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.570
 even the same contact on pushes the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.630
 motorcycle so now we're going to push the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.229
 motorcycle I disengaged once I 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.649
 good speed i can nothing i loose 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.649
 failed my rubio 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.090
 so we have to do well but the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.540
 second push and once there is 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.820
 that the grind is speed is good 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:49.210
 this is clutch and we continue to 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:50.770
 push until she does not if you 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.080
 have seen the first technique that nico 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.000
 uses quite classical technique the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.070
 technique that I too use in 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.780
 done for me this is the most technical 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.530
 simple and you also saw that he put 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.240
 second gear 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.500
 so why like second gear 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.870
 in fact he puts the second gear all 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.650
 simply because it's easier 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.000
 after that I will not go into 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.160
 details but it's a whole story of 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.500
 compression ratio and all that finally I 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.430
 do not go into details 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.500
 it's just that it's easier in 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.000
 second as the rear wheel turn 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.560
 even more easily 102nd so I'll you 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.830
 also advise using the second 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.630
 speed 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.890
 so after me too I have a method 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.150
 I will show you my method 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.290
 and then you will see that this 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.290
 method is far more cool 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.220
 Oh 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.830
 called nico 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:03:05.190
 go ahead apple apple bat nicole bouteau 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:15.330
 it starts not act well it's 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:25.290
 fast it starts time that drives me to 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:29.120
 inches I do not like when you 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.120
 youth hockey 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.950
 yeah 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.180
 so you've seen that this method is 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.170
 much better when you are two of you 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.360
 have seen that we do not need to 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.010
 tired already have you also seen that I 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.360
 do not know if you're afraid to push 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.980
 your bike and jump on it or so 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.590
 you are a little too small bath this 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.430
 method it is vastly better 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.380
 after that it's true that it stays exactly 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.600
 the same principle is always 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.130
 disengages we put the second gear 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.690
 we can get his bike once we get enough 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.750
 quickly and then release the clutch at this 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:19.150
 moment there but shot of is all alone and 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.260
 in addition you do not even tire the man 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:29.740
 out technical one feels in 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:31.090
 descent when shown at the same time 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.540
 technique you will see that the 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.250
 technical to the water if it is not bad 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:40.210
 sometimes I will be able to exploit my 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.420
 technique then the same contacts but 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.420
 I love 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.670
 so here you have seen that there is 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.290
 really several methods for 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.950
 start his bike on the stroller 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.050
 you saw that each has his own they 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.530
 hold it is the best that everyone has 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.170
 hers 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.730
 and then finally here it is after you as you 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.720
 feel it is the method that you 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.620
 prefer 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.850
 after I did just a little 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.380
 note to do is if you ever 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.670
 have started your bike at the 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.830
 stroller and that the floor is really 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.120
 wet that already happened to me at this moment 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.950
 there will really have to put weight 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.660
 on the back wheel so moment you 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.700
 let go of the clutch it will be necessary to be 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.410
 well put do that at the level of 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.790
 the back of the saddle because that's me 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.770
 I've already had the ars where nothing 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.900
 meals is suddenly I have a little bit of 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.330
 badly to start a lottery and then else bah 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.270
 I think this tutorial is over I will 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.820
 well I think this tutorial and ends up more 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.200
 down we'll tell you next time 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.570
 ciao and then if you have any questions 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.830
 do not hesitate in the comments 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.200

 maybe you 're going for a ride again 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.450
 go very high 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.340
 first step so starting in 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.500
 this video I presented you three 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.980
 different systems for to secure 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.980
 your bike
