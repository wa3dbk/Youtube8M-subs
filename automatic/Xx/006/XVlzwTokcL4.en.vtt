00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.529
 my name is evaristo 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:10.430
 today we are going to mark a stream of water 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.830
 that we have previously located 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.619
 but let's find the right place to 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.470
 do the piercing we will cover with 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.880
 these homemade rods that are from 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.149
 special radio wire thanks to it 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.159
 so let's specialize and we're going to 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:32.380
 find the right place to do the 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:35.010
 perforation we started 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.010
 but 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.710
 Ok here 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.710
 we have the beginning 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.660
 because the current 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.710
 now let's see how wide it is in 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.859
 this point 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.859
 [Applause] 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.059
 and here 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.320
 why 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.040
 [Applause] 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.819
 [Applause] 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 never 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.849
 [Applause] 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.110
 one 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.240
 [Applause] 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.570
 as you see 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.500
 here 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.500
 it starts 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:17.120
 you start to throw 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:19.400
 [Applause] 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.540
 well here in the background where we have 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.069
 started before as you see 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.780
 the sand 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.150
 It is one meter wide 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.510
 at that point you must have two meters 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.860
 and peak at the end and there in the middle of the zone 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.160
 wider because it is almost almost 45 meters 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.530
 Thus 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.490
 [Music] 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.800
 [Applause] 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.950
 the ideal place to do the well 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.460
 It would be more or less a remedy 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.730
 all this is the widest area 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.640
 and we are checking here 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:04.290
 [Applause] 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:08.299
 now let's check at point s the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.299
 depth and there is the water stream 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.690
 all estimated 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.170
 this is not magic 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.050
 let's look estimated 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.050
 the depth of the current 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.350
 For this, we analyze real the 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.350
 oats 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:46.460
 we stand on top and start 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.340
 check the depth that is 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.840
 when I reach the depth that is 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.840
 the rods are applied 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.980
 nothing 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.999
 [Applause] 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.230
 well I said it 's about 150 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.070
 meters deep 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.010
 and 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.840
 Now let's check the liters 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.840
 estimated that there may be 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.869
 [Applause] 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.550
 but not 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.900
 we return to place on the point 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:56.880
 that we want staff 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.880
 and we started to detect the next flow 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.000
 do not 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.490
 yes 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.490
 but of origin 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.770
 I 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.519
 [Music] 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:42.120
 yes 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:45.310
 so it gives us about 8000 liters roland 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.750
 8000 liters now gives us no no we're going 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.230
 to check until the 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.230
 drilling 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.760
 and show it 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.280
 but we're not going to write down a paper for 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.740
 remember it 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.430
 [Applause] 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.430
 here 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.470
 [Applause] 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.100
 [Applause] 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:23.760
 and since I have already got permission to 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.260
 drill when the day of the 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:31.030
 drilling as I can 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:34.310
 from another video take out another video and 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:37.130
 we will see the result so we will check 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.230
 Let's see if we've got it right, we're not going 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.500
 accepted if we have not succeeded or if not 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:46.170
 we have approached 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.170
 it's worth nothing else until then
