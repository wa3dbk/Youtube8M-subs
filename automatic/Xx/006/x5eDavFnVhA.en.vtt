things<00:01:54.509> constantly<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.250> said<00:01:56.610> that's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
things constantly so that said that's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.389 
things constantly so that said that's
why<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.360> kind<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.780> game<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.829> tough<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.310> me

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
why that kind of game is tough for me

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.830 
why that kind of game is tough for me
but<00:01:59.549> then<00:01:59.670> people<00:01:59.880> are<00:02:00.060> telling<00:02:00.329> me<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.570> play

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
but then people are telling me just play

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.539 
but then people are telling me just play
it<00:02:00.960> how<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.140> want<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.710> don't<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.189> to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
it how you want like you don't have to

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.670 
it how you want like you don't have to
do<00:02:02.939> all<00:02:03.119> these<00:02:03.299> things<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.560> know

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
do all these things just you know

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.139 
do all these things just you know
beeline<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.610> want<00:02:05.820> through<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
beeline it if you want through the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.999 
beeline it if you want through the
storyline<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:07.049> tried<00:02:07.259> doing<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
storyline and we tried doing that at the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.139 
storyline and we tried doing that at the
end<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.429> seems<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.849> be<00:02:08.940> possible

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
end and it seems to be possible

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.260 
end and it seems to be possible
especially<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:10.110> very<00:02:10.319> easy<00:02:10.530> mode<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.060> on<00:02:12.060> that

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
especially on very easy mode so on that

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.760 
especially on very easy mode so on that
side<00:02:12.510> at

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
side at

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.610 
side at
I'll<00:02:14.220> say<00:02:14.460> this<00:02:14.840> after<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.960> fact<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.350> actually

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
work or it might be but I want to build

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.110 
work or it might be but I want to build
my<00:02:28.590> character<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.040> see<00:02:29.220> what<00:02:29.340> kind<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.610> moves

my character and see what kind of moves

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.810 
my character and see what kind of moves
I<00:02:30.300> can<00:02:30.360> like<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:31.320> know<00:02:31.350> if<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.160> concentrate<00:02:32.790> on

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
I can like you know if I concentrate on

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.990 
I can like you know if I concentrate on
a<00:02:32.940> skill<00:02:33.390> tree<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.780> stuff<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.820> was

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
a skill tree and stuff and but I was

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.800 
a skill tree and stuff and but I was
talking<00:02:36.450> about<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.320> saying<00:02:37.530> how<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:39.600> only

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
talking about it and saying how the only

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.240 
talking about it and saying how the only
reason<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.170> don't<00:02:40.410> want<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.680> invest<00:02:40.890> all<00:02:41.100> that

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
reason I don't want to invest all that

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.130 
reason I don't want to invest all that
time<00:02:41.490> in<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:41.970> because<00:02:42.390> I'm<00:02:42.540> investing<00:02:43.050> it

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
time in it is because I'm investing it

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.280 
time in it is because I'm investing it
alone<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.830> think<00:02:44.040> that's<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.370> biggest

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
alone and I think that's the biggest

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.170 
alone and I think that's the biggest
weakness<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.650> game<00:02:46.830> like<00:02:46.980> Skyrim<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.730> that

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
weakness in a game like Skyrim is that

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.420 
weakness in a game like Skyrim is that
it<00:02:48.390> isn't<00:02:48.720> cooperative<00:02:49.440> if<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.310> was

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
it isn't cooperative if it was

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.850 
it isn't cooperative if it was
cooperative<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.180> would<00:02:51.420> be<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:52.050> all<00:02:52.470> about<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.800> I

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
cooperative I would be so all about it I

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.170 
cooperative I would be so all about it I
wouldn't<00:02:53.100> care<00:02:53.400> how<00:02:53.610> much<00:02:53.760> time<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.000> was

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
wouldn't care how much time I was

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.090 
wouldn't care how much time I was
spending<00:02:54.240> in<00:02:54.720> there<00:02:54.960> you<00:02:55.470> know<00:02:55.590> tweaking

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
spending in there you know tweaking

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.890 
spending in there you know tweaking
every<00:02:56.340> last<00:02:56.520> little<00:02:56.760> stat<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.450> collecting

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
every last little stat and collecting

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.120 
every last little stat and collecting
every<00:02:58.080> last<00:02:58.230> little<00:02:58.440> thing<00:02:58.620> because<00:02:58.830> I'd<00:02:58.980> be

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
every last little thing because I'd be

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.530 
every last little thing because I'd be
doing<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.490> with<00:02:59.610> somebody<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.270> think<00:03:00.450> it

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
doing it with somebody and I think it

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.660 
doing it with somebody and I think it
would<00:03:00.630> be<00:03:00.720> more<00:03:00.900> fun<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.290> way<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.980> remember

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
would be more fun that way I remember

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.130 
would be more fun that way I remember
when<00:03:02.820> Dead<00:03:03.060> Island<00:03:03.240> came<00:03:03.660> out<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.960> might

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
when Dead Island came out you might

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.450 
when Dead Island came out you might
remember<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.560> was<00:03:04.800> really<00:03:05.420> really<00:03:06.420> mean<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.080> it

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
remember I was really really mean to it

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.760 
remember I was really really mean to it
deservedly<00:03:08.460> so<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:09.030> was<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.210> it<00:03:10.200> does<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.530> had<00:03:10.740> a

deservedly so it was a it does it had a
lot<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.160> shortcomings<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.540> but<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.470> thing

the<00:06:09.120> experience

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
the experience

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.230 
the experience
I<00:06:09.870> find<00:06:10.440> it<00:06:10.560> hard<00:06:10.800> in<00:06:11.250> a<00:06:11.490> game<00:06:11.669> like<00:06:12.060> Skyrim

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
I find it hard in a game like Skyrim

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.050 
I find it hard in a game like Skyrim
where<00:06:13.080> as<00:06:13.350> I<00:06:13.560> find<00:06:13.830> it<00:06:13.950> easy<00:06:14.220> in<00:06:14.550> a<00:06:14.640> game<00:06:14.820> like

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
where as I find it easy in a game like

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.480 
where as I find it easy in a game like
say<00:06:15.360> Chrono<00:06:15.690> Trigger<00:06:15.919> because<00:06:16.919> the<00:06:17.100> graphics

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
say Chrono Trigger because the graphics

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.700 
say Chrono Trigger because the graphics
aren't<00:06:17.669> trying<00:06:17.970> to<00:06:18.090> be<00:06:18.180> realistic<00:06:18.540> I<00:06:19.020> find<00:06:19.560> it

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
aren't trying to be realistic I find it

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.530 
aren't trying to be realistic I find it
easier<00:06:19.980> to<00:06:20.010> use<00:06:20.190> my<00:06:20.370> imagination<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:21.120> imagine

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
easier to use my imagination and imagine

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.900 
easier to use my imagination and imagine
what's<00:06:21.720> happening<00:06:22.200> you<00:06:22.680> know<00:06:22.770> just<00:06:23.400> using<00:06:23.820> the

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
what's happening you know just using the

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.420 
what's happening you know just using the
graphics<00:06:24.390> as<00:06:24.570> a<00:06:24.620> representation<00:06:25.620> of<00:06:25.800> what<00:06:26.250> is

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
graphics as a representation of what is

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.730 
graphics as a representation of what is
really<00:06:26.760> happening<00:06:26.880> and<00:06:27.300> you<00:06:28.260> kind<00:06:28.440> of<00:06:28.530> paint

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
really happening and you kind of paint

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.680 
really happening and you kind of paint
the<00:06:28.770> picture<00:06:29.070> in<00:06:29.160> your<00:06:29.190> head<00:06:29.400> but<00:06:29.669> when<00:06:29.880> Skyrim

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
the picture in your head but when Skyrim

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
is doing it kind of you know in a way

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.120 
is doing it kind of you know in a way
better<00:06:33.240> than<00:06:33.540> Chrono<00:06:33.900> Trigger<00:06:33.930> but<00:06:34.680> then<00:06:34.890> at

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
better than Chrono Trigger but then at

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.180 
better than Chrono Trigger but then at
the<00:06:35.190> same<00:06:35.400> time<00:06:35.539> not<00:06:36.539> as<00:06:36.840> good<00:06:37.680> as<00:06:37.950> your

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
the same time not as good as your

the same time not as good as your
imagination<00:06:38.400> you<00:06:39.360> hit<00:06:39.570> what's<00:06:39.810> called<00:06:40.050> the

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
imagination you hit what's called the

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.760 
imagination you hit what's called the
uncanny

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
uncanny

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.180 
uncanny
which<00:06:41.870> it<00:06:42.870> just<00:06:43.199> harms<00:06:43.470> your<00:06:43.620> suspension<00:06:44.099> of

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
which it just harms your suspension of
