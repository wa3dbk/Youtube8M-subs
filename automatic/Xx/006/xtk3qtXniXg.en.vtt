weakness in patients and as neurologist
we<00:00:20.130> think<00:00:20.340> about<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.699> as<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> disorder<00:00:21.270> that

we think about this as a disorder that

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.390 
we think about this as a disorder that
affects<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.140> upper<00:00:22.380> motor<00:00:22.560> neurons<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
lower motor neurons and you need both

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.310 
lower motor neurons and you need both
pieces<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.449> your<00:00:27.660> muscles<00:00:28.109> move

walking or sometimes starts with

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.500 
walking or sometimes starts with
weakness<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> hands<00:00:50.969> they<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.300> trouble

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
weakness of the hands they have trouble

weakness of the hands they have trouble
with<00:00:51.719> gripping<00:00:51.899> things<00:00:52.230> or<00:00:53.190> doing<00:00:53.430> things

with gripping things or doing things
with<00:00:53.789> their<00:00:53.940> hand<00:00:54.090> an<00:00:54.690> occasion<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.309> patients

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
with their hand an occasion the patients

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.520 
with their hand an occasion the patients
begin<00:00:57.000> with<00:00:57.270> weakness<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> face<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.410> they

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
begin with weakness in the face so they

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
begin with weakness in the face so they
have<00:00:58.680> trouble<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.100> talking<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.570> sometimes

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
have trouble with talking and sometimes

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.540 
have trouble with talking and sometimes
chewing<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:01.590> usually<00:01:01.890> talking<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
chewing but usually talking is the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.889 
chewing but usually talking is the
initial<00:01:02.820> thing<00:01:03.000> where<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> speech<00:01:03.539> may<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
initial thing where the speech may be a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.390 
initial thing where the speech may be a
little<00:01:04.080> bit<00:01:04.260> slurred<00:01:04.530> or<00:01:05.100> harder<00:01:05.369> to

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
little bit slurred or harder to

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.850 
little bit slurred or harder to
understand<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.960> patients<00:01:07.290> begin<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.740> those

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
understand so patients begin with those

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.250 
understand so patients begin with those
kinds<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.220> symptoms<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.930> generally<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
kinds of symptoms and generally the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260 
kinds of symptoms and generally the
disease<00:01:10.560> progresses<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.970> initial

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
disease progresses and the initial

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.850 
disease progresses and the initial
evaluation<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:13.260> include<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.590> number<00:01:13.619> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
evaluation can include a number of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.130 
evaluation can include a number of
different<00:01:13.950> tests<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.570> average<00:01:15.750> takes

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
different tests but it on average takes

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.370 
different tests but it on average takes
about<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.470> year<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.310> diagnosis<00:01:17.970> made

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
about a year to get that diagnosis made

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.810 
about a year to get that diagnosis made
because<00:01:19.380> initially<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.189> symptoms<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.700> be

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
because initially the symptoms can be

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.760 
because initially the symptoms can be
hard<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> pinpoint<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> diagnosis<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.560> sure

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
hard to pinpoint to a diagnosis for sure

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.469 
hard to pinpoint to a diagnosis for sure
and<00:01:23.189> sometimes<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> tests<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.210> are<00:01:24.330> done

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
and sometimes the tests that are done

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.179 
and sometimes the tests that are done
early<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.080> don't<00:01:25.500> always<00:01:25.680> show<00:01:26.009> the

early on don't always show the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.210 
early on don't always show the
definitive<00:01:26.729> diagnosis<00:01:27.680> but<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.829> know<00:01:28.979> that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
definitive diagnosis but we know that

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.730 
definitive diagnosis but we know that

with ALS as if these progresses people

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.710 
with ALS as if these progresses people
become<00:01:32.189> weaker<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.180> part<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> body

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
become weaker in that part of the body

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.450 
become weaker in that part of the body
either<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.229> arm<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> leg<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> face

common symptoms would include things
like<00:01:48.109> what's<00:01:48.649> called<00:01:48.829> fasciculations<00:01:49.609> which

like what's called fasciculations which

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.910 
like what's called fasciculations which
is<00:01:50.060> muscle<00:01:50.240> twitching<00:01:50.810> which<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.530> can<00:01:51.679> see

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
is muscle twitching which you can see

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.340 
is muscle twitching which you can see
under<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.369> skin<00:01:53.030> now<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:54.020> is<00:01:54.200> something

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
under the skin now that is something

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.889 
under the skin now that is something
that<00:01:54.500> occurs<00:01:54.799> in<00:01:54.950> everybody<00:01:55.310> but<00:01:55.880> when<00:01:56.750> it's

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
that occurs in everybody but when it's

that occurs in everybody but when it's
coupled<00:01:57.049> with<00:01:57.289> weakness<00:01:57.829> and<00:01:58.100> atrophied

some patients call to get an appointment

some patients call to get an appointment
themselves<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.079> we<00:02:27.230> certainly<00:02:27.379> at<00:02:27.950> Mayo<00:02:29.019> will

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
themselves and we certainly at Mayo will

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.569 
themselves and we certainly at Mayo will
be<00:02:30.200> willing<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.590> see<00:02:30.739> patients<00:02:31.129> even<00:02:31.250> without

physician referrals for things like ALS

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.780 
physician referrals for things like ALS
we<00:02:35.480> can<00:02:35.840> usually<00:02:36.590> try<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:36.950> get<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.310> type<00:02:37.760> of

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
we can usually try to get the type of

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.640 
we can usually try to get the type of
testing<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.360> is<00:02:38.480> needed<00:02:38.810> very<00:02:39.049> quickly

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
testing that is needed very quickly

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.759 
testing that is needed very quickly
so<00:02:40.660> whereas<00:02:41.660> at<00:02:41.930> home<00:02:42.079> that<00:02:42.290> may<00:02:42.379> take<00:02:42.560> more

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
so whereas at home that may take more

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.110 
so whereas at home that may take more
time<00:02:42.829> to<00:02:43.160> get<00:02:43.280> all<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.519> different<00:02:43.609> tests<00:02:44.000> done

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
time to get all the different tests done

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.940 
time to get all the different tests done
or<00:02:44.389> see<00:02:44.510> all<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.750> different<00:02:45.019> specialists<00:02:45.620> in

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
or see all the different specialists in

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.229 
or see all the different specialists in
general<00:02:46.400> we<00:02:46.489> can<00:02:46.639> get<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:46.850> done<00:02:47.000> very

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
general we can get that done very

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.420 
general we can get that done very
quickly<00:02:47.450> here<00:02:47.720> at<00:02:47.870> Mia<00:02:48.049> so<00:02:48.799> I<00:02:48.829> think<00:02:48.980> if

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
quickly here at Mia so I think if

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.940 
quickly here at Mia so I think if

the same time so when the patient comes
here<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:18.049> best<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.349> our<00:03:18.470> knowledge<00:03:18.500> we

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
here and the best of our knowledge we

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.530 
here and the best of our knowledge we
have<00:03:19.069> everything<00:03:19.310> set<00:03:19.519> up<00:03:19.849> so<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.239> patient

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540

other appointments so the requests come
in<00:03:26.599> general<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.590> appointments<00:03:27.950> are<00:03:28.010> set<00:03:28.250> up

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
in general the appointments are set up

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.270 
in general the appointments are set up
very<00:03:28.790> quickly<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.930> if<00:03:30.410> patients<00:03:30.799> for<00:03:30.919> example

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
very quickly and if patients for example

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.890 
very quickly and if patients for example
are<00:03:31.340> having<00:03:31.609> speech<00:03:31.849> trouble<00:03:32.239> then<00:03:32.690> we

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
are having speech trouble then we

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.750 
are having speech trouble then we
haven't<00:03:33.049> see<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.319> speech<00:03:33.799> pathologist<00:03:34.069> if

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
haven't see a speech pathologist if

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.280 
haven't see a speech pathologist if
they're<00:03:34.910> having<00:03:35.030> swallowing<00:03:35.630> problems<00:03:36.049> and

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
they're having swallowing problems and

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.620 
they're having swallowing problems and
we<00:03:36.380> have<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.859> special<00:03:37.250> clinic<00:03:37.639> that<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.120> looks

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
we have a special clinic that it looks

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.420 
we have a special clinic that it looks
at<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:38.959> swallowing<00:03:39.440> for<00:03:39.650> assessment<00:03:40.280> on<00:03:40.400> that

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
at the swallowing for assessment on that

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.880 
at the swallowing for assessment on that
and<00:03:40.819> also<00:03:41.180> if<00:03:41.419> there<00:03:41.630> are<00:03:41.750> treatments<00:03:42.470> or<00:03:42.560> take

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
and also if there are treatments or take

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.550 
and also if there are treatments or take
patience<00:03:43.430> can<00:03:43.550> use<00:03:43.790> we<00:03:44.690> look<00:03:44.840> at<00:03:44.960> that<00:03:45.140> those

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
patience can use we look at that those

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.990 
patience can use we look at that those
are<00:03:45.770> just<00:03:45.860> a<00:03:45.980> couple<00:03:46.130> of<00:03:46.310> examples<00:03:46.580> as

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
are just a couple of examples as

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.090 
are just a couple of examples as
mentioned<00:03:47.570> my<00:03:47.630> patients<00:03:47.960> come<00:03:48.110> in<00:03:48.260> often

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
mentioned my patients come in often

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.610 
mentioned my patients come in often
times<00:03:49.280> part<00:03:50.180> of<00:03:50.240> that<00:03:50.360> evaluation<00:03:50.660> is<00:03:51.200> an<00:03:51.350> EMG

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
times part of that evaluation is an EMG

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.310 
times part of that evaluation is an EMG
or<00:03:51.860> electromyogram<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.600> that's<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.930> study

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
or electromyogram and that's a study

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.470 
or electromyogram and that's a study
where<00:03:54.650> we<00:03:54.680> give<00:03:55.130> some<00:03:55.340> electrical<00:03:55.850> shocks<00:03:56.180> to

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
where we give some electrical shocks to

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.330 
where we give some electrical shocks to
the<00:03:56.570> nerve<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.140> measure<00:03:57.680> how<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:57.890> nerves<00:03:58.130> are

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
the nerve and measure how the nerves are

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.100 
the nerve and measure how the nerves are
working<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:58.850> then<00:03:59.120> we<00:03:59.210> use<00:03:59.420> a<00:03:59.450> little<00:03:59.600> needle

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
working and then we use a little needle

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.960 
working and then we use a little needle
put<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.710> under<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.070> skin<00:04:01.280> into<00:04:01.490> the<00:04:01.640> muscle

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
put it under the skin into the muscle

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.610 
put it under the skin into the muscle
and<00:04:02.150> assess<00:04:02.780> how<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:02.960> muscles<00:04:03.410> are<00:04:03.500> working

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
and assess how the muscles are working

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.680 
and assess how the muscles are working
so<00:04:04.490> that's<00:04:04.610> usually<00:04:04.880> part<00:04:05.300> of<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.540> evaluation

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
so that's usually part of the evaluation

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.480 
so that's usually part of the evaluation
for<00:04:06.260> just<00:04:06.470> about<00:04:06.560> every<00:04:06.860> patient<00:04:07.190> with<00:04:07.400> the

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
for just about every patient with the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.460 
for just about every patient with the
question<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:07.910> ALS<00:04:08.270> is<00:04:08.570> that's<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.990> very

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
question of ALS is that's a very

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.430 
question of ALS is that's a very
important<00:04:09.950> diagnostic<00:04:10.220> tool<00:04:10.760> in<00:04:11.320> general<00:04:12.320> we

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
important diagnostic tool in general we

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.470 
important diagnostic tool in general we
may<00:04:12.740> be<00:04:12.800> ordering<00:04:13.130> some<00:04:13.310> blood<00:04:13.490> tests<00:04:13.940> we<00:04:14.150> may

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
may be ordering some blood tests we may

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.930 
may be ordering some blood tests we may
be<00:04:14.540> wanting<00:04:15.320> some<00:04:15.800> MRI<00:04:16.070> scans<00:04:16.489> or<00:04:16.790> other

have been done locally and we can review
those<00:04:22.580> ourselves<00:04:23.210> we<00:04:23.960> generally<00:04:24.350> have

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
those ourselves we generally have

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.560 
those ourselves we generally have
patients<00:04:25.010> evaluated<00:04:25.520> by<00:04:25.640> a<00:04:25.669> rehabilitation

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
patients evaluated by a rehabilitation

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
therapy their speech trouble we have

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.180 
therapy their speech trouble we have
speech<00:04:32.450> specialists<00:04:33.080> involved<00:04:33.950> if<00:04:34.070> they're

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
speech specialists involved if they're

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.950 
speech specialists involved if they're
swallowing<00:04:34.700> issues<00:04:35.240> than<00:04:35.690> we<00:04:35.810> have

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
swallowing issues than we have

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.230 
swallowing issues than we have
swallowing<00:04:36.410> experts<00:04:36.800> involved<00:04:37.280> if<00:04:38.030> there's

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
swallowing experts involved if there's

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.150 
swallowing experts involved if there's
breathing<00:04:38.600> problems<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.230> we<00:04:39.320> have<00:04:39.440> pulmonary

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
breathing problems and we have pulmonary

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.070 
breathing problems and we have pulmonary
doctors<00:04:40.730> or<00:04:40.910> lung<00:04:41.120> doctors<00:04:41.540> available<00:04:41.660> as

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
doctors or lung doctors available as

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.440 
doctors or lung doctors available as
well<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.680> so<00:04:43.280> that<00:04:43.310> initial<00:04:43.790> diagnosis

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
well and so that initial diagnosis

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.780 
well and so that initial diagnosis
really<00:04:44.930> is<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.350> team<00:04:45.620> approach<00:04:45.770> where<00:04:46.220> one<00:04:46.640> may

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
really is a team approach where one may

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.250 
really is a team approach where one may
be<00:04:46.850> seeing<00:04:47.180> multiple<00:04:47.330> different<00:04:47.720> physicians

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
be seeing multiple different physicians

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.530 
be seeing multiple different physicians
and<00:04:48.560> also<00:04:49.430> having<00:04:49.760> some<00:04:50.030> tests<00:04:50.360> especially

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
and also having some tests especially

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.290 
and also having some tests especially
the<00:04:50.870> EMG<00:04:51.050> study<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:52.220> try<00:04:52.370> to<00:04:52.430> then<00:04:52.760> come<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.270> a

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
the EMG study to try to then come to a

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.060 
the EMG study to try to then come to a
conclusion<00:04:53.419> and<00:04:54.050> I<00:04:54.229> would<00:04:54.410> say<00:04:54.560> in<00:04:54.680> most<00:04:54.800> cases

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
conclusion and I would say in most cases

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.150 
conclusion and I would say in most cases
after<00:04:55.910> several<00:04:56.390> days<00:04:56.540> of<00:04:56.900> testing<00:04:57.350> then<00:04:57.620> we<00:04:57.830> as

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
after several days of testing then we as

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.680 
after several days of testing then we as
neurologists<00:04:58.820> then<00:04:58.910> we<00:04:59.060> meet<00:04:59.180> back<00:04:59.360> with<00:04:59.600> the

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
neurologists then we meet back with the

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.450 
neurologists then we meet back with the
patient<00:05:00.050> and<00:05:00.200> family<00:05:00.440> go<00:05:01.160> through<00:05:01.190> the

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
patient and family go through the

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.219 
patient and family go through the
results<00:05:01.760> of<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:01.910> tests<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.510> talk<00:05:02.840> about<00:05:02.990> the

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
results of the tests and talk about the

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.930 
results of the tests and talk about the
diagnosis<00:05:04.150> so<00:05:05.150> obviously<00:05:05.510> we<00:05:06.729> really<00:05:07.729> try<00:05:07.910> to

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
diagnosis so obviously we really try to

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.190 
diagnosis so obviously we really try to
spend<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.240> lot<00:05:08.360> of<00:05:08.390> time<00:05:08.600> with<00:05:08.780> patients<00:05:08.900> and

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
spend a lot of time with patients and

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.110 
spend a lot of time with patients and
Families<00:05:09.590> this<00:05:09.919> is<00:05:10.070> really<00:05:10.310> oftentimes

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
Families this is really oftentimes

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.330 
Families this is really oftentimes
really<00:05:11.479> devastating<00:05:12.140> diagnosis<00:05:12.680> and<00:05:13.010> many

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
really devastating diagnosis and many

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.330 
really devastating diagnosis and many
times<00:05:13.640> patients<00:05:14.540> or<00:05:15.169> families<00:05:15.560> have<00:05:15.890> that<00:05:15.919> on

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
times patients or families have that on

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.409 
times patients or families have that on
their<00:05:16.490> mind<00:05:16.669> when<00:05:16.850> they<00:05:16.880> come<00:05:17.150> here<00:05:17.360> that

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
their mind when they come here that

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:18.969 
their mind when they come here that
somebody's<00:05:17.900> been<00:05:18.020> told<00:05:18.290> that<00:05:18.560> that's<00:05:18.770> likely

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
somebody's been told that that's likely

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.350 
somebody's been told that that's likely
what<00:05:19.220> you<00:05:19.340> have<00:05:19.490> but<00:05:19.700> they're<00:05:19.850> coming<00:05:20.120> here<00:05:20.300> to

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
what you have but they're coming here to

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.540 
what you have but they're coming here to
hope<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.290> we<00:05:21.380> can<00:05:21.500> find<00:05:21.680> something<00:05:21.890> else<00:05:22.100> and

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
hope that we can find something else and

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.070 
hope that we can find something else and
obviously<00:05:23.270> we<00:05:23.390> do<00:05:23.510> everything<00:05:23.720> we<00:05:23.900> can<00:05:24.020> to

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
obviously we do everything we can to

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.810 
obviously we do everything we can to
find<00:05:24.290> something<00:05:24.680> else<00:05:24.860> but<00:05:25.100> many<00:05:25.370> times<00:05:25.580> we

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
find something else but many times we

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.000 
find something else but many times we
cannot<00:05:26.180> so<00:05:27.080> we<00:05:27.200> spend<00:05:27.470> a<00:05:27.530> lot<00:05:27.560> of<00:05:27.680> time<00:05:27.890> with

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
cannot so we spend a lot of time with

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.380

patients<00:06:19.290> do<00:06:19.380> not<00:06:19.500> have<00:06:19.650> to<00:06:19.800> go<00:06:19.920> all<00:06:20.040> over<00:06:20.070> the

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
patients do not have to go all over the

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.160 
patients do not have to go all over the
clinic<00:06:20.670> and<00:06:20.910> wait<00:06:21.180> several<00:06:21.420> days<00:06:21.540> everything

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
clinic and wait several days everything

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.900 
clinic and wait several days everything
is<00:06:22.230> just<00:06:22.410> done<00:06:22.560> in<00:06:22.710> one<00:06:22.920> day<00:06:22.950> getting<00:06:23.790> all

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
is just done in one day getting all

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.970 
is just done in one day getting all
those<00:06:24.090> things<00:06:24.300> done<00:06:24.480> and<00:06:25.470> I<00:06:25.620> think<00:06:25.800> in<00:06:25.860> that

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
those things done and I think in that

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.870 
those things done and I think in that
way<00:06:26.040> we<00:06:26.370> can<00:06:26.550> really<00:06:26.790> try<00:06:27.120> to<00:06:27.150> treat<00:06:28.140> patients

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
way we can really try to treat patients

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.060 
way we can really try to treat patients
to<00:06:29.880> maximum<00:06:30.390> benefit<00:06:30.960> and<00:06:31.200> I<00:06:31.260> think<00:06:31.500> we<00:06:31.650> really

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
to maximum benefit and I think we really

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.560 
to maximum benefit and I think we really
focus<00:06:32.460> on<00:06:32.580> the<00:06:32.670> quality<00:06:32.760> of<00:06:33.000> life<00:06:33.180> and<00:06:33.390> doing

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
focus on the quality of life and doing

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.560 
focus on the quality of life and doing
everything<00:06:33.750> we<00:06:33.960> can<00:06:34.170> to<00:06:34.380> make<00:06:35.040> sure<00:06:35.570> patients

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
everything we can to make sure patients

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.060 
everything we can to make sure patients
have<00:06:36.780> everything<00:06:37.260> that<00:06:37.290> they<00:06:37.530> need<00:06:37.800> to

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
have everything that they need to

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.520 
have everything that they need to
maximize<00:06:38.580> our<00:06:39.030> quality<00:06:39.300> of<00:06:39.330> life<00:06:39.390> as<00:06:39.870> we<00:06:40.380> know

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
maximize our quality of life as we know

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.140 
maximize our quality of life as we know
there's<00:06:40.860> no<00:06:41.010> treatment<00:06:41.550> there's<00:06:41.700> no<00:06:41.790> cure

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
there's no treatment there's no cure

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.030 
there's no treatment there's no cure
they<00:06:42.660> can<00:06:42.690> fix<00:06:43.020> this<00:06:43.230> disease<00:06:43.530> and<00:06:43.710> make<00:06:43.830> it<00:06:43.950> go

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
they can fix this disease and make it go

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.790 
they can fix this disease and make it go
away<00:06:44.420> but<00:06:45.420> we<00:06:45.870> generally<00:06:46.320> take<00:06:46.470> the<00:06:46.620> approach

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
away but we generally take the approach

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.460 
away but we generally take the approach
that<00:06:46.830> it's<00:06:47.220> not<00:06:47.610> a<00:06:47.640> curable<00:06:47.970> disease<00:06:48.120> yet<00:06:48.690> but

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
that it's not a curable disease yet but

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.260 
that it's not a curable disease yet but
it<00:06:49.590> is<00:06:49.620> a<00:06:49.710> treatable<00:06:50.040> disease<00:06:50.190> and<00:06:50.760> we<00:06:51.060> can<00:06:51.180> do

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
it is a treatable disease and we can do
