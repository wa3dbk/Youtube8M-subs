but they do need light all you need is
growing<00:01:42.220> blocks<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.729> some<00:01:43.299> light<00:01:43.479> so<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:43.990> have

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
growing blocks and some light so we have

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.410 
growing blocks and some light so we have
diamond<00:01:44.860> here<00:01:45.190> we<00:01:45.370> have<00:01:45.490> ironed<00:01:45.820> their<00:01:46.000> gold

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
diamond here we have ironed their gold

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.859 
diamond here we have ironed their gold
redstone<00:01:47.380> lapis<00:01:47.979> emerald<00:01:48.540> glowstone<00:01:49.540> and

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
redstone lapis emerald glowstone and

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.219 
redstone lapis emerald glowstone and
other<00:01:50.140> quartz<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:51.330> they<00:01:52.330> do<00:01:52.390> take<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:52.960> little

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
other quartz and they do take a little

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.710 
other quartz and they do take a little
bit<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.440> time<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:54.250> grow<00:01:54.790> but<00:01:55.030> not<00:01:55.180> that<00:01:55.360> long<00:01:55.510> I

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
bit of time to grow but not that long I

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.120 
bit of time to grow but not that long I
mean<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:55.930> could<00:01:56.020> get<00:01:56.170> full<00:01:56.350> diamond<00:01:56.590> armor

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
mean you could get full diamond armor

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
mean you could get full diamond armor
and<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:58.630> an<00:01:58.780> hour<00:01:59.020> or<00:01:59.590> two<00:01:59.619> so<00:02:00.580> basically

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
and like an hour or two so basically

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.910 
and like an hour or two so basically
this<00:02:01.270> is<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.479> good<00:02:01.720> mod<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:02.140> get<00:02:02.290> unlimited<00:02:02.440> of

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
this is a good mod to get unlimited of

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.859 
this is a good mod to get unlimited of
any<00:02:03.100> resource<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:04.119> could<00:02:04.240> also<00:02:04.360> do<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.689> for

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.420 
wrong or it's currently bugged or
something<00:03:37.630> I<00:03:37.810> think<00:03:38.230> it's<00:03:38.350> just<00:03:38.380> bugged<00:03:38.739> but

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
something I think it's just bugged but

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.000 
something I think it's just bugged but
it<00:03:39.850> should<00:03:40.060> be<00:03:40.090> working<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.870> for<00:03:41.800> whatever

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
it should be working and for whatever

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.820 
it should be working and for whatever
you<00:03:42.280> used<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.640> quartz<00:03:43.060> glowstone<00:03:43.540> emerald<00:03:44.050> iron

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
you used I quartz glowstone emerald iron

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.920 
you used I quartz glowstone emerald iron
diamond<00:03:45.280> coal<00:03:45.520> whatever<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.330> you<00:03:46.360> use<00:03:46.630> each

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
diamond coal whatever that you use each

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.570 
diamond coal whatever that you use each
read<00:03:47.260> will<00:03:48.160> equal<00:03:48.880> 1<00:03:49.180> or<00:03:50.080> resource<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.310> return

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
read will equal 1 or resource and return

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.340 
read will equal 1 or resource and return
so<00:03:51.820> when<00:03:52.000> fully<00:03:52.239> grown<00:03:52.330> you'll<00:03:52.720> get<00:03:52.870> three<00:03:53.140> out

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
so when fully grown you'll get three out

so when fully grown you'll get three out
of<00:03:53.500> each<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:54.070> return<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.150> is<00:03:55.270> a<00:03:55.300> great

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
of each and return so this is a great

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.229 
of each and return so this is a great
way<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.810> get<00:03:56.380> tons<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:57.100> tons<00:03:57.280> of<00:03:57.489> diamond<00:03:57.970> and

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
not have to go mining for it and like

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.820

able to make some cool stuff in your
Minecraft<00:04:15.310> Walters<00:04:15.640> you<00:04:15.730> won't<00:04:15.910> have<00:04:16.000> to

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
Minecraft Walters you won't have to

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.610 
Minecraft Walters you won't have to
worry<00:04:16.120> about<00:04:16.390> going<00:04:17.049> around<00:04:17.230> getting

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
resources and whatnot so I think it's a

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.479 
resources and whatnot so I think it's a
very<00:04:19.180> useful<00:04:19.390> mod<00:04:19.750> some<00:04:20.650> people<00:04:20.980> if<00:04:21.160> you<00:04:21.310> like
