so you don't want to be doing films like

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.800 
so you don't want to be doing films like
this<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:20.010> I<00:01:20.610> control<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.420> my<00:01:21.570> phone

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
this but if I control it on my phone

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.649 
this but if I control it on my phone
right<00:01:21.869> now<00:01:22.580> it's<00:01:23.580> good<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.180> show<00:01:24.420> photos<00:01:25.170> as

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
right now it's good to show photos as

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.830 
right now it's good to show photos as
it's<00:01:27.659> good<00:01:27.960> quality<00:01:29.420> but<00:01:31.159> yeah<00:01:32.540> that's<00:01:33.540> it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
it's good quality but yeah that's it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.420 
it's good quality but yeah that's it
really<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.470> I'm<00:01:35.189> guessing<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.090> get<00:01:36.360> games

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
really and I'm guessing if you get games

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.429 
really and I'm guessing if you get games
and<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.579> play<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.060> games<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.259> will

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and you play the games on here it will

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.850 
and you play the games on here it will
be<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> bit<00:01:40.950> laggy<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.729> won't<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.329> best

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
be a bit laggy it won't be the best

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.280 
be a bit laggy it won't be the best
because<00:01:43.860> I'll<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.430> show<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:45.150> temple<00:01:46.110> 1

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
because I'll just show you what temple 1

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.230 
because I'll just show you what temple 1
2<00:01:46.650> will<00:01:46.920> look<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:48.320> as<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.030> see

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
2 will look like on here as you can see

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.039 
2 will look like on here as you can see
very<00:01:51.270> laggy<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:53.990> if<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.409> go<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.829> play<00:01:56.630> it's<00:01:57.630> very

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
very laggy so if I go and play it's very

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.580 
very laggy so if I go and play it's very
likely<00:01:59.479> but<00:02:00.479> all<00:02:02.810> software's<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.290> get

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
likely but all software's that you get

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.060 
likely but all software's that you get
to<00:02:04.860> record<00:02:05.369> all<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.630> them<00:02:06.840> will<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.500> E<00:02:07.530> but

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
to record all of them will be like E but

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.170 
to record all of them will be like E but
