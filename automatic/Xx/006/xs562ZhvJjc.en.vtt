00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.479
 hello beautiful welcome to the channel the 

00:00:02.249 --> 00:00:06.299
 today I bring you this makeup 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:09.299
 that is from scratch to the end is a 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.460
 uy warrior with me and I maquillen 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.099
 this specific makeup is for 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.650
 photography so you can use it with a 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.630
 little less of products and they have left for 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.090
 a newspaper or for an exit but 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.070
 specifically this video is for photos 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.930
 let's start by applying a first 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.300
 I'm using the professional 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.370
 benefit and I'll let you know also 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.309
 for the eyebrows is the first thing I do 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.379
 then I'm going to take one more corrector 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.269
 clarito that of my skin tone two or 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.160
 three tones and I'm going to blur it 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.160
 perfectly on the upper eyelids 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.920
 then I'm going to take a shade of color 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.020
 orange coffee mate and I'm going to blur 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.790
 without any specific technique a 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.980
 only what I want is to give 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.980
 depth in the crease of the eye 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.320
 with the same brush we will take the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.690
 chocolate brown shadow with 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.840
 shines that this palette has and we're going 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.670
 to apply on the outside of the eye and 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.700
 we will also spread it only 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.490
 I also want to give more dimension to 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.300
 eyeball then let's take the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.640
 shadow that is like a mole tone but with 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.310
 brightness is bright this shadow is going to 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.920
 help to give even more dimension to 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.040
 our eyeball and I'm going to put it to 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.110
 pats on the eyelid moore 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.720
 and then I'm going to take the color zone 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.300
 black and I'm going to use it to make my 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.360
 outlined as how this mind I am not 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.700
 using no liquid eyeliner or 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.510
 in gel only the shadow to give 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.980
 dimension to the upper lashes 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.160
 then I'm going to curl the lashes and 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.870
 apply my mascara 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.240
 whenever they do not download them, they launch sushi 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.220
 and then my eyelashes fell 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.000
 but here they are are those of xichú 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.910
 it's the elizabeth that are very pretty 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.240
 and I'm going to apply them first by putting them 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.250
 in the center of the mobile eyelid and then 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.440
 joining or gluing the two corners of 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.120
 the ends for the face I'm 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.160
 using a makeup base that 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.590
 the best is a bit darker but 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.050
 remember that in the photos almost always 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.520
 she eats the makeup horribly the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.070
 photo the flash or disappears 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.739
 practically and we look whiter than 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.470
 what we really are and we have the 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.810
 effect pan glass after I'll light up 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.550
 below the eyes with a concealer 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.370
 which is a clearer key 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.010
 my skin tone and I'm going to blur it 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.070
 perfectly with a small brush and 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.590
 this will help us level and attract 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.390
 attention in the upper parts of the 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.490
 face 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.430
 with the same brush and the product I will 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.610
 blur what remains in the in the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.380
 brush under my nose and 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.090
 upper part of the mouth 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.230
 I will illuminate only the part 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.380
 central bridge of my nose and these 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:10.390
 two areas below the mouth that we 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.390
 they help lift the smile 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.019
 then I'm going to take a concealer a 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.269
 much darker but it is a tone the 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.269
 pores he is not does not have an orange tone 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.849
 but on the contrary it has a yellow coffee 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.819
 that helps us give a contour a 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.859
 Pretty visible control for photos 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.609
 and I'm going to blur it up with the 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:36.400
 same brush that we have blurred the 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.430
 clear parts later I'm going to seal this 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.060
 with discounting profiled of the face with 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.909
 a shadow that has its autonomous 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.340
 pink orange that they from the mark of 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.709
 anastasia and I'll put it to pat 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.970
 do not drag it just taps 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.950
 will give us that is the nuance and give 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.189
 the skin we need in the parts 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.790
 high later I'm going to take a tonality 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:07.450
 which is a matte coffee also without any 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.750
 tonality this no its tone tone 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.879
 reddish and I'll blur it below 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.859
 of the cheeks below the bones 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.859
 of my cheeks of course very many 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.959
 thanks more a kiss for my husband 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.639
 and we are going to blur it perfectly if 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.740
 they are fixed I am using a brush 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.930
 quite fat and I am simply 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.719
 'pachorra' not for me to give me that 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:34.560
 contour that is very linear and blur it 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:34.560
 upwards 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.350
 and then I'm going to light the bones of 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.570
 my cheeks with a little dance and 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.570
 I am using this illuminator that is 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.970
 the one of to face the light caldén gives a 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.070
 lighting between gold and rose that to me 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.440
 I like it and then I'll go back to 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.950
 take the shadow truck which is a coffee 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.270
 reddish with glitters and I'm going to put it 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.060
 under the ocu to not lose 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.670
 dimension without being something marked after 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.830
 I'm going to use a much more shadow 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.470
 clarita in golden rose and I'll 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.020
 use to illuminate the animal after 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.970
 for the lips I'm using this is 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.310
 my usual lipstick also from now on 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.880
 I'm always using it, which is 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.040
 very neutral in its rosy tone and I'm going to 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.400
 give definition in the corners about 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.670
 everything with this eyeliner that is a tone 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.280
 amazing pink coffee that this tonality 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.500
 it really favors us a lot to do 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.240
 lip contour 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.730
 as a last step I'm applying mask 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.580
 of tabs and you can fly here what 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.490
 they have the final result for the face 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.180
 it is very called a lot of attention on 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.640
 all the photos find one that presides 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.030
 the match of the skin of the face with that of 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.330
 shoulders and when you release the flash 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:58.420
 well you do not see absolutely this any 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:02.260
 shine that was not our face 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.660
 Normal in person for red lips 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.580
 They have also asked me a lot 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.770
 can transform this look that is so 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.960
 light also in the eyes is not very 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.350
 loaded then we apply the eyeliner in 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.150
 matte red color and apply over a 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.370
 lipstick to seal what is going to 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.130
 help us to last throughout the 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.460
 session or the event and that 's how it is 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:27.430
 see a little more dramatic though 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.470
 for my taste it looks much better you know 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.760
 I'm Mr. Histogram and so 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.100
