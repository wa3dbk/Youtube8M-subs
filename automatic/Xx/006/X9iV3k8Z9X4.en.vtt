00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 so have just trained on the right 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.970
 then we have found separately on the left 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.429
 Now that we are both sides 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.780
 So we play the right way we play 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.759
 first time on the 9th 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.349
 then the tens comes like the right one 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.260
 side and afterwards playmaker over it 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.650
 nils on the left side continue hannes 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.420
 vegan 6 and again shortly 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.330
 play daniel course correct so ok 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.830
 Soon he stop one if we again 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.650
 new starts again is in the case 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.669
 daniel is a bit pure, we go 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.059
 we go in a little bit in there 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.129
 clean that his position okay okay first 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.510
 It only needs to come in two three times 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.480
 you get a feel for such a thing 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.480
 right left to right left to play 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.680
 Ok, the thing is always why 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.440
 we actually do the exercise 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.660
 Fact is easy 99 10 are always 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.600
 in opposite direction that means when you come 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.580
 do you stay away and afterwards reverse that 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.510
 If you are a bit after 4.23 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.340
 meter forward 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.220
 the sense is now an advantage with 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.380
 should go with the so if you then 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.030
 played the game you say you stay 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.280
 away is also already out of the cover 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.120
 shadow play out now so and so 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.130
 now 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.260
 and that's exactly what deciding 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.090
 Now you can play the ball on then off 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.640
 , game on the 7 you can not half as 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.420
 go there that is the only correct 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.100
 play dynamic games and 32 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.460
 meters away very quickly and there you have to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.760
 So again come soon tempo 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.040
 is good but now this action is the ball 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.619
 play has to make an extra work 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.790
 to do dirty work the opponent 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.710
 really to deal with 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.780
 You can now do that for two meters 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.150
 Ignite a short two meters 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.950
 I want to see that again and yes, too 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.600
 all ready so if you have the ball 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.130
 has played a 12 meters again 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.119
 extra work that you have to do that we have to 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.610
 let them go now 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.380

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.800
 you again young 1 daniel 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.830
 stay away, create space again 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.260
 Okay, let's leave it three times four times 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.910
 without you growing up both six 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.740
 34 times right before left means for you 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.390
 working properly and 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.940
 design work it once so 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.319
 endlessly goes over again that is 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.420
 he sixth hardly pauses for 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.740
 because of course you have 34 now 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.410
 quick actions but that can 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.790
 Game had to be had now 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.650

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.060
 Walk tunings must be good room 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.040
 Creating space again must be good 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.709
 and of course we all have to 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:07.610

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:10.680
