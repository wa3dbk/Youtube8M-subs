 hello welcome to the sandy channel today 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.660
 I 'm going to teach you how to make homemade ricotta 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.860
 The ingredients are the following 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.690
 lemon milk what we are going to do is I 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.689
 I'm going to make 3 liters of milk so 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.880
 for every liter of milk is a lemon 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.920
 lemon has to be so soft 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.170
 soft, the softer the better 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.600
 well we've already taken the milk in 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.160
 bowl and then we have to stir 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.620
 we will continuously lower it 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.600
 little fire so it does not escape and 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.640
 we're going to throw the juice of three lemons 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.640
 because they are three liters of milk 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.850
 Now let's see how it started 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:55.199
 curdle curdles quickly you start 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.000
 to disarm the milk and the serum remains 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.810
 above 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.650
 begins to make the ricotta we are going to 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.210
 have a little longer in boiling and 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.340
 then we will let him rest 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.740
 well now what we are going to do is 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.670
 throw the curd in this box that prepares 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.670
 with this colander 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.140
 well now what are we going to do with the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.300
 help from a spoon slowly go 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:31.490
 pressing for the serum to come out 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.490
 until you get it right, entourage 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.410
