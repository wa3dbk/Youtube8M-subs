00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 Water 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.209
 Water 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.380
 or not 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.020
 hello how about friends here I bring you my 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.439
 5 pokemon most useful pokemon white 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.849
 and black according to my opinion and experience 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.830
 I clarify once that if you do not like them 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.260
 the pokemones that I chose not to go 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.090
 saying nonsense or anything like that 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.160
 It's just my opinion and if you do not like it 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.620
 good for you to see if you can choose 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.040
 better pokémons than me well tell us 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.290
 well in position number 5 we have 6 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.690
 myth to this pokemon despite not being 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.850
 very attractive there is quite strong 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.470
 his attacks are good and it's good 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.110
 resistant and I say it from experience 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.059
 although its speed is not the best but 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.949
 it's enough but I really have not 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.600
 had a lot of chance to use this 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.729
 pokemon so I do not have much 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.040
 recommendation about him but I do not know what 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.950
 do you think now in the number position 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.990
 4 we have acro combine your attack is very 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.360
 good and effective but its speed 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.400
 attack is also not the best and its defense 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.290
 It's not the best thing that helps the most 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.270
 this pokemon and that's why I put it in this 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.420
 put those attacks he learns how 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.060
 grind dig and y good 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.280
 this pokemon is not a good idea to use it with 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.470
 pokemons type water and apart is not very 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.240
 resistant but its attack and its appearance 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.240
 of intimidation made him put it in 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.850
 this post now we are going in the 3rd position 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.680
 is in downloading this fire type pokemon me 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.720
 like for its appearance and its shape 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.600
 turbulent his great attack is very strong 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.180
 the movements are good strong and their 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.340
 hp or ps as it comes out in the game is very 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.649
 high your attack speed is also 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.780
 something formidable about him but I do not say what 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.789
 same of your defense but what you do not have 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.860
 defense has it attack but still 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.869
 so it's tough enough 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.360
 but against a water type it falls short 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.880
 still it deserves this third place 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.679
 aside this was my initiation pokemon 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.659
 I started with tepic and then I went to 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.690
 pinilla and then to enter and the truth 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.819
 it's one of my good favorites in the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.920
 put number 2 we have a pokemon 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.989
 dragon type called absolute this 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.269
 Pokemon its appearance is very good 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.430
 well I like his attack is something of 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.920
 admire since its defense is very good 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.200
 it's not bad but your hp or ps is not what 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.850
 better although its speed is not so 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.230
 bad but its attack speed 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.480
 it is definitely 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.670
 because it has but good movements 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.830
 they are good and very effective so I do not know 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.690
 you can ask much despite his hp 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.879
 that is not very good but after all 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.500
 this pokemon I choose as the second 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.050
 best 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.910
 and good in the number one position for 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.920
 me is the strongest of white pokemon and 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.770
 black would be nothing more and nothing less than 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.650
 dragon this dragon type pokemon and dark 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.630
 it's pretty strong your hp or ps is good 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.580
 but not as much as his attack but his 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.650
 attack speed is maybe the 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.930
 movements that you learn are very good 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.690
 but that depends on how you choose them 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.850
 its appearance is very cool its colors 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.980
 I also like them and the truth is that this 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.390
 pokemon his defense is not bad at 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.400
 same as its speed 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.260
 this pokemon is very skillful although it costs 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.480
 have it since its evolution is up to 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.820
 level 65 so you have to have patience 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.580
 because its evolution is not as fast as 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.430
 the one of edward level 36 or absolute level 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.410
 48 but the truth is worth it in my 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.260
 I recommend this pokemon 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.270
 his team good friends that was all 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.310
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.900
 before finishing I clarify that I did not put 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.850
 makes promo reside because I did not want 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.380
 put legendary pokémons and even though 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.959
 play white or black pokemon 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.209
 they will always give you one of the two 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.370
 would be scepter to me reside there are also others 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.470
 hidden legendaries look in 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.540
 youtube how they are achieved but 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.970
