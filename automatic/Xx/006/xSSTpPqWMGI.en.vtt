00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.700
 the militancy the day before to proceed is clearly welcome 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.570
 Berlin welcome to me so Zorc clicked for my poor 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.650
 Conference and today is about a guitar product of 1 6 and indeed happy 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.779
 the answer 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.829
 Everything included saw us from the app pot 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.140
 technology 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.570
 which are usually in the bottom pedals and the beans wealthy 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.840
 Devices are to be found 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.240
 Erkelenz often gets in touch with a small one 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.290
 Pastor Interface what should I do here 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.580
 This is 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.890
 the greed box 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.760
 the IPO for the TV 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 and briefly shown 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.280
 Guitar input 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.740
 if the level is too high volume the field strength 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.390
 and behind there are two analog outputs 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.640
 the series out that means that 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.310
 unadulterated stage win days then out again 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.270
 the head and foot below us and must b 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.640
 that all the cars are there that you can possibly continue with the guitar 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.140
 behind an amplifier or in conflict 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.620
 can give other recordings devices 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.650
 I always care about it 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.110
 Bucher such information Digital Innovation 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.400
 that reflect what percent 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.180
 a magnificent and amp can go again and that is still 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.880
 the point with Georg Huber and taken down that is the game around 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.880
 the guitar is set with a mixture so its still form 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.710
 in a low voice 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.710
 Savant's question 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560
 Find tomorrow 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.440
 then Prince dipped 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.320
 Now Sam can return so it never goes distortion 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.909
 that's what the old one 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.479
 Amplifiers from the fifties went well and that's about it 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.940
 worth striving is actually 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.520
 the application looks from the outside 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.520
 Radio Ben Mates amplifier 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.159
 to a bar 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.419
 If we live in Red they will be shown here too 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.479
 and depending on what you just quoted from 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.439
 For example, Storm Bockshorn there are various 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.119
 Opportunities you can here 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.479
 Patzer was or percent compressors 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:34.739
 were among them too 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.929
 continue connecting 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:38.569
 because invite him 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.019
 the whole thing will be before the race 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.379
 happen 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.230
 then there is still behind the fight that there are no amplifiers 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.229
 and what eventually happens after the microphone pickup happens a compressor 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.469
 alone «The Cube» modulation so effects the LEG and 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.930
 because suddenly all around tendered how to recognize this here on the display 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.639
 If you look like the entire capital, that's what this chain is all about 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.379
 compromising 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.369
 which is extremely dependent on this rally clarification and also by Dr 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.219
 Breker comment on this, I'll come right back 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.209
 because and that is actually the only criticism that I have in this whole 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.269
 Event there is a june hard IT solved quite well 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.859
 we want to pick up the title there 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:31.609
 Aachen stood 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.429
 the tuner said Stern 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:36.649
 and not to determine different club frequencies 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.559
 but we stay at 44 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:41.449
 then I have a distant carries 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:42.639
 the iceman 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.509
 the thing that was meant for bassists 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.629
 and down the state parliament by percent not last by 1 let the lung 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.409
 live 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.339
 with a maximum of 10 a box quite classic configuration 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:57.869
 and around no fence the frame has very often surfaced in music history 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:59.599
 still shows up and percent 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.409
 i am also very treasured and be celebrated and travel 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.129
 no device 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.579
 scraper 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.979
 me up here 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.319
 as Don built a compressor 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.360
 and 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.699
 designed with this compressor over tax 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.779
 the first channel Munich air compressor radiated 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.779
 Kling sucked 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.590
 should the citizens should 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:47.289
 Oberursel - from now on he is not alone 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.060
 a Hyundai this application area 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.259
 the Terminator does not change anything 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.430
 in the other countries of Europe and Asia and in that function 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.689
 Ben 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.279
 Dr 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:28.279
 Bennett 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.580
 the Independent 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.479
 but I played it 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.559
 come with Rita Rapp 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:12.919
 Center-Forward the piece Peter asks the chapel Stratocaster and Trifolium 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:14.110
 on 2 3 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.680
 Goal on goal under 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.919
 a kind of 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.430
 Helen Mirren 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.430
 vary in addition to beautiful names 

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:36.730
 that's all 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.069
 with this song because we see him as he is 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:43.069
 07 07 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.770
 to find the distortions 

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:07.119
 I really wanted 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:11.539
 Longer rings louder 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.300
 would have been mutilated 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.330
 in conjunction with the 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.130
 why as a compliment 2 045 points 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:21.789
 implemented 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:26.330
 in that one can err from Erhard Drews is either in the fish mp3s country 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.229
 or one cantonal 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:32.989
 from noise 016 percent Gentex download to the man 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:36.850
 here are there until the end of August and 12 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.850
 here Sparkassen read Ernst all around 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.490
 the TuS Recke honored and there I stood 

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:45.900
 and look how it sounds
