and as a battery of 10 kilowatt hours

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.219 
and as a battery of 10 kilowatt hours
that<00:01:11.820> enables<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:13.030> bike<00:01:13.210> to<00:01:13.600> go<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:13.870> range

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
that enables the bike to go a range

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.760

between<00:01:15.060> 100<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.180> 200<00:01:16.479> kilometers<00:01:17.229> on<00:01:17.409> one

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
between 100 and 200 kilometers on one

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.120 
between 100 and 200 kilometers on one
single<00:01:18.040> charge<00:01:18.430> and<00:01:19.270> with<00:01:19.630> this<00:01:19.930> new<00:01:20.470> charging

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
single charge and with this new charging

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.700 
single charge and with this new charging
technology<00:01:21.340> of<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.210> impulse<00:01:22.570> we<00:01:23.140> can<00:01:23.350> charge

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
technology of the impulse we can charge

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.750 
technology of the impulse we can charge
10<00:01:24.190> kilowatt<00:01:24.729> hours<00:01:25.030> within<00:01:26.310> 3.5<00:01:27.310> hours

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
10 kilowatt hours within 3.5 hours

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:37.800 
10 kilowatt hours within 3.5 hours
that's<00:01:28.420> really<00:01:28.930> quick

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.570 

so<00:01:38.810> we<00:01:38.930> also<00:01:39.049> will<00:01:39.439> enter<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.040> Italian

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
so we also will enter the Italian

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.880 
so we also will enter the Italian
markets<00:01:41.030> with<00:01:41.270> these<00:01:41.540> spikes<00:01:41.869> we<00:01:42.229> already

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
markets with these spikes we already

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.219 
markets with these spikes we already
started<00:01:43.250> with<00:01:43.640> her<00:01:43.790> first<00:01:44.149> steal<00:01:44.420> in<00:01:44.570> trento

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
started with her first steal in trento

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.850 
started with her first steal in trento
in<00:01:45.590> analog<00:01:46.220> delay<00:01:46.610> in<00:01:46.820> Milano<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.869> omt<00:01:48.439> garage

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
in analog delay in Milano the omt garage

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.330 
in analog delay in Milano the omt garage
and<00:01:49.189> we<00:01:49.850> will<00:01:50.060> expand<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.380> dealer<00:01:51.680> network

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
and we will expand the dealer network

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.570 
and we will expand the dealer network
during<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.570> next<00:01:53.869> year<00:01:54.110> to<00:01:54.979> give<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:55.399> the

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
possibility to test right all our bikes

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:07.570 
possibility to test right all our bikes
in<00:01:58.460> each<00:01:58.610> city<00:01:58.880> of<00:01:59.119> Italy

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:20.180 

you
