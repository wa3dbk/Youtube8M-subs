00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello everyone about two months of 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:12.809
 Resin distance reaffirm video today 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.780
 we will talk about holy melotti review 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.650
 of the film expresses to me personally is 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:25.500
 liked a lot but not for this hammer 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:30.890
 movie basically we say a good movie 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.930
 I think for lovers of the genre 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.800
 because we make a pretty ending 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.790
 particularly, I liked it 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:48.989
 because this is how it unfolds 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:51.539
 the plot of the film as president has me 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.379
 hit because I work and jump signatures 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:02.010
 similar facts like this and here goes on 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:05.369
 be satisfied, however, another because yes 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.680
 will form that of what we say the mar 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.469
 classic that all the movies 20 seconds 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.270
 movies are 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:17.079
 we say so completely but enough 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:21.130
 to be the first and under certain points 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:26.429
 of view may even be worse 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.720
 for example gas we say this radio 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.560
 because it is worth seeing a phenomenon because 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:37.719
 had already seen is different to the different 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.840
 because if from the 31 warriors demand and in the 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:46.349
 usually a psychiatric hospital 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:51.599
 in short, these guys are different but 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:51.599
 the sketches are a little less active 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:02.709
 but to the different people, burns go to me 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:06.520
 we are clothes that he remembered suspended 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:10.739
 sure to have the studio at least for me but 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.739
 this made me dressed but I don't know about you 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.380
 what else can I say yes English are 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.500
 always seen in the usual sense 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:27.170
 cameras placed but alive in everything 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:33.250
 the hospital with its subject like 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.250
 main one that is simple but Milanese 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.420
 another thing is that we are more a 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.640
 bit there is a certain point in the video 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:54.990
 to follow the film there never seemed to be 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:58.270
 be a game or I work a disc 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:01.720
 the movie bryant and now with thought goes 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:05.950
 well what there was a point of a 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.230
 character develops badly from vichy e 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.260
 no one remembered we say 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.560
 sometimes the streets we say that 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.810
 opposites get people out 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.480
 I do not know 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:27.250
 there was a corridor passing by 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:31.260
 here in one part of the film a character 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.260
 at first door and let's say a sort of 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:42.400
 siro between the support road la 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:47.380
 young clear closes the reopens like this 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.340
 the closes something closes it 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.900
 variable 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.879
 we are reform 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.180
 other hallway all the rooms has 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:04:00.829
 caused presidio what game I saw 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:05.079
 that I played so badly then we say 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.079
 which has become let's say 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.620
 but many who asked us what is here 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:19.570
