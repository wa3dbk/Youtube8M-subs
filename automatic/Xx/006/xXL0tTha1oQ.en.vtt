so<00:00:03.150> this<00:00:03.540> is<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:04.430> demo<00:00:05.430> about<00:00:05.820> a<00:00:05.850> 60<00:00:06.480> touch<00:00:06.690> you

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
so this is a demo about a 60 touch you

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.220 
so this is a demo about a 60 touch you
why<00:00:07.140> it's<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.280> real<00:00:08.460> home<00:00:08.940> software<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.960> we

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
why it's a real home software that we

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.910 
why it's a real home software that we
are<00:00:10.380> using<00:00:11.059> from<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.240> computer<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.349> then<00:00:13.740> i'm

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
are using from the computer and then i'm

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.519 
are using from the computer and then i'm
using<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.490> kind<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.030> external<00:00:15.809> display<00:00:16.470> to

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
using this kind of a external display to

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.760 
using this kind of a external display to
show<00:00:16.740> how<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.789> behaves<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.930> later<00:00:19.500> or

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
show how it behaves and later or

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.160 
show how it behaves and later or
licenses<00:00:20.520> will<00:00:20.910> show<00:00:21.390> how<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.660> actual

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
licenses will show how the actual

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.019 
licenses will show how the actual
devices<00:00:22.529> will<00:00:23.010> look<00:00:23.190> like<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
devices will look like so this is a

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.080 
devices will look like so this is a
software<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.810> using<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.350> base<00:00:25.560> demo<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.910> can

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
software and using the base demo you can

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.480 
software and using the base demo you can
tap<00:00:27.330> anywhere<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.199> screen<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.949> if<00:00:29.100> you<00:00:29.250> tap

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
tap anywhere on the screen so if you tap

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.400 
tap anywhere on the screen so if you tap
to<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.730> clock<00:00:30.060> icon<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.600> will<00:00:30.630> take<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.170> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
to the clock icon it will take you to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.250 
to the clock icon it will take you to
work<00:00:32.009> application<00:00:32.850> or<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.870> can<00:00:34.050> quickly

functionalities you can quickly scroll

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.549 
functionalities you can quickly scroll
in<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.469> lists<00:00:47.920> like<00:00:48.250> that<00:00:48.899> our<00:00:49.899> idea<00:00:50.350> is<00:00:50.379> that

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
in the lists like that our idea is that

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.619 
in the lists like that our idea is that
I<00:00:50.949> light<00:00:51.219> always<00:00:51.460> follows<00:00:52.059> your<00:00:52.239> finger

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
I light always follows your finger

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.509 
I light always follows your finger
movement<00:00:53.050> and<00:00:53.229> you<00:00:53.409> know<00:00:53.589> where<00:00:53.859> you<00:00:54.039> are<00:00:54.250> the

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
movement and you know where you are the

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.060 
movement and you know where you are the
least<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:55.239> not<00:00:55.510> you<00:00:55.899> are<00:00:56.019> not<00:00:56.170> just<00:00:56.440> thrown<00:00:56.739> to

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
least and not you are not just thrown to

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.160 
least and not you are not just thrown to
somewhere<00:00:57.489> in<00:00:57.789> the<00:00:58.390> list<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.960> more<00:00:59.140> you

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
somewhere in the list and the more you

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.799 
somewhere in the list and the more you
have<00:00:59.530> names<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.129> if<00:01:00.280> you<00:01:00.399> keep<00:01:00.579> scrolling<00:01:01.000> I'd

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
have names and if you keep scrolling I'd

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.889 
have names and if you keep scrolling I'd
accelerates<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:03.010> scrolling<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.600> that<00:01:04.780> it's

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
accelerates the scrolling so that it's

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.630 
accelerates the scrolling so that it's
faster<00:01:05.440> to<00:01:05.470> pull<00:01:05.799> some<00:01:06.369> some<00:01:06.820> places

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
faster to pull some some places

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.410 
faster to pull some some places
then<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.300> similar<00:01:10.140> functionality<00:01:10.729> is<00:01:11.729> also<00:01:12.240> in

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
then a similar functionality is also in

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.219 
then a similar functionality is also in
the<00:01:12.450> web<00:01:12.750> browser<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.720> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.900> scroll

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the web browser you can you can scroll

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.350 
the web browser you can you can scroll
on<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.620> web<00:01:16.800> page<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.640> quickly<00:01:17.880> see

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
on the web page and you can quickly see

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.780 
on the web page and you can quickly see
what's<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.350> there<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.830> how<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> looks<00:01:20.340> like

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.140 

that's<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.660> idea<00:01:24.490> then<00:01:25.660> also<00:01:26.660> in<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:28.150> images

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
that's the idea then also in the images

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.740 
that's the idea then also in the images
let's<00:01:29.450> go<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:30.170> open<00:01:30.520> on<00:01:31.520> image<00:01:31.940> oh<00:01:32.240> no<00:01:32.600> it

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
let's go and open on image oh no it

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.900 
let's go and open on image oh no it
opens<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.350> a<00:01:33.380> different<00:01:33.740> resolution<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:34.730> we

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
opens to a different resolution that we

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.300 
opens to a different resolution that we
are<00:01:35.030> supporting<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:36.560> can<00:01:36.740> make<00:01:36.890> a<00:01:36.920> small

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
are supporting you can make a small

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.800 
are supporting you can make a small
gesture<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.150> goes<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.690> next<00:01:39.080> image

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
gesture and it goes to the next image

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.750 
gesture and it goes to the next image
and<00:01:41.810> then<00:01:42.050> let's<00:01:42.740> take<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.010> look<00:01:43.310> at<00:01:43.430> the

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
and then let's take a look at the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.640 
and then let's take a look at the
thanks<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.810> importing<00:01:46.800> so<00:01:47.300> we<00:01:48.300> are<00:01:48.450> actually

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
thanks the importing so we are actually

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.230 
thanks the importing so we are actually
provided<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.680> widest<00:01:50.220> set<00:01:50.520> affects<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
provided the widest set affects the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.310 
provided the widest set affects the
input<00:01:51.510> methods<00:01:52.640> compared<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.790> anyone<00:01:54.210> else

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.399 

there

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
there

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.120 
there
so<00:02:00.179> it<00:02:01.179> always<00:02:01.420> opens<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.380> method<00:02:02.740> that<00:02:02.770> you

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130

is<00:02:35.019> then<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.769> virtual<00:02:36.220> benign<00:02:36.670> which<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.150> a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
is then the virtual benign which is a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.569 
is then the virtual benign which is a
full<00:02:38.019> screen<00:02:39.810> keypad<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.129> then<00:02:42.129> you<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.430> use

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
full screen keypad and then you can use

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.509 
full screen keypad and then you can use
it<00:02:42.610> between<00:02:43.090> your<00:02:43.329> thumb<00:02:44.190> while<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.400> are

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
it between your thumb while you are

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.550 
it between your thumb while you are
walking<00:02:45.700> or<00:02:46.209> things<00:02:46.840> like<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:47.049> so<00:02:47.440> it

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
walking or things like that so it

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.550 
walking or things like that so it
depends<00:02:47.890> on<00:02:48.129> what<00:02:48.819> do<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.060> like<00:02:49.299> it<00:02:50.170> also

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
depends on what do you like it also

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.000 
depends on what do you like it also
depends<00:02:51.069> on<00:02:51.220> languages<00:02:51.879> because<00:02:52.180> if<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.720> are

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
depends on languages because if you are

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.220 
depends on languages because if you are
going<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.190> write<00:02:54.370> Chinese<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.690> want<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.079> use

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
going to write Chinese you want to use

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.110 
going to write Chinese you want to use
handwriting<00:02:56.890> recognition<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.579> all<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:58.000> the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
handwriting recognition of all of the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.410 
handwriting recognition of all of the
details<00:02:58.599> in<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.959> characters<00:02:59.500> and<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.489> on<00:03:00.730> and

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
details in the characters and so on and

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.020 
details in the characters and so on and
we<00:03:02.019> are<00:03:02.140> supporting<00:03:02.739> more<00:03:03.040> than<00:03:03.250> 50<00:03:03.609> languages

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
we are supporting more than 50 languages

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.110 
we are supporting more than 50 languages
at<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.690> moment

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
at the moment

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720 
at the moment
so<00:03:06.840> there<00:03:07.170> should<00:03:07.379> be<00:03:07.409> your<00:03:07.799> old<00:03:08.010> language<00:03:08.250> as

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
so there should be your old language as

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.630 
so there should be your old language as
well<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.330> list

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.050 

that's<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.480> idea<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:14.069> there<00:03:14.460> might<00:03:14.670> be<00:03:14.730> all

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
that's the idea and there might be all

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.580 
that's the idea and there might be all
kind<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.510> touch<00:03:15.750> devices<00:03:18.020> so<00:03:19.020> they<00:03:19.230> might<00:03:19.290> be

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
kind of a touch devices so they might be

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.430 
kind of a touch devices so they might be
just<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.950> couple<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.310> hardware<00:03:20.910> keys<00:03:21.240> or<00:03:21.630> they

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
just a couple of hardware keys or they

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.390 
just a couple of hardware keys or they
might<00:03:22.650> be<00:03:22.890> touch<00:03:23.160> devices

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.599
