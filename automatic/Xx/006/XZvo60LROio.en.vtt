00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
hello we have a 2001 Accord v6 then

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:27.259 
hello we have a 2001 Accord v6 then

speed<00:00:27.660> what<00:00:27.930> we've<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.650> car<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.250> we

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
speed what we've got on this car is we

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.040 
speed what we've got on this car is we
have<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:31.250> vibration<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:33.180> accelerating<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
have a vibration when accelerating and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.639 
have a vibration when accelerating and
only<00:00:34.350> one<00:00:34.500> accelerating<00:00:35.690> I<00:00:37.670> know<00:00:39.620> for<00:00:40.620> our

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
only one accelerating I know for our

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.970 
only one accelerating I know for our
fact<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:42.480> engine<00:00:42.809> mounts<00:00:43.110> mounts<00:00:43.500> are<00:00:43.800> blown

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
fact the engine mounts mounts are blown

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.540 
fact the engine mounts mounts are blown
out

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
out

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
out
look<00:00:45.350> she<00:00:46.350> wobbles<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:46.920> over<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.340> place<00:00:49.039> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
look she wobbles all over the place the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.799 
look she wobbles all over the place the
engine<00:00:50.430> does<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> cause<00:00:51.750> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
engine does but that's not the cause of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.480 
engine does but that's not the cause of
the<00:00:52.020> vibration<00:00:52.590> under<00:00:52.800> acceleration

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.880 

what<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.180> thinking

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.980 

it<00:01:01.340> is<00:01:01.490> that<00:01:01.880> if<00:01:02.060> you<00:01:02.090> can<00:01:02.270> see<00:01:02.450> that<00:01:02.600> actual

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
it is that if you can see that actual

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.180 
it is that if you can see that actual
shaft<00:01:03.140> going<00:01:03.530> up<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:03.800> down

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
shaft going up and down

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.550 
shaft going up and down
this<00:01:04.910> is<00:01:05.059> driver<00:01:05.300> side<00:01:05.600> axle<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:08.140> if<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.260> stop

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
this is driver side axle so if I stop

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.340 
this is driver side axle so if I stop
the<00:01:09.590> other<00:01:09.860> tire<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:11.600> get<00:01:11.930> this<00:01:12.050> stuff<00:01:12.290> going

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
the other tire and get this stuff going

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
the other tire and get this stuff going
even<00:01:12.920> more<00:01:12.950> I<00:01:15.730> pick<00:01:16.730> up<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:16.970> inboard<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:19.190> end

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
even more I pick up that inboard the end

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.700 
even more I pick up that inboard the end
board<00:01:19.580> axle

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.830 

that<00:01:26.160> wobbling<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.730> and<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.060> think<00:01:27.300> gets

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that wobbling up and that I think gets

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.120 
that wobbling up and that I think gets
pretty<00:01:28.110> bad<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.800> agent<00:01:29.100> starts<00:01:29.280> flexing

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.010 

we're<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.760> to<00:01:35.820> replace<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.270> axle<00:01:36.750> next

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
we're going to replace this axle next

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.149 
we're going to replace this axle next
week<00:01:37.820> let's<00:01:38.820> eat<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> vibration<00:01:39.630> goes<00:01:39.659> away

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
week let's eat the vibration goes away

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.580 
week let's eat the vibration goes away
and<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.300> we<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.630> good<00:01:43.050> jack<00:01:43.350> stands

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and you know we do have good jack stands

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.090 
and you know we do have good jack stands
under<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.950> toy<00:01:44.100> when<00:01:44.310> we're<00:01:44.460> doing<00:01:44.550> this<00:01:44.760> all

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
under the toy when we're doing this all

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.830 
under the toy when we're doing this all
right<00:01:47.420> that's<00:01:48.420> what<00:01:48.570> we're<00:01:48.660> thinking

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
right that's what we're thinking

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.320 
right that's what we're thinking
acceleration<00:01:49.770> acceleration<00:01:50.400> at<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:51.060> speeds

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
acceleration acceleration at all speeds

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.740 
acceleration acceleration at all speeds
basically<00:01:52.820> that<00:01:53.820> little<00:01:54.119> bit<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.270> play<00:01:54.509> that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
basically that little bit of play that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.540 
basically that little bit of play that
axle<00:01:55.170> snap<00:01:55.350> going<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.800> and<00:01:55.950> down<00:01:56.070> up<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.490> down

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
axle snap going up and down up and down

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.100 
axle snap going up and down up and down
see<00:01:59.550> that<00:01:59.759> shafts<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.300> bouncing<00:02:00.690> straight<00:02:00.960> up

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
see that shafts and bouncing straight up

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.270 
see that shafts and bouncing straight up
and<00:02:01.290> down

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.580 

alright<00:02:05.060> I'll<00:02:05.510> post<00:02:05.810> another<00:02:05.930> video<00:02:06.260> next

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
alright I'll post another video next

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.139 
alright I'll post another video next
week<00:02:06.740> after<00:02:07.130> we<00:02:07.220> replace<00:02:07.400> two<00:02:07.610> active<00:02:07.910> crafts

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
week after we replace two active crafts

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.390 
week after we replace two active crafts
yeah
