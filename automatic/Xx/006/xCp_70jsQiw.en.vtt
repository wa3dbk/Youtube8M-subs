00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.760
 Base number 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:10.560
 By winning student members eight is nine lottery has been performed 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:17.270
 Four members of the Chungrong are collecting Iizuka 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:17.270
 Six persons including Takahashi Ikeda became the same face as the All Star Championship 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.150
 When only the final game was left c 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.150
 I asked the finalists their enthusiasm for tomorrow 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.730
 It will be answered lever properly 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.220
 I failed a bit today 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.370
 Well, there are times when 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.940
 In 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.940
 Steadily 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.830
 I think 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.270
 Saying that there is another state 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.270
 Because it is your customer's 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.550
 Close to the state 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.550
 Whoa different 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.290
 Not to leave 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.290
 To say 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.520
 I somehow feel like this 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.750
 Fucoidan Zinger 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.250
 It's like that 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.720
 I'm waiting 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.720
 I do not say that so much good 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.480
 It this is to say embarrassing race 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.480
 So as not to 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.659
 To join 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.450
 I will do my best 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.570
 I have no feeling 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.280
 There is something I want you to do a bit more 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.030
 The result is to say that it records the time being Yuzen 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.659
 I think that is big 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.659
 It is serious 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.750
 Hey That's right 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.750
 Grinded that this kind of way can run 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.550
 I'm glad 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:06.030
 It's the strongest strongest rival 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.030
 Tanaka, who was said to be Uratani's strongest rival, was facing races with a calm expression every day 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.109
 Eh in the part 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.380
 I would like to paste it after death 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.140
 Heart of 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.770
 Scenario Street 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.770
 He is not good 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.650
 I took it 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.579
 I do not say that there are only 3 points 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.579
 There is really little 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.540
 Still 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.240
 Compared to powerful videos 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.490
 Just do it 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.330
 I think I was bring in competition gay 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.290
 I was killed 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.290
 I think it was good 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.860
 The first time San'yodo of Saint Oh 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.490
 According to Mr. Masami Nakamura 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.550
 A with feelings of wearing one taken 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.090
 Then I'm confident 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.050
 The difference after that is the trial 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.180
 That's right, oh 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.380
 I thought Hamano Fuji last beaten losing 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.940
 With that kind of thought there is something 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.940
 Also it dangerous No Sukedo great 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:25.910
 It was Sasaki that made extensive maintenance on this day 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.910
 And Takahashi was seeking a powerful engine than the other 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.420
 During that 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.420
 The back of the relaxed state and Tanaka 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.590
 There Te 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.550

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.550

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.730
 There is no 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.460
 Last day 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.770
 Runway was wet with rain that fell in late eve 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.920
 Is there any impact on the base 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.520
 It was done while confirming the Kushiro state of the players 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.520
 Morning practice 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.270
 Especially Ikeda had repeated start practice many times 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.890
 Said Sasaki had a development all the way to late in last night seep members 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.890
 Hey lucky 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.440
 It is said that 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.900
 Is east 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.400
 It's the last time I got it 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.930
 Bree is so the stomping looking 嘗胆 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.630
 I also heard about Takahashi Oh 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.630
 I automotive Oke was something Hey to another 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.700
 It's open warfare speaking total basis 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:56.210
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:59.040
 And after all this portal is also in the part of even the stomach at Sevin 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.760
 You do not win and not good to 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.540
 It was a specification 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.540
 Product to win
