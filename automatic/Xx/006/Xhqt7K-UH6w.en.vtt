00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.719
 well a minute ago he got a call 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.790
 of televisa that already a car wins 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:16.350
 then they were already telling me that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.990
 dialed in a phone for the following 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.360
 instructions how to get this car 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:27.020
 then let's make this call 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.870
 and we're going to put everything live so that 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.440
 listen to how the fraud is because 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.830
 I honestly do not think that I win a 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.830
 car 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.680
 credit here on skype 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.210
 let's do let's see what he says 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.300
 two 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:22.030
 It seems that it 's a good cell phone 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.030
 to make another call to see what happens 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.010
 typical for those people because it's like that 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.680
 like where 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:35.830
 well many talk about jail for 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.830
 those scams do not then we're going to 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.440
 makes another call let's see let's 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.440
 watch 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.480
 here is in a way 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.060
 melissa 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.229
 Y 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.229
 and our stories 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.750
 Y 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.790
 Y 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:17.069
 he avoids having to charge the afternoon but 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:20.700
 yes good afternoon the gentleman is 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:25.439
 Alberto palaces to trust 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.810
 we have something good and barely 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.500
 they said that I won a car I do not know if 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.500
 true that 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.219
 and good good 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.590
 good good but worse 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.510
 and good good good one 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.590
 a call was made again because 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.590
 I think it fell 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.890
 if it is also improving or we are going to do 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.890
 again 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.710
 live 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.340
 i 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.379
 Y 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.850
 they already answer me I think they've already caught it 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:40.330
 in jail 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.720
 also the subscription is called televisa 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.920
 san angel saying to make car and 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.890
 you have to talk to a cell phone is not 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.230
 neither office nor is it anything then it is 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.230
 half liking let's do it again 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:07.459
 is that he does not know we're live 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.459
 that you see it and the grief called 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:29.270
 and point has no case look at the number 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:37.340
 I know if it has happened to you 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:42.410
 the 55 33 44 66 62 with a certain Alberto 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:46.790
 palace or palaces then it would be good 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:50.540
 if they pass the word and very carefully 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.020
 because I think it's a scam is that I 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.880
 I was calling first to me to 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:02.960
 home phone is that I have here a 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:05.750
 number of house with worm with movistar and 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.640
 was saying without number then 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.100
 means that the number is no longer 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.030
 registered that they are already calling from not 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:17.630
 be a computer phone something like that 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:21.020
 that the number is not recorded then what 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.910
 first that is suspicious because if you 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.970
 call from an office should appear 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.590
 the number and not without number not then 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.840
 There they told me 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.830
 to guess 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:39.360
 a famous singer and I got three 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:42.330
 options and I already chose the good one because 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.510
 I know the song that I told myself in 40 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.419
 and 20 from joseph jose and they told me later 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.389
 you won you won a good car and I 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:55.050
 they said you are already sitting or you are standing 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:57.990
 you told us sitting and they told me already 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.729
 you won a car of the year and blah blah blah 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.729
 blah not then 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:10.429
 already told me you already have to dial this 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:14.849
 number that I mentioned and there I am going to 

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:17.249
 say more about the car myself 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.860
 now they are not even answering, let's do the 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:23.779
 Last attempt is that rules that give 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.779
 know what they say 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.889
 and the times they 're calling me up 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:35.740
 in kidnapping and saying that I have a 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:38.440
 good that they have my son and I do not know 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:42.460
 the average they put me in a car and I do not know 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.580
 then they are trying again with 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.580
 that 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:57.250
 it's a fraud then, well , I'm going to 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:07:00.610
 cut this this bit to upload it to 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.979
 youtube to see it and what they think me 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.440
 and I do not know then very carefully 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:08.560
 because it's not so easy that you won like that 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:12.099
 of doing nothing and a car no 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:16.110
 then carefully those calls are 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:19.509
 well fraudulent I do not san angel no 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:22.720
 let's say this if it were true that 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:26.430
 directly call no no no no I 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:29.180
 to call a cell phone then 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.180
 that's all
