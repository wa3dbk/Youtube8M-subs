saves grows in desert sage wants
absolutely<00:00:48.640> no<00:00:49.240> water<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:50.530> is<00:00:50.590> a<00:00:50.740> desert

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
absolutely no water this is a desert

plant<00:00:53.760> right<00:00:54.760> next<00:00:54.970> to<00:00:55.270> it<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.740> it<00:01:09.490> grows

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
plant right next to it but it grows

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.060 
plant right next to it but it grows
right<00:01:10.030> next<00:01:10.300> to<00:01:10.390> it<00:01:10.510> side<00:01:10.659> by<00:01:10.690> side<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.860> so

here he says there's enough air space in
the<00:01:29.740> woodchips<00:01:30.159> for<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.700> safe<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.210> expand<00:01:31.630> in

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
the woodchips for the safe to expand in

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.149 
the woodchips for the safe to expand in
the<00:01:31.870> open<00:01:32.110> places<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.620> avoid<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.010> water

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
the open places and avoid the water

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.399 
the open places and avoid the water
there's<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.210> watercress<00:01:34.600> wants<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.080> they<00:01:35.260> can
