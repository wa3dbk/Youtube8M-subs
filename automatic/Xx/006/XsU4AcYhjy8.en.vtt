00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
batteries now it's got four batteries in

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.279 
batteries now it's got four batteries in
and<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.300> hasn't<00:00:45.450> got<00:00:45.660> back<00:00:45.719> light<00:00:46.050> screen

our gameboy color now this has just got
two<00:00:52.469> batteries<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.149> see<00:00:54.329> how<00:00:54.449> long

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
two batteries so we can see how long

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.080 
two batteries so we can see how long
that<00:00:54.660> lasts<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:56.160> not<00:00:56.280> backlit<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.910> again

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that lasts it's not backlit so again

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.160 
that lasts it's not backlit so again
that<00:00:57.210> should<00:00:57.329> last<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.629> long<00:00:57.719> time<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
that should last a long time and the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.099 
micro there runs out of battery and top
right<00:04:13.770> so<00:04:14.610> we're<00:04:14.790> left<00:04:14.970> with<00:04:15.360> these<00:04:15.540> consoles

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.900 
right so we're left with these consoles
powering<00:04:16.710> their<00:04:16.920> way<00:04:17.100> through<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.489> light<00:04:17.670> and

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
powering their way through the light and

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.500 
powering their way through the light and
there<00:04:18.390> goes<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:19.220> original<00:04:20.220> DS<00:04:20.700> obviously

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
there goes the original DS obviously

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.880

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
this less bright screens lasts a bit

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.480 
this less bright screens lasts a bit
