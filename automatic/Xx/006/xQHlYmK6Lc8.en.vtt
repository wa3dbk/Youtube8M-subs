00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:13.780
 hello hello today I present a design of a 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.250
 mini mouse made in third divination 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.390
 we are going to need monomer 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.550
 a third dimension brush 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.210
 acrylics in nude pink 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.370
 black 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.950
 Red 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:38.120
 and white plus white enamel and 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.770
 black enamel 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.190
 yes 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.740
 I anticipated an acrylic base made 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.020
 in pearl and pink color 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.810
 let's start our design with the 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.320
 acrylic color nude forming a heart 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.430
 in the top part that will be the head 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.430
 of our little mouse 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.380
 then with two smaller pearls 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.380
 let's make them cachetitos 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.790
 putting them in the bottom of each 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.790
 pearl with which we made the heart 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.400
 If there is any empty space, we will 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.400
 fill it with a small pearl 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.230
 and then we will form the chin with 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.230
 another small pearl 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.030
 once done this with black acrylic 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.210
 let's form the head of our mini 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.210
 mouse 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.390
 taking pearls and distributing them towards 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.390
 the sides 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:14.230
 so that the head is formed taking care 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.690
 always to not pass us the part of the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.200
 Nude color and not stain our design 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.200
 i 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.700
 While 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.269
 then with the same black acrylic 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.840
 we are going to form the little ears taking a 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.470
 pearl a little big 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.010
 and flattening the forming a circle in the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.870
 right side and repeating the same 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.870
 steps on the left side 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.990
 since we finished forming the head and 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.040
 the ears we will continue working with 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:35.190
 the color nude for the nose and we're going 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.760
 to put a pearl leaving it a bit high 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.450
 and we will form a drop going towards the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.450
 left side 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.470
 and 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.750
 then we will take a smaller pearl 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.930
 and we will put it in what will be in the 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:08.549
 cheek giving it shape and blurring 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.549
 to go marking the smile 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.250
 in the same way we will do it with the other 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.840
 cheek of our mouse giving 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.840
 always the shape of the smile 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.210
 we will finish with a pearl on the chin 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.540
 and 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.919
 then with white acrylic we are going to 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:54.220
 take small pearls to form the 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.220
 little eyes 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.690
 i 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.169
 yes 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.960
 with the help of black acrylic we are going to 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.479
 take a small pearl and put it 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.319
 just in the nose so that it stays in 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.319
 ball shape 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:36.080
 then on a flat surface I put a 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:41.110
 droplet of the black enamel and with the help of 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.110
 a punch we will mark the eyes 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.000
 to give you one more detail with the enamel 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:52.750
 white let's put a few dots of 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.930
 shines in the eyes of our little mouse 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.500
 then with the red acrylic we are going to 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.670
 form the tongue 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.920
 putting a pearl and forming a medium 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.529
 circle on the back of the 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.129
 little mouth 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:09.129
 all right 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.259
 once done this with black acrylic 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.389
 let's form shadows in the mouth of 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.629
 our little mouse taking care of not 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:30.909
 move on to the nude acrylic part and 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:32.760
 cleaning any excess acrylic 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:35.550
 black 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.190
 to finish with the pink acrylic 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.340
 we are going to form a bow we will take a 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:45.030
 pearl of good size we will form a 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:48.920
 petal after we will mark the sides 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.920
 in our petals to expand as much 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:56.590
 in the middle part we are going to push 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:56.590
 to go forming a heart 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:05.900
 here 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.900
 and we're going to do the same thing on the other side 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:13.029
 and 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:15.370
 once the petals of our 

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:18.939
 We are going to put a pearl of the 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:21.639
 pink acrylic in the middle of these so that 

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:24.009
 the bow is finished 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:26.789
 and that's how our mini mouse looks 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.789
 completed 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:38.040
