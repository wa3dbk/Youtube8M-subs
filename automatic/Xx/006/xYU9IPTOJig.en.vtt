00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.050
 as you can see here an exquisite grouper 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.689
 to roquefort with herbs this is a 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.000
 delicious dish in this fish combines 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.920
 very good with roquefort cheese and let's go 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.230
 to discover today the way to have a 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.150
 roquefort toucan really is going to 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.530
 surprise the taste and you will enjoy it 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.019
 very much knows what are the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.550
 ingredients that we need 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:48.210
 we will need some fillets of grouper me 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.449
 I will use two fresh cheese whipped 0% 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.579
 skim or our yogurt cheese 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.100
 home 0% of either of the two that 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.579
 you choose to use we are going to use 150 grams 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.399
 approximately we will use two droplets of 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.770
 Roquefort aroma only two droplets 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.720
 because it is very strong we will use the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.840
 species that we have chosen can be 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.820
 rosemary or thyme and a little milk and 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.640
 of course salt let's see then 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.590
 First, how will we make the cream? 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.310
 see that it is very easy 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.220
 I'm going to use our yogurt cheese 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.680
 for all the friends who do not have the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.420
 possibility of finding 0% cheese for 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.270
 Spreads will use our cheese 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.899
 yogurt these are roughly 150 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.090
 grams of pbc look what is that 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.299
 it is very very creamy 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.429
 we will add more or less about 2 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.289
 spoonfuls of milk you have to go 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.950
 watching until the consistency is the 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.950
 what do you want 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.939
 what we have is that soften the cheese 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.679
 because we are not going to need to be 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.679
 spread all over the fish 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.189
 if we see that we need a little more 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.920
 of milk we put our case 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.110
 let's put the cheese on sometimes 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.750
 beaten cheese that we buy is much more 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.640
 liquid then in this case you're going to 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.819
 see that you may not even need to add the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.819
 milk 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.890
 and now let's get let's take 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.890
 a fork 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.620
 we are going to put the scent then 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.069
 as I said this aroma is very strong 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.220
 but they have really accomplished very well in 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.739
 my shop diet dukan the aroma and the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.690
 flavor of the cheese what was then 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.580
 let's put only two drops 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.070
 we are going to do very carefully always 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.260
 and when you're not sure how to 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.280
 How much room are we going to use? 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.069
 spoon 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.750
 let's try it once if I would need 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.319
 a little bit more we will first put a 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.319
 little salt 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.120
 Really 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.970
 it is very very similar the taste we are going to 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.660
 put a couple of droplets more let's 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.410
 bring 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.410
 a 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.430
 baking tray where we have put 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.200
 paper 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:33.170
 Metallized paper 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:36.980
 and we are going to put then only two 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.840
 of the steaks we will first put a 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.680
 little bit of our cream underneath so that 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.629
 also impregnate below 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.170
 let's do it as if it were the 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.319
 papillote that is to say in one we are going to 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.379
 remain as one 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:55.409
 a little bag made with this paper 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.719
 aluminum that makes all the heat is 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:00.299
 perfectly maintain and cook 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:02.200
 own juices we will see now 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.340
 seasoned 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.340
 the steaks 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.550
 and we are going to put them here 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:22.049
 i 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:25.639
 we will put on top of the cream then 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.639
 the rest of the cream 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.830
 we already have the oven preheated to 200 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.260
 degrees 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.410
 Since this is going to be closed, you do not have 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.030
 danger that the fish dries and leaves 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.900
 to cook and it's going to be really 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.900
 delicious 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.420
 if you want you can book a little bit of 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.220
 the cream to put on top 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.220
 when we already serve them 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:12.569
 and then now what we put is the 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:12.569
 rosemary or thyme selective herb 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:22.050
 we are going to do like this to close it 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:27.680
 this way and we're going to take it to the oven 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.680
 for about 20 minutes 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.750
 we close ourselves well so they do not escape 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.710
 the juices that the fish will release 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.710
 our cream 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.220
 then we go back in about 20 minutes 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.210
 well we have come back from the oven we are going to 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.210
 open it very carefully 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.300
 keep in mind that when you open it like this 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.080
 it's still very hot, it's going to come out 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.479
 steam 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.530
 so we always open it not to 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.530
 us for the primary 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.260
 and look what a delight you do not know the aroma 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.450
 roquefort 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:23.930
 that is recent we are going to put it 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.930
 serve them on a plate with a source 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.550
 and we'll decorate with another little 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.550
 of the sauce 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.670
 we can put a little more sauce 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.000
 good extremely simple just what 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:50.520
 we had it ready in a few minutes and 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.460
 it really is very appetizing the smell is 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.009
 Roquefort is amazing if you like this 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.870
 you will enjoy it so much 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.629
 I hope you like this idea 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:03.270
 this idea of ​​course is from 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:05.520
 attack phase and we can eat it from 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.280
 the first day of the diet and it's 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.210
 terrific so encourage yourself to do it already 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.210
 you find any result 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.260
 two 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.960
 do not 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.630
 i
