00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.629
 Many manufacturers such as Samsung HTC and LG introduce small less powerful ones 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.809
 variants of the top models in the form of 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.309
 such an idea that otherwise and introduced with the setting compact admittedly one 

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:22.449
 smaller version of a top model but less powerful was that device 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.869
 not at all this one sonic spear more than 2000 is actually the mini variant 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.470
 as we know him 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.470
 similar appearance with the current flagship but one the big less 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.820
 powerfully less extensive and less expensive 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.700
 and in this case also hurt a lot less 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.210
 yes then I just say small smartphone 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.160
 this m2 is really a bit smaller than the z2 but and really small 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.659
 smartphone is with a 4 comma 18 its display 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.079
 yes then again not yet the difference with the z2 is clear 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.499
 noticeable and it is yes this from just a little handy which is easier to carry along 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:53.949
 take 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.280
 and so I personally prefer to see the z2 in this format 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.190
 unfortunately there is a bit saved on the materials used where the z2 to 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.500
 the back is still made of glass, I think this has become plastic 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.230
 a pity but good costs must of course be reduced, we see 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.900
 a flap on the side and then of course you think your own city is not nikkei 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.060
 fabrics and waterproof that you would expect 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.780
 that is not the case here 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.970
 so a bit confusing it clicked of course 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.300
 yes i am not waterproof and also the screen resolution of with 540 with 960 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.940
 pixels 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.350
 something against it 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.049
 That is mainly a shame when you watch a video for example 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.430
 but beyond 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.820
 you actually do not mind that because the screen is just nice 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.410
 is clear 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.600
 and especially the xperia yusen interface 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.860
 looks nice it is nice and colorful 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.900
 there is nothing too much to complain about 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.189
 find in the peel with the copper tricks 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.950
 then you can get an overview of the most used n va find applications 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.060
 and you can always do the so-called swolfs 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.280
 be nominated everywhere 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.390
 we also see the vut jori each that effects return in the camera software well that 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.690
 is nice then you can experience a lot of fun 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.190
 and also the garden chefs has done burst mode back with shooting device 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.020
 one blow a whole series of photos 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.120
 unfortunately the perpetrator had a bit of it 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.280
 and we for example no 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.979
 possibility of recording slomo videos for example and africa with that 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.510
 less pressure too, in addition, the quality of the photos will occasionally 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.050
 a bit against the device seems to have some trouble always everything 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.120
 to bring one focus and the white balance just doesn't always seem to you at all 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.229
 to knock 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.959
 Mon completely unreachable, this room is not in the least for a couple 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:25.950
 that you in between 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.609
 yes it certainly is 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.370
 the great power of this m2 yes go probably scale in the 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:32.499
 Specifications 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.139
 he is equipped with the boiler 2 gigabyte head assessor and a gigabyte 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.669
 RAM memory and that is sufficient and sufficient for most operations 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.069
 therefore it will also be sufficient for most people 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.379
 compared to a man more not two sizes sea yes it is a bit less 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.300
 nice light screen resolution somewhat lower 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.690
 but then in the nice pictures 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.539
 but yes with a good 200 euros both roughly make up for it 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:57.139
 so you are looking for a nice middle class with a fairly large size 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.579
 screen a little power that 4g wds and you do not cost too much and then you may like this 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.209
 sony xperia m2 with four stars 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.569
 take it into consideration
