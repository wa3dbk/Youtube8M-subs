00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.120
 boys girls how are you 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.390
 I am a shaman and in this video I am going to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.900
 give 10 good reasons to take more 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.349
 water did you know that a person that a being 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.599
 human can live about a month 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.939
 without food but only 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.579
 about a week without consuming 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.739
 water that is after a week that 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.500
 we humans do not have water 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:38.010
 finite caputo there we finished that is a 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.900
 reason to take more water number 2 the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.810
 water helps us maintain a weight 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.960
 healthy helps us increase the 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.870
 metabolism and to regulate the appetite is 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.750
 that's why I 'm recommended to take 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.420
 At least 2 glasses of water before each 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.940
 food to feel fuller and for 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.910
 consequently we are going to eat less ok 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.460
 number 3 the water leads to higher levels 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.000
 of energy the most common cause of fatigue 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.560
 during the day is actually the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.810
 dehydration when we really feel 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.020
 tired that we go for more there is that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.170
 drink water 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.679
 The main cause can be 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.600
 dehydration is not that we have 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.390
 lazy so you have to take quite 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.250
 water another little thing many times we feel 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.320
 that we do not fill up that we eat and 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.840
 we eat and eat and we are hungrier 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.399
 we never fill it can be that 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.710
 do not be hungry it can be that 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.689
 just be dehydrated so 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.869
 you have to drink water all day 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.950
 the number 4 drink an adequate amount 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.200
 of water can decrease the risk of 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.810
 certain types of cancers including 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.450
 colon cancer bladder cancer and 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.659
 breast cancer that other reasons you want 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.840
 but I have 6 number 5 left for the 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.049
 Most sufferers drink water can 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.439
 significantly reduce pain in 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.479
 the joints or in the back 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.979
 good reasons to drink water 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.200
 truth 6 water favors health in 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.450
 general since it allows to eliminate 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.840
 waste and bacteria that can cause 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.700
 Bone diseases Water cleans us 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.129

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.569
 Also, we do not all have the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.280
 possibilities of having an orgasm for 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.140

 8 water hydrates our skin 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.510
 naturally and ensures an adequate 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.610

 people who suffer constipation and who 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.060

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.130
 number 10 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.170
 water is the main module of 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.750
 transport for all the nutrients in 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.630
 the body and it's essential for the 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.209
 circulation so what else do you want 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.180

 between three to three and a half liters of water 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.660
 every day for many people is 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.340
 an excess but for me it is no longer a 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.440
 excess because my body is so 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.470

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.930
