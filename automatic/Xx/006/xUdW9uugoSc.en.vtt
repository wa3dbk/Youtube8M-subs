00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.269 
and alt mode of the figure before we
begin<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.809> wanted<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.900> point<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.260> just<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:17.250> few

first part of the review and this is the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.609 
first part of the review and this is the
complete<00:00:23.850> conversion<00:00:24.090> into<00:00:24.689> robot<00:00:25.199> mode<00:00:25.410> II

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
complete conversion into robot mode II

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.609 
complete conversion into robot mode II
this<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> full<00:00:26.279> robot<00:00:26.699> mode<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.240> forgot<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
this is the full robot mode I forgot to

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.710 
this is the full robot mode I forgot to
mention<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.980> knee<00:00:29.099> pads<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:30.060> theny<00:00:30.359> guards

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.359 
mention the knee pads or theny guards
they<00:00:30.869> should<00:00:31.050> be<00:00:31.170> pointing<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> little<00:00:32.250> bit

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
they should be pointing a little bit

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.360 
they should be pointing a little bit
outward<00:00:34.820> what<00:00:35.820> else<00:00:36.739> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.829> go<00:00:37.950> ahead<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
outward what else you can go ahead and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.310 
outward what else you can go ahead and
fold<00:00:39.000> out<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.800> heels<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:42.329> collarbone<00:00:42.989> or<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
fold out the heels the collarbone or the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.990 
fold out the heels the collarbone or the
visor<00:00:43.559> should<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.460> transformed<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.210> way<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
visor should be transformed this way and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.529 
visor should be transformed this way and
that's<00:00:48.000> about<00:00:48.149> it

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
that's about it

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.090 
that's about it
everything<00:00:49.110> should<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.289> tabbed<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.829> neatly

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
everything should be tabbed and neatly

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.080 
everything should be tabbed and neatly
and<00:00:51.320> oh<00:00:52.320> there<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.129> some<00:00:53.309> mecha<00:00:53.489> live<00:00:53.699> gimmick

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and oh there is some mecha live gimmick

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.650 
and oh there is some mecha live gimmick
right<00:00:54.300> here<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.960> see<00:00:55.260> twist<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.160> bicep<00:00:56.670> you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
right here and see twist the bicep you

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.779 
right here and see twist the bicep you
can<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.079> gold<00:00:58.320> piece<00:00:58.620> represents<00:00:59.340> like

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
can see that gold piece represents like

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.020 
can see that gold piece represents like
a<00:00:59.820> cybernetic<00:01:00.510> bone<00:01:00.870> or<00:01:01.320> whatnot<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:02.850> that's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
a cybernetic bone or whatnot so that's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.109 
a cybernetic bone or whatnot so that's
that<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.629> also<00:01:03.949> some<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.489> piping<00:01:05.820> he's<00:01:05.970> got

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
that and also some like piping he's got

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.460 
that and also some like piping he's got
very<00:01:06.600> awesome<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.380> piping<00:01:07.820> as<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.000> will<00:01:09.150> see

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
very awesome like piping as you will see

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.830 
very awesome like piping as you will see
very<00:01:10.470> nice<00:01:11.630> okay<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.840> to

very nice okay so that's that to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.770 
very nice okay so that's that to
transform<00:01:16.380> him<00:01:16.530> into<00:01:16.710> his<00:01:17.250> period<00:01:18.119> Peterbilt

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
transform him into his period Peterbilt

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
transform him into his period Peterbilt

then the legs open up just like the

00:01:49.900 --> 00:02:00.270 
then the legs open up just like the
leader<00:01:50.110> class<00:01:50.380> figure<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:58.110> then<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.500> might

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
leader class figure that then you might

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.440 
leader class figure that then you might
go<00:02:00.490> ahead<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:01.229> join<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:03.030> leg<00:02:04.030> pieces

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
go ahead and join the leg pieces

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:14.160 
go ahead and join the leg pieces
together<00:02:12.480> start<00:02:13.480> by<00:02:13.600> joining<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.959> feet

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
together start by joining the feet

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:25.640 
together start by joining the feet
together<00:02:20.790> okay<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:23.590> not<00:02:23.830> cooperating<00:02:24.130> yeah

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
together okay it's not cooperating yeah

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.130 
together okay it's not cooperating yeah
okay<00:02:26.650> there<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.430> go

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
okay there you go

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.130 
okay there you go
and<00:02:29.140> then<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:30.790> like<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.120> there<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> joint

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
and then just like that there is a joint

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.479 
and then just like that there is a joint
right<00:02:32.320> here<00:02:32.380> underneath<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.130> knee<00:02:33.310> that

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
right here underneath the knee that

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.250 
right here underneath the knee that
allows<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.120> transform<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.870> legs<00:02:35.080> that

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
allows you to transform the legs that

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.880 
allows you to transform the legs that
way<00:02:35.790> next<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:37.750> want<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.930> do<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.170> arms<00:02:40.890> go

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
way next you want to do the arms go

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.370 
way next you want to do the arms go
ahead<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.370> pull<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.730> up<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.650> fists<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:46.450> slide

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
ahead and pull it up the fists and slide

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.860 
ahead and pull it up the fists and slide
the<00:02:47.850> panel's<00:02:48.850> outward<00:02:50.040> okay<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:52.540> what<00:02:52.750> you

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
the panel's outward okay and what you

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.990 
the panel's outward okay and what you
want<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.080> do<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.380> transform<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.340> part<00:02:54.820> of<00:02:54.940> the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
want to do is transform the part of the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.020
