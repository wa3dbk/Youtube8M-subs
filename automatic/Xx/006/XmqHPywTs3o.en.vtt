then go to the right and past route 11

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.660 
then go to the right and past route 11
which<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.799> right<00:00:14.099> here<00:00:14.839> and<00:00:15.839> over<00:00:16.830> into<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670

which is right here and over into the
village<00:00:18.119> bridge<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.900> think<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.350> can<00:00:19.500> only<00:00:19.560> get

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
village bridge I think you can only get

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.859 
village bridge I think you can only get
this<00:00:19.949> Pokemon<00:00:20.430> after<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.210> have<00:00:21.449> beaten<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
this Pokemon after you have beaten the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.529 
this Pokemon after you have beaten the
game<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.439> gotten<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.710> National<00:00:23.130> Dex

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
game and gotten the National Dex

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.720 
game and gotten the National Dex
