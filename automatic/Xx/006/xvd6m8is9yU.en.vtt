all<00:00:03.540> right<00:00:03.900> we've<00:00:04.440> covered<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.950> traditional

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
all right we've covered the traditional

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.700 
all right we've covered the traditional
toxic<00:00:05.910> metals<00:00:06.240> now<00:00:06.810> let's<00:00:07.440> talk<00:00:07.650> about

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
toxic metals now let's talk about

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.190 
toxic metals now let's talk about
calcium<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.660> beginning<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.080> this

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
calcium in the beginning of this

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.900 
calcium in the beginning of this
presentation<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:11.100> mentioned<00:00:11.520> that<00:00:11.639> under

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
presentation I mentioned that under

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.180 
presentation I mentioned that under
certain<00:00:12.119> circumstances<00:00:13.110> calcium<00:00:13.709> can<00:00:13.889> become

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
certain circumstances calcium can become

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.180 
certain circumstances calcium can become
a<00:00:14.219> toxic<00:00:14.760> metal<00:00:15.119> let's<00:00:15.990> discuss<00:00:16.440> exactly<00:00:16.980> how

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
a toxic metal let's discuss exactly how

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.509 
a toxic metal let's discuss exactly how
this<00:00:17.460> happens<00:00:18.439> unlike<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.619> previous<00:00:19.830> metals

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:20.519 
this happens unlike the previous metals

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.450 
this happens unlike the previous metals
we<00:00:20.670> have<00:00:20.789> discussed<00:00:21.380> calcium<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:22.560> toxic

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
we have discussed calcium is not toxic

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.939 
we have discussed calcium is not toxic
by<00:00:23.669> virtue<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.119> what<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.509> is<00:00:24.710> but<00:00:25.710> rather

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
by virtue of what it is but rather

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.359 
by virtue of what it is but rather
because<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.759> where<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.359> go<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:28.589> a<00:00:28.980> healthy

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
because of where it can go in a healthy

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.600 
because of where it can go in a healthy
body<00:00:30.259> 99%<00:00:31.259> of<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> calcium<00:00:31.919> is<00:00:32.070> found<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
body 99% of the calcium is found in the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.410 
body 99% of the calcium is found in the
bones<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.120> teeth<00:00:34.430> unfortunately<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:36.180> age

bones and teeth unfortunately as we age

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.380 
bones and teeth unfortunately as we age
our<00:00:36.809> bones<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.860> teeth<00:00:38.070> lose<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.879> calcium

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
our bones and teeth lose this calcium

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.049 
our bones and teeth lose this calcium
becoming<00:00:40.050> weak<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.649> brittle<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.520> process

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.830 
becoming weak and brittle this process
is<00:00:42.239> known<00:00:42.420> as<00:00:42.859> osteoporosis<00:00:43.859> and<00:00:44.129> tooth<00:00:44.430> decay

lost calcium goes it goes into the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
the less known results of calcification

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.650 
the less known results of calcification
in<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.510> body<00:02:22.340> calcium<00:02:23.340> also<00:02:23.610> accumulates<00:02:24.450> in

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
in the body calcium also accumulates in

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.950 
in the body calcium also accumulates in
the<00:02:24.960> muscles<00:02:25.410> as<00:02:25.650> we<00:02:26.130> age<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:27.450> causes

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
the muscles as we age this causes

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.990 
the muscles as we age this causes
tightness<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.650> muscles<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
tightness in the muscles and in the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.650 
tightness in the muscles and in the
extreme<00:02:30.450> leads<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.410> condition<00:02:31.710> known<00:02:32.190> as

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
extreme leads to a condition known as

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.750 
extreme leads to a condition known as
fibromyalgia<00:02:33.660> if<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.830> feel<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.250> muscles<00:02:35.610> of

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
fibromyalgia if you feel the muscles of

fibromyalgia if you feel the muscles of
a<00:02:35.820> small<00:02:36.090> child<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.900> will<00:02:37.230> see<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.620> they<00:02:37.800> are

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
a small child you will see that they are

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
can use to remove toxic metals such as

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.549 
can use to remove toxic metals such as
mercury<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:51.399> lead<00:04:51.460> can<00:04:52.419> also<00:04:52.629> be<00:04:52.990> used<00:04:53.319> to

00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:53.559 
mercury and lead can also be used to

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.010 
mercury and lead can also be used to
pull<00:04:53.979> this<00:04:54.159> toxic<00:04:54.699> calcium<00:04:55.210> from<00:04:55.419> our<00:04:55.569> bodies

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
pull this toxic calcium from our bodies

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.920 
pull this toxic calcium from our bodies
in<00:04:56.219> fact<00:04:57.219> this<00:04:57.789> process<00:04:58.330> will<00:04:58.569> not<00:04:58.599> only

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
in fact this process will not only

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.129 
in fact this process will not only
remove<00:04:59.229> toxic<00:05:00.129> calcium<00:05:00.639> but<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:01.479> can<00:05:01.659> actually

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
remove toxic calcium but it can actually

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.110 
remove toxic calcium but it can actually
put<00:05:02.499> it<00:05:02.620> back<00:05:02.830> into<00:05:03.249> the<00:05:03.430> bones<00:05:03.639> and<00:05:03.939> teeth

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
put it back into the bones and teeth

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.360 
put it back into the bones and teeth
where<00:05:04.389> it<00:05:04.509> belongs

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
where it belongs

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.529 
where it belongs
so<00:05:06.370> how<00:05:07.330> can<00:05:07.749> all<00:05:08.050> this<00:05:08.289> be<00:05:08.349> done<00:05:09.149> it<00:05:10.149> can<00:05:10.419> be

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
so how can all this be done it can be

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.689 
so how can all this be done it can be
done<00:05:10.749> with<00:05:11.349> a<00:05:11.379> process<00:05:11.979> called<00:05:12.699> chelation

done with a process called chelation

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.029 
done with a process called chelation
chelation<00:05:15.699> uses<00:05:16.539> a<00:05:16.569> synthetic<00:05:16.839> amino<00:05:17.469> acid

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
chelation uses a synthetic amino acid

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.929 
chelation uses a synthetic amino acid
called<00:05:18.249> EDTA<00:05:19.029> to<00:05:19.779> go<00:05:19.990> in<00:05:20.259> and<00:05:20.499> bind<00:05:21.249> to<00:05:21.639> these

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:21.939 
called EDTA to go in and bind to these

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.989

toxic metals and misplaced calcium and

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:28.920

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
physically pull them out of the body the

to think about it is to think of a

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.119 
to think about it is to think of a

world won't remove all the grease but
add<00:05:54.279> a<00:05:54.339> little<00:05:54.759> bit<00:05:54.969> of<00:05:55.089> soap<00:05:55.419> and<00:05:55.659> that<00:05:56.319> does

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
add a little bit of soap and that does

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.759 
add a little bit of soap and that does
the<00:05:56.709> trick<00:05:57.240> this<00:05:58.240> is<00:05:58.419> because<00:05:58.749> soap<00:05:59.169> is<00:05:59.439> what

00:05:59.759 --> 00:05:59.769 
the trick this is because soap is what

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:02.579 
the trick this is because soap is what
makes<00:06:00.009> Greece<00:06:00.419> water-soluble<00:06:01.419> add<00:06:01.749> the<00:06:02.349> soap
