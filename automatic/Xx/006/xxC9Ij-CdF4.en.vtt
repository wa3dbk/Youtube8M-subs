00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.820
 stands more precisely on this 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.340

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.210
 elevation of people goods 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.550
 winches scaffolding this kind of 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.940
 motorized platform things on this 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.339
 2013 batimat edition 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.430
 the accent was undeniably 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:01.309
 about the extent and richness of our 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.580
 range since actually we have at 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.040
 total nearly 35,000 materials that are 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.200
 dedicated to our building clientele 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.540
 so here obviously we are not exposing 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.180
 35000 material but it is not exposed near 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.250
 of two hundred which is four times 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.690
 more for just memory that 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.510
 our at our last 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.980
 presence so at the 2011 edition so 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.530
 the goal is really to 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.720
 to be able to show the batimat visitor 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.220

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.670
 that can be found in the sector of 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.460
 building so we have materials 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.740
 which will cover the soil treatment 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.170
 sanding as well so soil 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.630

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.850
 power tools and especially 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.610
 everything that is electric since 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.939

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.799

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.530
