brother was killed and that was just

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.880 
brother was killed and that was just
about<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.600> time<00:03:37.720> when<00:03:37.989> I<00:03:38.019> was<00:03:38.200> meeting<00:03:38.380> Cedric

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
about the time when I was meeting Cedric

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.910 
about the time when I was meeting Cedric
and<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:40.209> allowed<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.840> actually<00:03:41.200> taught<00:03:41.410> me<00:03:41.620> I

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
and it allowed it actually taught me I

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.560 
and it allowed it actually taught me I
don't<00:03:42.670> think<00:03:42.850> if<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.120> wouldn't<00:03:43.360> have<00:03:43.480> had

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
don't think if I wouldn't have had

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.000 
don't think if I wouldn't have had
Cedric<00:03:44.050> in<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.290> group<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.590> don't<00:03:44.769> think<00:03:44.920> I

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
Cedric in the group I don't think I

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.080 
Cedric in the group I don't think I
would<00:03:45.130> have<00:03:45.190> gotten<00:03:45.400> through<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:45.910> well

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
would have gotten through it so well

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.000 
would have gotten through it so well
because<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.930> group<00:03:47.110> kind<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.380> took<00:03:47.560> me<00:03:47.739> away

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
because the group kind of took me away

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.370 
because the group kind of took me away
from<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.519> someone<00:03:48.970> had<00:03:49.150> died<00:03:49.660> in<00:03:49.840> my<00:03:49.930> family

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
from that someone had died in my family

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.479 
from that someone had died in my family
it<00:03:51.190> helped<00:03:51.400> me<00:03:51.610> cope<00:03:51.880> with<00:03:51.940> different<00:03:53.489> things

it helped me cope with different things
that<00:03:54.760> goes<00:03:55.000> on<00:03:55.239> in<00:03:55.390> my<00:03:55.480> life<00:03:55.720> like<00:03:56.080> growing
