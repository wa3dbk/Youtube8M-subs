00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
currently I'm just using the regular

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.840 
currently I'm just using the regular
size<00:01:28.240> L<00:01:28.570> M<00:01:28.750> v1<00:01:29.100> because<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:30.310> really<00:01:30.550> like<00:01:30.700> the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
size L M v1 because I really like the

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.360 
size L M v1 because I really like the
feel<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.600> like<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.840> beveled<00:01:32.170> edges

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
feel of it and like the beveled edges

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.820 
feel of it and like the beveled edges
and<00:01:33.370> I<00:01:33.880> averaged<00:01:34.210> like<00:01:34.450> 35<00:01:34.960> oh<00:01:34.990> no<00:01:35.229> H<00:01:35.500> so<00:01:35.800> I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
and I averaged like 35 oh no H so I

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.070 
and I averaged like 35 oh no H so I
guess<00:01:36.220> I<00:01:36.430> would<00:01:36.580> want<00:01:36.729> like<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.909> 35<00:01:37.420> marriage<00:01:37.870> I
