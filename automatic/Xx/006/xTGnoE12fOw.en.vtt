pretty mild note for most of the UK but

pretty mild note for most of the UK but

the<00:00:14.460> early<00:00:14.580> part<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.030> next<00:00:15.210> week<00:00:15.360> we're<00:00:15.900> going

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
the early part of next week we're going

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.019 
the early part of next week we're going
to<00:00:16.080> feel<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.410> cold<00:00:16.680> weather<00:00:16.920> more<00:00:17.490> widely

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
to feel that cold weather more widely

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.150 
to feel that cold weather more widely
and<00:00:18.990> if<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.170> look<00:00:19.289> at<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.470> chart<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.010> can

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
and if we look at the chart here we can

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160 
and if we look at the chart here we can
see<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.609> reason<00:00:20.939> behind<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.630> out<00:00:21.779> over

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
see the reason behind that and out over

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560 
see the reason behind that and out over
parts<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.619> Europe<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.220> Scandinavia<00:00:23.570> there's

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
parts of Europe and Scandinavia there's

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.660 
parts of Europe and Scandinavia there's
quite<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> lot<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.050> cold<00:00:25.380> air<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.400> that's<00:00:26.490> going

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
quite a lot of cold air and that's going

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.370 
quite a lot of cold air and that's going
