00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.510
 he distributed among the favorite tracks of the German unfortunately 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.580
 I found at home 0 1 is less on the yeast dough that happened then 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.589
 under the sofa into the abyss rips 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.889
 for here he holds, he shares with the easiest to prepare 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.280
 the problem is just 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.210
 if something goes wrong then it is not the help 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.240
 high-tech way 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.009
 and you can drag him away 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.009
 how to prepare a yeast dough that we will show you now 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.900
 First of all, what is everyone? 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.310
 There are two ways you can guess with fresh produce therefore advise 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.720
 the work had traditionally been with fresh yeast 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.960
 the experts small offender who multiply when they have enough food 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.600
 Kindness and Breuer have been baking while kids called food more 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.670
 as a price therefore we have ca and basses 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.270
 we can call the rabble 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.440
 So directly to the careers or 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.019
 Handball on the water dissolve that in any case always with fresh help 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:59.640
 must be made 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.050
 for that presents the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.370
 just if that was something 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.520
 and while the land and its aid has completely dissolved 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.770
 all ingredients usually fail for Martyn no goal 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.240
 did not really need to be noticed 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.780
 so that supplies can work cleverly 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.970
 lead like me 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.750
 but the reality is that the microwaves are still warm for a while 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.070
 then always pay attention to the reality has never dared me 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.190
 Degrees become warm because that is for the established to train and they die 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.290
 because at any time can not go more 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.290
 So they give more input to a sister 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.340
 give ours 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.660
 here is something different and quite so 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.660
 a bit tough 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.690
 Ample the whole now first with the Hans Burger do with dough hook 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.590
 the heraldic animal of handwork is 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.300
 knead the dance-night now again with the hands properly 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.220
 the reported activist therefore it is important May fell on the asphalt 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.809
 bring 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:12.029
 and the first night has worked well and can go 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:20.659
 and that means just now the right chancellor a bass is the case 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.019
 and if you do it again with your finger 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.019
 other experts do not care 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:32.009
 that means they come to the next step to let go is tricky there 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:36.639
 Handle the rest that is needed at the moment, or the yeasts and too 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:37.799
 work 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.400
 while making the game as a normal day in Advent has been well 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.589
 can happen 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.959
 but also when bending over 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.409
 today for example in the oven then simply with a binding 2k 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:50.899
 cover 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.370
 and at a maximum of 30 degrees 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.340
 So as long as the markets have been promoted effectively doubled so did a good one 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.699
 half an hour and a half 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:04.339
 including half an hour of customer trust in an assassination attempt 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.739
 and then you become really wonderful 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.259
 how he has doubled his volume that means we can go on 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.259
 so Kan wants me a strike but the gate 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.410
 and to kick in new air now 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.410
 who then steered through again diligently 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.589
 and depending on the time now next processed
