anyway<00:00:00.359> I've<00:00:00.599> studied<00:00:01.199> lots<00:00:01.740> of<00:00:01.829> methods<00:00:02.040> of

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
anyway I've studied lots of methods of

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.800 
anyway I've studied lots of methods of
how<00:00:02.399> it<00:00:02.460> could<00:00:02.580> happen<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.000> potato<00:00:03.330> method<00:00:03.750> is

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
how it could happen the potato method is

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.720 
how it could happen the potato method is
the<00:00:03.870> best<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.770> potato<00:00:05.100> method<00:00:05.580> is

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
the best and the potato method is

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.870 
the best and the potato method is
scientifically<00:00:06.629> researched<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.830> prove<00:00:08.250> that

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
scientifically researched to prove that

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.180 
scientifically researched to prove that
we<00:00:09.030> actually<00:00:09.179> all<00:00:09.389> breathe<00:00:09.660> too<00:00:09.929> much<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.380> in

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
we actually all breathe too much and in

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.100 
we actually all breathe too much and in
previously<00:00:11.759> maps<00:00:12.059> we<00:00:12.269> breathe<00:00:12.509> too<00:00:12.719> much<00:00:12.900> it

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
previously maps we breathe too much it

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.660 
previously maps we breathe too much it
take<00:00:13.290> too<00:00:13.500> much<00:00:13.650> air<00:00:13.830> into<00:00:14.040> your<00:00:14.130> mouth<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
take too much air into your mouth and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.519 
take too much air into your mouth and
and<00:00:15.120> that's<00:00:15.330> through<00:00:15.870> your<00:00:16.020> nose<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.379> that's

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
and that's through your nose and that's

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.920 
and that's through your nose and that's
got<00:00:16.710> too<00:00:16.890> many<00:00:17.100> components<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.539> air<00:00:18.690> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
got too many components in the air and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.900 
got too many components in the air and
that<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:19.920> according<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.640> particular

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
that can be according to particular

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.580 
that can be according to particular
method<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.539> believe<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.230> research

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
method and I believe it the research

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.370 
method and I believe it the research
says<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.160> have<00:00:23.550> meet<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> lot<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.060> diseases

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
says and have meet a lot of diseases

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.109 
says and have meet a lot of diseases
little<00:00:25.380> run<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> problem<00:00:25.920> absolutely<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
little run the problem absolutely you

don't<00:00:27.269> know<00:00:27.660> let<00:00:28.140> me<00:00:28.260> do<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.560> if<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.189> stop

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
don't know let me do it if you stop

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.650 
don't know let me do it if you stop
breathing<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.910> order<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.150> stop<00:00:30.359> getting<00:00:30.510> any

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
breathing in order to stop getting any

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.179 
breathing in order to stop getting any
diseases<00:00:31.019> right<00:00:31.380> well<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.710> look<00:00:31.859> very<00:00:32.009> long

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
about halfway through it looks as though

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
that's because I've done it the wrong

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.690 
that's because I've done it the wrong
way<00:02:25.620> around<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:26.040> see<00:02:26.190> because<00:02:26.310> normally<00:02:26.670> I

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
way around you see because normally I

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.280 
way around you see because normally I
would<00:02:26.849> start<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.299> first<00:02:27.900> thing<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
would start this first thing in the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.660 
would start this first thing in the
morning<00:02:28.620> I've<00:02:28.830> done<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.099> as<00:02:29.280> an<00:02:29.370> experiment

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
morning I've done this as an experiment

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.900 
morning I've done this as an experiment
for<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.330> program<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:32.430> would<00:02:32.610> have<00:02:32.760> been

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
for the program and that would have been

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.270 
for the program and that would have been
my<00:02:33.060> 1-minute<00:02:33.330> one<00:02:33.750> working<00:02:34.380> up<00:02:34.680> from<00:02:34.920> 40

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
my 1-minute one working up from 40

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.620 
my 1-minute one working up from 40
seconds<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.760> first<00:02:35.970> one<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.299> day

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
seconds the first one of the day

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.350 
seconds the first one of the day
and<00:02:37.019> as<00:02:37.230> we're<00:02:37.440> at<00:02:37.650> 2:20<00:02:38.519> in<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.640> morning<00:02:39.000> I

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
and as we're at 2:20 in the morning I

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.000 
and as we're at 2:20 in the morning I
thought<00:02:39.630> I'd<00:02:39.750> better<00:02:39.900> do<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.319> 6<00:02:40.560> a.m.<00:02:40.829> one

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
thought I'd better do the 6 a.m. one

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.830 
thought I'd better do the 6 a.m. one
yeah<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.489> that's<00:02:41.610> why<00:02:41.760> 20<00:02:41.819> 40<00:02:42.239> seconds<00:02:42.599> but<00:02:42.720> I

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
yeah so that's why 20 40 seconds but I

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.370 
yeah so that's why 20 40 seconds but I
mean<00:02:42.959> look<00:02:43.470> at<00:02:43.590> all<00:02:43.950> different
