00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello people i have a little puzzle 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.029
 for you what is all this about when 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.230
 you live at the top of a house and 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.670
 I have no hope 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.349
 you have no annoying neighbors 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.300
 over the whole time and traffic lights 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.020
 or c you can be incredibly horny 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.660
 Throw paper airplane from the balcony 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.890
 strong and that was like today we 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.350
 make a blatant now 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.880
 Paper airplane battle every two 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.650
 try to keep two papers 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.300
 or still not throw the loser 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.740
 far enough behind the clear 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:36.390
 the other one remains then it must over 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:38.420
 by the outside very little say yes 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.890
 namely fully the blatant papiertiger book 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.910
 the old freak and do you still have some 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.950
 in the head is a perfection 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.780
 important for decades after the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.020
 perfect paper airplane formula researched 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.699
 and to function today is important 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.989
 is a friend of the paper plane at 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.979
 Of course, this operation is not 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.100
 just look like it's funny that it's the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.290
 perfect flier , the hit was not what 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.409
 the film is now very much looking forward to it 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.409
 me very much in the districts airport 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.270
 biedermanns I was yes 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.970
 here to the master paper plane 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.000
 Engineer on the big important 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.500
 Significantly, in fact, it is the largest 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.310
 paper plane airfield of the world 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.869
 trained in behind live anyway 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.220
 would be relatively humid for many years 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.020
 have to complete training 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.579
 and now I can really master myself 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.429
 Paper airplane designers 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.929
 if consumption is not declining that 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.450
 no great art i 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.310
 Leonardo da Vinci would also be there before 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.590
 wet pale when he my aircraft 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.030
 would see 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.789
 this is my masterpiece such a good one 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.590
 I have never built paper carers 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.950
 that we are after the interests of the series 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.000
 yes and how we will see that yes yes 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.709
 like two different paper planes 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.090
 built models because I did not know exactly 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.929
 how profitable it promised today have 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.830
 I decided to go two 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.780
 to try different things 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.209
 which is more like that classic 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.549
 model with relatively wide wings like 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.440
 make sure that the plane at 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.870
 relatively weak are really two 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.370
 is carried by the air which sets 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.319
 actually a completely different principle 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.420
 therefore just cut through the air 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.040
 no matter how strong the wind is, that's it 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.060
 trick doing so as it did the link 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.430
 I also have two different ones 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.109
 Models once built the classic 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.980
 biplane, so to speak, double 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.629
 area to have 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.190
 once a looping machine the 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.349
 hopefully if it worked 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.540
 nice loopings and so easy 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.790
 thereby as far as possible comes into the house 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.920
 built incomparable and once something 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.120
 I screwed it had nothing to me here 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.200
 I can not think of a weapon 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.150
 Build another plane 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.340
 Let's see what can be 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.810
 all i am optimistic if that 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.140
 ship sinking at nothing then 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:03:07.019
 more than optimism makes the beginning 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:07.980
 the partie what needs the absolute 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.230
 catastrophe 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.130
 league total cup ulstertal decay times 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.170
 Do not look like it 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.470
 can only do better than what the first 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.470
 money 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:29.010
 the rangers board 70 it perfect 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.319
 No matter because I want the work to agree 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.350
 Weeks by the direction of the paragraph 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.770
 every case first again 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.770
 Let's go 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.460
 O 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.159
 steep down 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.959
 steep down but a few meters 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.519
 put back a branch on the roof 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.650
 has landed I hope that now my 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.280
 biplane a little further I come 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.280
 just try times 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:13.290
 So people here it is and more violent 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:15.720
 from basti that are 50 centimeters so that 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.280
 here the good the good variant of mine 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.140
 Pflegers I hope so now in niklas 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.370
 to beat and I have the 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.370
 player does not have to be on 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.789
 wow now niklas now comes the 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.930
 decision now it is my turn and 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.270
 actually it is already 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.009
 firmly accused 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.710
 the two of them already have their throws 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:44.319
 gone and that's actually the farthest 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.190
 I was 50 centimeters from the house 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.990
 after all , it had already been on a few 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.550
 By contrast, this is what it is 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.840
 which is against right but now comes 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.280
 yes my paper plane the wind 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.449
 shit is and I believe so can 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.259
 I again worth my own 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.259
 I am curious 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.490
 88 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.490
 so had gotten stuck 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.159
 who of you two has to go now 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.589
 clearly I imagine by fits 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.479
 his farthest aviator is less far 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:14.399
 Come as a weiner a little farther 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.279
 aviator flew behind the states 

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:19.289
 but I should find that the sound 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:21.419
 so to speak, their wood together or something 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.860
 now collected collected there now 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:31.979
 he is already the farthest aviator 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:37.979
 from basti that one here 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:39.300
 he is in the biggest people we hope 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.860
 you papierflieger to our small 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.019
 action if you like the full 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.669
 paper airplane found professionals shows us yet 

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:46.739
 times your creations shows the route 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.819
 fly and send us the link then 

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:49.619
 we even make it a playlist 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.819
 and then link somewhere if 

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:52.949
 Anybody participates in plastic 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:54.059
 shit and while we still do not 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.349
 had enough then are here and still 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:57.300
 two videos linked to the synonymous look 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.949
 can nice comments and city drives 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.959
 friendly comments or personal 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.719
 news fanpost writes you my 

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:04.979
 tattooing name 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.239
 yes it would be really exorbitant 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.439
 happy if you subscribe to the channel 

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:09.179
 would you see continue even 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:11.959
 we are shitting now and we are 

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:11.959
 next time it'll be good
