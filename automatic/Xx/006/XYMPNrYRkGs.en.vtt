00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.190 
bike right now but whatever anyway this
is<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.619> quick<00:01:07.710> little<00:01:07.799> how<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:09.080> see<00:01:10.080> what<00:01:10.170> I

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
is just a quick little how to see what I

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.120 
is just a quick little how to see what I
can<00:01:10.260> set<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.619> down<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.010> they<00:01:11.130> don't<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.430> any

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
can set this down so they don't have any

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.330 
can set this down so they don't have any
they're<00:01:14.720> not<00:01:15.720> or<00:01:15.900> anything<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> iphone

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.859 

so<00:01:20.340> what<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> did<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.880> instead<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.600> using<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
so what I did is instead of using the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.149 
so what I did is instead of using the
sticky<00:01:22.409> backs<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.700> comes<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:25.100> for<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
sticky backs that it comes with for the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.560 
sticky backs that it comes with for the
side<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> top<00:01:27.030> mount<00:01:27.450> stuff<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:29.570> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
side and the top mount stuff like that I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.600 
side and the top mount stuff like that I
you<00:01:31.409> actually<00:01:31.860> took<00:01:31.979> off<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.369> little

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610

unless<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.530> bothering<00:02:04.920> your<00:02:05.070> something

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.380 
it doesn't really matter
this<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:12.760> solid<00:02:13.090> as<00:02:13.180> hell<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.480> there<00:02:13.629> like

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
this is solid as hell in there like

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.839 
this is solid as hell in there like
that's<00:02:16.390> not<00:02:16.569> moving<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.650> put<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.610> weight<00:02:18.730> of

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
that's not moving so put the weight of

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.500 
that's not moving so put the weight of
the<00:02:18.970> camera<00:02:19.360> which<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.319> like<00:02:20.470> super<00:02:20.950> light

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the camera which is like super light

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.910 
the camera which is like super light
that<00:02:22.510> shouldn't<00:02:22.810> go<00:02:22.930> anywhere<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.530> mean<00:02:23.769> that's

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
that shouldn't go anywhere I mean that's

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.330 
that shouldn't go anywhere I mean that's
solid<00:02:24.580> as<00:02:24.849> hell<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:28.860> that's<00:02:29.860> pretty<00:02:30.099> much<00:02:30.220> it

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
solid as hell and that's pretty much it

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.490 
solid as hell and that's pretty much it
that's<00:02:30.760> all<00:02:30.849> it<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.090> all<00:02:31.569> it<00:02:31.750> really<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.319> it

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
that's all it is all it really is to it

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500 
that's all it is all it really is to it
just<00:02:32.769> to<00:02:32.890> mount<00:02:33.250> those<00:02:33.430> like<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.180> said<00:02:34.269> it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
just to mount those like I said it's

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.080 
just to mount those like I said it's
good<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.019> sense<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.730> now<00:02:36.730> I'm<00:02:36.940> probably

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
good in the sense of now I'm probably

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.220 
good in the sense of now I'm probably
going<00:02:37.269> to<00:02:37.360> have<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.510> pick<00:02:37.660> up<00:02:37.780> another<00:02:37.959> one<00:02:38.049> of

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
online if you wanted to but because the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.720 
online if you wanted to but because the
way<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:47.920> supposed<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.280> be<00:02:48.370> designed

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
way this is supposed to be designed

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.900 
way this is supposed to be designed
supposed<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.120> have<00:02:49.209> that<00:02:49.360> sticky<00:02:49.690> back<00:02:50.910> those

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
supposed to have that sticky back those

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.880 
supposed to have that sticky back those
mounts<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:52.450> then<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:52.720> just<00:02:52.870> slides<00:02:53.739> in

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
mounts and then this is just slides in

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.830 
mounts and then this is just slides in
and<00:02:54.040> clicks<00:02:54.250> into<00:02:54.430> place<00:02:54.519> but<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.569> course<00:02:55.780> you

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
and clicks into place but of course you

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.280 
and clicks into place but of course you
don't<00:02:55.989> have<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.410> there<00:02:56.709> but<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:57.160> guess<00:02:58.090> it's

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
don't have that there but I guess it's

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.069 
don't have that there but I guess it's
six<00:02:59.290> one-half<00:02:59.680> dozen<00:02:59.829> the<00:03:00.040> other<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.660> anyway

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
six one-half dozen the other so anyway

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:24.150 
six one-half dozen the other so anyway
when<00:03:02.260> it's<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.500> there<00:03:10.230> whatever<00:03:22.230> yeah<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:24.010> I

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
when it's on there whatever yeah like I

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.729 
when it's on there whatever yeah like I
said<00:03:24.450> it's<00:03:25.450> good<00:03:25.750> because<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.230> likes<00:03:26.500> its

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
said it's good because it likes its

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.449 
said it's good because it likes its
pretty<00:03:27.519> much<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:28.060> level<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.739> wherever<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.190> look

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
pretty much I level and wherever I look

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.920 
pretty much I level and wherever I look
it's<00:03:30.670> going<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:30.940> look<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.359> can<00:03:31.480> adjust<00:03:31.600> it

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
it's going to look and you can adjust it

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.490 
it's going to look and you can adjust it
down<00:03:32.109> or<00:03:32.470> up<00:03:32.650> or<00:03:32.859> whatever<00:03:33.069> a<00:03:34.170> lot<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.200> chin
