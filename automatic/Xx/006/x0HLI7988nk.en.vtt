00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
I guess better point is budokai HD that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.970 
I guess better point is budokai HD that
same<00:00:54.360> year<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:54.899> released<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.500> America

same year was released in America
november<00:00:56.670> six<00:00:56.870> 2012<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.559> same<00:00:58.800> day<00:00:58.980> as<00:00:59.100> halo<00:00:59.430> 4

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
november six 2012 the same day as halo 4

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.150 
november six 2012 the same day as halo 4
now<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.020> leading<00:01:01.530> me<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.800> say<00:01:01.980> that

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
now this is leading me to say that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.920 
now this is leading me to say that
basically<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.850> lately<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.690> been

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
basically here lately they have been

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.479 
basically here lately they have been
trying<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.290> release<00:01:04.710> their<00:01:04.949> games<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
trying to release their games on the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.969 
trying to release their games on the
same<00:01:05.729> day<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:06.240> other<00:01:06.540> big<00:01:06.869> titles<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.740> think

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
same day as other big titles and I think

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.320 
same day as other big titles and I think
