little Hills have all been filed flat to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.540 
little Hills have all been filed flat to
reveal<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.929> different<00:01:07.289> layers

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
reveal all the different layers

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.490 
reveal all the different layers
underneath<00:01:08.550> and<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.660> sheet<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.140> I've

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
underneath and the sheet that I've

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:19.709 
underneath and the sheet that I've
bought<00:01:10.830> looked<00:01:11.130> something<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.490> this

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.300 

now<00:01:20.719> the<00:01:20.780> advantage<00:01:21.259> is<00:01:21.380> that<00:01:21.409> this<00:01:22.039> sheet

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
now the advantage is that this sheet

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.620 
now the advantage is that this sheet
saves<00:01:22.610> me<00:01:22.880> hours<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.509> hours<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:25.270> time<00:01:26.270> making

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
saves me hours and hours of time making

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.350 
saves me hours and hours of time making
it<00:01:26.899> but<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.530> downside<00:01:27.770> is<00:01:28.130> this<00:01:28.490> is<00:01:28.610> expensive

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
it but the downside is this is expensive

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.779 
it but the downside is this is expensive
I<00:01:29.390> think<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:29.899> was<00:01:30.079> a<00:01:30.549> fifty<00:01:31.549> millimeter

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
I think this was a fifty millimeter

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.969 
I think this was a fifty millimeter
square<00:01:32.450> sheet<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.320> it's<00:01:33.530> about<00:01:33.649> half<00:01:33.890> a

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
square sheet and it's about half a

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.580 
square sheet and it's about half a
millimeter<00:01:34.130> thick<00:01:34.429> two<00:01:35.420> inch<00:01:35.600> two<00:01:36.439> inch

millimeter thick two inch two inch
square<00:01:37.340> sheet<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.060> think<00:01:38.240> this<00:01:38.659> cost<00:01:38.929> me<00:01:39.170> about

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
square sheet I think this cost me about

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.740 
square sheet I think this cost me about
70<00:01:39.890> or<00:01:39.920> 80<00:01:40.159> pounds<00:01:40.759> which<00:01:41.149> is<00:01:41.270> quite<00:01:41.479> a<00:01:41.509> lot<00:01:41.720> of

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
70 or 80 pounds which is quite a lot of

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.419 
70 or 80 pounds which is quite a lot of
money<00:01:42.020> but<00:01:42.259> if<00:01:42.350> we<00:01:42.409> consider<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.860> time<00:01:43.039> taken

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
money but if we consider the time taken

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.270 
money but if we consider the time taken
for<00:01:43.520> me<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.789> make<00:01:44.000> this<00:01:44.240> it's<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.380> money<00:01:46.069> well

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
for me to make this it's a money well

project and I'm going to make the

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.479 
project and I'm going to make the
earrings<00:02:20.630> out<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.900> here<00:02:21.079> now<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:21.829> sheet<00:02:22.190> is

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
earrings out of here now this sheet is

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.280 
earrings out of here now this sheet is
rather<00:02:23.480> expensive<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:24.350> think<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:24.859> a<00:02:25.090> 50

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
rather expensive I think this is a 50

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.020 
rather expensive I think this is a 50
millimeter<00:02:27.290> square<00:02:27.980> sheets<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.730> think

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
millimeter square sheets and I think

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.360 
millimeter square sheets and I think
this<00:02:29.329> cost<00:02:29.660> me<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.049> read<00:02:30.170> about<00:02:30.260> 7080<00:02:31.040> pounds

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
this cost me and read about 7080 pounds

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.099 
this cost me and read about 7080 pounds
so<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.150> really<00:02:32.329> want<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.480> get<00:02:32.600> my<00:02:32.720> money's<00:02:33.079> worth

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
so I really want to get my money's worth

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:38.830 
so I really want to get my money's worth
out<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.650> using<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.519> sheet<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:37.030> it's<00:02:38.030> trying

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
out of using this sheet so it's trying

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.449 
out of using this sheet so it's trying
utilize<00:02:39.319> as<00:02:39.500> much<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.069> sheet<00:02:40.280> as<00:02:40.370> we

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
utilize as much of this sheet as we

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.090 
utilize as much of this sheet as we
possibly<00:02:40.910> can<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:42.200> distance<00:02:42.560> across<00:02:42.680> here

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
possibly can the distance across here

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.390 
possibly can the distance across here
now<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.400> 20<00:02:43.989> so<00:02:44.989> we're<00:02:45.200> going<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.590> make<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
now is 20 so we're going to make the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.670 
now is 20 so we're going to make the
earrings<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:48.700> fraction<00:02:49.700> under<00:02:50.030> 20<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:51.470> we<00:02:51.560> can

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
earrings a fraction under 20 so we can

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.710 
earrings a fraction under 20 so we can
utilize<00:02:51.829> all<00:02:52.069> that<00:02:52.389> so<00:02:53.389> divide<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:54.049> up<00:02:54.109> I<00:02:55.720> do

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
utilize all that so divide this up I do

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.110 
utilize all that so divide this up I do
that<00:02:56.959> enough<00:02:57.200> about<00:02:57.410> nine<00:02:57.950> and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
that enough about nine and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.530 
that enough about nine and
three-quarters<00:03:01.870> get<00:03:02.870> our<00:03:03.049> sheet<00:03:04.540> gently

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
three-quarters get our sheet gently

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.960 
three-quarters get our sheet gently

scribe a line there Scrabble on base who
know<00:03:08.120> what<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.389> center<00:03:08.750> is

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.670 

I'm<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.590> scribe<00:03:12.950> or<00:03:13.010> line<00:03:13.280> here<00:03:14.349> so<00:03:15.349> now<00:03:15.440> where

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
I'm a scribe or line here so now where

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.220 
I'm a scribe or line here so now where
these<00:03:15.920> lines<00:03:16.310> cross<00:03:17.239> here<00:03:17.510> we<00:03:17.660> know<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:18.049> that

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
these lines cross here we know that that

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.069 
these lines cross here we know that that
is<00:03:18.470> going<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:18.829> be<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.099> exact<00:03:19.609> radius<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.930> the

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
is going to be the exact radius to the

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.699 
is going to be the exact radius to the
edge<00:03:21.250> I'm<00:03:22.250> just<00:03:22.489> gonna<00:03:22.609> take<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.090> in<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:23.450> a

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
edge I'm just gonna take it in and a

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.539 
edge I'm just gonna take it in and a
fraction<00:03:24.709> just<00:03:24.829> give<00:03:25.099> a<00:03:25.130> little<00:03:25.160> bit<00:03:25.370> more

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
fraction just give a little bit more

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.600 
fraction just give a little bit more
room<00:03:26.030> for<00:03:26.090> maneuver<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:28.040> Daisy<00:03:28.250> as<00:03:28.699> popular

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
room for maneuver so Daisy as popular

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.430 
room for maneuver so Daisy as popular
and<00:03:29.960> that<00:03:30.960> and<00:03:31.920> now<00:03:32.160> we<00:03:32.220> simply<00:03:35.000> make<00:03:36.000> our

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
and that and now we simply make our

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.340 
and that and now we simply make our
circle<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:40.940> want<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.030> make<00:03:42.180> two<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.450> these<00:03:42.660> so

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
circle I want to make two of these so

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.430 
circle I want to make two of these so
I'm<00:03:43.440> going<00:03:43.770> over<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.100> other<00:03:44.130> side<00:03:44.550> here

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.870 

now<00:03:49.440> subscribe<00:03:49.860> that<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.460> we<00:03:50.550> know<00:03:50.700> where

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
now subscribe that so we know where

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.520 
now subscribe that so we know where
we're<00:03:51.000> looking<00:03:51.240> at<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:54.800> then<00:03:55.800> I<00:03:55.890> subscribe

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
we're looking at and then I subscribe

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.570 
we're looking at and then I subscribe
another<00:03:58.530> circle<00:03:59.960> over<00:04:00.960> there<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.400> don't<00:04:02.400> push

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
another circle over there I don't push

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.880 
another circle over there I don't push
too<00:04:02.610> hard<00:04:02.880> on<00:04:03.330> this<00:04:03.480> point<00:04:03.810> otherwise<00:04:04.710> you're

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
too hard on this point otherwise you're

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.060 
too hard on this point otherwise you're
going<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.190> mark<00:04:05.550> the<00:04:06.540> metal<00:04:06.900> alternately<00:04:07.740> what

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
going to mark the metal alternately what

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.470 
going to mark the metal alternately what
we<00:04:08.190> could<00:04:08.459> do<00:04:08.640> is<00:04:08.760> put<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.030> little<00:04:09.120> bit<00:04:09.330> of

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
we could do is put a little bit of

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.040 
we could do is put a little bit of
masking<00:04:09.959> tape<00:04:09.990> in<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:11.010> center<00:04:11.459> here<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:12.050> we

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
masking tape in the center here so we

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.600 
masking tape in the center here so we
mark<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.470> masking<00:04:13.800> tape<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.100> not<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.340> metal

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
mark the masking tape and not the metal

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.170 
mark the masking tape and not the metal
underneath<00:04:15.470> on<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.590> father<00:04:16.769> it<00:04:16.970> now<00:04:17.970> we<00:04:18.030> need

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
underneath on the father it now we need

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.340 
underneath on the father it now we need
to<00:04:18.269> cut<00:04:18.450> out<00:04:18.570> these<00:04:19.549> circles<00:04:23.990> glasses<00:04:24.990> on<00:04:25.140> so<00:04:25.170> I

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
to cut out these circles glasses on so I

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.800 
to cut out these circles glasses on so I
can<00:04:25.530> see<00:04:25.560> what<00:04:25.830> I'm<00:04:25.890> doing<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:29.420> I<00:04:30.420> think<00:04:30.630> this

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
can see what I'm doing and I think this

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.500 
can see what I'm doing and I think this
sheet<00:04:31.050> is<00:04:31.170> about<00:04:31.380> half<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.950> millimeter<00:04:32.160> thick

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
sheet is about half a millimeter thick

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.790 
sheet is about half a millimeter thick
just<00:04:33.510> not<00:04:33.780> going<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.020> take<00:04:34.230> an<00:04:34.350> awful<00:04:34.470> lot<00:04:34.770> of

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
just not going to take an awful lot of

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:47.000 
just not going to take an awful lot of
cutting<00:04:35.190> out<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:46.110> know<00:04:46.230> as<00:04:46.380> I'm<00:04:46.500> moving<00:04:46.710> the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
cutting out you know as I'm moving the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:55.270 
cutting out you know as I'm moving the
sheets<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:50.310> not<00:04:50.550> necessarily<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.300> sole

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.030 

which<00:04:56.280> is<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.460> far<00:04:56.700> easier<00:04:56.880> way<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.270> trying<00:04:57.660> to

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
which is a far easier way of trying to

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:06.950 
which is a far easier way of trying to
cut<00:04:59.040> a<00:04:59.750> circle<00:05:05.210> make<00:05:06.210> sure<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.540> hold<00:05:06.810> the

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
cut a circle make sure you hold the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.660 
cut a circle make sure you hold the
metal<00:05:07.230> down<00:05:07.380> as<00:05:07.590> well<00:05:07.800> quite<00:05:08.190> close<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.640> where

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
metal down as well quite close to where

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.850 
metal down as well quite close to where
you're<00:05:08.940> sawing<00:05:09.180> otherwise<00:05:09.960> you'll<00:05:10.560> get<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:10.740> bit

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
you're sawing otherwise you'll get a bit
