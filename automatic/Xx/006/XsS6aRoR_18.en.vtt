to update are we gonna be able play
video<00:01:09.659> games<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.990> these<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.409> there's<00:01:10.619> 720p<00:01:11.659> 2.4

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
video games on these so there's 720p 2.4

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.380 
video games on these so there's 720p 2.4
million<00:01:12.869> pixels<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.700> their<00:01:14.700> refresh<00:01:15.090> rate<00:01:15.270> is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
million pixels and their refresh rate is

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.120 
million pixels and their refresh rate is
a<00:01:15.420> less<00:01:15.780> than<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.990> millisecond<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
a less than a millisecond so this is

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.499 
a less than a millisecond so this is
going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.430> great<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:17.850> first-person

that the 3d images didn't have that
dimness<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.229> I've<00:02:04.350> seen<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> lot<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.040> TV

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
dimness that I've seen on a lot of TV

3d<00:02:07.380> glasses<00:02:07.590> why<00:02:08.429> didn't<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.849> see<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> dimness

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
3d glasses why didn't I see the dimness

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.510 
3d glasses why didn't I see the dimness
here<00:02:09.660> why<00:02:09.810> did<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.050> look<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:11.009> clear<00:02:11.280> as

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
the brightness of the LED technology as

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.229 
the brightness of the LED technology as
well<00:02:23.590> as<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.129> darkness<00:02:24.549> gives<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.879> that<00:02:25.060> that
