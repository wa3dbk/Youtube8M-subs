00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
because I'm using a 64-bit operating

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
because I'm using a 64-bit operating
system<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.910> need<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.270> is

file to download now the reason I'm
using<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.159> version<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.990> web

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
using this version is because the web

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.640 
using this version is because the web
installer<00:01:22.530> version<00:01:22.909> doesn't<00:01:23.909> work<00:01:24.090> with

64-bit operating systems very well it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.819 
64-bit operating systems very well it
will<00:01:27.479> basically<00:01:27.630> tell<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.409> same<00:01:28.619> error

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
will basically tell you the same error

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.410

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
message we got before which is we can't

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090 
message we got before which is we can't
install<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.900> because<00:01:31.020> there's<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.890> newer

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
install it because there's a newer

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.130 
install it because there's a newer

version of DirectX installed this is a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.569 
version of DirectX installed this is a
way<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.470> getting<00:01:34.770> around<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.340> the

redistributable package will allow you
to<00:01:37.560> install<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.759> run<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.000> now<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
to install it so if we run this now and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.840 
to install it so if we run this now and
run<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:42.020> yes<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:44.340> we're<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.670> give<00:01:44.820> you
