00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.129
 hello you out there I can do that 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.060
 and today's video is about one 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.980
 further price 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.540
 I also wanted to be right again 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.310
 I thank you very much 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.150
 I really love that you guys 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.460
 so interested today should be all around 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.460
 Turn this good piece that is 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.640
 the cut patrice freimann find something 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.280
 We think I want you today 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.110
 just a little bit we imagine 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.420
 already can see it is one of the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.900
 Primer who come in a cup 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:53.350
 that here is made of plastic and 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:57.790
 here are moment it is 14 grams 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:02.820
 are in here and you get in 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:06.460
 every dm and in just miller for 495 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.720
 Look that's what it is 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.729
 as well a light pink consistency 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.860
 but do not let it go 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.460
 that's what scares you on the skin 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.380
 really transparent as opposed to 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.549
 I join you in the club of l'oreal 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:31.570
 has presented the relatively fluid 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:34.690
 and fluffy and pretty easy of 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.420
 of consistency and it settles 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.420
 really very well distributed 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.350
 You can really do that very well 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:54.299
 work the primer is on everyone 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:59.830
 case very productive and has a similar one 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:07.270
 Consistency so the timer of l'oréal 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:09.470
 is a lot more solid and musician and im 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.530
 year as I said there is 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.720
 already pretty easy he is on everyone 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.630
 case one of the primer of also for 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.860
 dry skin is suitable because it 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.780
 just really velvety soft skin 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.870
 So filtering is just like the one from 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.870
 real he is really really dry 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.100
 skin suitable as well as me already 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.310
 I think in another video 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.190
 said in contrast to that of 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.870
 I would benefit for being dry 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.710
 I like this one for dry skin sooner 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.690
 recommend 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.160
 and I also think that's a lot 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.990
 good alternative to that of l'oréal 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.820
 they do not test on animals either 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.260
 patrice as far as I know 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.510
 and I just think so yes 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.670
 a really big plus point of that 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.650
 Product once again we come too 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.590
 a minus of the product and 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.920
 Although I really do not find the smell 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.120
 so enjoyable it is hard to 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.459
 explain you can always in the shop 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.070
 those still really year old and those on 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.750
 test a consistency here 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.940
 So there is always one 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.560
 tester and I would be the one in front of me 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.050
 lie because he very 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.570
 So the right one 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.330
 Bit bitter and yes I do not know 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.800
 Of course it is also disadvantageous that 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.980
 the ingredients are not 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.540
 but you can stop 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.360
 really assume that it is the 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.769
 purest silicone bomb is but I have 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.790
 now no skin changes with me 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:48.030
 thus discovered that in spite of the newly 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.620
 I have pretty moisturizing 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.690
 now part of it skin and mature 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.610
 although I already have it 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.130
 so if I have the wrong fight 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.140
 I'll use this product 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.019
 such an outbreak but I have 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.610
 now really did not notice what 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.530
 I have not mentioned in the series yet 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.720
 that is me in the particular video 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.790
 whatever the product carries with it 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.519
 also in combination with make-up 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.000
 I can see that the primer 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.200
 by patrice really great 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.730
 compatible with the foundations of 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.400
 patrice is so talk to the 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:26.620
 photofinish foundation and the infinite 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.680
 and yes I think that too 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.790
 Make up has been holding longer so it flows 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.410
 It's not that fast either 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.490
 because of course I also have a before 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.490
 picture for you later 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.030
 I really can give you this good piece 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.639
 recommend for just under five euros 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.350
 is it really a great find 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.050
 product and it keeps its promise 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:59.750
 So it really makes lines and pores 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.440
 lighter and yes I can tell you absolutely 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.630
 recommend 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.660
 especially on this topic what is now 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.220
 But already in total to the series 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.570
 not yet so i still have 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.700
 some products like me you like 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.730
 So I would like to introduce you further 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.500
 what I can still be to you 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.450
 if you have organic wishes for me or 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.490
 Of course, I am glad to receive suggestions 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.980
 great if you like that in me 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.890
 I leave comments trying 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.010
 then possibly at your request 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.230
 enter into 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.230
 So it'll be good until then
