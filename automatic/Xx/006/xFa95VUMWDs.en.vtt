00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.990
 the vampire squid of hell as 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.800
 stool to survive the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.780
 depths 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.450
 although most vampires 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.050
 they prefer their live prey the squids 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.790
 vampires are far less demanding and 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.700
 they chew any dead plankton 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.340
 remains of crustaceans and fecal material 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.710
 that are in its way 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.070
 they are cephalopods but not only to hunt

 tease literally the vampire squid 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.480
 of hell has a couple of filaments 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.510
 thin retract and are used as a 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.810
 fishing line leaving it adrift and 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.000
 so you can collect pieces of waste 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.819
 clean the filaments through their 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.310
 arms the squid combines the waste 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.240
 with a mucus secreted by their suckers 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.170
 to form balls of food that is swallowed 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.490
 this diet unique among the cephalopods 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.980
 allows the squid to live in environments 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.980

 the food fields of squid are 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.730
 has done for 20 years through 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.820
 the observations captured in waters 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.090

 Squid and octopus use their arms 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.010
 strong to capture their prey but 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.740
 the passive approach of the vampire squid 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.110
 to find food means no

 have to spend energy chasing 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.570
 live animals this allows you to live 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.090
 in areas with little oxygen where the water 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.640
 does not circulate much and most of the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.940
