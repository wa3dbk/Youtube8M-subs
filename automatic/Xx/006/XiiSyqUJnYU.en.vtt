00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
to move them you just grab a hammer I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.120 
to move them you just grab a hammer I
like<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.400> use<00:01:14.549> brass<00:01:14.909> hammers<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.130> neoprene

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
like to use brass hammers or a neoprene

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.219 
like to use brass hammers or a neoprene
hammer<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.700> way<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.909> don't<00:01:18.229> score

everything

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:47.320 

so<00:01:32.450> 34:34<00:01:34.010> still<00:01:35.010> too<00:01:35.340> much<00:01:35.490> play<00:01:38.990> 35<00:01:44.180> five<00:01:45.180> I

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
so 34:34 still too much play 35 five I

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.070 
so 34:34 still too much play 35 five I
think<00:01:48.330> they're<00:01:48.420> supposed<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.960> an

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
think they're supposed to be like an

00:01:49.080 --> 00:02:02.540 
think they're supposed to be like an
inch<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.440> play<00:01:55.850> 36<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:01.500> might<00:02:01.980> get<00:02:02.160> one<00:02:02.310> more

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
inch of play 36 you might get one more

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:20.180 
inch of play 36 you might get one more
here<00:02:17.240> okay<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.300> think<00:02:18.390> that's<00:02:18.890> that's<00:02:19.890> probably

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
here okay I think that's that's probably

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.240 
here okay I think that's that's probably
about<00:02:20.310> good<00:02:20.700> here<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.440> just<00:02:22.740> tighten<00:02:23.010> it

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250
