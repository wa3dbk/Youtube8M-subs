we
only<00:02:16.109> do<00:02:16.230> one<00:02:16.439> on<00:02:16.560> once<00:02:16.769> maybe<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.489> two-on-one

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
I'm just thinking if we try the two on

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.349 
I'm just thinking if we try the two on
what<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.189> mune<00:02:20.400> Aaron<00:02:20.790> wouldn't<00:02:21.120> do<00:02:21.329> very

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
what the mune Aaron wouldn't do very

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.050 
what the mune Aaron wouldn't do very
good<00:02:21.980> um<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.310> we<00:02:23.370> could<00:02:23.519> try<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.790> let's<00:02:24.000> just

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
good um but we could try it let's just

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.479 
good um but we could try it let's just
see<00:02:24.269> what<00:02:24.390> happens<00:02:24.450> actually<00:02:25.310> alright<00:02:26.310> guys<00:02:26.459> I

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
see what happens actually alright guys I

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.009 
see what happens actually alright guys I
figured<00:02:26.849> we'd<00:02:26.969> give<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.209> one<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.450> shot

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
figured we'd give this one a shot

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.780 
figured we'd give this one a shot
two-on-one<00:02:28.500> against<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.189> mutant<00:02:29.400> Enderman

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
candy take him out I mean if you think

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.410 
candy take him out I mean if you think
about<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.549> he<00:02:32.609> actually<00:02:32.849> has<00:02:32.939> more<00:02:33.150> help<00:02:33.329> than

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
about it he actually has more help than

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.449 
about it he actually has more help than
both<00:02:33.599> of<00:02:33.629> them<00:02:33.780> combined<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:35.069> we<00:02:35.189> will<00:02:35.280> try

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
both of them combined so we will try

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.910 
both of them combined so we will try
this<00:02:35.700> he<00:02:35.909> should<00:02:36.269> be<00:02:36.810> able<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.139> agro<00:02:37.590> both

with this final attack here and it
possibly<00:03:13.290> me<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:14.150> love<00:03:15.150> how<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.389> throws<00:03:15.659> me

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
possibly me I love how it throws me

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.839 
possibly me I love how it throws me
around<00:03:15.900> as<00:03:16.200> well

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
around as well

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.220 
around as well
but<00:03:17.849> yeah<00:03:17.939> I<00:03:17.969> got<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.180> other<00:03:18.269> dude<00:03:18.510> down<00:03:18.659> to<00:03:18.870> 50

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
but yeah I got the other dude down to 50

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.020 
but yeah I got the other dude down to 50
couldn't<00:03:19.709> quite<00:03:20.010> do<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:20.669> know<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.879> might

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
couldn't quite do it you know it might

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.000 
couldn't quite do it you know it might
be<00:03:21.060> closer<00:03:21.449> we<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:21.989> try<00:03:22.290> like<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.709> ender

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
be closer we can try like the ender

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.030 
be closer we can try like the ender
Guardian<00:03:23.459> with<00:03:23.639> like<00:03:23.790> strength<00:03:24.329> 1<00:03:24.690> on<00:03:25.040> against

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
Guardian with like strength 1 on against

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.990 
Guardian with like strength 1 on against
immune<00:03:26.129> Enderman<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.579> think<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.879> would<00:03:26.970> be

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
immune Enderman I think that would be

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.830 
immune Enderman I think that would be
like<00:03:27.180> super<00:03:27.540> close

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
like super close

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.289 
like super close
I<00:03:28.220> think<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.310> ender<00:03:29.519> Guardian<00:03:29.909> just<00:03:30.060> needs<00:03:30.239> a

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
I think the ender Guardian just needs a

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.670 
I think the ender Guardian just needs a
little<00:03:30.419> bit<00:03:30.599> more<00:03:30.780> power<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.349> we<00:03:31.470> are<00:03:31.590> gonna

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
little bit more power so we are gonna

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.860 
little bit more power so we are gonna
toss<00:03:31.919> strength<00:03:32.400> on<00:03:32.639> him<00:03:32.879> and<00:03:33.090> now<00:03:33.629> he's

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
toss strength on him and now he's

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.539 
toss strength on him and now he's
stronger<00:03:34.199> than<00:03:34.290> ever<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.889> think<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.310> could<00:03:35.430> do

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
stronger than ever I think you could do

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.520 
stronger than ever I think you could do
it<00:03:35.639> bro<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:35.849> gotta<00:03:36.030> take<00:03:36.239> him<00:03:36.329> down<00:03:36.389> quick<00:03:36.810> why

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.349 
because I still think it's gonna be
close<00:04:19.650> here<00:04:19.859> he<00:04:20.340> might<00:04:20.459> die<00:04:20.669> in<00:04:20.729> this<00:04:20.909> guy's<00:04:21.150> oh

can't make the ender Guardian attack
first<00:06:34.259> for<00:06:34.560> some<00:06:34.710> reason<00:06:35.099> it<00:06:35.190> just<00:06:35.219> has<00:06:35.460> to<00:06:35.550> do

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
first for some reason it just has to do

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.399 
first for some reason it just has to do
with<00:06:35.699> his<00:06:35.819> AI<00:06:36.029> so<00:06:36.599> I<00:06:36.629> have<00:06:36.779> to<00:06:36.900> make<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.139> mutant

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
with his AI so I have to make the mutant

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.399 
with his AI so I have to make the mutant
enemy<00:06:37.649> go<00:06:37.770> after<00:06:38.009> him<00:06:38.300> he's<00:06:39.300> at<00:06:39.419> 14<00:06:39.810> oh<00:06:39.899> he's

that he toss it right in his foot but

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.500 
that he toss it right in his foot but
sadly<00:07:36.960> he's<00:07:37.620> dead<00:07:37.950> but<00:07:38.550> you<00:07:38.670> know<00:07:38.790> at<00:07:39.000> least<00:07:39.060> he

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.620 
doesn't have the block still at his hand
and<00:07:41.730> I<00:07:41.850> think<00:07:41.940> he's<00:07:42.090> gonna<00:07:42.180> kill<00:07:42.360> the<00:07:42.480> Ender

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:42.630 
and I think he's gonna kill the Ender

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.770 
and I think he's gonna kill the Ender
Guardian<00:07:42.960> -<00:07:43.110> one<00:07:43.980> of<00:07:44.010> them's<00:07:44.190> down<00:07:44.510> this<00:07:45.510> ender

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:45.780 
Guardian - one of them's down this ender

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.060 
Guardian - one of them's down this ender
Guardians<00:07:46.080> going<00:07:46.290> down<00:07:46.470> as<00:07:46.590> well

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.070 
Guardians going down as well

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.650 
Guardians going down as well
I<00:07:47.100> think<00:07:47.820> the<00:07:47.880> mutant<00:07:48.060> Enderman<00:07:48.330> are<00:07:48.420> actually

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 
I think the mutant Enderman are actually

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.770
