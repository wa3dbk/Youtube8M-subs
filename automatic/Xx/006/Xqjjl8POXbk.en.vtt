00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello dear friends with you your 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.109
 link and I continue to shoot all the bugs in 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.590
 minecraft today with me angry zubastik 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.099
 lech say hello to everyone hi hi 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.379
 hello project gave them greetings 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.080
 enough today we will show you one 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.850
 very very cool and interesting bug 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.930
 let's not pull the cat for pips 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.060
 they will continue to shoot our series in order 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.429
 to work this bug we need 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.099
 comparator and as you might guess we 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.170
 let's duplicate this comparator recipe for 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.620
 hearing about how we led in principle let's 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.750
 watch the tank now we will see this 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.820
 Bug Critters by Nibbler 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.820
 please put the comparator put 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.230
 red torch two pieces of redstone here 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.500
 so here's another piece 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:01:01.469
 yes and juicy try to break in the block with us 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:04.700
 under the comparator to usually 2 but here 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.110
 somehow too much 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.299
 so we want a second take 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.330
 ease 5 comparator usually fall out 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.100
 two comparators put steel torch and two 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.549
 a piece of redstone one more piece and 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.700
 destroying the unit under the comparator I'm in shock 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.700
 simply 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.509
 this is a hard bottom for you 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.460
 I'll show you this tank from 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.979
 of your face 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.799
 and so that this bug does not need to work 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.350
 again put a comparator 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.479
 put a red torch and 3 pieces 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.030
 arrested here and so we need 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.650
 server version and destroyable to us 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.640
 two comparators fall in some 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.619
 cases falls out more drops out as you 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.960
 probably saw 15 comparators for 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.460
 time and we already got it depends on 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.140
 of the world let's even try with 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.600
 check you I do not know maybe we 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.520
 it may not work out well 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.680
 actually was not and set 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.390
 something like this is our comparator 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.549
 try to destroy the bottom nifiga not 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.399
 it turned out now let's try with 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.310
 this side so zubastik we there 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.899
 helps and what you do and why with this 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.580
 sides we destroy and what we see we 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.530
 see what again two pieces fell out 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.780
 Well, in general it is very strange 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.819
 everything happens and you need to look and what 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.400
 it all depends in general everything is yours 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.069
 server version we can 175 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.450
 checking alone doesn't work well and in 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.440
 principle on this this finished help 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.020

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.390
