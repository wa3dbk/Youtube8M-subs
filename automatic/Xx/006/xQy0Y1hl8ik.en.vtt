millimeter bolt you put the little
remote<00:02:11.900> receiver<00:02:12.080> on<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.620> bracket<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.130> bolt

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
remote receiver on the bracket you bolt

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.910 
remote receiver on the bracket you bolt
it<00:02:13.459> on<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:14.450> connect<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.370> green<00:02:17.920> electrical

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
it on you connect the green electrical

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.229 
it on you connect the green electrical
connector<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:20.319> then<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.560> well<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.700> program

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
connector and then you well you program

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.630 
connector and then you well you program
the<00:02:23.360> remote
