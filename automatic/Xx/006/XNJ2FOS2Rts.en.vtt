00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
too is that on the venom one these links

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.140 
too is that on the venom one these links
in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.630> bracelet<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:22.320> one<00:01:23.250> piece<00:01:23.520> where<00:01:23.939> is

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
in the bracelet are one piece where is

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.399 
in the bracelet are one piece where is
it<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> could<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.200> wrong<00:01:25.350> maybe

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it I don't know I could be wrong maybe

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.560 
it I don't know I could be wrong maybe
they<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.490> know<00:01:26.580> change<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.030> halfway<00:01:27.210> through

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
they you know change it halfway through

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.020 
they you know change it halfway through
the<00:01:27.689> venom<00:01:27.900> ones<00:01:28.110> also<00:01:28.490> on<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> venom<00:01:29.820> one

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the venom ones also on the venom one

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.149 
the venom ones also on the venom one
these<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:30.900> actually<00:01:31.170> two<00:01:31.350> pieces<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.009> when

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
these are actually two pieces so when

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.160 
these are actually two pieces so when
you<00:01:32.250> size<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.210> take<00:01:33.420> off<00:01:33.659> this

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
you size this you have to take off this

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.719 
you size this you have to take off this
piece<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.920> piece<00:01:35.009> there's<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.520> pin

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
piece and this piece there's a pin

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.060 
piece and this piece there's a pin
holding<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.150> piece<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.780> piece<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.290> then

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
holding this piece this piece and then

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.830 
holding this piece this piece and then
the<00:01:38.280> other<00:01:38.400> difference<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.180> course<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the other difference here of course is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.160 
the other difference here of course is
the<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:41.759> lugs<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> lugs<00:01:42.960> are

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
the the lugs you can see the lugs are

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.929 
the the lugs you can see the lugs are
slightly<00:01:43.409> or<00:01:43.979> I'll<00:01:44.399> show<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> side-by-side

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
slightly or I'll show you a side-by-side

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.539 
slightly or I'll show you a side-by-side
comparison<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:46.259> lugs<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:46.770> redesigned<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
comparison the lugs they redesigned and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.660 
comparison the lugs they redesigned and
then<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> bezel<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.460> unbelievable<00:01:50.460> I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
then the bezel is just unbelievable I

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.420 
then the bezel is just unbelievable I
mean<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:52.140> chiseled<00:01:52.590> intricate

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
mean really really chiseled intricate

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
mean really really chiseled intricate
