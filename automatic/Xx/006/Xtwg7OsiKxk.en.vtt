00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.059
 this time it was not necessary to take a 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.709
 flight to enjoy the best kebab 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.150
 barcelona actually that goes can 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.309
 refer to many different dishes 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.380
 so that we understand what I 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.449
 he looked for are the sheets of meat of 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.520
 chicken or veal lamb that are made in 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.890
 a vertical rotisserie for the 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.539
 turks shawarma for the Syrians you can 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.520
 serve with pita bread or with a bread 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.350
 flat rolled what's called durum 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.480
 as always my criteria to start 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.730
 it was the kitchen schedule but also the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.949
 bismillah that goes to vis' has been one of 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.780
 the most recommended its peculiarity is 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.730
 that they do everything including bread 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.589
 they take their time on the iron and in 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.899
 This time I ordered it on a plate and meat 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.780
 was accompanied with a usual lettuce 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.120
 onion tomato and cucumber cabbage the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.370
 cuts of meat are long and very thin 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.079
 tasty they cover it with yogurt sauce and 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.510
 then you can add hot sauce 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.999
 taste do not serve alcoholic beverages and the 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.829
 shawarma with pita bread is 350 euros 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.479
 I ordered it on a plate because it was the 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.610
 first and I wanted to see the 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.440
 ingredients clearly then lower to 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.630
 the raval of the raval and I entered the cca 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.399
 paddock and a pretty Turkish restaurant 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.320
 spacious your pita bread is pretty 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.540
 far from the bismillah meat 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.070
 less toast and single is not very tasty 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.810
 but there are sauces for 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.870
 accompany her in this yes they serve 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.460
 alcohol and the kebab is 350 coming 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.040
 to be the usual price right opposite 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.869
 is killing also Turkish as you see 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.700
 the decoration is something more modern although 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.680
 the model is also fast food the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.360
 covered for example are plastic the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.400
 meat is cut very thin and is something 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.590
 tastier the very rich spicy sauce 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.940
 they serve alcohol and the price of kebab is 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.940
 also 350 euros 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.300
 play and you started being a little 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.950
 local in a corner of hebron iker 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.660
 come from the flowers and today is a 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.760
 chain of seven stores but has not 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.010
 lost its essence your kitchen is pretty 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.690
 different not only because it's Syrian but 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.030
 also because it has a certain personality 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.920
 if one looks for restaurant service is 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.110
 of the best the lid of shawarma or 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.180
 Gary is the most comparable to the rest of the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.440
 pieces of meat are thick and small and 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.840
 they are covered by onion and tomato 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.210
 grilled is somewhat drier 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.250
 but with the sauce earns a lot they serve 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.250
 alcohol and the tapita is at 435 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.290
 after a little respite I approached 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.150
 I like shawarma according to what the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.709
 owner of the caravan the local 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.900
 in front of a historic city 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.610
 shows work there for ten years and 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.709
 he learned everything from him so the 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.989
 recipes are very similar as you see the 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.640
 local is spacious with lots of modern light 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.989
 within what fits the bread is not 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.790
 opened in the middle but it has 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.859
 made a small cut to put the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.230
 filling if you ask for it with nothing is the 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.909
 350 standard price and you can add it 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.099
 different ingredients I ordered it with 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.079
 hummus was very tasty hot sauce 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.299
 It is strong and tasty and the ingredients 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:18.340
 additions are priced at 20 cents 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.340
 so I got it for 370 euros 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.880
 as I told you the caravan is a local 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.470
 Historical is very well known at night 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.360
 of grace the truth is that I did not know 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.980
 that the kebab was such a dish at night 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.080
 most places like the caravan 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.730
 they have late night schedules as you see 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.800
 It's a dark place with music very 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.630
 high and the owner told me that what 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.700
 they do everything to buy the meat the short 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.830
 the dogan and the mount to roast the 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.690
 Sauces are very rich they serve alcohol and 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.690
 the shawarma is 350 euros 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.300
 then I got off to the street escudellers 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.340
 where is the good snack that according to 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.730
 they are the first local with rotisserie 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.830
 vertical of the city are since 1982 and 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.140
 this time they put it to me with cuca 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.090
 that is bread and pine cake for 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.010
 roll the meat and the accompaniment me 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.380
 liked its intense flavor and its originality 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.120
 They got it spicy without asking for it which 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.620
 It is a seal of authenticity and as 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.420
 curiosity I had been recommended a 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.340
 local that was right next to him 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.530
 carpanta that no longer exists but in something 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.570
 invoked was his cook the price is 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.250
 of 390 in someone say he does in 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.900
 Kurdish cuisine you can order in bar 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.790
 in front of the kitchen but they have a 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.830
 dining room with two floors and also a living room 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.330
 of tea I ordered a durum that is to say in the 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.010
 ingredients rolled in the cake 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.570
 fine bread and in this place once 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.370
 rolled up they wrap it with paper 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.990
 aluminum and they cost it with the toaster 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.940
 so they get it very 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.040
 Crunchy they do not serve cut in half 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.270
 As you can see, you can ask for alcohol and 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.270
 price is 450 euros 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.710
 and finally I approached the cook of 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.690
 damask depends on what time you go 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.120
 you find long queues but 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.010
 I was prontito to be more comfortable your 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.540
 cook is a man is wise and his 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.880
 grandfather was already preparing shawarmas in 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.980
 damask is precisely wound on 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.200
 whole is delicious the bread is good 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.300
 toasted with which is crispy and the 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.430
 combination is very balanced either 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.550
 They serve alcohol and its price is 450 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.550
 euros 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.210
 and here is the ranking that for the first 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.130
 time it includes a tie between the musical 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.880
 shawarma and the caravan and the week that 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.020
 comes to mÃ¡laga 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.020
 I hope suggestions
