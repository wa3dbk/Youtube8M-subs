00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.789
 johann taddigs there are more 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.349
 video about call of duty black ops 3m am 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.790
 Although today a new equipment in 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.320
 black ops three it is not complete 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.670
 There were already new things in Winterthur 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.840
 I guess most of you on 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.390
 ball not played I have it too 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.620
 not played but these crib it 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.630
 I think it's really interesting 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.550
 and that my decision would be to my 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.050
 to make video and this new 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.329
 Equipment of the Molotov cocktail 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.040
 or the brand grenade the 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.150
 Information about this comes from tomato 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.740
 that is also a youtuber I link 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.210
 description but I guess the 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.250
 So most of them know that 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.410
 Most of you already know him, he has 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.940
 the game already played therefore could 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.960
 the quasi to give information and 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.489
 I found it interesting then 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.500
 I have also decided me 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.820
 Making video games would be the whole thing 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.860
 So not yet knows a molotov 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.000
 cocktail is already relatively well known me 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.110
 say that I have the most 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.700
 know it from somewhere it is indeed 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.950
 often that somehow a movie somewhere 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.360
 is shown but I'll show it to you 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.610
 my background csu is namely 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.200
 already is a bottle like that 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.909
 then filled with an oil or something 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.720
 and then that's one piece of fabric 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.700
 is lit. 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.960
 and if you then the bottle, so to speak 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.270
 throws the natural breaks and that 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.460
 Whole oil is then becomes free and can 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.500
 so to speak, and then 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.630
 the quasi arises as we are 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.970
 small fire its burned area and at 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.159
 it's pretty much the place of the fire as well 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.390
 otherwise just a bit more developed yes 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.159
 And he makes this brand surface natural 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.150
 somehow harm to those for the opponent 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.770
 So it always somehow pulls something 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.299
 live off and if the opponent then too 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.310
 long inside this brand grenade stands in it 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.729
 you can almost kill the enemy with it 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.560
 So now almost quasi live grenade 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.210
 the whole one just natural 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.860
 even more tactical so in cisco 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.619
 It is often used in that way 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.180
 any points anyway 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.770
 where you do not have the extra check 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.750
 because it might be risky or 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.400
 awkward is that you just then 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.780
 a molotow and then if 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.820
 any enemy in it he has to get out 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.960
 or if you want to 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.950
 example, the opponents want to wash that 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.799
 Just spend a month on it 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.329
 accuse me of getting better 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.950
 could prepare for the opponents or 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.020
 still can call reinforcement before we 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.740
 So that just delays to the coup 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.720
 from the opponents 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.040
 yes you can definitely in 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.080
 call of duty so use I guess 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.550
 this is less tactical because it is used 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.890
 as a cisco maybe in search 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.150
 storms a bit but in a team 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.440
 deathmatch or so I guess that 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.820
 is just thrown somewhere 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.490
 would then be hoped that there either 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.440
 opponents running pure or so I do not know 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.970
 if it's really useful like that to try 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.250
 had or so or if it stops more like that 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.990
 a bit of fun to use 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.350
 quite so when you put such a fire 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.980
 can 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.090
 but maybe it's a c4 or whole 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.070
 normal grenade maybe something 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.660
 useful but we will see that 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.070
 yes I'm pretty cool in any case 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.450
 that we get a black ops 3 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.860
 I had gotten too 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.560
 honestly thought about it before 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.730
 that is actually there are the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.260
 already known I had considered 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.390
 it is funny that they are not in 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.650
 call of duty is like me now 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.940
 driver was already the forest edward 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.200
 that has never played like I said but that 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.420
 is just in the newer call of duty 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.650
 Share why was available 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.420
 and then we actually have it now 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.010
 so i think i really is 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.300
 a pretty interesting garnet with 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.630
 you definitely have a lot of fun 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.430
 can 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.140
 In any case, that would be very much yours 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.160
 interested so that 's it now 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.020
 with the video if you like me 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.680
 myself still friends what today 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.680
 haut rein people
