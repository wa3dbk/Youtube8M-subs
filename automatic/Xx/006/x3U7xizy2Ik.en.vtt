create a path that he will automatically

follow and precise speeds however the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.810 
follow and precise speeds however the
mod<00:00:40.950> has<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.879> big<00:00:42.420> floor<00:00:43.100> it's<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.340> mod<00:00:44.550> and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
mod has one big floor it's a mod and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.420 
mod has one big floor it's a mod and
though<00:00:45.510> mods<00:00:45.899> are<00:00:46.230> great<00:00:46.530> they<00:00:47.039> require<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
though mods are great they require a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.400 
though mods are great they require a
significant<00:00:48.120> amount<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.570> knowledge<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.170> set

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
significant amount of knowledge to set

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.920 
significant amount of knowledge to set
up<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.920> require<00:00:50.489> updating<00:00:51.239> before<00:00:51.660> they<00:00:51.750> can

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
up and require updating before they can

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.910 
up and require updating before they can
be<00:00:52.020> used<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.500> later<00:00:52.829> versions<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.090> game<00:00:54.920> so

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
be used in later versions of the game so

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.990 
be used in later versions of the game so
I<00:00:56.250> did<00:00:57.210> some<00:00:57.480> thinking<00:00:58.370> what<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.789> could

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
I did some thinking what if you could

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.810 
I did some thinking what if you could
have<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.510> single<00:01:01.079> command<00:01:01.500> which<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.579> copy

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
have a single command which you can copy

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.270 
have a single command which you can copy
and<00:01:02.969> paste<00:01:03.090> into<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.780> command<00:01:04.290> block<00:01:04.409> which<00:01:05.040> in

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and paste into a command block which in

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.520 
and paste into a command block which in
turn<00:01:05.820> creates<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.659> command<00:01:07.080> block<00:01:07.170> system

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
turn creates a command block system

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.859 
turn creates a command block system
which<00:01:08.250> would<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> reasonable<00:01:08.880> replacement

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
which would be a reasonable replacement

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.500 
which would be a reasonable replacement
for<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.229> cameras<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:11.189> mod<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
for the cameras to do mod if it's a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
for the cameras to do mod if it's a
command<00:01:12.930> block<00:01:13.049> system<00:01:13.530> you'd<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.549> able<00:01:14.760> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
command block system you'd be able to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.749 
command block system you'd be able to
use<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.600> any<00:01:16.080> version<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.130> game<00:01:17.340> from

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
use it in any version of the game from

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.410 
use it in any version of the game from
version<00:01:18.150> 1.8<00:01:18.840> onwards<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.240> therefore<00:01:21.240> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
version 1.8 onwards and therefore you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.510 
version 1.8 onwards and therefore you
would<00:01:21.570> never<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.290> worry<00:01:22.560> about<00:01:22.860> updating

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
would never have to worry about updating

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.120 
would never have to worry about updating
the<00:01:23.820> mod<00:01:24.030> again<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> fact<00:01:25.619> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the mod again that and the fact that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.179 
the mod again that and the fact that
it'd<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.150> easy<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.869> set<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.140> mix<00:01:28.920> this

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
it'd be so easy to set up mix this

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.240 
it'd be so easy to set up mix this
system<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.030> my<00:01:30.479> opinion<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.170> worthy<00:01:31.890> opponent

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
system in my opinion a worthy opponent

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.460 
system in my opinion a worthy opponent
for<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> cameras<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.869> mod<00:01:34.170> whoa

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470

fast the footage will look jittery so
more<00:03:22.330> than<00:03:22.720> not<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.709> player<00:03:24.010> will<00:03:24.250> have<00:03:24.489> to

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
more than not the player will have to

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.330 
more than not the player will have to
speed<00:03:25.120> up<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.450> footage<00:03:26.230> in<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:27.040> video

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340

editing stage of course this is fine for
most<00:03:30.790> time<00:03:31.180> lapses<00:03:31.600> but<00:03:32.140> it<00:03:32.290> wouldn't<00:03:32.560> be<00:03:32.709> so

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
most time lapses but it wouldn't be so

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.850 
most time lapses but it wouldn't be so
great<00:03:33.280> for<00:03:33.310> redstone<00:03:34.030> showcases<00:03:34.840> as<00:03:35.019> then<00:03:35.650> the

great for redstone showcases as then the

velocities what is riding velocities
riding<00:03:51.700> velocities<00:03:52.390> was<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.750> idea<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.470> one

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
riding velocities was the idea that one

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.670 
riding velocities was the idea that one
could<00:03:54.160> sit<00:03:54.520> on<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:55.150> horse<00:03:55.570> for<00:03:56.020> example<00:03:56.530> and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
could sit on a horse for example and

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.220 
could sit on a horse for example and
then<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.400> horse<00:03:57.700> could<00:03:58.060> be<00:03:58.210> given<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.690> velocity

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
then the horse could be given a velocity

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.400 
then the horse could be given a velocity
with<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.070> entity<00:04:00.490> data<00:04:00.700> command<00:04:01.300> this<00:04:02.170> would

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
with the entity data command this would

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.220 
with the entity data command this would
get<00:04:02.620> rid<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.460> jittery<00:04:03.970> problem<00:04:04.720> with

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
get rid of the jittery problem with

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.860 
get rid of the jittery problem with
sequential<00:04:05.700> teleportation<00:04:06.700> however<00:04:07.540> this

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
sequential teleportation however this

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.090 
sequential teleportation however this
brings<00:04:08.320> a<00:04:08.740> whole<00:04:08.770> host<00:04:09.460> of<00:04:09.730> new<00:04:10.300> problems<00:04:11.100> the

brings a whole host of new problems the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.950 
brings a whole host of new problems the

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
main problem with this movement system

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.600 
main problem with this movement system
is<00:04:14.140> that<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.410> player<00:04:14.680> is<00:04:14.920> in<00:04:15.070> complete

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
is that the player is in complete

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.539 
is that the player is in complete
control<00:04:15.940> of<00:04:16.540> where<00:04:17.170> the<00:04:17.320> camera<00:04:17.709> looks<00:04:18.010> which

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
control of where the camera looks which

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.370 
control of where the camera looks which
of<00:04:18.700> course<00:04:18.730> would<00:04:19.390> mean<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.840> player<00:04:20.110> would

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
of course would mean the player would

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.490 
of course would mean the player would
have<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.650> undergo<00:04:21.100> more<00:04:21.790> work<00:04:22.150> than<00:04:22.780> he<00:04:23.020> did<00:04:23.260> in

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
have to undergo more work than he did in

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.670 
have to undergo more work than he did in
the<00:04:23.920> sequential<00:04:24.390> teleportation<00:04:25.390> method<00:04:25.780> what

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
the sequential teleportation method what

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.400 
the sequential teleportation method what
is<00:04:26.830> worse<00:04:27.190> is<00:04:27.640> that<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.240> cannot<00:04:28.690> force<00:04:29.170> the

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
is worse is that you cannot force the

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.750 
is worse is that you cannot force the
player<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.860> look<00:04:30.010> in<00:04:30.190> any<00:04:30.460> particular

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
player to look in any particular

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.480 
player to look in any particular
direction<00:04:31.240> with<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.260> teleport<00:04:32.770> commands<00:04:33.310> if

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
direction with the teleport commands if

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.600 
direction with the teleport commands if
you<00:04:34.300> try<00:04:34.750> you'll<00:04:35.320> just<00:04:35.590> force<00:04:35.920> the<00:04:36.100> player<00:04:36.340> to

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
you try you'll just force the player to

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.600 
you try you'll just force the player to
get<00:04:36.760> off<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.660> horse<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:39.280> at<00:04:39.400> this<00:04:39.550> stage

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
get off the horse so at this stage

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.090 
get off the horse so at this stage
riding<00:04:40.540> velocities<00:04:41.110> doesn't<00:04:41.530> look<00:04:41.770> any

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
riding velocities doesn't look any

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.940 
riding velocities doesn't look any
better<00:04:42.520> than<00:04:42.940> sequential<00:04:43.540> teleportation<00:04:44.320> so

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
better than sequential teleportation so

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.000 
better than sequential teleportation so
let's<00:04:45.190> look<00:04:45.460> at<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:46.000> final<00:04:46.600> option<00:04:47.010> option

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
let's look at the final option option

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.330 
let's look at the final option option
number<00:04:48.550> three<00:04:49.500> occupied<00:04:50.500> spectator

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
number three occupied spectator

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.750 
number three occupied spectator
velocities<00:04:52.350> this<00:04:53.350> idea<00:04:53.770> hit<00:04:54.070> me<00:04:54.280> when<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.550> was

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
velocities this idea hit me when I was

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.940 
velocities this idea hit me when I was
messing<00:04:55.030> around<00:04:55.240> with<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.840> hilarious<00:04:56.590> mob

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
messing around with the hilarious mob

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.460 
messing around with the hilarious mob
rotations<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:58.090> I<00:04:58.360> just<00:04:58.660> so<00:04:58.810> happened<00:04:59.260> to<00:04:59.350> be

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
rotations and I just so happened to be

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.890 
rotations and I just so happened to be
in<00:04:59.590> spectator<00:05:00.250> mode<00:05:00.580> when<00:05:00.880> I<00:05:00.910> clicked<00:05:01.330> on<00:05:01.570> the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
in spectator mode when I clicked on the

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.460 
in spectator mode when I clicked on the
villager<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.620> suddenly<00:05:03.610> noticed<00:05:04.090> that<00:05:05.050> my

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
villager I suddenly noticed that my

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.780 
villager I suddenly noticed that my
camera<00:05:06.130> was<00:05:06.610> upside<00:05:07.360> down<00:05:07.390> and<00:05:08.050> I<00:05:08.590> was<00:05:08.790> inside

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
camera was upside down and I was inside

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.930 
camera was upside down and I was inside
an<00:05:10.300> entity<00:05:11.050> that<00:05:11.650> could<00:05:11.919> be<00:05:12.040> moved<00:05:12.340> with

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
an entity that could be moved with

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.980 
an entity that could be moved with
velocities<00:05:14.490> so<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.610> final<00:05:15.880> option<00:05:16.330> is<00:05:16.750> that

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
velocities so the final option is that

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.530 
velocities so the final option is that
the<00:05:17.110> cameras<00:05:17.470> to<00:05:17.830> do<00:05:18.040> first<00:05:18.520> sets<00:05:18.970> the<00:05:19.240> player

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
the cameras to do first sets the player

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.409 
the cameras to do first sets the player
to<00:05:19.840> spectator<00:05:20.350> mode<00:05:20.620> then<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.700> player<00:05:21.970> clicks

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
to spectator mode then the player clicks

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.659 
to spectator mode then the player clicks
on<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.840> entity<00:05:23.200> which<00:05:23.650> will<00:05:23.860> call<00:05:24.190> from<00:05:24.460> now

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
on the host the host will then be moved

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.900 
on the host the host will then be moved
around<00:05:28.840> with<00:05:29.200> velocities<00:05:29.830> given<00:05:30.700> with<00:05:30.880> the

host looks the player will also look

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.390 
host looks the player will also look
during<00:05:37.480> the<00:05:37.630> simulation<00:05:38.410> the<00:05:38.830> player<00:05:39.070> won't

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
during the simulation the player won't

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.850 
during the simulation the player won't
have<00:05:39.610> any<00:05:39.910> control<00:05:40.330> other<00:05:40.930> than<00:05:41.169> being<00:05:41.440> able

to leave the host and upon leaving the
host<00:05:44.860> the<00:05:45.490> host<00:05:45.669> will<00:05:45.940> be<00:05:45.970> killed<00:05:46.390> and<00:05:46.660> the

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
host the host will be killed and the

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.529 
host the host will be killed and the
system<00:05:47.290> reset

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
system reset

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.540

to<00:05:49.539> make<00:05:49.719> the<00:05:49.930> camera<00:05:50.379> look<00:05:50.680> in<00:05:50.949> certain

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
to make the camera look in certain

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.700 
to make the camera look in certain
directions<00:05:51.699> the<00:05:52.330> host<00:05:52.629> can<00:05:52.869> be<00:05:53.020> teleported

around<00:05:54.099> using<00:05:54.759> your<00:05:55.059> and<00:05:55.389> pitch<00:05:55.719> values

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.820 

this<00:06:02.520> method<00:06:02.880> gives<00:06:03.330> an<00:06:03.540> extremely<00:06:04.410> smooth

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
this method gives an extremely smooth

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.920 
this method gives an extremely smooth
camera<00:06:05.370> movement<00:06:05.760> as<00:06:05.880> you<00:06:06.090> can<00:06:06.270> see<00:06:06.510> from<00:06:06.750> the

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
camera movement as you can see from the

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.220 
camera movement as you can see from the
video<00:06:07.130> the<00:06:08.130> camera<00:06:08.490> movement<00:06:08.970> is<00:06:09.120> much<00:06:09.720> much

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
video the camera movement is much much

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.830 
video the camera movement is much much
smoother<00:06:10.920> than<00:06:11.310> the<00:06:11.520> camera<00:06:11.880> movement<00:06:12.360> using

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
smoother than the camera movement using

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.920 
smoother than the camera movement using
sequential<00:06:13.340> teleportation<00:06:14.720> however<00:06:15.720> this

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
sequential teleportation however this

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.740 
sequential teleportation however this
isn't<00:06:16.530> all<00:06:16.770> you<00:06:17.280> might<00:06:17.940> have<00:06:18.150> seen<00:06:18.390> it<00:06:18.570> already

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
isn't all you might have seen it already

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.530 
isn't all you might have seen it already
as<00:06:19.230> it's<00:06:19.710> already<00:06:20.040> played<00:06:20.400> through<00:06:20.880> a<00:06:21.060> few

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
as it's already played through a few

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.170 
as it's already played through a few
times<00:06:21.930> but<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:22.830> holy<00:06:23.040> grail<00:06:23.460> of<00:06:23.700> this

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
times but the holy grail of this

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.350 
times but the holy grail of this
technique<00:06:24.660> is<00:06:24.840> that<00:06:25.140> when<00:06:25.440> the<00:06:25.680> host

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
technique is that when the host

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.490 
technique is that when the host
teleports<00:06:27.360> the<00:06:27.930> player<00:06:28.320> also<00:06:28.740> moves<00:06:29.480> smoothly

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
teleports the player also moves smoothly

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.670 
teleports the player also moves smoothly
so<00:06:31.500> this<00:06:31.740> technique<00:06:32.280> allows<00:06:32.430> for<00:06:33.120> smooth

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
so this technique allows for smooth

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.470 
so this technique allows for smooth
teleportation<00:06:34.680> which<00:06:35.190> ultimately<00:06:35.430> means<00:06:35.910> we

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
teleportation which ultimately means we

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.750 
teleportation which ultimately means we
can<00:06:36.630> use<00:06:36.840> sequential<00:06:37.320> teleportation<00:06:38.310> method

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
can use sequential teleportation method

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.750 
can use sequential teleportation method
if<00:06:38.910> we<00:06:39.420> wanted<00:06:39.600> to<00:06:39.840> as<00:06:40.230> well<00:06:40.370> this<00:06:41.370> would<00:06:41.580> give

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
if we wanted to as well this would give

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.610 
if we wanted to as well this would give
us<00:06:41.790> the<00:06:42.030> advantage<00:06:42.180> of<00:06:42.660> being<00:06:42.720> able<00:06:43.050> to<00:06:43.260> pass

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
us the advantage of being able to pass

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.370 
us the advantage of being able to pass
through<00:06:44.160> walls<00:06:44.460> like<00:06:45.300> we<00:06:45.510> would<00:06:45.720> if<00:06:46.080> we<00:06:46.170> were

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
through walls like we would if we were

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.870 
through walls like we would if we were
in<00:06:46.650> noclip<00:06:47.130> mode<00:06:47.990> so<00:06:48.990> it<00:06:49.590> seems<00:06:49.980> the<00:06:50.280> occupied

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
in noclip mode so it seems the occupied

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.570 
in noclip mode so it seems the occupied
spectator<00:06:51.540> velocities<00:06:52.290> method<00:06:52.830> is<00:06:52.980> the<00:06:53.220> best

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
spectator velocities method is the best

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.530 
spectator velocities method is the best
of<00:06:53.880> all<00:06:54.300> three<00:06:54.780> options<00:06:55.550> but<00:06:56.550> if<00:06:56.700> we<00:06:56.850> take<00:06:57.090> two

of all three options but if we take two
