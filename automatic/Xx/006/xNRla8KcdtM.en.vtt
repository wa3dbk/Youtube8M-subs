we<00:00:02.460> are<00:00:02.580> now<00:00:02.790> going<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.419> show<00:00:03.780> how<00:00:04.230> we<00:00:04.259> can

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
we are now going to show how we can

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.140 
we are now going to show how we can
determine<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.980> maximum<00:00:05.160> number<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.700> zeros

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
determine the maximum number of zeros

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.089 
determine the maximum number of zeros
and<00:00:06.390> I've<00:00:06.779> already<00:00:07.049> talked<00:00:07.440> about<00:00:07.589> this<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:08.040> a

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
and I've already talked about this in a

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.640 
and I've already talked about this in a
few<00:00:08.370> earlier<00:00:08.730> videos<00:00:09.240> but<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.139> just<00:00:10.349> want<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.590> go

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
few earlier videos but I just want to go

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.560 
few earlier videos but I just want to go
over<00:00:10.740> this<00:00:10.950> specifically<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:11.940> case<00:00:12.000> and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
over this specifically in this case and

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.690 
over this specifically in this case and
it<00:00:13.049> turns<00:00:13.320> out<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.799> maximum<00:00:14.309> number<00:00:14.370> of

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
it turns out that the maximum number of

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:33.220 
it turns out that the maximum number of
zeros<00:00:22.550> is<00:00:23.990> always<00:00:26.480> equal<00:00:28.970> to<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.179> degree<00:00:30.660> of

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.380 

the<00:00:34.230> polynomial<00:00:34.620> zero<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.790> only<00:00:35.940> works

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
the polynomial zero now this only works

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.650 
the polynomial zero now this only works
if<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.719> polynomial<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:38.149> the<00:00:39.149> polynomial

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
if it's a polynomial of the polynomial

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.630 
if it's a polynomial of the polynomial
function<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:40.890> whatever<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> degree<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
function so whatever the degree the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.819 
function so whatever the degree the
function<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.180> that's<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.110> maximum<00:00:43.559> number<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
function is that's the maximum number of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.729 
function is that's the maximum number of
zeros<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:45.510> suppose<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> function<00:00:46.710> f

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
zeros so suppose we have the function f

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.360 
zeros so suppose we have the function f
of<00:00:47.070> x<00:00:47.280> equals<00:00:47.460> minus<00:00:48.059> x<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.480> fourth<00:00:48.870> plus

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
of x equals minus x to the fourth plus

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.420 
of x equals minus x to the fourth plus
6x<00:00:50.370> q2<00:00:51.000> minus<00:00:51.149> 9x<00:00:51.570> squared<00:00:52.039> so<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.340> is

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
6x q2 minus 9x squared so what we do is

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.240 
6x q2 minus 9x squared so what we do is
we<00:00:53.550> look<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> degree<00:00:54.829> this<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.039> degree

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
we look at the degree this is degree

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.950 
we look at the degree this is degree
four<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:57.960> means<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.289> are<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> maximum

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
four so this means there are a maximum

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.649 
four so this means there are a maximum
of<00:01:01.070> four<00:01:02.210> zeros<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.600> function<00:01:04.640> if<00:01:05.640> G<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
of four zeros for this function if G of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.880 
of four zeros for this function if G of
X<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.140> equal<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.770> x<00:01:08.100> squared<00:01:08.490> times<00:01:08.880> X<00:01:09.210> plus<00:01:09.570> 1

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
X is equal to x squared times X plus 1

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.670 
X is equal to x squared times X plus 1
times<00:01:10.890> X<00:01:11.250> minus<00:01:11.369> 2<00:01:11.930> this<00:01:12.930> one's<00:01:13.170> harder

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
times X minus 2 this one's harder

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.530 
times X minus 2 this one's harder
because<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.340> factored<00:01:14.880> form<00:01:14.909> not<00:01:15.479> in

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
because it's in factored form not in

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.800 
because it's in factored form not in
polynomial<00:01:16.380> form<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.150> what<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.390> need<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
polynomial form and so what we need to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.830 
polynomial form and so what we need to
do<00:01:18.960> instead<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:21.150> count<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> number<00:01:21.810> of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
do instead is just count the number of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.390 
do instead is just count the number of
X's<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.470> see<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.890> their<00:01:23.040> power<00:01:23.250> so

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
X's that we see with their power so

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.690 
X's that we see with their power so
there's<00:01:23.580> two<00:01:23.939> x's<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.470> there's<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:26.100> X<00:01:26.340> here

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
there's two x's here there's one X here

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.910 
there's two x's here there's one X here
and<00:01:26.909> there's<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:27.180> X<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.680> also

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and there's one X here so this also

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.649 
and there's one X here so this also
happens<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:29.909> degree<00:01:31.009> 4<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:33.329> there's<00:01:33.479> also

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
happens to be degree 4 so there's also

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.870 
happens to be degree 4 so there's also
again<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.439> maximum<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.509> four<00:01:36.509> zeros<00:01:37.640> now<00:01:38.640> one

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
again a maximum of four zeros now one

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.889 
again a maximum of four zeros now one
last<00:01:39.090> case<00:01:39.710> let's<00:01:40.710> let<00:01:40.920> H<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.430> X<00:01:41.640> equal<00:01:42.150> x<00:01:42.390> cubed

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
last case let's let H of X equal x cubed

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.810 
last case let's let H of X equal x cubed
times<00:01:43.259> X<00:01:43.560> plus<00:01:43.890> 1<00:01:44.159> squared<00:01:44.369> times<00:01:44.939> X<00:01:45.720> minus<00:01:46.200> 2

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
times X plus 1 squared times X minus 2

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.260 
times X plus 1 squared times X minus 2
well<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.060> case<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.840> three<00:01:49.649> x's<00:01:50.270> we

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
well in this case we have three x's we

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.469 
well in this case we have three x's we
have<00:01:51.450> one<00:01:52.020> X<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.530> before<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.610> here<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.329> have

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
have one X like before but here we have

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.090 
have one X like before but here we have
two<00:01:54.780> X<00:01:55.049> because<00:01:55.350> that's<00:01:55.470> an<00:01:55.590> X<00:01:55.710> plus<00:01:55.920> one

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
two X because that's an X plus one

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.560 
two X because that's an X plus one
squared<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.610> one<00:01:56.850> two<00:01:56.880> three<00:01:57.210> four

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
squared so we have one two three four

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.569 
squared so we have one two three four
five<00:01:57.810> six<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.189> degree<00:01:59.640> six<00:02:01.549> with<00:02:02.549> a

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
five six this is a degree six with a

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.960 
five six this is a degree six with a
maximum<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:05.329> six<00:02:06.329> zeros<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.310> really<00:02:08.610> easy

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
maximum of six zeros so it's really easy

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.940 
maximum of six zeros so it's really easy
if<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.629> pala<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.500> standard<00:02:11.039> form

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
if it's in pala if it's in standard form

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.160 
if it's in pala if it's in standard form
it<00:02:12.849> takes<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.150> little<00:02:13.300> bit<00:02:13.480> more<00:02:13.540> work<00:02:13.870> if<00:02:14.020> it's

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
it takes a little bit more work if it's

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.720 
it takes a little bit more work if it's
factored<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:14.860> mostly<00:02:15.250> what<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.459> have<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.640> do

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
factored but mostly what you have to do

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.280 
factored but mostly what you have to do
is<00:02:15.819> just<00:02:15.940> count<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.209> number<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.420> EXO<00:02:16.690> so<00:02:16.810> 1<00:02:16.989> 2<00:02:17.140> 3

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
is just count the number of EXO so 1 2 3

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.880 
is just count the number of EXO so 1 2 3
4<00:02:17.709> 5<00:02:17.950> 6<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:19.209> you're<00:02:19.450> done<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:19.870> that's<00:02:20.650> how<00:02:20.830> we

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
4 5 6 and you're done and that's how we

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.780 
4 5 6 and you're done and that's how we
determine<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.459> maximum<00:02:21.970> number<00:02:22.239> of<00:02:22.390> zeros
