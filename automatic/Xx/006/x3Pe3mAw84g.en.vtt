shore enough you remember where typhoon

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.160 
shore enough you remember where typhoon
bopha<00:02:19.860> hit<00:02:20.069> was<00:02:20.340> ranked<00:02:20.700> down<00:02:21.180> across<00:02:21.629> much<00:02:22.140> of

bopha hit was ranked down across much of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.960 
bopha hit was ranked down across much of
this<00:02:22.439> area<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.099> even<00:02:23.370> extending<00:02:23.730> up<00:02:23.819> through

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
this area here even extending up through

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.750 
this area here even extending up through
the<00:02:24.060> valleys<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:25.079> is<00:02:25.439> aware<00:02:26.099> you're<00:02:26.640> going

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
the valleys that is aware you're going

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.580 
the valleys that is aware you're going
to<00:02:26.819> be<00:02:26.879> seeing<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.209> highest<00:02:27.659> risk<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.140> for

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
to be seeing the highest risk of for

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.349 
to be seeing the highest risk of for
flooding<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.040> landslides<00:02:29.730> because<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> lot<00:02:30.329> of

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
flooding and landslides because a lot of

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.330 
flooding and landslides because a lot of
this<00:02:30.540> soil<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:31.019> already<00:02:31.409> loose<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.010> once<00:02:32.220> you

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
this soil is already loose so once you

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.399 
this soil is already loose so once you
get<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:32.579> heavy<00:02:32.909> rainfall<00:02:33.540> coming<00:02:33.870> down<00:02:34.170> on<00:02:34.200> a

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
get that heavy rainfall coming down on a

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.199 
get that heavy rainfall coming down on a
plenty<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.489> these<00:02:35.670> areas<00:02:36.030> which<00:02:36.180> were

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
plenty of these areas which were

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.050 
plenty of these areas which were
completely<00:02:36.810> deforested<00:02:37.650> there<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.579> that<00:02:38.790> risk

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
completely deforested there is that risk

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.940 
completely deforested there is that risk
of<00:02:39.299> further<00:02:39.540> landslides<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.379> then<00:02:40.530> not<00:02:40.769> to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
of further landslides and then not to

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.440 
of further landslides and then not to
mention<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.310> flooding<00:02:41.700> farther<00:02:42.030> off<00:02:42.239> there

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
mention the flooding farther off there

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
mention the flooding farther off there
towards<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.810> north<00:02:43.019> so<00:02:43.200> we're<00:02:43.319> definitely

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
towards the north so we're definitely

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.569 
towards the north so we're definitely
going<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.799> continue<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.159> watch<00:02:44.340> this

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
going to continue to watch this

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.339 
going to continue to watch this

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
we take a look at the gfs model it does

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.300 
we take a look at the gfs model it does
keep<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.540> rather<00:02:48.840> weak<00:02:49.290> pushing<00:02:49.799> through<00:02:50.129> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
keep it rather weak pushing through the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.360 
keep it rather weak pushing through the
next<00:02:50.750> 12<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.870> 24<00:02:52.109> hours<00:02:52.440> actually<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.220> is

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
next 12 to 24 hours actually this is

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
these bands continuing the ramp around

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.319 
these bands continuing the ramp around
out<00:03:05.069> farther<00:03:05.340> towards<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.790> north<00:03:06.030> that's

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
out farther towards the north that's

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.280 
out farther towards the north that's
where<00:03:06.599> you're<00:03:06.720> going<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.930> be<00:03:06.989> seeing<00:03:07.170> that

your Wednesday afternoon into evening

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.490 
your Wednesday afternoon into evening
hours<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:12.389> this<00:03:12.569> is<00:03:12.720> right<00:03:12.870> about<00:03:13.079> that<00:03:13.230> time

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
hours so this is right about that time

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.710 
hours so this is right about that time
once<00:03:13.859> it<00:03:14.010> starts<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.310> reimburse<00:03:14.700> but<00:03:15.090> still

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
once it starts to reimburse but still

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.970 
once it starts to reimburse but still
have<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.870> moisture<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.439> flow<00:03:16.590> coming<00:03:16.829> in

have that moisture and flow coming in
from<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.430> east<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.449> eventually<00:03:18.599> we

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
from the east and then eventually we

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.229 
from the east and then eventually we
look<00:03:19.199> out<00:03:19.379> towards<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.889> 72-hour<00:03:20.730> mark<00:03:21.030> going

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
look out towards the 72-hour mark going

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.990 
look out towards the 72-hour mark going
into<00:03:21.599> Thursday<00:03:22.139> and<00:03:22.590> eventually<00:03:23.310> continues

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
into Thursday and eventually continues

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.970
