I got Sonia here and today we decided to

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.829 
I got Sonia here and today we decided to
do<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.040> joint<00:00:05.460> high-stakes<00:00:06.180> because<00:00:06.629> she's

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
do a joint high-stakes because she's

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.049

never<00:00:07.020> done<00:00:07.350> one<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.099> figured<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.730> we'd

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
never done one and I figured that we'd

put<00:00:09.809> her<00:00:09.929> through<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.290> ranks<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:10.620> every<00:00:10.800> time

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
put her through the ranks so every time

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.980 
put her through the ranks so every time
she<00:00:11.010> dies<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.670> get<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.179> tickle<00:00:12.509> her<00:00:12.599> until<00:00:12.900> she

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
she dies I get to tickle her until she

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.079 
she dies I get to tickle her until she
complements<00:00:13.559> me<00:00:13.710> but<00:00:14.219> she's<00:00:14.460> too<00:00:14.670> scared<00:00:14.700> to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089
