height of the papers that they would all

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.289 
height of the papers that they would all

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.850 
end up relatively close in size now
using<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.750> hole<00:01:55.990> puncher<00:01:56.380> I'm<00:01:56.530> going<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.740> go

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
using a hole puncher I'm going to go

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.800 
using a hole puncher I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.340> punch<00:01:57.520> two<00:01:57.820> holes<00:01:57.850> in<00:01:58.299> each<00:01:58.420> number

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
ahead and punch two holes in each number

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.840 
ahead and punch two holes in each number
on<00:01:58.990> both<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.439> left<00:01:59.469> and<00:01:59.920> right<00:02:00.219> side<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.520> the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
on both the left and right side of the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.900 
on both the left and right side of the
top

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.390 

and<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:08.200> taking<00:02:08.440> our<00:02:08.680> string<00:02:09.010> I'm<00:02:09.190> going<00:02:09.340> to

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
and then taking our string I'm going to

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.040 
and then taking our string I'm going to
start<00:02:09.610> by<00:02:09.729> threading<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.180> five<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.690> going

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
start by threading the five and going

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.360 
start by threading the five and going
down<00:02:11.200> through<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.530> first<00:02:11.800> hole<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.010> then

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
down through the first hole and then

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.920 
down through the first hole and then
back<00:02:12.610> up<00:02:12.820> through<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.240> seconds<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.840> the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
back up through the seconds that the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.540 
back up through the seconds that the
majority<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.620> string<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.010> hidden<00:02:15.280> on<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
majority of the string is hidden on the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.280 
majority of the string is hidden on the
backside<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.180> number<00:02:16.450> but<00:02:16.870> will<00:02:17.050> still

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
backside of the number but will still

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.950 
backside of the number but will still
hold<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.620> number<00:02:17.770> up<00:02:18.040> straight

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.270 

so<00:02:25.960> continue<00:02:26.350> threading<00:02:26.710> on<00:02:26.860> each<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.220> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
so continue threading on each of the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.130 
so continue threading on each of the
numbers<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.820> I<00:02:27.970> also<00:02:28.150> added<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.720> little<00:02:28.750> piece

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
numbers and I also added a little piece

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.570 
numbers and I also added a little piece
of<00:02:29.260> tape<00:02:29.470> onto<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:29.920> back<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.130> each<00:02:30.400> number

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
of tape onto the back of each number

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.250 
of tape onto the back of each number
over<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.240> string<00:02:31.510> once<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:31.930> knew<00:02:32.080> exactly

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
over the string once I knew exactly

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.200 
over the string once I knew exactly
where<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:32.830> wanted<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> numbers<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.670> stay<00:02:33.940> and

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
where I wanted the numbers to stay and

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.080 
where I wanted the numbers to stay and
you're<00:02:34.810> done<00:02:34.960> this<00:02:35.740> next<00:02:36.010> one<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.130> super<00:02:36.790> super

scrapbook paper into a rough cone shape
just<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.080> get<00:04:31.200> an<00:04:31.290> idea<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.680> how<00:04:31.860> much<00:04:32.010> paper

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
just to get an idea of how much paper

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.130 
just to get an idea of how much paper
I'll<00:04:32.550> need<00:04:32.790> to<00:04:32.940> make<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.270> size<00:04:33.450> I<00:04:33.660> want<00:04:33.960> and

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
I'll need to make it the size I want and

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.630 
I'll need to make it the size I want and
then<00:04:34.620> trimming<00:04:34.950> it<00:04:35.040> down<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.370> a<00:04:35.400> more

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
then trimming it down to a more

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.000 
then trimming it down to a more
manageable<00:04:35.700> size<00:04:39.410> next<00:04:40.410> I'm<00:04:40.530> going<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.680> put<00:04:40.860> a

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
manageable size next I'm going to put a

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.740 
manageable size next I'm going to put a
line<00:04:41.280> of<00:04:41.430> hot<00:04:41.610> glue<00:04:41.760> on<00:04:42.030> one<00:04:42.090> side<00:04:42.600> of<00:04:42.690> the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
line of hot glue on one side of the

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.690 
line of hot glue on one side of the
paper<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.260> roll<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.650> back<00:04:43.770> up<00:04:43.920> into<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.490> cone

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
paper and roll it back up into the cone

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.550 
paper and roll it back up into the cone
so<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.060> two<00:04:45.240> ends<00:04:45.600> connect<00:04:45.960> on<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.260> glue<00:04:47.210> and

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
so the two ends connect on the glue and

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.020 
so the two ends connect on the glue and
then<00:04:49.560> obviously<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:50.160> bottom<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.610> that<00:04:50.760> cone

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
then obviously the bottom of that cone

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.460 
then obviously the bottom of that cone
needs<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.390> be<00:04:51.510> trimmed<00:04:51.780> down<00:04:51.900> so<00:04:52.230> that<00:04:52.320> it's

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
needs to be trimmed down so that it's

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.350 
needs to be trimmed down so that it's
flat<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.100> once<00:04:53.430> that's<00:04:53.520> cut<00:04:53.730> down<00:04:53.940> I'm<00:04:54.210> going

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
flat and once that's cut down I'm going

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.330 
flat and once that's cut down I'm going
to<00:04:54.420> put<00:04:54.600> a<00:04:54.750> dot<00:04:54.990> of<00:04:55.020> glue<00:04:55.200> onto<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.800> bottom<00:04:56.220> of

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
to put a dot of glue onto the bottom of

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.860 
to put a dot of glue onto the bottom of
the<00:04:56.460> cone<00:04:56.670> to<00:04:56.940> attach<00:04:57.150> this<00:04:57.390> little<00:04:57.690> mini
