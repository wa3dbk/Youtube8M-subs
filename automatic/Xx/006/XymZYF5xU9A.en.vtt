00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
something wrong with the axle in this

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.240 
something wrong with the axle in this
case<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.250> already<00:00:32.969> know<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:35.160> know

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
case I already know that the you know

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.069 
case I already know that the you know
camper<00:00:35.610> axles<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.090> surprisingly<00:00:36.600> light<00:00:36.840> duty

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
camper axles are surprisingly light duty

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.389 
camper axles are surprisingly light duty
they<00:00:37.410> don't<00:00:37.559> want<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> put<00:00:37.829> any<00:00:37.950> more<00:00:38.070> money<00:00:38.129> in

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
they don't want to put any more money in

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.619 
they don't want to put any more money in
they<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.000> most<00:00:39.059> people<00:00:39.329> don't<00:00:39.420> tow

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
they have to and most people don't tow

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.950 
they have to and most people don't tow
their<00:00:39.780> campers<00:00:40.110> very<00:00:40.320> far<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:42.510> axles<00:00:42.870> are

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
their campers very far so the axles are

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.130 
their campers very far so the axles are
are<00:00:43.170> bent<00:00:43.710> they're<00:00:44.660> you<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:45.719> they're<00:00:45.899> sort

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
are bent they're you know they're sort

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.389 
are bent they're you know they're sort
of<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.789> u-shape<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> wheels<00:00:48.450> are<00:00:49.160> our<00:00:50.160> tip

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
of a u-shape so the wheels are our tip

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.819 
of a u-shape so the wheels are our tip
slightly<00:00:50.670> which<00:00:51.030> means<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.420> run<00:00:51.829> more

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
slightly which means they run more

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.880 
slightly which means they run more
weight<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.039> these<00:00:53.250> insides<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.320> then<00:00:55.320> because

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
weight on these insides and then because

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.580 
weight on these insides and then because
there's<00:00:56.039> more<00:00:56.250> weight<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.600> front<00:00:58.079> axle

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
there's more weight on the front axle

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.459 
there's more weight on the front axle
there<00:00:59.059> it's<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> dominant<00:01:00.420> axle<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
there it's the dominant axle so it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.979 
there it's the dominant axle so it
tracks<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.789> back<00:01:03.000> axle<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> one

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
tracks and the back axle is the one

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.200 
tracks and the back axle is the one
scrubs<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.700> goes<00:01:05.880> around<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
scrubs which is as it goes around the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.330 
scrubs which is as it goes around the
corner<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.200> tires<00:01:07.500> up<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> slide<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> little

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
corner the tires up the slide a little

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.810 
corner the tires up the slide a little
so<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.510> always<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> back<00:01:10.439> axle<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
so it's always the back axle then you

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.120 
so it's always the back axle then you
throw<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:15.409> Civil<00:01:16.409> War<00:01:16.619> cannon

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
throw on Civil War cannon

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.969 
throw on Civil War cannon
carriage<00:01:18.090> strapped<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> back<00:01:19.439> now<00:01:19.830> you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
carriage strapped to the back now you

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.620 
carriage strapped to the back now you
have<00:01:20.070> thrown<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> lot<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.640> weight<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> rear

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
have thrown a lot of weight in the rear

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.570 
have thrown a lot of weight in the rear
and<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.680> constantly<00:01:23.430> shaking<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:25.580> we

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
and it's constantly shaking it so we

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.260 
and it's constantly shaking it so we
smoked<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.880> one

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
smoked that one

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.569 
smoked that one
this<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> spare<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.040> I'd<00:01:29.430> already

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
this was the spare and I'd already

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.789 
this was the spare and I'd already
pulled<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> off<00:01:30.119> because<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.140> had<00:01:31.259> hit<00:01:31.409> chords

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
pulled it off because it had hit chords

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.100 
pulled it off because it had hit chords
in<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.520> spot<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.979> time<00:01:34.979> or<00:01:35.189> two<00:01:35.810> back<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.179 

if<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> start<00:01:55.049> eating<00:01:55.170> tires<00:01:55.619> this

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
if it's going to start eating tires this

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.010 
if it's going to start eating tires this
fast<00:01:57.049> it's<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.350> don't<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.340> what's<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.759> on

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.020 
fast it's I don't know what's going on
and<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> other<00:02:01.380> tire<00:02:01.770> I've<00:02:02.700> got<00:02:02.880> these

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and on the other tire I've got these

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.740 
and on the other tire I've got these
funny<00:02:03.740> blister<00:02:04.740> wear<00:02:05.100> patterns

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
funny blister wear patterns

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:17.060 
funny blister wear patterns
I<00:02:15.320> don't<00:02:16.320> know<00:02:16.410> if<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.710> see<00:02:16.920> them<00:02:17.040> very

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
I don't know if you can see them very

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.730 
I don't know if you can see them very
clearly<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:17.760> there<00:02:18.080> right<00:02:19.080> there<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.710> know

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
clearly in there right there you know

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.100 
clearly in there right there you know
there's<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.100> little<00:02:20.850> little<00:02:21.420> tip<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.780> little

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
there's a little little tip to little

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.650 
there's a little little tip to little
nubbin<00:02:22.440> it's<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.100> button<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:24.240> sticks<00:02:24.540> up

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
nubbin it's like a button it sticks up

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.110 
nubbin it's like a button it sticks up
there<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.260> there<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.070> evenly<00:02:26.490> spaced<00:02:26.910> all

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
there and there and so evenly spaced all

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.150 
there and there and so evenly spaced all
the<00:02:27.240> way<00:02:27.330> around

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
the way around

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.070 
the way around
so<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:29.850> rear<00:02:30.060> corner<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.450> always<00:02:30.810> eating

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
so that one rear corner is always eating

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.810 
so that one rear corner is always eating
