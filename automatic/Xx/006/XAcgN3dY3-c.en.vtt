00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.139 

all<00:00:00.599> right<00:00:00.900> so<00:00:01.230> I<00:00:01.620> was<00:00:02.010> really<00:00:02.639> really<00:00:02.790> bored

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
all right so I was really really bored

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.260 
all right so I was really really bored
and<00:00:03.419> I<00:00:03.990> decided<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.529> make<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:05.069> device<00:00:05.970> which

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
and I decided to make a device which

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.960 
and I decided to make a device which
allows<00:00:06.569> me<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:07.049> turn<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.710> lights<00:00:07.950> off<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.580> my

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
allows me to turn the lights off in my

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.350 
allows me to turn the lights off in my
room<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.719> on<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.590> turn<00:00:10.920> them<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.130> -<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:12.179> my

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
room and on and turn them on - in my

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.440 
room and on and turn them on - in my
room<00:00:12.389> from<00:00:13.019> both<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.889> internet<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.670> from

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
room from both the internet and from

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.710 
room from both the internet and from
flowers<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:17.580> all<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:17.970> do<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.420> just

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
flowers so all you have to do is just

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.140 
flowers so all you have to do is just
load<00:00:19.109> up<00:00:19.140> Firefox<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.550> type<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.910> link

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
load up Firefox and you type in the link

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.609 
load up Firefox and you type in the link
and<00:00:21.800> whatever<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:23.010> connect<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.460> page<00:00:23.699> it

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
and whatever you connect to the page it

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:33.040 
and whatever you connect to the page it
turns<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.830> lights<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.220> my<00:00:26.250> room<00:00:26.369> either<00:00:26.699> ro

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.720 

and<00:00:33.560> I<00:00:34.130> consider<00:00:34.520> this<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:34.910> be<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:35.620> most

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
and I consider this to be the most

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.840 
and I consider this to be the most
useless<00:00:37.730> invention<00:00:38.540> ever<00:00:38.750> but<00:00:39.700> that's<00:00:40.700> not

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
useless invention ever but that's not

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.120 
useless invention ever but that's not
all<00:00:40.940> you<00:00:40.970> can<00:00:41.090> also<00:00:41.300> do<00:00:41.540> it<00:00:41.630> for<00:00:41.720> my<00:00:41.810> thumb<00:00:42.130> just

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
all you can also do it for my thumb just

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.800 
all you can also do it for my thumb just
type<00:00:43.430> in<00:00:43.580> the<00:00:43.670> length<00:00:43.910> from<00:00:44.210> any<00:00:44.480> phone

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
type in the length from any phone

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.120 
type in the length from any phone
capable<00:00:45.230> of<00:00:45.320> connecting<00:00:45.650> to<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:45.860> Internet

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
capable of connecting to the Internet

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.970 
capable of connecting to the Internet
and<00:00:49.570> we'll<00:00:50.570> give<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:50.870> second<00:00:51.230> thought

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and we'll give it a second thought

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:02.799 
and we'll give it a second thought
they're<00:00:53.610> good

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:11.300 

it's<00:01:03.809> actually<00:01:04.110> pretty<00:01:04.320> simple<00:01:09.950> see<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.979> have

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it's actually pretty simple see I have

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.370 
it's actually pretty simple see I have
this<00:01:11.640> server<00:01:12.000> computer<00:01:12.540> setup<00:01:12.840> right<00:01:13.050> here

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
this server computer setup right here

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.490 
this server computer setup right here
and<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.130> wrote<00:01:14.610> code<00:01:15.050> to<00:01:16.050> make<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.470> that

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and I just wrote code to make it so that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.749 
and I just wrote code to make it so that
whenever<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.100> receives<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:18.979> connection<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
whenever it receives a connection on a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.190 
whenever it receives a connection on a
certain<00:01:21.750> port<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.800> sends<00:01:24.200> electrical

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
certain port it just sends electrical

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.219 
certain port it just sends electrical
voltage<00:01:25.560> up<00:01:25.830> through<00:01:26.330> this<00:01:27.330> parallel<00:01:27.929> port

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
voltage up through this parallel port

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.639 
voltage up through this parallel port
cable<00:01:28.619> right<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:29.100> which<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.640> wired<00:01:29.910> into

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
cable right here which I have wired into

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.910 
cable right here which I have wired into
this<00:01:31.649> thing<00:01:32.630> which<00:01:33.630> goes<00:01:34.020> into<00:01:34.289> this<00:01:34.590> thing

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
this thing which goes into this thing

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.499 
this thing which goes into this thing
which<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.429> wired<00:01:35.729> into<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.479> thing<00:01:37.460> yeah<00:01:38.509> I

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
which is wired into this thing yeah I

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.029 
which is wired into this thing yeah I
don't<00:01:39.720> know<00:01:39.960> if<00:01:40.080> I<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.500> explain<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
don't know if I can really explain it

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.840 
don't know if I can really explain it
very<00:01:41.070> well<00:01:41.539> it's<00:01:42.539> basically<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.080> a<00:01:43.350> relay

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
very well it's basically just a relay

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.180 
very well it's basically just a relay
connected<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> power<00:01:46.470> supply<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:47.070> my

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
connected to the power supply of my

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.820 
connected to the power supply of my
computer<00:01:49.190> with<00:01:50.190> a<00:01:50.220> transistor<00:01:51.229> which<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:52.679> it

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
computer with a transistor which when it

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.710 
computer with a transistor which when it
receives<00:01:53.490> voltage<00:01:53.880> from<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> parallel<00:01:54.479> port

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
receives voltage from the parallel port

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.590 
receives voltage from the parallel port
cable<00:01:55.009> it<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.490> lot<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.030> altars<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.479> go

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
cable it just a lot of altars to go

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.180 
cable it just a lot of altars to go
through<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> transistor<00:01:58.229> which<00:01:58.770> allows<00:01:59.159> a

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
through the transistor which allows a

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.130 
through the transistor which allows a
relay<00:01:59.700> connected<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> light<00:02:00.570> switch<00:02:00.600> over

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
relay connected to the light switch over

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.300 
relay connected to the light switch over
there<00:02:01.579> this<00:02:02.579> light<00:02:02.820> switch<00:02:03.860> which<00:02:04.860> is

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
there this light switch which is

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.730

connected to this light and yeah that's

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.760 
connected to this light and yeah that's
about<00:02:07.860> it

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.830 

you
