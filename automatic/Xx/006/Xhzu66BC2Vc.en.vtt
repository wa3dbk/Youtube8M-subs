00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.660
 let's tell a story 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:45.339
 we have created some climbs 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.260

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.960

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.890
 there was once a caterpillar called 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.740
 here 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.700
 this doubt wanted to fly because of them 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.890

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.409

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.790
 flying through the sky but she was 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.700
 very sad 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:51.640
 because he was just crawling 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.640

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.070

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.579
 is that as they are caterpillars with low UN 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:13.550
 with that they crawl and eat little leaves 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:18.200
 couple one day the caterpillar was already tired 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:22.370
 and he said hidden to his friend they are worth 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.849
 because we are not going to take a nap 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.940

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.940

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.120

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.090

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.170

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.170

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.340

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.840
 trees and my place went to sleep 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.110
 and then he was not tired and Alex went to 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.380

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.600

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.000

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.000
