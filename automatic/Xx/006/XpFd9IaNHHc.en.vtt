who did that 21 weeks nine times yeah I
just<00:00:59.789> don't<00:00:59.879> believe<00:01:00.090> what<00:01:00.420> you're<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
just don't believe what you're going to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.900 
just don't believe what you're going to
give<00:01:01.440> us<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.649> sample<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.219> high<00:01:02.399> intense<00:01:02.760> I

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
give us a sample of this high intense I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.310 
give us a sample of this high intense I
am<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:03.300> we're<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> sample<00:01:04.199> so

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
am what we're going to do as a sample so

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.140 
am what we're going to do as a sample so
go<00:01:04.500> ahead<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.739> head<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.070> down<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.640> start

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
go ahead and head on down and start

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.429 
go ahead and head on down and start
getting<00:01:06.240> warmed<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:06.990> what<00:01:07.140> we're<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
getting warmed up so what we're going to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.980 
getting warmed up so what we're going to
do<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.799> yep<00:01:08.130> gotcha<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.420> reason<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.810> works

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
do is yep gotcha the reason this works

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.679 
do is yep gotcha the reason this works
is<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.500> because<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.250> burn<00:01:11.670> more<00:01:12.360> calories

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
is not because you burn more calories

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.539 
is not because you burn more calories
during<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.380> four<00:01:13.650> minute<00:01:13.890> workout<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.400> what

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
during the four minute workout but what

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.810 
during the four minute workout but what
happens<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.350> 24<00:01:16.350> hours<00:01:16.830> after<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
happens is 24 hours after you do the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.039 
happens is 24 hours after you do the
four-minute<00:01:18.360> high-intensity<00:01:18.810> interval

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
four-minute high-intensity interval

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.140 
four-minute high-intensity interval
training<00:01:19.290> they<00:01:20.040> burned<00:01:20.369> nine<00:01:20.759> times<00:01:21.030> more

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
training they burned nine times more

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.090 
training they burned nine times more
body<00:01:21.540> fat<00:01:21.659> during<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> workout<00:01:22.710> because<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
body fat during the workout because you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.230 
body fat during the workout because you
boost<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.460> those<00:01:23.610> good<00:01:23.759> fat<00:01:23.939> burning

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
boost all those good fat burning

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.550 
boost all those good fat burning
hormones<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.409> very

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
hormones and so on so it's very

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.080 
hormones and so on so it's very
effective<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.460> what<00:01:26.610> we're<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.000> is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
effective so what we're going to do is

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.190 
effective so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> warm<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.689> Michelle<00:01:27.990> real

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
we're going to warm up Michelle real
