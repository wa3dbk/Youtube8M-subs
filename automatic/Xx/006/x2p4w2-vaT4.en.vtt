00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.350
 the PRI 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.350
 we are proudly revolutionary 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.769
 we are the party that emerges from the revolution 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.999
 we are legitimate heirs 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.589
 of revolutionary causes 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.169
 We owe it to her and we work for them 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.849
 If the revolution was a popular movement 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.060
 a movement of majorities 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.440
 today the revolution that party defends the causes of all sectors of the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.970
 society 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.740
 the results 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.890
 they were so obvious 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.140
 as blunt 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.560
 rights to workers 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.120
 health and social security 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.550
 Petroleum Expropriation 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.910
 in industrialization 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.470
 education for all 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.470
 democracy and international respect 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.230
 this 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.100
 it's time 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.290
 the intense partisan work 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.290
 already of preparation 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.299
 for the democratic competition of 2011 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.180
 here 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.840
 here there is no space 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.370
 for individualism or for personal projects 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.300
 but is pretty 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.400
 the whole world 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.280
 must sign 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.470
 our unit 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.050
 and works on a single project as a triumph pelÃ© 2011 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.290
 the pri 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.500
 in the pri I was going to win 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.810
 2011 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.740
 besides his death 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 with more than 600 government commitments 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.850
 that we are fulfilling 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.250
 with others 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:10.720
 four hundred high-impact works in addition to my reasons for voting for the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.720
 pri 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.109
 as you sleep 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.639
 what can be lost 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.189
 that you can feel 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.159
 that can be enjoyed 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.029
 no reasons 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.639
 that improve the quality of life 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:34.799
 of the Mexiquenses
