 I lived not far from my room 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.589
 Boxing is actually I liked it I watched 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.000
 and then I always had 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.790
 financial problems of what I was 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.960
 a child do I was 16 years old and 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.970
 I have already worked in the markets 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.280
 to be able to pay my license and after 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.080
 a year I study the rooms France and 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.670
 compared to his bomb the club she does 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.160
 wanted more than I pay since I'm going 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.350
 contribute to advertising at the club and that 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.479
 allowed me to almost evolve to do 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.979
 I chose boxing feet-fists 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.630
 because I was simply doing 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.670
 I play football at the time 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.110
 I had thrown in cadets and actually I 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.220
 saw my first fight I won I 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.960
 said but the second fight I won 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.580
 exit if this third fight win I 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.580
 continued time and again that's what 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.560
 I did and the gg 133 fight that I 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.070
 done and I have three defeats and I'm 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.990
 remained undefeated 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.950
 in fact from 2.87 until 91 I 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.790
 lost weight 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.830
 after I have not I lost again in 97 and 98 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.720
 only once in the final actually I 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.300
 three defeats the final point in the end 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.450
 are not france actually the title the most 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.770
 coveted what i have is that does gt5 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:04.880
 far better boxer all categories 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:06.080
 by karate bushido magazine it's the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.580
 points scripts that the stock market 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.070

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.570
 does kendo karate do the sports the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.130
 martial arts at rex and it's a 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.480
 stringing fists 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.800
 feet who says it's boxing 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.870
 French fist boxing 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.819
 kickboxing for the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.930
 contact actually is the distance that 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.930
 separates a little things 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.680
 in fact it's the motivation that is 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.750
 always important - as long as I 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.180
 the motivation I 'm doing there I've never 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.870
 refused a fight he would kill salmon tuna 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.120
 on average 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.519
 because at the highest level you know 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.810
 I always told myself my point of 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.209
 view is very simple is to put all 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.409
 my titles that I won on on the 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.819
 butt table like when I 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:47.950
 meet someone and that's what 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.950
 motivated and we surpassed made 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.209
 I fought a lot more balance 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.519
 and that fight like me fighters 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.319
 but to himself because we were watching 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.109
 I stayed 18 years in the same 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.310
 category and know it's very very it's 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.769
 you have to ask a lot of 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.569
 perseverance and a lot of self-denial 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.590
 a lot of especially serious passes 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.450
 how the nightclubs all that I 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.400
 did not know too much because I knew 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.629
 it makes me me is boxing 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.489
 was almost all my life because I 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.829
 ate bof i slept ebook if i lived 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.510
 boxing I say I it's so much 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.090
 that's what gave me the success of 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.650
 all and in fact it's harder that in 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.959
 done was once I was at 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.150
 weight in the city ​​of tomorrow 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.019
 balance for me after I would not say that 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.459
 it was a letter to the post office 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.930
 the opponent but in fact I had 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.489
 much more to fight the scales than 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.720
 the opponent because I was training 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.030
 more than that to be able to train 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.650
 to be able to fight it I'm training 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.910
 three a day why teach it's 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.150
 very simple is that I am 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.190
 always say once we have instilled 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.230
 what we lived is to do 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.420
 pass on to our little brothers and 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.060
 why not 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.130
 put a factory to champions and there I 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.690
 just because I like his 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.530
 shapes and countries because it's small 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.050
 it is he who is going from the future 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.550
 I do not like people can come 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.650
 who are already champions yesterday in the 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.910
 room because it's not credible because 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.370
 that I had the glory 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.110
 I 'm losing 25 years in the glory it's 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.450
 better train the little ones and he climbed 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.310
 and the villa gillet in champagne france 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.390
 in younger wheeling chicks and 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.040
 benjamins chicks 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.030
 I am very happy that he boxing boxing 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.040
 Thai lady did about eight 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.540
 years and a half on the holes on the 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.450
 roadway 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.010
 it's the competition so much 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:34.000
 I was his deputy of the team of 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:35.740
 rental writings and since this year we 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.500
 tried a lot of Nordic type 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.510
 to the champion of France this year 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.540
 last and the year before so it befits 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.790
 is about six years that the indicative 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.000
 there is a lot of potential and that 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.830
 progresses to perez but I was small on 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.139
 hope she is very good with them and 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.970
 to see them grow also me it is very 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.650
 simple me I console myself as a 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.810
 train I always had this expression 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.610
 like a train and prophets of 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.090
 travelers going up and down to 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.289
 two stations 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.789
 finally that's what the blues club he 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.250
 will always remain the wagon and the legs 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:11.140
 while training and I won title 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.280
 for them it's personal what is 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.390
 important it is a serious if young 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.400
 by sport because we do 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.570
 also a lot of the educational and me this 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.130
 which interests me most of all is the 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.229
 academic success because there is not that 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.640
 the breeze in life boxing had bandaged 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.900
 fight and we do not win too much 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.419
 is not with the professional thief 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.969
 knowing that they have it in them 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.999
 difficult neighborhoods 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:32.129
 should themselves their families and 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:34.409
 sometimes under very 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.489
 precarious are very precarious and 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.449
 try to help them to make a real 

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:40.339
 tutoring 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.339
 meanwhile do not compensate for boxing 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.319
 all that is in compliance because 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.149
 that in fact boxing is very simple 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:48.839
 we give we have to type in places 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:50.309
 drop specified 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:52.169
 we must not bowling water we must 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:53.819
 greet you have to go back it's very simple 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.069
 in boxing and in a gym 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.479
 even though the same the hello animosities 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.489
 years old born hot so I do not see why 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.289
 she young people who come who counts 

00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:03.449
 difficult neighborhoods that started 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.829
 in the night when he comes to train 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.639
 they come and say hello a debit 

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:08.129
 not say hello because they are 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.979
 shy they are they are locked up and 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:13.169
 afterwards and opens and as for 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.509
 alain for example to excel without 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.559
 doubt a jersey of course when I say 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.899
 to taf said hello 

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:21.239
 arrived at the beginning reluctant days but everything 

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:22.559
 discreetly after we will say hello and 

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:24.119
 very simple because actually when he 

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:25.319
 then comes to me I always fear by 

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:27.629
 report to young people who do not come 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.919
 so everyday then but the day when 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:29.939
 we see their job to fetch 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.679
 work when they will find some 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.149
 work the grumblers that that's part of 

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:36.019
 the everyday life boxing that is 

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:38.339
 very beautiful and co2 is your bill rhyme 

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:40.229
 very important because when we 

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:41.639
 continues to sing in France vis-à-vis 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.439
 from the neighborhood where someone important 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.939
 because it's someone who came out 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:46.889
 context 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:48.269
 context leave on the act that the whole 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.860
 is very dark in France that is going to be 

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:51.419
 open for a youth tour 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.889

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.889
