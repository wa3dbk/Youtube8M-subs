remember<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:08.189> it's<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.490> little<00:00:08.730> bit

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
remember that it's a little bit

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.520 
remember that it's a little bit
different<00:00:09.120> than<00:00:09.210> starting<00:00:09.540> up<00:00:09.809> because

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
different than starting up because

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.230 
different than starting up because
you're<00:00:10.650> never<00:00:10.800> really<00:00:10.980> going<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.340> be<00:00:11.400> speeding

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240

in Reverse

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.480 
in Reverse
you're<00:00:12.990> only<00:00:13.139> going<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.559> moving<00:00:14.130> back<00:00:14.160> on

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
you're only going to be moving back on

you're only going to be moving back on
to<00:00:14.610> reverse<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.690> need<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.870> give<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> little

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
to reverse you need to give it a little

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.019 
to reverse you need to give it a little
gas<00:00:16.440> start<00:00:16.890> coming<00:00:17.100> off<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.279> clutch<00:00:17.520> slowly

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
gas start coming off the clutch slowly

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.210 
gas start coming off the clutch slowly
beginning<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:18.990> feel<00:00:19.320> you're<00:00:19.800> gonna<00:00:19.859> get<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.189> a

point where the car's gonna start to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.060 
point where the car's gonna start to
move<00:00:21.510> back<00:00:21.570> when<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.470> happens<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.890> hold

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
move back when that happens you hold

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.250 
move back when that happens you hold
your<00:00:23.220> foot<00:00:23.310> there<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.609> clutch<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:25.080> car

your foot there in the clutch the car
starts<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.710> move<00:00:25.740> back<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.070> little<00:00:26.400> faster<00:00:26.820> go

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
starts to move back a little faster go

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.849 
starts to move back a little faster go
back<00:00:27.840> down<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> clutch<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.619> let<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
back down on the clutch and let the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.009 
back down on the clutch and let the
momentum<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:30.090> car<00:00:30.240> moving<00:00:30.539> back<00:00:30.689> carry

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
momentum of the car moving back carry

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.880 
momentum of the car moving back carry
you<00:00:31.170> if<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.980> stops<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.669> again<00:00:33.710> if<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.739> see

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
you if it stops do it again if you see

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.380 
you if it stops do it again if you see
the<00:00:34.980> car<00:00:35.130> moving<00:00:35.370> too<00:00:35.550> quick<00:00:35.760> go<00:00:35.910> back<00:00:36.090> down<00:00:36.270> in

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
the car moving too quick go back down in

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.240 
the car moving too quick go back down in
the<00:00:36.450> clutch<00:00:36.660> let<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> car<00:00:37.680> slide<00:00:37.829> itself

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the clutch let the car slide itself

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.150 
the clutch let the car slide itself
again<00:00:38.520> when<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.390> momentum<00:00:39.780> stops<00:00:40.160> repeat

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
again when that momentum stops repeat

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.819 
again when that momentum stops repeat
the<00:00:41.760> reason<00:00:41.969> you're<00:00:42.090> doing<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.570> because

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
the reason you're doing this is because

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.560 
the reason you're doing this is because
you<00:00:43.829> want<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> move<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.520> car<00:00:44.700> slowly<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
you want to move the car slowly you

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.850 
you want to move the car slowly you
don't<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> car<00:00:45.989> speed<00:00:46.289> into<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.530> parking

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
don't the car speed into the parking

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.560 
don't the car speed into the parking
spot<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.590> am<00:00:49.710> giving<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.760> gas<00:00:50.969> coming

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
spot so here I am giving it gas coming

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.240 
spot so here I am giving it gas coming
off<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> clutch<00:00:52.079> slowly<00:00:52.350> let<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.800> car<00:00:53.070> roll

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
off the clutch slowly let the car roll

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.310 
off the clutch slowly let the car roll
now<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.910> go<00:00:54.120> back<00:00:54.149> down<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> clutch<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.199> let

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
now I go back down on the clutch to let

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040 
now I go back down on the clutch to let
the<00:00:55.440> car<00:00:55.649> slow<00:00:55.860> itself<00:00:56.129> down<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.750> come<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the car slow itself down I come up and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.990 
the car slow itself down I come up and
down<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> clutch<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.710> tweak<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.129> when<00:00:59.969> I

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
down on a clutch to tweak it when I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.400 
down on a clutch to tweak it when I
really<00:01:00.270> need<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> stop<00:01:00.750> I'll<00:01:00.899> press<00:01:01.109> down<00:01:01.289> on

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
really need to stop I'll press down on

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.260 
really need to stop I'll press down on
the<00:01:01.469> brake<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:03.210> I'll

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
the brake as you can see now I'll

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.000 
the brake as you can see now I'll
continue<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.719> come<00:01:03.899> off<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> clutch<00:01:04.320> again<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
continue to come off the clutch again to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.100 
continue to come off the clutch again to
let<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> car<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> little<00:01:05.850> roll<00:01:06.110> break

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
when I need to suddenly stop and repeat

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.580 
when I need to suddenly stop and repeat
and<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.159> straighten<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.560> Here<00:01:13.560> I

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and then I straighten it out and Here I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.670 
and then I straighten it out and Here I
am<00:01:13.710> pulling<00:01:14.100> into<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.369> spot<00:01:15.560> working<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.650> a
