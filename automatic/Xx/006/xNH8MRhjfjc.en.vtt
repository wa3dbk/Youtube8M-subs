 hello everyone with you internet tizen and 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.260
 let's talk today about Kursk and therefore 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.080
 that sea ​​is the official app 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.809
 Yesterday I found one for windows phone 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.970
 interesting thing is that 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.980
 foursquare for some reason gives less points 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.829
 when you use windows phone than 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.470
 on android at the same time but let's 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:28.619
 try to find a place in which I 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.730
 there was no and check it using 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.820
 marine official official 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.219
 app for windows phone not 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.309
 scabbers irish bar for example yes summer not 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.440
 was barcelona catalonia don't know what 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.089
 such to share with the public but 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:53.249
 here I am fixing here means 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:56.699
 one point gave me one point 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:59.339
 but here you saw yes I got one point 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.289
 I think this is some kind of mistake that in 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.920
 application all the time gives one point 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.770
 what about grieving and just a bar you see that 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.930
 I have already fixed there yes it is 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:21.420
 re- chikin will go on the check news 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:27.030
 for square and get 7 points and you were 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:31.649
 here two times that is see yes here 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.920
 this dad is one point and here is 7 points and I 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.289
 was twice you saw what i just 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.100
 fixed afternoon checked in like me this 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:44.340
 did you saw that is to question 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.890
 probably that application which 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.900
 even produces the same company on 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.330
 windows phone and on 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.840
 other systems work very different 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.850
 way it is not at all about the system to 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.000
 This story is about the fact that force koi 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.950
 works differently there and there though with 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.840
 other side here's a functional 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.390
 the possibilities are about the same 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.610
 theory well, that's all the evidence 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.060
 the fact that there is a glitch in the Vorskla 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.060
 windows phone
