00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello to all as such but that very 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.930
 but very good as you will see in the title 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.790
 that says twenty days ten books I want 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.849
 do this kind of challenge in your 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.410
 beginning had emerged as 30 days 15 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.389
 books but I realized that the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.190
 vacations did not begin just the 1st 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.450
 of July then I said good during the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.280
 last 20 days 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.080
 I want to read and the book so 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.610
 basically it would be a book every two days 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.890
 the point is that I commented on it 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.880
 twitter and flower of plausible said that I 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.040
 I also wanted to do it then 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.290
 We were talking and we said why not 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.629
 make a kind of call 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.480
 open or we do this video that is 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.800
 a tibial of the 20 days 10 books and yes 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.480
 you want to participate good 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.269
 you went away on twitter or on facebook 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.489
 also do subsidize a video a post 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.870
 on the blog as you want the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.909
 grace is age, it is also not necessary 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.909
 that you feel books can be five 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.710
 there can be four can be 11 12 the 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.780
 things that is a symbolic thing so 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.819
 let's move on to doing the tibial and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.680
 tell me if you are caught with the idea 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.440
 or if you feel like reading some 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.210
 it would really be an experience 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.580
 different to read in group so there 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.150
 They are good of my dearest James 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.440
 station er I want to read the infinite game 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.020
 illusion that is the second book of the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.600
 saga the first one blew my head and this 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.180
 I think I have a lot of faith and I hope 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.460
 many things about jim turner so I think 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.130
 I 'm going to love this part later 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.800
 also from michi trip I have a zodiac 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.650
 romina russel is an argentine author 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.259
 that Argentine nation but lives in the USA and 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.810
 talks about the signs and talks about the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.610
 5 looked for the thirteenth sign so 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.560
 I really want to read it too 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.210
 a well-known book in these 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.970
 moments for a tube and the blog is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.619
 would be the world of sangin to the son I have 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.330
 eager to read this book they say 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.530
 which is very good and has a plot 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.660
 pretty catchy 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.550
 so this is going to be one of my 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.399
 readings I will also read bells are 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.190
 the world gold and be that what they say if 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.470
 it's a new book, a novelty or more 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.000
 less and it's a contemporary book I do not know 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.350
 very well what it is about but when I 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.690
 they commented I liked it very much 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.060
 so I really want 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.530
 and it looks a little short but I do not know 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.170
 I'm fooled by the editing and 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.650
 as an addition to this they put on 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.050
 agreement 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.270
 reid and edhasa editorial and they took a 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.250
 sylvia plath glass bell that 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.140
 is a book that is named a lot in this 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.940
 so they're going to go their eyes together 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.650
 first to read this and then this or 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.450
 first of this and then this one I do not know very 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.550
 ok the order but these two books are going 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.490
 to be also I'm going to read black bird of 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.800
 anna carey is a book in second 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.600
 person and that has quite good 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.310
 criticism is about a girl who 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.290
 get up in the middle of the train tracks 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.060
 and he does not know how he got there and nothing for the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.710
 style so I have a lot of desire 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.970
 because it looks a bit of mystery and to me 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.940
 I like books with mysteries 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.300
 also part of my life is the 100 day 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.030
 21 gas morgan the first book does not 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.010
 really liked it was like a transition like 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.810
 a book me so I'm waiting 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.880
 a lot of this second book because 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.010
 the series I love so I want that 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.990
 be good and I would love to be able 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.400
 I love the books as much as I do 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.230
 I grew fond of the series also after 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.440
 be reading in code 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.989
 and this book is about more or less 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.090
 about one about a society that can 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.569
 have a name from the age of 15 and 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.940
 there they choose between being like hunters 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.069
 builders breeders and good looks 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.410
 that the protagonist chooses that is a 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.790
 hunter and well there they are going to start 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.290
 things happen very well I do not know what 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.330
 try when you read it I'll be able to tell you 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.940
 and going to the last two books 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.980
 I will also read reading of mariluz 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.920
 this book is already well known by 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.110
 bust did not arrive Argentina so he arrived 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.110
 a few months ago and well I will have the 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.670
 opportunity to read it I really wanted 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.349
 so well I'm going to pay it and the last 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.200
 most of all I chose it because it is 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.510
 quite short is the presence of franco 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.730
 vaccarini has as a kind of 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.530
 mystery and things like that so he called me 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.359
 enough attention 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.640
 I chose it because it is very short and maybe 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.160
 ande played good this time but has 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.989
