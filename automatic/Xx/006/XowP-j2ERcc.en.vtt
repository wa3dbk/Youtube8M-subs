00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.250

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.300
 good to all welcome to the fake club 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.160
 today we are going to do two rituals 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.619
 taking advantage of what you asked for and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.230
 that are very brief the first one is called 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.330
 baby blue I do not know if you will remember that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.279
 I did in a previous video and I said that 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.769
 there was another way to do it and you have 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.629
 asked to do that other way so 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.739
 I go to it and see what happens 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.739
 until now 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.100
 I am here as you have seen it has not 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.709
 past nothing now let's make the game 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.900
 of the angry that is simply about 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.510
 draw on a paper a star david 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.640
 with some symbols inside you have 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.160
 than to leave it in the place that you want and 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.740
 Going to sleep is supposed to have gone 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.080
 all good the next day will not be 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.780
 to paper and that will mean that you will have 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.270
 traveled to another dimension so I'm going to 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.480
 it to see what happens until 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.480
 now 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.980

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.019
 to 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.620
 I got up this morning and look at the 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.500
 little table but as you can imagine the 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.349
 notebook was still there and I have not noticed anything 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.659
 weird so I would mark it as fake of 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.560
 Anyway I will ask there 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:21.350

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.900

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.680

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.780
