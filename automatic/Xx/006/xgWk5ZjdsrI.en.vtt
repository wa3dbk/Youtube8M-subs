00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.930

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.390
 throw them away or life have the same 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.780

 although although it is in third place 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.050
 can stay in third place and this 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.260

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.409
