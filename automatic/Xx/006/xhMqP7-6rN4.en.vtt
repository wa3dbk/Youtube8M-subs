one on typical you would need to start

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.589 
one on typical you would need to start
without<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> cake<00:00:27.599> ball<00:00:28.730> which<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:30.179> can<00:00:30.390> find

without a cake ball which you can find
the<00:00:30.689> recipe<00:00:31.309> probably<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:33.210> youtube<00:00:34.170> somewhere

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the recipe probably on youtube somewhere

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.430 
the recipe probably on youtube somewhere
or<00:00:34.770> easily<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.820> could<00:00:35.940> type<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.660> find

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
or easily you could type it in and find

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.610 
or easily you could type it in and find
it<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.610> what<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.270> use<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:40.140> start<00:00:40.440> with<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
it so what you do use you start with a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.540 
it so what you do use you start with a
lollipop<00:00:41.489> stick<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.260> I've<00:00:43.260> used<00:00:44.010> candy

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
lollipop stick and I've used candy

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.360 
lollipop stick and I've used candy
wafers<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.180> melted<00:00:45.930> them<00:00:46.050> down<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:47.010> get<00:00:47.129> this

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
wafers and melted them down to get this

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.580 
wafers and melted them down to get this
yellow<00:00:47.789> substance<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
yellow substance and so what you do is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.709 
yellow substance and so what you do is
that<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.579> place<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:53.449> lollipop<00:00:54.449> stick

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
that you place the lollipop stick

covered in melted candy wafer into the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.670 
covered in melted candy wafer into the
cable<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.820> I'm<00:01:00.210> gonna<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.780> start<00:01:01.379> off<00:01:01.500> with

I'll let the excess drip down like

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:20.920 
I'll let the excess drip down like
gravity<00:02:10.880> good<00:02:11.060> job<00:02:16.630> bounce<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.900> out<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.750> most

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
gravity good job bounce it out the most

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.320 
gravity good job bounce it out the most
important<00:02:21.440> thing<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.520> you're<00:02:22.820> making<00:02:23.000> these

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
important thing and you're making these

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.740 
important thing and you're making these
is<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:24.320> let<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.710> drop<00:02:25.580> down<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.210> that<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.510> have

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
is to let it drop down so that you have

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.600 
is to let it drop down so that you have
a<00:02:27.050> smooth<00:02:28.420> flat<00:02:29.420> surface<00:02:29.480> as<00:02:30.410> flatter<00:02:31.070> and

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
a smooth flat surface as flatter and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.990 
a smooth flat surface as flatter and
smooth<00:02:32.209> as<00:02:32.390> possible<00:02:32.540> all<00:02:33.020> around<00:02:34.000> preferably

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
smooth as possible all around preferably

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.910 
smooth as possible all around preferably
on<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.240> top<00:02:35.480> where<00:02:35.900> your<00:02:36.260> stars<00:02:36.530> are<00:02:36.709> going<00:02:36.830> to

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
on the top where your stars are going to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.140 
on the top where your stars are going to
be<00:02:37.010> placed<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:40.250> I'm<00:02:40.310> letting<00:02:40.490> it<00:02:40.640> just<00:02:40.880> drop

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
be placed so I'm letting it just drop

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
be placed so I'm letting it just drop
down<00:02:42.190> make<00:02:43.190> sure<00:02:43.220> all<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.580> sides<00:02:43.790> are<00:02:44.030> nice

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.229 

now<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.200> my<00:02:54.770> stars

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:20.550 

so<00:03:00.629> I<00:03:00.689> did<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> good<00:03:01.109> starter<00:03:01.680> put<00:03:01.859> on

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.750 

and<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.459> doesn't<00:03:21.760> have<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.910> be<00:03:22.090> perfect<00:03:23.010> but

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.990 

yeah<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:29.860> have<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.100> be<00:03:30.190> very<00:03:30.430> careful

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
yeah and you have to be very careful

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.570 
yeah and you have to be very careful
when<00:03:31.990> you<00:03:32.080> put<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.380> stars<00:03:32.650> on<00:03:32.860> because<00:03:33.340> if

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
when you put the stars on because if

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.500 
when you put the stars on because if
your<00:03:33.970> fingers<00:03:34.390> touch<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:36.280> will<00:03:36.580> mess<00:03:37.239> up

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
your fingers touch it it will mess up
