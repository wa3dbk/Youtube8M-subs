it's moving more toward southeast
Mississippi<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.860> would<00:01:53.130> bring<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> up

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
Mississippi that would bring it up

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.410 
Mississippi that would bring it up
around<00:01:53.670> Meridian<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:55.170> could<00:01:55.560> see

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
around Meridian but you could see

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.069 
around Meridian but you could see
hurricane-force<00:01:57.420> winds<00:01:57.659> there<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
hurricane-force winds there is the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.810 
hurricane-force winds there is the
potential<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.619> hurricane-force<00:01:59.070> winds<00:01:59.729> as

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
potential of hurricane-force winds as

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.179 
potential of hurricane-force winds as
far<00:02:00.570> north<00:02:00.600> as<00:02:00.990> Meridian<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.619> maybe<00:02:01.829> even<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
far north as Meridian or maybe even a

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.580 
far north as Meridian or maybe even a

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
little farther north than that so people

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.450 
little farther north than that so people
in<00:02:04.920> our<00:02:05.040> northern<00:02:05.430> viewing<00:02:06.329> area

in our northern viewing area

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.699 
in our northern viewing area
who<00:02:07.580> in<00:02:08.090> some<00:02:08.300> cases<00:02:08.360> saw<00:02:08.990> terrible<00:02:09.530> weather

who in some cases saw terrible weather

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.400 
who in some cases saw terrible weather
out<00:02:09.979> of<00:02:10.130> Ivan<00:02:10.600> realized<00:02:11.600> that<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:12.050> potential

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
out of Ivan realized that that potential

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.860 
out of Ivan realized that that potential
is<00:02:12.680> out<00:02:12.800> there<00:02:13.040> again<00:02:13.640> with<00:02:13.940> hurricane<00:02:14.450> dennis

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
is out there again with hurricane dennis

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.930 
is out there again with hurricane dennis
and<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.500> will<00:02:15.590> likely<00:02:15.860> extend<00:02:16.280> farther

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
and it will likely extend farther

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.940 
and it will likely extend farther
westward<00:02:17.480> as<00:02:17.750> dennis<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.260> not<00:02:18.440> going<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.770> take

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
westward as dennis is not going to take

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.059
