00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.880
 good afternoon dear friends welcome 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.820
 section went to see another see 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.980
 with you the top of which is still 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.680
 still 35 level and I play 53 days this 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.180
 virtual game we have today on 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.300
 hopper triad base 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:43.430
 this is three fish she is not complicated 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:46.130
 detachment and product of a perch and a dog besides 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.320
 2 fish of interest to us such as 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.630
 pillows come out presented on one 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.340
 locations are two shores that is here 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.650
 indicative tournaments we will not be here 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.960
 Of course arrange any because u 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.420
 our discharge is still low enough 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.990
 so that there trophies effectively finish 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.320
 tournaments 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.869
 that is why the task is extremely simple 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.420
 you need to catch 3 credits that is 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.460
 you need to catch a pillow 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.210
 mothers teeth and need to catch 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.970
 perch 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.640
 so we will now build such a bank 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.300
 began we will put 2 corn or 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.409
 there is the meaning of corn fly we put on 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.230
 pillow one we will run on the notch we and 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.530
 we will cook on such a location as two 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.909
 shores 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.220
 registration but this series is very good 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.830
 the tournament for them as you can see very gives 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:43.350
 a lot of money well, here is the location where 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:46.049
 represented our fish is two shores 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.840
 not only that here our test fish 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.369
 there is still a pillow trophies 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.190
 I'll get out just beforehand 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.040
 prepared the nozzle sense changed 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.350
 in advance there is a hole good there well 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.790
 let's try the fly maybe 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.810
 flies to us now quickly work 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.810
 we have a purchase 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.560
 to help 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.250
 it means friends tactics such catch offsets 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.810
 and change the bait to another fish that is 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.980
 we will not be much right on hard 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.210
 I catch some fish right now 1 offset 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.230
 us how you get 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.980
 but this is not credible, and now they will come out 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.220
 offsets then we change will attack us from 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.170
 also not offsets such tactics friends then 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.840
 there is no catcher sent here 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.560
 some weights and direct main itself 3 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.290
 offset on all periods and then just 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.600
 somehow win the podust tournament also 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.350
 you can catch the bread can catch on 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.350
 bloodworm them 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.810
 barley but you can catch it all 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.180
 and cut to the fatal neck on 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.490
 clams on the material too on the worm 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.820
 years but still tired from on small 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.820
 glitter on can pecks slowly bastard 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.800
 it's mountains too 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.080
 no blows nice wonderful and here 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.200
 Now we caught with you tests 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.080
 friends despite the fact that he is there 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.130
 little we leave everything now we 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.130
 paste with you 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.260
 in carving 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.260
 that is, it's another clam 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.799
 and this we put a fatal mistake he too 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.799
 cul but the neck 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.920
 supposedly meat is also my channel 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.830
 here we put 2 pray to and seashells 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.590
 catch the standings 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:53.140
 and only then will a rundown Come 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:55.090
 come on chariots can of course we can here 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.069
 2 Now there is not a science to put 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.790
 here he is 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.760
 here is not a major possible on the cambric he 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.310
 will spit him now take 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.120
 a common tip like a big fee 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:13.920
 she's the most harmless meal after all 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.570
 such a harmless big roach and 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.310
 add there flavoring well here we are 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:26.370
 caught in rezul a test and in principle 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.370
 Now we have to go to such a location as 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.290
 not at all things let's you and me 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.400
 try table unica 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:40.000
 what jade 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:45.070
 but most of his baubles here it is not pour 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.110
 only small small not average well 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.140
 i.e. small he can be 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.140
 but 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.660
 not to hire 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:58.020
 well here and perch we caught both 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:02.610
 rests a little bit what we all three wanted 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.340
 would catch but we need another set off flour and 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.030
 because offset our first to the ridge 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.590
 accurate low i mean they are minimal and 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.550
 Come here, you can not try to worm 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:22.190
 catch did not get tortured other 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:22.190
 Yes, that is, it will not follow this pike 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.560
 no well here his cousin that is, as it were, here 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.860
 we caught 3 credits like 660 grams 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.500
 as a result of the grams and rolled 900 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.699
 I now think of these here this weight 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.550
 on quite enough to win 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:47.520
 now we need to go get drunk and 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:51.479
 return to our location two shores 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.479
 get a quick back 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:57.919
 to throw 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.919
 wait for the end of the tournament 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:05.099
 but as you can see as I said, that is 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.160
 Our 3 tests made the whole tournament 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:10.070
 that is, not necessarily 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.910
 us for some heavy weights important there 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.910
 and 3 credits
