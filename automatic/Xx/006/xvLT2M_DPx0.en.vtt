00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.529
 nine people and welcome to one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.120
 to make more professional food borne today 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.880
 we a pancake cordon bleu very much 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.880
 yummy you also need eggs for flour 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:18.080
 turkey breast or ham cheese 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.359
 champignons 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:31.500
 even more cheese parmesan in the 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:34.530
 case tomatoes happened and when needed 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.830
 but not enough milk 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.540
 Finish fresh parsley first 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.550
 once it falls 10 tablespoon flour in 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.800
 A bowl can be good heaped 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.360
 but do not pay too much attention to it 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 then hit the six eggs if it does 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.780
 the dough should be a bit too thick 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.010
 just give it again in the case 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.260
 so the whole betrays then either 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.670
 by hand like me now with a spatula 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.080
 Or you can do it by hand 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.269
 or with a mixer like her 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.920
 do you want dough must be very fluid 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.290
 be as you see best you give that 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.930
 out of the bowl into a good one 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.430
 heated pan with a little fat olive oil 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.310
 or frying fat as you want 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.080
 I did it with olive oil then 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.090
 you spread the whole a little bit and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.110
 not too long in there, very important 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.090
 that should be a bit golden brown 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.440
 are thus a spatula from time to time 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.170
 Check if you can solve it already 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.870
 the whole animal then again from that of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.320
 the other side still be firm 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.580
 now you can do that 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.370
 brush mushrooms as soon as the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.110
 pancakes are done respecting the 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.430
 mushrooms only with a damp kitchen towel 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.170
 Do not clean under running water 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.120
 because they are like a sponge and suck 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.560
 everything on that makes them very watery 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.350
 cut each case into the pan with it 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.150
 in time while the mushrooms are thinnest 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.390
 can you ever have the eggs of cheese 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.180
 and with ham show just how 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.680
 such a cordon bleu 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.909
 once you have done that the mushrooms 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.680
 should not stay in it too long 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.110
 peter see we cut the mushrooms then 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.820
 take it from the heat and with 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.440
 the parsley do not mix the 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.000
 Parsley still fry for that 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.909
 also takes that over the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.470
 you should never taste flavor spices anyway 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.420
 cook with but only at the end 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.100
 In any case, then give the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.270
 distribute mushroom mass over the pancakes 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:19.080
 that looks really delicious now 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.080
 or then roll up 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.330
 and put in the casserole dish 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.510
 yes, that's what I do with all three 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.210
 I have a little bit here now 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.400
 Tomato paste separated give milk 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.750
 hit like that 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.090
 the whole thing is mulled and on top of that 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.290
 given 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.460
 you can now take everything 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.160
 But the bowl was too small because of that 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.810
 I added that later 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.910
 rest of tomato paste 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.930
 or just the tomato sauce that's yes 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.540
 no market that's a bit 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.340
 then dilute everything to share 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.080
 and I have a whole pack now 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.200
 We do not have to worry about parmesan like that 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.580
 do a lot but parmesan is actually 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.420
 I say one of the best cheese 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.239
 you can use 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.730
 hard cheese grated parmesan das 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.300
 whole is now in the oven at 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.680
 180 degrees about 15 to 20 minutes until the 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.390
 cheese golden brown is that it actually 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.120
 always the currency for such recipes 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.250
 and that's how it all looks like 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.650
 But it does not have to be there 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.540
 you even delicious from well here 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.069
 Do you see the recipe again if you 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.739
 still have notes or prescription ideas 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.000
 always like to comment on it 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.630
 otherwise enjoy cooking and cooking 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.630
 Enjoy your meal
