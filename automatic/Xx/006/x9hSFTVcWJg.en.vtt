00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
from the airport and has created what I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.380 
from the airport and has created what I
think<00:01:07.170> will<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.830> choice<00:01:08.340> area<00:01:08.790> for

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
think will be the choice area for

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.140 
think will be the choice area for
homeowners<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.560> coming<00:01:10.920> years<00:01:11.250> going

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.830 
could put more into it than what we have
planned<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.650> we're<00:02:22.800> interested<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:24.090> very

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
planned but we're interested in a very

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.360 
planned but we're interested in a very
high<00:02:25.020> quality<00:02:26.360> eco-friendly<00:02:27.360> marina

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
high quality eco-friendly marina

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.699 
high quality eco-friendly marina
something<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:30.060> controllable<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.380> we've

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
something that is controllable so we've

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.820 
something that is controllable so we've
limited<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.910> 120<00:02:33.900> slips<00:02:34.260> we<00:02:34.650> could

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
limited it to to 120 slips we could

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.590 
limited it to to 120 slips we could
easily<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.340> twice<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.000> we're<00:02:36.420> not<00:02:36.450> going

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
easily do twice that but we're not going

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.890 
easily do twice that but we're not going
to<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.800> it's<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.459> natural<00:02:38.910> sight<00:02:39.150> as<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.540> said

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
to it's it's a natural sight as I said

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.660 
to it's it's a natural sight as I said
with<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> natural<00:02:40.680> entrance<00:02:41.070> through<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.370> reef

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
with a natural entrance through the reef

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.199 
with a natural entrance through the reef
and<00:02:42.709> just<00:02:43.709> pretty<00:02:43.920> much<00:02:44.100> ideal<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.760> for<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
and just pretty much ideal for for the

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.560 
and just pretty much ideal for for the
purposes<00:02:46.040> mcgoon<00:02:47.040> was<00:02:47.340> pretty<00:02:47.820> much<00:02:48.030> an<00:02:48.239> inert

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
purposes mcgoon was pretty much an inert

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.600 
purposes mcgoon was pretty much an inert
swamp<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.290> would<00:02:49.470> have<00:02:49.650> water<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.310> at<00:02:50.430> high

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
swamp it would have water in it at high

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.130 
swamp it would have water in it at high
tide<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.270> be<00:02:51.989> nearly<00:02:52.350> dry<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:52.950> low<00:02:53.130> tides<00:02:54.140> it

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
tide and be nearly dry in low tides it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.600 
tide and be nearly dry in low tides it
was<00:02:55.410> not<00:02:55.739> very<00:02:55.920> attractive<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:58.110> we

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
was not very attractive and so we

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.850 
was not very attractive and so we
envisioned<00:02:59.610> digging<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.150> out<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.860> making

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
envisioned digging it out and making

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.070 
envisioned digging it out and making
beaches<00:03:02.430> all<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.760> way<00:03:02.910> around<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.870> it's

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
beaches all the way around it and it's

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.030 
beaches all the way around it and it's
turned<00:03:04.350> in<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.709> be<00:03:04.860> one<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.160> our<00:03:05.280> best<00:03:05.519> assets
