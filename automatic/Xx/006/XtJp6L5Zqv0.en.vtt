00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.600 
because I didn't I didn't change my
flaps<00:02:52.329> when<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.630> told<00:02:52.780> me<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.440> now<00:02:54.280> i<00:02:54.310> am

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
flaps when it told me to so now i am

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.630 
flaps when it told me to so now i am
stuck<00:02:55.480> with<00:02:55.690> my<00:02:55.989> takeoff<00:02:56.410> flaps<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.549> it's

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
stuck with my takeoff flaps and it's

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.750 
stuck with my takeoff flaps and it's
kind<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:57.940> annoying<00:02:59.099> because<00:03:00.099> I<00:03:00.400> just<00:03:00.640> gonna

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
kind of annoying because I just gonna

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.870 
kind of annoying because I just gonna
keep<00:03:00.940> like<00:03:01.510> going<00:03:01.810> downward<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.700> I'm<00:03:03.760> gonna

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
keep like going downward so I'm gonna

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.870 
keep like going downward so I'm gonna
point<00:03:04.180> myself<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:06.120> engine<00:03:07.120> overheating<00:03:07.750> okay

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
point myself up engine overheating okay

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.630 
point myself up engine overheating okay
and<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:11.440> don't<00:03:11.920> think<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.130> can<00:03:12.250> get<00:03:12.400> out<00:03:12.519> in<00:03:12.579> the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
and I don't think you can get out in the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.840 
and I don't think you can get out in the
first<00:03:12.880> level<00:03:13.150> but<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.019> think<00:03:14.470> after<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.790> while

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
first level but I think after a while

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.849 
first level but I think after a while
you<00:03:16.120> play<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.480> seal<00:03:16.750> unlock<00:03:17.139> stuff<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.769> you

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
you play the seal unlock stuff and you

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.240 
you play the seal unlock stuff and you
can<00:03:18.010> lock<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.400> fire<00:03:18.790> extinguisher<00:03:19.500> too<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:21.160> if

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
can lock a fire extinguisher too so if

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.680 
can lock a fire extinguisher too so if
you're<00:03:21.340> paying<00:03:21.519> playing<00:03:22.030> catches<00:03:22.359> fire<00:03:22.540> you

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
you're paying playing catches fire you

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.270 
you're paying playing catches fire you
can<00:03:22.810> just<00:03:22.959> put<00:03:23.109> it<00:03:23.230> out<00:03:23.319> which<00:03:23.620> would<00:03:23.799> be

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
can just put it out which would be

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:33.780 
can just put it out which would be
really<00:03:24.579> nice<00:03:24.819> for<00:03:24.880> me<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:32.100> pull<00:03:33.100> up<00:03:33.130> my<00:03:33.310> gears

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
don't know I've never gotten to the

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.780 
don't know I've never gotten to the
second<00:04:14.019> level<00:04:14.139> which<00:04:14.560> hopefully<00:04:15.130> this<00:04:15.430> be<00:04:15.669> my

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
second level which hopefully this be my

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.990 
second level which hopefully this be my
lucky<00:04:16.090> time

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.450 

so<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.229> not<00:04:21.229> too<00:04:21.409> hard<00:04:21.650> once<00:04:21.949> you<00:04:22.039> get<00:04:22.159> used<00:04:22.340> to

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
so I not too hard once you get used to

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.360 
so I not too hard once you get used to
controls<00:04:22.939> and<00:04:23.270> everything<00:04:23.719> but<00:04:24.080> it's<00:04:24.370> pretty

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
controls and everything but it's pretty

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.850 
controls and everything but it's pretty
hard<00:04:25.699> when<00:04:25.909> the<00:04:26.090> first<00:04:26.330> time<00:04:26.599> I've<00:04:27.560> never

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
hard when the first time I've never

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.279 
hard when the first time I've never
actually<00:04:28.159> used<00:04:28.490> space<00:04:28.969> so<00:04:29.419> I<00:04:29.719> can't<00:04:30.020> tell<00:04:30.110> you

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289
