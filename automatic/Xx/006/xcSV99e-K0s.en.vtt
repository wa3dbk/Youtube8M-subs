territory they they make a pop up but
why<00:00:45.780> don't<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.080> make<00:00:46.290> a<00:00:46.350> popper<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.220> do

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
why don't we make a popper that can do

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.300 
why don't we make a popper that can do

both jobs when I first started designing

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.080 
both jobs when I first started designing
this<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.030> was<00:00:51.240> I<00:00:51.540> made<00:00:51.810> the<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.550> face<00:00:53.820> of

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
this it was I made the the the face of

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.850 
this it was I made the the the face of
the<00:00:54.240> law<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.780> an<00:00:54.960> ordinary<00:00:55.200> popper

and<00:02:37.670> get<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.970> lower<00:02:38.120> down<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.600> his<00:02:38.750> face<00:02:39.430> so

what<00:02:40.580> we<00:02:40.730> do<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.209> just<00:02:41.240> wind<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.870> down

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
what we do is we just wind it down

slowly<00:02:42.590> then<00:02:43.040> start<00:02:43.430> flicking<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.970> rod<00:02:44.150> tip

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
slowly then start flicking the rod tip

slowly then start flicking the rod tip
like<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:45.100> constantly<00:02:46.100> taking<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.700> slack<00:02:46.970> up

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209
