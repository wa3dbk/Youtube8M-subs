00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.420
 hello everyone today we will sew 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.300
 uggs for babies for this you must 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.150
 print the pattern link I 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.210
 ladies under the video 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.899
 what size to choose we measure your foot 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.489
 baby and add a couple of centimeters to 

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:30.849
 depending on the thickness of your material 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:35.450
 I advise you to take a natural community 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:38.660
 she is very soft warm and you will get 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:43.720
 excellent result so i am you 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:48.740
 show details for a single boot 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:52.910
 here foot heel holder i don't know 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.400
 do i call this item right but she 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:02.840
 walks behind in purchase meadows if you have 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:06.590
 have they surely seen that here here 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:11.600
 the back comes from ucoz shevchik and this is the front 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.080
 half that 's what 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.220
 we will download sequences 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.500
 for a start we can deal with the connection 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.520
 rear halves 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:30.760
 for this we spend this part 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.760
 this one 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.730
 all seams can be looped i.e. 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.180
 hand stitch seam 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:46.610
 but you can also lay on a typewriter 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.330
 fun in line but if you have the same 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.190
 fabrics 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:56.960
 I have a sheepskin coat and a base 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:02:01.610
 dense and inside here this part can 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.060
 a little pressure on the leg is not a fact but on 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.220
 any case if you use that 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:14.410
 film material is tight then better 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.410
 loop it like this 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:42.620
 I'll build a line on the sewing machine 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:48.549
 for this I cut off the details you can 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.549
 baste or whatever you want 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:52.250
 so we connected the back detail here 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.250
 here the slice can be cut a little more 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.390
 now let's connect the front 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.390
 halves 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.319
 here is this detail 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:10.370
 connect with this here need a small 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:13.650
 When planting but it is nothing to worry as 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.769
 better if you do not use sewing 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:23.060
 the car then again this person should 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:27.180
 to be outside to baby's feet 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:31.970
 I felt perfectly well 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.970
 laying a seam here on a sewing machine 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.380
 here at launch you can cut a little 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.380
 after we connected the parts 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:53.090
 strings need to be cut immediately 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.840
 we will now connect the back half and 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.070
 front half 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.070
 for this 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.889
 we sew the side seam in this way 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.960
 can overlap 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:14.520
 if your soft film fabric can 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.520
 lap like this 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.790
 overlap or so 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:46.440
 so I made the details with overlap served 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:50.940
 villi just connect and 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:54.420
 the other side is if you are here 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:58.130
 do lap with me like the other 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.130
 the sides do exactly the same overlap 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.610
 so we connected 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.610
 the details 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.680
 we just have to solve the last 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:26.949
 part 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:26.949
 as usual, we combine marks 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.920
 and plot the line 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.790
 in the end we get these lags 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.509
 edge 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.509
 and wrapped around 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.040
 I donâ€™t advise to wear such shoes because 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.190
 that all the same 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.690
 the foot should be fixed and if 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:23.320
 this is a child who is just 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.450
 starts walking in the footsteps will 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.160
 deform and this is very bad in 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.820
 these corners are best 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.560
 baby ride in a wheelchair and so on 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:37.590
