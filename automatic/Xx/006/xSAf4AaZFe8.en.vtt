00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 the artist Albert Oehlen is considered 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.720
 one of the most influential painters of the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.760
 contemporary art that's why the house 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.800
 lit 'offers us a tour of 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.639
 his work with the exhibition concepts 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.639
 modern color 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:34.870
 and albert oehlen was born in germany in 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:37.400
 1945 although he lived the neoexpressionism 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.309
 German with other artists in the 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.300
 70s and 80s quickly found a 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.370
 own and unrepeatable language 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.379
 a path that invites us to tear down 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.770
 all our certainties about the 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.770
 painting 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.710
 He is a painter but he does a pretty painting 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.480
 unconventional in the sense that 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.970
 precisely what it claims is 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.330
 build a mechanism through the 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.730
 paint with which they are dismantled 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.380
 gradually but relentlessly 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.150
 ritualized values ​​that 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.490
 traditionally it has been awarded to 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.620
 the painting and show us that painting 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.040
 It also has some new paths for 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.040
 travel 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.160
 this work is a perfect example of 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.290
 period around 2008 where is 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.390
 centered part of the exhibition of the 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.170
 stylistic formal heterodoxy 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.479
 conceptual 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.370
 ultimately visual of the works of 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.680
 albert or he is far from pretending 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.470
 give you chewed and build you a 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.140
 universe completely finished and 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.680
 present it to your eyes not then 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.690
 what he sees rather well is that he 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.009
 leaves the viewer a great 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.160
 responsibility when interpreting 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.430
 what he sees when he sees clearly he wants 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.960
 express something through his works what 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.790
 what happens is that he is convinced that what 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.070
 that the viewer sees in his works 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.690
 expressed have little to do with what 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.690
 he has tried to express previously 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.019
 albert vélez is not an artist with 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.629
 which can talk or structures 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.670
 guilds in the paint neither nor and a 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.379
 work of a certain technique in the 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.049
 study let's leave what is a 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.319
 artist who has a conceptual root 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:40.680
 very strong I would say more than a painter what 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.329
 What it does is compose pictures of a large 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.730
 capacity with some great talent for 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.560
 compose pictures 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.019
 and he invests a lot of time in 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.000
 develop a work he observes a lot 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.260
 think about it I would even say 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.269
 that meditates and then good then the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.840
 intervenes and ex works but very 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.879
 experimental what speaks 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.310
 more than follow an evolution in a 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.310
 temporary and conceptual sense convinced 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.730
 this 1994 work exemplifies very well 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.659
 how he develops how his work evolves 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.180
 from the figuration of the 80s to 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:20.780
 the abstraction and the combination of 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.099
 heterogeneous and heterodox colors that we 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.099
 pose after 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.490
 albert has and manifests an admiration 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:40.140
 very deep and very sincere gives by the 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:43.170
 work of Andy warhol even boasts 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.900
 in quotes to be jealous of him or 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.520
 have professional envy because he knows 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.010
 with the path he has taken he will never be able 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.170
 have the popularity or I repeat that 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.640
 social impact that warhol had not us 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.190
 let's forget that Albert is a disciple of 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.960
 sigmar polke you know and it comes from that 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.180
 heritage of hamburg from that art of the 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.290
 70's then his his way of 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.620
 assimilate 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.390
 advertising is very different than that 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.170
 American capitalist world in the state 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.170
 described warhol 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.859
 if he 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.000
 this time of year 2012 by albert oehlen 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:26.210
 is an example of how albert oehlen has 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.460
 taken to the limit the fact of 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.270
 free the drawing to the practice of 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.930
 drawing of your usual functions 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.930
 do not
