this lately and I loved it so much I had

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.990 
this lately and I loved it so much I had
to<00:01:01.530> go<00:01:01.710> buy<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.920> big<00:01:02.310> bottle<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:02.790> i<00:01:02.880> was

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
to go buy the big bottle because i was

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.870 
to go buy the big bottle because i was
using<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.390> little<00:01:03.630> sample<00:01:04.079> size<00:01:04.259> and<00:01:04.880> it

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
using the little sample size and it

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.399 
using the little sample size and it
feels<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.360> much<00:01:06.509> like<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> condition<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.260> me
