the plants are doing here are the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.320 
the plants are doing here are the
various<00:00:21.689> lettuce<00:00:22.289> varieties<00:00:23.180> ranging<00:00:24.180> from

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
various lettuce varieties ranging from

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.040 
various lettuce varieties ranging from
arugula<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.670> different<00:00:26.670> mixes<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.510> lettuces

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
arugula and different mixes of lettuces

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.139 
arugula and different mixes of lettuces
and<00:00:28.429> then<00:00:29.429> some<00:00:29.699> larger<00:00:30.210> romaine<00:00:30.990> lettuce<00:00:32.149> all

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149

and then some larger romaine lettuce all
down<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.739> back<00:00:34.950> run<00:00:35.309> again<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.390> snow

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
down the back run again we have snow

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.860 
down the back run again we have snow
peas<00:00:37.079> as<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.829> said<00:00:38.100> before<00:00:38.600> now<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.809> is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
peas as I said before now this is

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.990 
peas as I said before now this is
progress<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:41.719> should<00:00:42.719> mention<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:44.000> we

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
progress I should mention that we

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.790 
progress I should mention that we
haven't<00:00:45.329> really<00:00:45.510> added<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> fish<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
haven't really added the fish to the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.000 
haven't really added the fish to the
system<00:00:47.430> yet<00:00:47.640> we've<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.870> been<00:00:49.170> cycling<00:00:49.559> it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
system yet we've just been cycling it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.180 
system yet we've just been cycling it
and<00:00:50.690> getting<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> bacterial<00:00:52.379> colonies<00:00:52.890> built

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and getting the bacterial colonies built

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.240 
and getting the bacterial colonies built
up<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.610> now<00:00:54.360> day<00:00:54.660> 14<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.530> that's<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.800> two

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
up and so now day 14 so that's just two

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.430 
up and so now day 14 so that's just two
weeks<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.930> bacteria<00:00:58.320> are<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.809> water<00:01:00.809> testing

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
weeks the bacteria are in water testing

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.390 
weeks the bacteria are in water testing
today<00:01:01.789> showed<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:04.040> ammonia<00:01:05.040> levels

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
today showed that the ammonia levels

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.060 
today showed that the ammonia levels
were<00:01:05.610> down<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.030> zero<00:01:06.270> meaning<00:01:07.049> bacteria<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
were down to zero meaning bacteria is

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.960 
were down to zero meaning bacteria is
eating<00:01:09.030> everything<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.659> being<00:01:10.080> fed<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
eating everything it's being fed the

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.130 
eating everything it's being fed the
nitrite<00:01:11.970> levels<00:01:12.000> are<00:01:12.510> down<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> zero<00:01:13.049> so

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
nitrite levels are down to zero so

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.980 
nitrite levels are down to zero so
second<00:01:13.979> bacterial<00:01:14.790> colony<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
second bacterial colony is in and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.490 
second bacterial colony is in and
consuming<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> nitrites<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.729> nitrates

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
consuming the nitrites and nitrates

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.200 
consuming the nitrites and nitrates
levels<00:01:19.500> which<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> plants<00:01:20.700> consume

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
levels which is what the plants consume

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.570 
levels which is what the plants consume
are<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.110> 40<00:01:22.650> parts<00:01:22.950> per<00:01:23.159> million<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
are up to 40 parts per million and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.230 
are up to 40 parts per million and
climbing<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.409> time<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.970> load<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
climbing so it's now time to load the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.890 
climbing so it's now time to load the
system<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.049> fish<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:29.689> because<00:01:30.689> now<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
system with the fish and because now the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.399 
system with the fish and because now the
plants<00:01:31.500> are<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.820> consuming<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> bacteria

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
plants are in and consuming the bacteria

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.270 
plants are in and consuming the bacteria
are<00:01:34.530> transforming<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.700> ammonia<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
are transforming the ammonia and so the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.990 
are transforming the ammonia and so the
plants<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.909> cleanse<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:40.520> water<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
plants can cleanse the water for the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.530 
plants can cleanse the water for the
fish<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.590> now<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.890> those<00:01:44.670> colonies<00:01:45.240> are<00:01:45.390> in

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
fish so now that those colonies are in

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.060 
fish so now that those colonies are in
the<00:01:45.720> fish<00:01:45.899> are<00:01:46.079> hopefully<00:01:46.590> coming<00:01:46.829> in

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the fish are hopefully coming in

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.359 
the fish are hopefully coming in
tomorrow<00:01:48.049> at<00:01:49.049> least<00:01:49.229> some<00:01:49.740> if<00:01:49.920> not<00:01:49.950> all<00:01:50.159> of

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
tomorrow at least some if not all of

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.810 
tomorrow at least some if not all of
them<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:52.229> show<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.950> growth<00:01:53.869> here<00:01:54.869> are<00:01:55.820> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
them to show you the growth here are the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.160 
them to show you the growth here are the
onions<00:01:57.180> they're<00:01:57.890> getting<00:01:58.890> larger<00:02:00.170> definitely

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
onions they're getting larger definitely

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.749 
onions they're getting larger definitely
larger<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.670> bok<00:02:02.909> choy<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.329> taking<00:02:04.140> off<00:02:04.759> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
larger the bok choy is taking off the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.410 
larger the bok choy is taking off the
kale<00:02:06.329> red<00:02:07.229> Russian<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.039> winter<00:02:08.399> boar<00:02:08.670> are

kale red Russian and winter boar are

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.610 
kale red Russian and winter boar are
still<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> bit<00:02:10.470> slow

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
still a bit slow

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.320 
still a bit slow
the<00:02:13.870> napa<00:02:14.870> cabbage<00:02:15.470> are<00:02:16.099> really<00:02:16.760> taking<00:02:17.000> off

the napa cabbage are really taking off

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.330 
the napa cabbage are really taking off
look<00:02:17.720> at<00:02:17.900> these<00:02:18.140> guys<00:02:18.730> they're<00:02:19.730> doing<00:02:20.120> great

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
look at these guys they're doing great

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.300 
look at these guys they're doing great
and<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:23.659> broccoli<00:02:24.379> starts<00:02:24.860> are<00:02:25.640> just<00:02:27.310> jumping

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
and the broccoli starts are just jumping

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.319 
and the broccoli starts are just jumping
up<00:02:28.870> quite<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> bit<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.349> growth<00:02:30.980> since<00:02:31.610> last<00:02:31.970> week

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
up quite a bit of growth since last week

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.160 
up quite a bit of growth since last week
and<00:02:32.890> over<00:02:33.890> here<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.879> wicking<00:02:35.269> bin<00:02:35.450> it's

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
and over here in the wicking bin it's

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.080 
and over here in the wicking bin it's
working<00:02:36.349> great<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:37.849> top<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:39.489> soil<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:41.060> dry

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
working great the top of the soil is dry

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.780 
working great the top of the soil is dry
and<00:02:41.930> about<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.590> half<00:02:42.920> an<00:02:43.159> inch<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.459> an<00:02:43.670> inch

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.559 
and about a half an inch to an inch
under<00:02:44.299> it<00:02:44.420> it's<00:02:44.690> all<00:02:44.930> moist<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.970> again<00:02:46.970> you

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
under it it's all moist and again you

under it it's all moist and again you
can<00:02:47.599> see<00:02:47.780> here<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.560> rock<00:02:48.769> is<00:02:49.269> damp<00:02:50.269> because<00:02:50.690> it

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
can see here the rock is damp because it

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.339 
can see here the rock is damp because it
just<00:02:50.989> finished<00:02:51.349> fully<00:02:52.220> filling<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.879> so<00:02:53.660> the

just finished fully filling and so the

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.399 
just finished fully filling and so the
water<00:02:54.590> comes<00:02:54.980> up<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.849> above<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.810> bottom<00:02:57.019> of
