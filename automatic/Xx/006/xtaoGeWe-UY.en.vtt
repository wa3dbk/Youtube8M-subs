the<00:02:24.300> pregnancy<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.050> think<00:02:25.530> my<00:02:25.680> 13<00:02:26.250> week

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
the pregnancy I think my 13 week

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.040 
the pregnancy I think my 13 week
ultrasound<00:02:26.790> looked<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.540> coolest<00:02:27.900> just

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
ultrasound looked the coolest just

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.380 
ultrasound looked the coolest just
because<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.410> can<00:02:28.560> see<00:02:28.920> everything<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:30.239> there
