00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
run at 30 frames per second was kind of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.690 
run at 30 frames per second was kind of
a<00:00:30.689> deal<00:00:30.840> breaker<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.230> me<00:00:31.439> plus<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.460> just

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
a deal breaker for me plus it's just

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.620 
a deal breaker for me plus it's just
enough<00:00:32.940> skills<00:00:33.500> 792<00:00:34.500> p<00:00:34.860> i<00:00:35.070> think<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.520> was<00:00:35.670> what

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
enough skills 792 p i think it was what

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.610 
enough skills 792 p i think it was what
a<00:00:36.660> weird<00:00:37.079> number<00:00:37.290> anyway<00:00:38.030> 792<00:00:39.030> p<00:00:39.390> which<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.530> be

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
a weird number anyway 792 p which to be

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.380 
a weird number anyway 792 p which to be
honest<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.129> really<00:00:41.670> not<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:41.969> bad<00:00:42.000> as<00:00:42.149> you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
honest it's really not as bad as you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.270 
honest it's really not as bad as you
think<00:00:42.570> i<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:43.170> probably<00:00:43.379> deal<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.920> i<00:00:44.070> love

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
think i can probably deal that i love

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.000 
think i can probably deal that i love
ghost<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.820> was<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.059> 720p<00:00:45.750> upscaled

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
ghost and that was just 720p upscaled

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.500 
ghost and that was just 720p upscaled
but<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:47.250> i<00:00:47.370> said<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.910> deal<00:00:48.090> breaker<00:00:48.329> is

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
but like i said the deal breaker is

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
but like i said the deal breaker is
definitely<00:00:48.989> with<00:00:49.110> 30<00:00:49.379> frames<00:00:49.680> per<00:00:49.800> second<00:00:50.340> i

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
definitely with 30 frames per second i

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.000 
definitely with 30 frames per second i
want<00:00:50.700> 60<00:00:51.210> at<00:00:51.420> least<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.739> makes<00:00:52.920> me

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
want 60 at least that just makes me

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.950 
want 60 at least that just makes me
think<00:00:53.100> how<00:00:53.430> are<00:00:53.879> these<00:00:54.059> next-gen<00:00:54.510> consoles

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
think how are these next-gen consoles

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.450 
think how are these next-gen consoles
not<00:00:55.140> even<00:00:55.350> able<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.739> play<00:00:55.890> these<00:00:56.070> current

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
not even able to play these current

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.479 
not even able to play these current
games<00:00:56.699> at<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> decent<00:00:57.629> framerate<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.440> mean<00:00:59.039> even

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
games at a decent framerate I mean even

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.729 
games at a decent framerate I mean even
a<00:00:59.879> budget<00:01:00.270> PC<00:01:00.449> gamer<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:01.170> play<00:01:01.379> these<00:01:01.530> games

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
a budget PC gamer can play these games

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.799 
a budget PC gamer can play these games
on<00:01:01.949> better<00:01:02.160> quality<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> think<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
on better quality when I think of the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.750 
on better quality when I think of the
words<00:01:04.019> next-gen<00:01:04.739> I'm<00:01:05.010> thinking<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.670> going

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
words next-gen I'm thinking it's going

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.719 
words next-gen I'm thinking it's going
to<00:01:05.820> be<00:01:05.970> at<00:01:06.060> least<00:01:06.200> 1080p<00:01:07.200> right<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.770> 60<00:01:08.700> frames

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
to be at least 1080p right at 60 frames

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.899 
to be at least 1080p right at 60 frames
per<00:01:09.060> second<00:01:09.570> minimum<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.950> no<00:01:11.159> I'm<00:01:11.430> looking<00:01:11.790> at

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
per second minimum but no I'm looking at

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.840 
per second minimum but no I'm looking at
720p<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.990> some<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.409> these<00:01:13.500> games<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.610> can't

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
720p on some of these games and I can't

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.460 
720p on some of these games and I can't
speak<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.060> every<00:01:15.420> game<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:15.840> some<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.409> them

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
speak for every game but some of them

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.190 
speak for every game but some of them
even<00:01:16.680> still<00:01:17.250> give<00:01:17.430> me<00:01:17.580> frame<00:01:17.820> drops<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.990> yeah

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
even still give me frame drops so yeah

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.690 
even still give me frame drops so yeah
I'm<00:01:19.500> gonna<00:01:19.680> be<00:01:19.770> honest<00:01:20.159> I'm<00:01:20.280> not<00:01:20.310> exactly

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
I'm gonna be honest I'm not exactly

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.149 
I'm gonna be honest I'm not exactly
happy<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.360> xbox<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:21.900> right<00:01:22.080> now<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.560> I

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
happy with the xbox one right now and I

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.440 
happy with the xbox one right now and I
know<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.490> supposedly<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.330> better

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
know it's supposedly going to get better

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300 
know it's supposedly going to get better
when<00:01:24.750> developers<00:01:25.320> learn<00:01:25.590> how<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> maximize

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
when developers learn how to maximize

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.149 
when developers learn how to maximize
the<00:01:26.460> consoles<00:01:26.880> potential<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.470> how<00:01:28.890> long<00:01:29.100> is

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the consoles potential but how long is

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.280 
the consoles potential but how long is
that<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.670> take<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.150> exactly<00:01:30.810> how<00:01:31.140> much

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that going to take and exactly how much

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.410 
that going to take and exactly how much
better<00:01:31.470> would<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.130> once<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.000> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
better would be once they do that I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.020 
better would be once they do that I
really<00:01:34.110> don't<00:01:34.320> know<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.799> I'm<00:01:35.670> trying<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
really don't know and I'm trying to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.460 
really don't know and I'm trying to
figure<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.360> why<00:01:36.540> can't<00:01:36.750> these<00:01:36.840> games<00:01:37.110> play<00:01:37.350> at

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
figure out why can't these games play at

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.560 
figure out why can't these games play at
a<00:01:37.560> better<00:01:37.740> frame<00:01:38.159> rate<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.579> at<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> good

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
a better frame rate and at a good

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.660 
a better frame rate and at a good
resolution<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:41.189> only<00:01:41.310> thing<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.610> can

don't<00:01:48.540> know<00:01:48.659> exactly<00:01:48.990> what<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.500> i'll

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
don't know exactly what that is i'll

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.139 
don't know exactly what that is i'll
give<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.159> quick<00:01:50.430> low<00:01:50.610> rundown<00:01:50.970> on

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
give you a little quick low rundown on

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.870 
give you a little quick low rundown on
how<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.540> works<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.310> all<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> previous

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
how this works so for all the previous

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.880 
how this works so for all the previous
councils<00:01:54.360> microsoft<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.320> sony<00:01:55.500> would<00:01:55.710> both

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
councils microsoft and sony would both

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.560 
councils microsoft and sony would both
sell<00:01:56.219> their<00:01:56.369> console<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.969> cheaper<00:01:57.329> price

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
sell their console for cheaper price

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.630 
sell their console for cheaper price
then<00:01:57.990> how<00:01:58.500> much<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.829> actually<00:01:58.950> cost<00:01:59.340> me<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
then how much it actually cost me the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880 
then how much it actually cost me the
building<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.570> they<00:02:00.810> actually<00:02:00.930> lost<00:02:01.439> money<00:02:01.740> on

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
building so they actually lost money on

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.010 
building so they actually lost money on
every<00:02:02.280> console<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:02.909> sold<00:02:03.180> usually<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> little

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
every console they sold usually a little

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.149 
every console they sold usually a little
bit<00:02:04.200> over<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.469> hundred<00:02:04.649> bucks<00:02:04.829> or<00:02:05.040> something

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
bit over a hundred bucks or something

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.370 
bit over a hundred bucks or something
then<00:02:06.119> they'd<00:02:06.299> make<00:02:06.509> all<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.750> money<00:02:06.930> back<00:02:07.140> on

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
then they'd make all that money back on

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.380 
then they'd make all that money back on
the<00:02:07.619> game<00:02:07.799> sales<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.399> publishing<00:02:08.879> rights<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
of course things like the xbox live

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.309 
of course things like the xbox live
subscriptions<00:02:11.910> which<00:02:12.599> by<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.900> way<00:02:13.020> did<00:02:13.260> you

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
subscriptions which by the way did you

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.910 
subscriptions which by the way did you
know<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.709> there

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
know that there

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.330 
know that there
over<00:02:14.250> 48<00:02:14.910> million<00:02:15.300> Xbox<00:02:16.260> Live<00:02:16.500> subscribers

over 48 million Xbox Live subscribers
right<00:02:17.610> now<00:02:17.790> yeah<00:02:18.450> that's<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.470> lot<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.620> money<00:02:20.180> but

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
right now yeah that's a lot of money but

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.479 
right now yeah that's a lot of money but
anyways<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.230> instead<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:22.800> giving<00:02:23.040> us<00:02:23.280> better

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
anyways so instead of giving us better

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.670 
anyways so instead of giving us better
components<00:02:24.060> like<00:02:24.239> they<00:02:24.390> usually<00:02:24.569> do<00:02:24.930> they

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
components like they usually do they

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.470 
components like they usually do they
just<00:02:26.010> kind<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.430> skimped<00:02:26.849> on<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.970> couple<00:02:27.330> things

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
just kind of skimped on a couple things

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.470 
just kind of skimped on a couple things
more<00:02:28.380> notably<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.099> GPU<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.849> graphics<00:02:30.209> card

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
more notably the GPU the graphics card

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.780 
more notably the GPU the graphics card
now<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.350> GP<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:31.980> they<00:02:32.130> chose<00:02:32.370> for<00:02:32.700> these

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
now the GP that they chose for these

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.940 
now the GP that they chose for these
next-gen<00:02:33.209> consoles<00:02:33.690> are<00:02:33.870> kind<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.530> on<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.709> low

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
next-gen consoles are kind of on the low

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.010 
next-gen consoles are kind of on the low
end<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.220> graphics<00:02:35.640> cards<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.750> can<00:02:36.840> buy<00:02:36.989> a

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
end of graphics cards you can buy a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.050 
end of graphics cards you can buy a
better<00:02:37.200> card<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.709> your<00:02:37.770> pc<00:02:38.160> for<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.610> 100

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
better card for your pc for like 100

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.570 
better card for your pc for like 100
bucks<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.140> guess<00:02:40.650> what<00:02:40.830> I'm<00:02:40.950> saying<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.340> I

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
bucks so I guess what I'm saying is I

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.430 
bucks so I guess what I'm saying is I
wish<00:02:42.000> he<00:02:42.180> kept<00:02:42.360> with<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.510> loss<00:02:42.780> leader<00:02:43.110> thing

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
wish he kept with the loss leader thing

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.650 
wish he kept with the loss leader thing
and<00:02:43.680> they<00:02:44.130> just<00:02:44.310> included<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.910> better<00:02:45.090> GPU<00:02:45.510> in

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
and they just included a better GPU in

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.090 
and they just included a better GPU in
the<00:02:45.720> console<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.500> would<00:02:46.680> have<00:02:46.709> made<00:02:46.920> it

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the console and that would have made it

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.309 
the console and that would have made it
so<00:02:47.400> much<00:02:47.430> better<00:02:47.670> we'd<00:02:48.630> be<00:02:48.750> playing<00:02:48.930> all<00:02:49.200> of

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
so much better we'd be playing all of

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.320 
so much better we'd be playing all of
our<00:02:49.440> games<00:02:49.560> at<00:02:49.800> 1080p<00:02:49.950> with<00:02:50.700> better<00:02:51.000> frame

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
our games at 1080p with better frame

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.750 
our games at 1080p with better frame
rates<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:51.870> better<00:02:52.290> graphics<00:02:52.830> but<00:02:53.400> instead

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
rates and better graphics but instead

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.240 
rates and better graphics but instead
they<00:02:54.239> took<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.569> cheaper<00:02:54.870> route<00:02:55.100> so<00:02:56.100> that's

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
they took the cheaper route so that's

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.130 
they took the cheaper route so that's
why<00:02:56.400> I'm<00:02:56.489> just<00:02:56.730> not<00:02:57.090> really<00:02:57.390> impressed<00:02:57.900> with

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
why I'm just not really impressed with

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.660 
why I'm just not really impressed with
what<00:02:58.319> I'm<00:02:58.440> seeing<00:02:58.470> these<00:02:59.010> consoles<00:02:59.489> could

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
what I'm seeing these consoles could

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.580 
what I'm seeing these consoles could
have<00:02:59.760> been<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.209> great<00:03:00.569> but<00:03:01.049> I<00:03:01.110> think<00:03:01.380> they<00:03:01.470> both

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
have been so great but I think they both

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.949 
have been so great but I think they both
dropped<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.220> ball<00:03:02.370> for<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.360> little<00:03:03.569> bit<00:03:03.810> of

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
dropped the ball for a little bit of

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.350 
dropped the ball for a little bit of
extra<00:03:04.319> money<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:05.030> considering<00:03:06.030> all<00:03:06.150> this

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
extra money so considering all this

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.390 
extra money so considering all this
here's<00:03:06.720> what<00:03:06.900> i<00:03:06.930> did<00:03:07.170> i<00:03:07.350> went<00:03:08.010> ahead<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.220> i

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
here's what i did i went ahead and i

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.039 
here's what i did i went ahead and i
bought<00:03:08.580> some<00:03:08.640> pc<00:03:09.120> components<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.720> upgrade<00:03:10.019> my

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
bought some pc components to upgrade my

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.530 
bought some pc components to upgrade my
old<00:03:10.380> computer<00:03:10.620> actually<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.700> bought<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.090> pretty

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
old computer actually I bought a pretty

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.990 
old computer actually I bought a pretty
nice<00:03:12.720> graphics<00:03:13.260> card<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.769> mean<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.580> needed<00:03:14.880> it

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
nice graphics card I mean it needed it

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.570 
nice graphics card I mean it needed it
anyway<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.870> think<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.470> had<00:03:16.590> like<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:16.830> GTS

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
anyway is it I think it had like a GTS
