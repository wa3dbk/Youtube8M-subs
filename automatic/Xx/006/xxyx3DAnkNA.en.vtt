kind of took a deep breath and a big

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.450 
kind of took a deep breath and a big
little<00:01:15.200> practice<00:01:15.500> kick<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:15.950> then<00:01:16.009> went<00:01:16.369> out

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.030 
nervous cuz I don't know for some reason
I<00:01:32.180> was<00:01:32.270> just<00:01:32.299> like<00:01:32.600> no<00:01:33.439> it's<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:33.590> long<00:01:33.770> field

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
didn't really feel that much pressure on

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.100 
didn't really feel that much pressure on
the<00:01:37.850> kick<00:01:38.000> for<00:01:38.119> some<00:01:38.270> reason<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:38.659> was<00:01:38.810> just<00:01:38.930> kind

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
the kick for some reason I was just kind

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.029

of<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.289> zone<00:01:39.469> and<00:01:39.740> then<00:01:39.829> when<00:01:39.950> he<00:01:40.009> actually

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
of in a zone and then when he actually

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.529 
of in a zone and then when he actually
call<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.490> time<00:01:40.670> out<00:01:40.789> I<00:01:40.850> was<00:01:41.060> like<00:01:41.240> oh<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.479> just

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
call the time out I was like oh I just

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.450 
call the time out I was like oh I just
wish<00:01:41.869> I<00:01:41.990> could<00:01:42.140> have<00:01:42.229> kicked<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:42.619> but<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:43.100> don't

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
wish I could have kicked it but I don't

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.649 
wish I could have kicked it but I don't
know<00:01:43.549> I<00:01:43.579> think<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.789> timeout<00:01:44.090> helped<00:01:44.390> I<00:01:44.450> kind

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
know I think the timeout helped I kind

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.630 
know I think the timeout helped I kind
of<00:01:44.689> feel<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.710> little<00:01:45.890> practice<00:01:46.159> kick<00:01:46.369> got<00:01:46.610> a

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
of feel a little practice kick got a

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.710 
of feel a little practice kick got a
little<00:01:46.909> more<00:01:47.509> practice<00:01:47.869> in<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.079> in

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
little more practice in it in

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.750 
little more practice in it in
all<00:01:49.320> right<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.740> kick<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.190> right<00:01:50.370> when<00:01:50.730> it

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
all right so you kick it right when it

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.180 
all right so you kick it right when it
leaves<00:01:50.970> your<00:01:51.210> foot<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:51.990> did<00:01:52.080> you<00:01:52.170> think<00:01:52.350> when

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
leaves your foot what did you think when

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.920 
leaves your foot what did you think when
I<00:01:53.250> hit<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.730> knew<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.910> didn't<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.540> know<00:01:54.630> I

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
I hit it I knew I didn't you know I

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.840 
I hit it I knew I didn't you know I
guess<00:01:55.650> I'm<00:01:55.800> keeping<00:01:56.130> germs<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.430> didn't<00:01:56.610> crush

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
guess I'm keeping germs I didn't crush

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.460 
guess I'm keeping germs I didn't crush
it<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.480> know<00:01:57.870> I<00:01:57.960> had<00:01:58.080> a<00:01:58.110> little<00:01:58.230> breeze

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
it but I know I had a little breeze

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.530 
it but I know I had a little breeze
behind<00:01:58.710> me<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.790> told<00:02:00.060> myself<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.390> know

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
behind me so I just told myself you know

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.910 
behind me so I just told myself you know
don't<00:02:00.750> try<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.900> over<00:02:01.230> kick<00:02:01.410> it<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.620> stick<00:02:01.800> it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
don't try to over kick it to stick it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.590 
don't try to over kick it to stick it
straight<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.430> then<00:02:02.970> hopefully<00:02:03.150> it'll<00:02:03.420> go

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
straight and then hopefully it'll go

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.000 
straight and then hopefully it'll go
right<00:02:03.870> through<00:02:04.050> and<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.320> when<00:02:04.470> I<00:02:04.500> looked<00:02:04.710> up<00:02:04.860> I

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
right through and so when I looked up I

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.140 
right through and so when I looked up I
saw<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.220> balls<00:02:05.430> won't<00:02:05.580> straight<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.030> was

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
saw the balls won't straight and I was

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.120 
saw the balls won't straight and I was
like<00:02:06.300> okay<00:02:06.900> as<00:02:07.050> long<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.560> makes<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.770> distance

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
like okay as long as it makes a distance

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.710 
like okay as long as it makes a distance
it'll<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.369> good<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.850> did<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.270> think<00:02:09.300> was<00:02:09.630> there

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
you thought oh no this might not make it
