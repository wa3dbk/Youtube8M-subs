rust-oleum camouflage that is a flat
type<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.579> paint<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.239> would<00:02:45.959> do<00:02:46.110> two<00:02:46.410> coats<00:02:46.650> of

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
type of paint I would do two coats of

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.030 
type of paint I would do two coats of
clear<00:02:46.980> coat<00:02:47.280> one<00:02:47.940> co<00:02:48.150> 2<00:02:48.209> tan<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.930> then<00:02:49.739> my

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
clear coat one co 2 tan and then my

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.789 
clear coat one co 2 tan and then my

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
streaks of brown and OD and then I did

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.800 
streaks of brown and OD and then I did
two<00:02:52.980> more<00:02:53.160> coats<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.549> clear<00:02:53.640> coat<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.420> result

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
two more coats of clear coat the result

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.020 
two more coats of clear coat the result
of<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:54.930> was<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.319> very<00:02:55.890> smooth<00:02:56.430> really<00:02:56.879> nice

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
of that was a very smooth really nice

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.509 
of that was a very smooth really nice
finish<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.260> finish<00:02:58.410> itself<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.129> almost

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
finish and the finish itself is almost

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.699 
finish and the finish itself is almost
you<00:03:00.030> know<00:03:00.180> as<00:03:00.420> smooth<00:03:00.840> as<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.110> original

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
you know as smooth as the original

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.289 
you know as smooth as the original
finish<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.549> that's<00:03:02.730> what<00:03:02.940> we're<00:03:03.090> always

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
finish so that's what we're always

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.229 
finish so that's what we're always
trying<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.840> go<00:03:03.959> for<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:04.709> then<00:03:05.090> going<00:03:06.090> into

trying to go for you and then going into
some<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:06.720> imperfections<00:03:07.379> at<00:03:07.590> since<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.280> did

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
some of the imperfections at since I did

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.210 
some of the imperfections at since I did
do<00:03:08.640> clear<00:03:08.940> coats<00:03:09.120> over<00:03:09.720> these<00:03:10.500> imperfections

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
do clear coats over these imperfections

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.640 
do clear coats over these imperfections
it<00:03:11.700> actually<00:03:12.269> gives<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.870> really<00:03:13.109> nice<00:03:13.380> like

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
it actually gives it a really nice like

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.629 
it actually gives it a really nice like
a<00:03:13.889> battle-torn<00:03:14.609> feel<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.900> gun<00:03:16.079> so<00:03:16.920> those

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
a battle-torn feel to the gun so those

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.819 
a battle-torn feel to the gun so those
are<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.880> only<00:03:18.090> two<00:03:18.389> spots<00:03:18.569> that<00:03:19.079> smudge<00:03:19.530> and

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
are the only two spots that smudge and

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.860 
are the only two spots that smudge and
that<00:03:20.280> smudge<00:03:20.579> and<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.850> resulted<00:03:21.329> from<00:03:21.569> me

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
that smudge and that resulted from me

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.789 
that smudge and that resulted from me
touching<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:23.190> gun<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:23.609> my<00:03:23.790> fingertips<00:03:24.440> so

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.830 

moving<00:03:28.799> on<00:03:29.069> from<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:29.880> also<00:03:30.389> didn't<00:03:30.750> pay

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
moving on from that I also didn't pay

the one on the other side they kind of

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.339 
the one on the other side they kind of
stick<00:03:44.700> out<00:03:44.819> from<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.090> pump<00:03:45.359> cut<00:03:45.959> this<00:03:46.109> off

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
stick out from the pump cut this off

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.809 
stick out from the pump cut this off
just<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.709> make<00:03:46.829> it<00:03:46.859> easier<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.250> put<00:03:47.489> into<00:03:47.639> the

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
shotgun just to make it a whole lot

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.080 
shotgun just to make it a whole lot
easier<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.739> clear<00:03:58.739> coat<00:03:59.099> your<00:03:59.400> pump<00:03:59.760> I

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
easier is to clear coat your pump I

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.690 
easier is to clear coat your pump I
didn't<00:04:01.079> just<00:04:01.260> do<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.859> did<00:04:02.099> two<00:04:02.310> coats<00:04:02.519> of

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
didn't just do that I did two coats of

didn't just do that I did two coats of
clear<00:04:02.819> coat<00:04:03.090> pretty<00:04:03.419> much<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.690> same<00:04:03.900> method<00:04:04.260> I

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
clear coat pretty much the same method I

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.870 
clear coat pretty much the same method I
did<00:04:04.530> for<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.769> rest<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.130> gun<00:04:05.280> for<00:04:05.519> painting

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
did for the rest of the gun for painting

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.990 
did for the rest of the gun for painting
two<00:04:06.599> coats<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:06.959> clear<00:04:07.109> coat<00:04:07.579> two<00:04:08.579> coats<00:04:08.849> of

two coats of clear coat two coats of
black<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.660> then<00:04:10.530> two<00:04:10.799> more<00:04:10.950> coats<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.370> clear

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
black and then two more coats of clear

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.229 
black and then two more coats of clear
coat<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.329> result<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.160> very<00:04:14.160> very<00:04:14.700> smooth

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
coat the result is a very very smooth

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.409 
coat the result is a very very smooth
finish<00:04:15.599> and<00:04:16.190> I<00:04:17.190> did<00:04:17.549> have<00:04:17.729> one<00:04:18.030> like

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
finish and I did have one like

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.819 
finish and I did have one like
fingerprint<00:04:19.049> mark<00:04:19.229> there<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:19.440> can<00:04:19.590> probably

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
fingerprint mark there you can probably

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:20.910 
fingerprint mark there you can probably
see<00:04:19.979> it

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
see it

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.470 
see it
right<00:04:21.070> there<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:21.490> do<00:04:21.760> have<00:04:21.970> that<00:04:22.120> one<00:04:22.300> like

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
right there I do have that one like

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.900 
right there I do have that one like
fingerprint<00:04:23.080> smudge<00:04:23.380> but<00:04:24.010> besides<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.580> I

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
fingerprint smudge but besides that I

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.240 
fingerprint smudge but besides that I
mean<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.270> grip<00:04:25.540> is<00:04:25.690> extremely<00:04:26.590> smooth<00:04:26.890> just

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
mean the grip is extremely smooth just

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.980 
mean the grip is extremely smooth just
like<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.610> rest<00:04:27.760> of<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.030> gun<00:04:28.180> now<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.570> that

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
like the rest of the gun now and that

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.380 
like the rest of the gun now and that
results<00:04:29.470> into<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.830> shotgun<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.760> can<00:04:30.940> easily

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
results into a shotgun that can easily

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.960 
results into a shotgun that can easily
go<00:04:31.570> into<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.200> scabbard<00:04:32.770> but<00:04:33.280> still<00:04:33.610> retain

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
go into the scabbard but still retain

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.550 
go into the scabbard but still retain
that<00:04:34.150> way<00:04:34.300> when<00:04:34.510> you're<00:04:34.630> running<00:04:34.870> jumping

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
that way when you're running jumping

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.040 
that way when you're running jumping
crawling<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.580> shotgun<00:04:37.090> will<00:04:37.240> not<00:04:37.480> come<00:04:37.840> out

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
crawling the shotgun will not come out

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.500 
crawling the shotgun will not come out
so<00:04:38.830> that's<00:04:39.040> a<00:04:39.250> pretty<00:04:39.550> cool<00:04:39.820> I<00:04:40.090> was<00:04:40.210> really
