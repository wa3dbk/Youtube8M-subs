00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
desert biome and as well as all these

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.359 
desert biome and as well as all these
cool<00:01:15.750> bills<00:01:16.049> there's<00:01:16.290> also<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.530> massive<00:01:16.799> Sphinx

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
cool bills there's also a massive Sphinx

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.149 
cool bills there's also a massive Sphinx
somewhere<00:01:17.760> which<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.510> absolutely<00:01:18.900> awesome<00:01:19.159> so

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
somewhere which is absolutely awesome so

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.039 
somewhere which is absolutely awesome so
as<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.670> said<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> whole<00:01:21.090> idea<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.750> try<00:01:21.930> and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
as I said the whole idea is to try and

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.490 
as I said the whole idea is to try and
survive<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.530> long<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.799> possible<00:01:23.010> and<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:25.350> also

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
survive as long as possible and you also

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.260 
survive as long as possible and you also
have<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.130> age<00:01:26.369> system<00:01:26.970> which<00:01:27.119> I

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
have this kind of age system which I

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.320 
have this kind of age system which I
found<00:01:28.200> pretty<00:01:28.560> interesting<00:01:28.650> reading<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.700> what

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
found pretty interesting reading so what

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.090 
found pretty interesting reading so what
happens<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.810> when<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:30.990> start<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.650> start<00:01:31.680> at

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
happens is when you start you start at

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.550 
happens is when you start you start at
Year<00:01:32.490> Zero<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.630> longer<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.930> survive<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
Year Zero and the longer you survive the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
Year Zero and the longer you survive the
older<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.490> also<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:36.000> well<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.270> that

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
older you get but also as well as that

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.450 
older you get but also as well as that
the<00:01:36.600> weaker<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.009> kind<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.310> like

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the weaker you get so it's kind of like

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429 
the weaker you get so it's kind of like
a<00:01:38.490> battle<00:01:38.820> against<00:01:39.060> time<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.869> try<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.200> survive

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
a battle against time to try and survive

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.530 
a battle against time to try and survive
as<00:01:40.650> long<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:40.890> possible<00:01:41.270> really<00:01:42.270> really

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
as long as possible really really
