00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
what we like about classic Futurama

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.430 
what we like about classic Futurama
which<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:58.030> first<00:03:58.270> two<00:03:58.480> were<00:03:58.660> missing<00:03:59.080> in<00:03:59.290> a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
which the first two were missing in a

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.970 
which the first two were missing in a
lot<00:03:59.470> of<00:03:59.650> segments<00:04:01.080> but<00:04:02.080> I<00:04:02.110> do<00:04:02.230> recommend<00:04:02.680> this

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
lot of segments but I do recommend this

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.520 
lot of segments but I do recommend this
because<00:04:03.420> this<00:04:04.420> is<00:04:04.600> probably<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.990> best<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.470> the

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
because this is probably the best of the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.580 
because this is probably the best of the
