 and we who maybe talk are 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.059
 that has a new video tutorial very 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.700
 simple and pretty fast that good I'm going 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.939
 to teach the very simple thing that is like 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.130
 put an emblem or a logo for 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.250
 your clan or good for you in 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.480
 butterfield and to play and I started on play tv 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.599
 on xbox 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.550
 I suppose that good in pc 4 if it is yes 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.700
 You are seeing this when I have it 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.910
 there in a team and well, I suppose 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.540
 fish you will know 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.040
 but good I come to say it because much 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.220
 console people do not know it so 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.840
 well we are going to play you will not have it 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.400
 with firefox or google chrome 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.100
 to any search browser and 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.870
 let's put battlelog and we're going to go 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.420
 here to the first page that they put goes to 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.570
 have the waterfill 4 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.570
 and good you will leave this more or less going to 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.909
 have waterfill 4 such 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.220
 You can also go up here if you 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.720
 Battlefield 3 we think 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.140
 It can also be done in the same way 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.050
 but we're going to use it as the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.020
 fil 4 we give you to login us 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.880
 Let's sail 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.950
 and well once he does they are going to 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.620
 leave this more or less then we 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.050
 let's go for 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.520
 for up here that puts in soldier 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.710
 oviedo let's click on our here 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.470
 in soldier we puncture we will leave a 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.560
 page with 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.590
 with all this from our range the 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.440
 skill is going to have the good ones and everything 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.560
 generally we will customize and 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.659
 let's give the emblem 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.390
 and here as you can see we are going to give 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.149
 add new here as you can see 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.850
 We can create our emblem as well 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.159
 we want we can move things like 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.539
 me that black 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.170
 you can put everything 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.849
 let's make some simple so that 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.600
 see how it does not have a system if the 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.890
 cap 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.890
 you can change it 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.510
 and well then we would have everything that way 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.420
 more or less our logo if it is fast 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:45.420
 as improvised fact equipment adjust 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.180
 the opacity 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.370
 and good that simple when mate does not go 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.590
 to leave your emblem and if always 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.410
 nothing and here to save and use and here it 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.500
 save does not take long at all and already 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.660
 I'm here saved emblem I'm going to 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.100
 select mine also if you give it 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.290
 soldier you can access other 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.690
 Customize features like 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.240
 customize in your portrait that is 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.050
 this 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.980
 it's like the soldier that for obvious 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.640
 I'll put 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.870
 I think it was the one who had this 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:26.180
 and here on the sheet you can put it 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:30.870
 what you want our clan 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.760
 something like that is good the plates can you 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.840
 customize it from the game as well 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.879
 You will know if not, then you can 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.549
 customize from there so good 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.000
 this has been the very simple tutorial I think 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.270
 that someone did not know 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.400
 about how to change our emblem and 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.010
 trapani tal 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.450
 and good that this has been all I hope that 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.140
 you liked it and it has turned out 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.310
 useful that I did not know and it's already recorded 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.310
 in another video to several 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.930
