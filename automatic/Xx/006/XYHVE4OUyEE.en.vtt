00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.859 
laying the eggs works great on the
inside<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> tank<00:01:17.450> you'll<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.750> I've

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
inside of the tank you'll see that I've

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.469 
inside of the tank you'll see that I've
got<00:01:19.049> enough<00:01:19.950> water<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:21.090> about<00:01:21.180> this

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
got enough water here it's about this

the<00:01:37.290> water<00:01:37.759> you<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:38.909> there's<00:01:39.240> plenty<00:01:39.540> of

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the water you can see there's plenty of

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.120 
the water you can see there's plenty of
humidity<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.369> also<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.790> my

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
humidity in here and then I also have my

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.780 
humidity in here and then I also have my
my<00:01:44.130> temperature<00:01:44.490> gauge<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.119> my<00:01:46.280> my<00:01:47.280> heater

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
my temperature gauge and my my heater

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.999 
my temperature gauge and my my heater
gauge<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:49.200> temperature<00:01:49.530> gauge<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.890> my

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
gauge my temperature gauge of my

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.120 
gauge my temperature gauge of my
humidity<00:01:50.610> gauge<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.270> well<00:01:51.890> okay<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:52.920> I

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
humidity gauge in here as well okay so I

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.399 
humidity gauge in here as well okay so I
can<00:01:53.280> kind<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.460> keep<00:01:53.670> an<00:01:54.180> eye<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.229> need

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
can kind of keep an eye on that you need

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.350 
can kind of keep an eye on that you need
to<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.799> able<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.070> maintain<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.880> temperature<00:01:57.119> of

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
to be able to maintain a temperature of

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.010 
to be able to maintain a temperature of
around<00:01:57.479> 85<00:01:57.990> degrees<00:01:59.090> all<00:02:00.090> right<00:02:00.270> that's<00:02:00.899> going

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
around 85 degrees all right that's going

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.780 
around 85 degrees all right that's going
to<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.200> important<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.930> that's<00:02:04.079> one<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.350> my

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
to be important and so that's one of my

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.150 
to be important and so that's one of my
ways<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:06.060> making<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.689> incubator<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.770> works

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
ways of making a incubator that works

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.820 
ways of making a incubator that works
really<00:02:08.459> well<00:02:08.989> here's<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.140> second<00:02:10.470> incubator

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
really well here's the second incubator

sits on top of the cups they're not
completely<00:04:13.500> submerged<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.510> then<00:04:15.650> the

completely submerged and then the

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.160 
completely submerged and then the
container<00:04:16.920> of<00:04:17.130> course<00:04:17.370> can<00:04:17.580> sit<00:04:17.790> on<00:04:17.940> top<00:04:18.420> of

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
container of course can sit on top of

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.360 
container of course can sit on top of
those<00:04:20.070> cups<00:04:21.320> without<00:04:22.320> fear<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.830> having<00:04:23.280> the

the female is getting ready to lay her

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.700 
the female is getting ready to lay her
eggs<00:05:05.360> I'll<00:05:06.500> put<00:05:07.500> in<00:05:07.590> a<00:05:07.740> bucket<00:05:08.540> it's<00:05:09.540> salt<00:05:10.440> as<00:05:10.620> a

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
eggs I'll put in a bucket it's salt as a

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.530 
eggs I'll put in a bucket it's salt as a
brick<00:05:10.950> but<00:05:11.160> when<00:05:11.280> it<00:05:11.400> comes<00:05:11.580> out<00:05:11.730> its<00:05:11.970> it'll

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
brick but when it comes out its it'll

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.330 
brick but when it comes out its it'll
fill<00:05:12.750> half<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.080> bucket<00:05:13.290> full<00:05:13.590> when<00:05:13.980> it<00:05:14.100> when<00:05:14.310> it

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
fill half a bucket full when it when it

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.180 
fill half a bucket full when it when it
expands<00:05:15.000> so<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:15.180> need<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.360> good<00:05:15.450> hour<00:05:16.380> or<00:05:16.890> so<00:05:17.130> to

expands so you need a good hour or so to

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.130 
expands so you need a good hour or so to
have<00:05:17.550> this<00:05:19.490> basically<00:05:20.490> soak<00:05:20.910> in<00:05:21.240> your<00:05:21.300> warm
