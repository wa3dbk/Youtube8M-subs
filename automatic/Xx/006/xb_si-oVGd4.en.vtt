00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.800
 and greet everyone squeezes is she 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.869
 24 for the 38th episode of kraft lab 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.970
 What is expected in this 38th it 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.740
 draw ode we'll see a system that 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.650
 allows to shoot through a dispensary 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.900
 arrows that will cross a wall a 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:39.489
 develops what in this case simple 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:41.170
 since it smells like the weather or 6 beats a 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:48.390
 little bit to say that I returned to 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.390
 the red stone I am the world 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.180
 listening we have crossed today from 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.770
 show a little intimate thing to do 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:06.430
 pay 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:10.660
 cool go ahead him the middle them then the 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.929
 system is here no it's not this 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.789
 door that you can find yesterday 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:19.119
 it's this system so my taste but I 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:27.550
 wanted to spend the majestic door rico 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:30.009
 buy way also go into nightmare so 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.360
 the year a normal dispensary behind 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.030
 a block is good when we press you 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.200
 know it does not work 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.910
 in this case this system will us 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.860
 allow it to work so my 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:45.429
 guinea pig montredon ya I'm coming 30 seconds 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.399
 the defenses and it turns it turns 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.050
 so here I guess that's good there is no 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.580
 trap 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.679
 oh he can not watch anything look 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.910
 well in front of me you will see you 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:00.160
 maybe you understand French 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:04.300
 go on it always has a new plate 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.800
 of pressure and each so what is so 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.550
 it is true it is vince li ning impulses 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.909
 very fast 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.459
 a change of 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.769
 the bucks have to transition what makes 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.330
 that the marx edition back or 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.580
 again in finland comes back to three we're going 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.709
 make the system to one 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.390
 just to show you 60 cm thing is 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.370
 well the particular fast transition that 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.099
 the arrow she has time to spend 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.410
 so congratulations to Marie force that 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.610
 find that to find the system you 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.769
 stay far in the description that has me 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.260
 advisable 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:36.670
 it's gone back up this t systems goes that 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.670
 it's forbidden 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:47.660
 that's it's good we can go his 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.690
 part I take the better than the study 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.760
 yes I guess the middle of course good 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.140
 meaning we 'll put a button to 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.370
 moment while it's a wave of 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.410
 pressure we do not care 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.840
 so that's the block the other 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.160
 main where will be the first torch 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.540
 so I 'm going to show where is the trap 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.790
 so the 10 years of her dress at this level 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.519
 there and you'll go check for those who 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:15.500
 are six themes that you 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:19.400
 be sure what are you doing here 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.880
 you'll leave like that seems to me 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.130
 left you four blocks from between 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.049
 two since two pistons and a block 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.630
 free so that the transition 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.930
 is done in peace and quiet 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.810
 tranquility and friendliness can the 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.849
 see how we need you to 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.319
 that you put arrows in the ten 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.639
 nine who will position themselves 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:46.730
 here of course we will bombard him 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:49.040
 a blog that is guided by this offer and which 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.389
 will guide these two torches this barley for 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.609
 the distinction that this torch that are going 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:56.139
 we use to go up to go for them 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:58.549
 see what they are to fuck him 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.030
 ah good so you go up you go up 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.930
 like these a torch inside 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.830
 outside a blog and here we go for 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.220
 three of the eight hours you have 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.500
 left in the first row is normally 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.420
 if I'm not mistaken that my 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.620
 guinea pig to the arrows yes the friends 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.900
 of course 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.760
 well it should work m excuse me 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.010
 you have to change both repeater there 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.330
 must put a third and a point 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.730
 and there normally it works it's good 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.180
 no thanks to the force for this super 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.660
 system which is rather nice in the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.880
 description 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.900
 what do I have for you my guinea pig 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:45.220
 to the pleasures of subscribers france Ã´ 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:49.060
 in the cheater modes and yes my friend 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.410
 long live the bag so if for example you 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.210
 you have to put a pressure plate 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.669
 you just have to put it there 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.110
 know from below where you want 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:02.030
 lemieux happened below like that 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.320
 it does not see gilles who withdraws this 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.240
 total is never to say that it does not 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.630
 not working at 100% it works 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:12.320
 and in multi I go in sauce very well 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.669
 so it works at 80% m on rails but we 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.130
 puts 3 you're going to do exactly the 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.419
 same thing and it's just that where everything 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.410
 will play it's a little boring 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.120
 with the red stone because it will take 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:27.890
 if we do the same thing we are 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.419
 often too quickly done on example we 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.750
 put three like there are you going to do 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.669
 like that and not madness both the guides and 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.080
 so with the pressure call these 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:43.080
 three porsche so a share the side a 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.150
 share here one here 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.470
 of course no but crosses increases the 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.009
 chances to hit the opponent 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.870
 they can be a little repeater this 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.219
 makes the first step to avoid eso 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.729
 waste time that the person is 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:06:01.069
 already the cost of the lab while some 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:03.680
 are you there take your arrow 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:09.419
 but not actually breaking everything 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:11.939
 No, here we go home 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.659
 yeah we find ourselves for a neighbor in 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:20.969
 next June 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:22.770
 a good next I'll let you do 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.620
 the gobbers I want with my guinea pig 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:47.479
 will do a little stonian repeat 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:47.479
 normal cool well I saw well 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:57.179
 at the sessions Algeria think about what 

00:06:54.589 --> 00:07:02.719
 in short I am it's the delirium 

00:06:57.179 --> 00:07:02.719
 completely stops external links
