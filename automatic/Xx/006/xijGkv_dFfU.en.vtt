more<00:02:09.209> tablespoon<00:02:10.310> I'm<00:02:11.310> sure<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.640> some<00:02:11.790> people

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
more tablespoon I'm sure to some people

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.990 
more tablespoon I'm sure to some people
that's<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.239> lot<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:13.650> sometimes<00:02:14.579> I<00:02:14.700> do<00:02:14.760> more

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
that's a lot so but sometimes I do more

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.090 
that's a lot so but sometimes I do more
but<00:02:15.360> today<00:02:16.170> I'm<00:02:16.380> just<00:02:16.560> going<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.739> do<00:02:16.890> one

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
but today I'm just going to do one

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.289 
but today I'm just going to do one
tablespoon<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:19.320> then<00:02:19.680> I'm<00:02:20.040> gonna<00:02:20.190> put<00:02:20.549> the

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
tablespoon and then I'm gonna put the

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.360 
tablespoon and then I'm gonna put the
coffee<00:02:21.600> on<00:02:22.519> top<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.910> kind<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.209> heat<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.660> up<00:02:24.780> and

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
coffee on top to kind of heat it up and

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.660 
coffee on top to kind of heat it up and
then<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.640> way<00:02:26.850> it'll<00:02:27.739> dissolve<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:29.340> little

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
then that way it'll dissolve a little

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.180 
then that way it'll dissolve a little
bit<00:02:29.790> better<00:02:29.940> into<00:02:30.600> coffee<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:33.180> then<00:02:33.360> use<00:02:33.570> your

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
bit better into coffee and then use your

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.890
