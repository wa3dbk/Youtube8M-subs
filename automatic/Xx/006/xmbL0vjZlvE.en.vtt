so<00:00:10.530> rich<00:00:10.769> we<00:00:10.980> talked<00:00:11.309> about<00:00:11.490> some<00:00:11.880> basic<00:00:12.000> rail

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
so rich we talked about some basic rail

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.749 
so rich we talked about some basic rail
setups<00:00:12.870> but<00:00:13.290> we<00:00:13.620> just<00:00:14.009> all<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.280> sudden<00:00:14.580> got<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
setups but we just all of a sudden got a

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.279 
setups but we just all of a sudden got a
lot<00:00:14.969> more<00:00:15.000> stuff<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.719> desk<00:00:15.900> what's<00:00:16.109> going

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
lot more stuff on the desk what's going

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.349 
lot more stuff on the desk what's going
on<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:16.560> yeah<00:00:16.949> well<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.760> all<00:00:17.940> fits<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.270> one

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
on here yeah well this all fits in one

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.630 
on here yeah well this all fits in one
bag<00:00:18.600> believe<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:18.990> or<00:00:19.050> not<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> bag

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
bag believe it or not but it is a bag

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.519 
bag believe it or not but it is a bag
that<00:00:20.670> will<00:00:21.029> hold<00:00:21.210> everything<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:22.020> need<00:00:22.289> for

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
that will hold everything I need for

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.050 
that will hold everything I need for
shooting<00:00:22.980> time-lapse<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> actually<00:00:23.730> took

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
shooting time-lapse so I actually took

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.609 
shooting time-lapse so I actually took
the<00:00:24.240> system<00:00:24.600> out<00:00:24.779> into<00:00:25.050> valley<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.439> fire

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
the system out into valley of fire

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.859 
the system out into valley of fire
recently<00:00:25.949> put<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.910> through<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.330> trial<00:00:27.720> by

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
recently put it through the trial by

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.839 
recently put it through the trial by
fire<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.410> held<00:00:28.619> up<00:00:28.740> well<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:28.949> shot<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.580> 10

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
fire and it held up well I shot for 10

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.849 
fire and it held up well I shot for 10
days<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.510> slider<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.619> worked

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
days on this slider and it worked

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.650 
days on this slider and it worked
fantastic<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> wanted<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> walk<00:00:33.450> through

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
fantastic so I wanted to walk through

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.870 
fantastic so I wanted to walk through
the<00:00:33.719> process<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.739> mentioned<00:00:35.010> motorized

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the process but you mentioned motorized

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.490 
the process but you mentioned motorized
yeah<00:00:36.239> there's<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.809> couple<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.260> different

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
yeah there's a couple of different

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.630 
yeah there's a couple of different
motors<00:00:37.739> here<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.040> why<00:00:38.160> do<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.460> multiple

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
motors here and why do I have multiple

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.889 
motors here and why do I have multiple
motors<00:00:39.120> Rob<00:00:39.300> well<00:00:39.540> you're<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> have

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
motors Rob well you're going to have

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.060 
motors Rob well you're going to have
different<00:00:40.110> torque<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:40.739> what<00:00:40.950> you're

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
different torque for what you're

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.680 
different torque for what you're
depending<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.760> what<00:00:41.940> you're<00:00:42.059> trying<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.300> do<00:00:42.480> if

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
depending on what you're trying to do if

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.030 
depending on what you're trying to do if
you're<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.110> know<00:00:43.140> doing<00:00:43.350> time-lapse<00:00:43.860> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
you're you know doing time-lapse you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.290 
you're you know doing time-lapse you
might<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.489> motor<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> little<00:00:45.090> less

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
might have one motor with a little less

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.060 
might have one motor with a little less
work<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:45.960> kind<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.200> move<00:00:46.350> stop<00:00:46.739> move

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
work so you can kind of move stop move

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.010 
work so you can kind of move stop move
stop<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.090> some<00:00:48.270> memory<00:00:48.420> involve<00:00:48.780> there

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
stop and have some memory involve there

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.420 
stop and have some memory involve there
or<00:00:49.230> if<00:00:49.469> you're<00:00:49.590> doing<00:00:49.739> video<00:00:49.980> where<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.280> want

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
or if you're doing video where you want

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.500 
or if you're doing video where you want
constant<00:00:50.789> motion<00:00:51.000> you're<00:00:51.239> gonna<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
constant motion you're gonna have a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.790 
constant motion you're gonna have a
better<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> little<00:00:51.960> bit<00:00:52.289> more<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.500> work<00:00:52.680> on

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
better with a little bit more to work on

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.979 
better with a little bit more to work on
it<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.550> thing<00:00:53.699> about<00:00:53.730> sort<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.449> motorized

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
it and the thing about sort of motorized

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.080 
it and the thing about sort of motorized
sliders<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:55.980> opinion<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.760> kind<00:00:57.030> of

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
sliders in my opinion that's kind of

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.420 
sliders in my opinion that's kind of
where<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.449> at<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.899> mean<00:00:58.289> yeah<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
where it's at I mean yeah you can do the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
where it's at I mean yeah you can do the
hand<00:00:59.699> manual<00:01:00.210> movement<00:01:00.629> or<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
hand manual movement or you can do the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.290 
hand manual movement or you can do the
hand<00:01:01.379> crank<00:01:01.680> or<00:01:01.949> pushing<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:03.059> when<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
hand crank or pushing it but when it

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.380 
hand crank or pushing it but when it
comes<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> nice<00:01:04.290> constant<00:01:05.250> movement<00:01:05.580> you're

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
comes to a nice constant movement you're

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.030 
comes to a nice constant movement you're
not<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:06.900> better<00:01:07.170> than<00:01:07.500> motorized

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
not going to get better than motorized

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.609 
not going to get better than motorized
and<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.790> step<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.150> through<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.350> various

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and as you step up through the various

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.859 
and as you step up through the various
or<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.040> calibers<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> motorized<00:01:12.330> sliders

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
or of calibers of motorized sliders

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.649 
or of calibers of motorized sliders
you're<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.010> whole<00:01:14.310> lot<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:15.270> whole

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
you're going to get a whole lot a whole

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.810 
you're going to get a whole lot a whole
lot<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.140> options<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.460> from<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
lot of options not just from the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.490 
lot of options not just from the
movement<00:01:18.390> left<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.900> right<00:01:19.049> obviously<00:01:19.229> that's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
movement left and right obviously that's

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.929 
movement left and right obviously that's
what<00:01:19.590> motive<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.070> comes<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:20.850> you're

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
what motive really comes in but you're

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.030 
what motive really comes in but you're
gonna<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.150> motorized<00:01:21.659> panning<00:01:22.200> heads<00:01:22.560> things

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
gonna get motorized panning heads things

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.219 
gonna get motorized panning heads things
of<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.400> nature<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:24.270> really<00:01:24.600> give<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.049> for

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
of that nature that really give you for

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.749 
of that nature that really give you for
time<00:01:25.409> lapse<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.890> video<00:01:26.100> work<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.700> an

time lapse and video work just an

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.640 
time lapse and video work just an
immense<00:01:27.150> amount<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.540> flexibility<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.320> sort

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
immense amount of flexibility and sort

immense amount of flexibility and sort
of<00:01:28.710> uniqueness<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.850> shots<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.540> nailed<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
of uniqueness to your shots we nailed it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.480 
of uniqueness to your shots we nailed it
Rob<00:01:31.049> we're<00:01:31.259> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.439> build<00:01:31.650> out<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> three

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
Rob we're going to build out a three

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160 
Rob we're going to build out a three
axis<00:01:32.759> system<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.630> where<00:01:33.750> there's<00:01:33.900> three

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
axis system here where there's three

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.330 
axis system here where there's three
different<00:01:34.320> types<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.829> movement<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.280> ability

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
different types of movement the ability

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340 
different types of movement the ability
to<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:35.759> side<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.090> side<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.420> ability<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> pan

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to go side to side the ability to pan

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590 
to go side to side the ability to pan
and<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.100> ability<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.520> tilt<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:38.970> once<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.509> go

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
and the ability to tilt but once you go

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.060 
and the ability to tilt but once you go
ahead<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.840> attach<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.320> motor<00:01:40.590> at<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.890> end

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
ahead and attach that motor at that end

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.069 
ahead and attach that motor at that end
and<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.060> sort<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.420> adapter

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and so this is just a sort of adapter

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.270 
and so this is just a sort of adapter
that<00:01:43.200> attaches<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> rod<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that attaches to the rod and this is the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.740 
that attaches to the rod and this is the
actual<00:01:44.430> motor<00:01:44.850> itself<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
actual motor itself and you can see I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.510 
actual motor itself and you can see I
actually<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.259> some<00:01:46.439> other<00:01:46.619> motors<00:01:47.280> here

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
actually have some other motors here

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.490 
actually have some other motors here
yeah<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.149> works<00:01:48.329> pretty<00:01:48.540> easily<00:01:48.780> ones<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
yeah this works pretty easily ones the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.310 
yeah this works pretty easily ones the
video<00:01:49.740> 11<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.420> does<00:01:51.630> shoot<00:01:51.990> step

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
video 11 is the one that does shoot step

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.440 
video 11 is the one that does shoot step
move<00:01:52.619> which<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.340> essential<00:01:53.939> when<00:01:54.090> putting

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
move which is essential when putting

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
move which is essential when putting
together<00:01:54.600> something<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.619> time-lapse

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
together something for time-lapse

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.039 
together something for time-lapse
productions<00:01:57.030> where<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.240> want<00:01:57.390> those<00:01:57.540> micro

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
productions where you want those micro

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.139 
productions where you want those micro
movements<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.430> time-lapse<00:01:59.880> motor

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
movements this is the time-lapse motor

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.880 
movements this is the time-lapse motor
he's<00:02:00.329> attaching<00:02:00.630> which<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.350> going<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.710> a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
he's attaching which is going to have a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.429 
he's attaching which is going to have a
lot<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.549> ability<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> very<00:02:03.840> small

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
lot of ability to do a very small

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.590 
lot of ability to do a very small
movement<00:02:04.829> which<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.670> great<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:06.240> that's

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
movement which is great now that's

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.330 
movement which is great now that's
attached<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.680> see<00:02:07.860> there<00:02:08.009> rub<00:02:08.190> how

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
attached and you see there rub how

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.589 
attached and you see there rub how
they're<00:02:08.489> sort<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.700> holes<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> side<00:02:09.390> yep

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
they're sort of holes on the side yep

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.320 
they're sort of holes on the side yep
this<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.400> gear<00:02:11.400> teeth<00:02:11.430> just<00:02:11.879> like<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.150> saw

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
this is the gear teeth just like you saw

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.059 
this is the gear teeth just like you saw
in<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.420> Kessler<00:02:12.780> so

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
in the Kessler so

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.489 
in the Kessler so
once<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.609> take<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:13.969> through<00:02:14.329> and<00:02:14.599> loop<00:02:15.409> it

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:15.499 
once you take that through and loop it

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:17.410 
once you take that through and loop it
around<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.579> other<00:02:16.670> side<00:02:16.999> I've<00:02:17.359> just

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
around and on the other side I've just

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.099 
around and on the other side I've just
got<00:02:18.109> a<00:02:18.319> geared<00:02:19.099> wheel<00:02:19.519> here<00:02:19.939> so<00:02:20.359> that<00:02:20.569> can<00:02:20.989> make

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
got a geared wheel here so that can make

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.720 
got a geared wheel here so that can make
a<00:02:21.170> complete<00:02:21.560> loop<00:02:21.799> so<00:02:22.040> I'll<00:02:22.159> just<00:02:22.189> take<00:02:22.519> that

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
a complete loop so I'll just take that

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:32.530 
a complete loop so I'll just take that
and<00:02:23.079> attach<00:02:24.079> it<00:02:24.109> down<00:02:24.439> here<00:02:31.359> always<00:02:32.359> a<00:02:32.389> good

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
and attach it down here always a good

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.140 
and attach it down here always a good
idea<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.900> lightly<00:02:33.650> tighten<00:02:34.069> not<00:02:34.459> overtighten

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
idea to lightly tighten not overtighten

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.170 
idea to lightly tighten not overtighten
anything<00:02:35.659> firm<00:02:36.379> but<00:02:36.739> not<00:02:36.769> locked<00:02:37.310> because<00:02:37.670> you

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
anything firm but not locked because you

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.520 
anything firm but not locked because you
want<00:02:38.359> to<00:02:38.389> be<00:02:38.480> able<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.659> take<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.900> system<00:02:39.230> apart

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
want to be able to take the system apart

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.239 
want to be able to take the system apart
now<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.579> this<00:02:40.730> case<00:02:41.000> there<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.719> another<00:02:42.439> unit

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:43.249 
now in this case there is another unit

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:44.949 
now in this case there is another unit
that<00:02:43.459> sort<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.760> falls<00:02:44.060> in<00:02:44.329> between<00:02:44.419> this<00:02:44.810> is

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
that sort of falls in between this is

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.959 
that sort of falls in between this is
going<00:02:45.139> to<00:02:45.200> hold<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:46.310> Abel<00:02:46.669> thing<00:02:46.790> together

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:46.969 
going to hold this Abel thing together

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.270 
going to hold this Abel thing together
yeah<00:02:47.329> so<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.840> just<00:02:48.169> take<00:02:48.409> this<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.829> attach<00:02:49.250> it

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
yeah so I just take this and attach it

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.429 
yeah so I just take this and attach it
to<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.030> unit<00:02:50.299> there's<00:02:50.599> a<00:02:50.689> thread<00:02:51.230> on<00:02:51.260> the

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
to the unit there's a thread on the

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.069 
to the unit there's a thread on the
bottom<00:02:52.180> let<00:02:53.180> me<00:02:53.239> turn<00:02:53.359> that<00:02:53.419> around<00:02:53.629> so<00:02:53.930> it's

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
bottom let me turn that around so it's

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.429 
bottom let me turn that around so it's
facing<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:55.629> camera<00:02:56.629> so<00:02:56.900> they<00:02:56.989> could<00:02:57.169> see<00:02:57.319> it

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
facing the camera so they could see it

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.740 
facing the camera so they could see it
normally<00:02:57.889> I<00:02:57.919> would<00:02:58.099> put<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.340> on<00:02:58.459> my<00:02:58.669> side<00:02:59.000> so<00:02:59.659> is

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
normally I would put it on my side so is

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.229 
normally I would put it on my side so is
easier<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.049> see<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:01.129> thread<00:03:01.489> that<00:03:01.669> down<00:03:02.000> and

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
easier to see and I thread that down and

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.140 
easier to see and I thread that down and
this<00:03:02.540> just<00:03:02.780> creates<00:03:02.959> a<00:03:03.469> channel<00:03:04.280> for<00:03:04.819> this<00:03:05.000> to

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
this just creates a channel for this to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.420 
this just creates a channel for this to
go<00:03:05.269> through<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:05.689> if<00:03:05.780> we<00:03:05.900> take<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.409> belt<00:03:06.620> we

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
go through so if we take the belt we

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.009 
go through so if we take the belt we
could<00:03:07.609> pass<00:03:07.849> that<00:03:08.180> through<00:03:08.449> and<00:03:08.689> just<00:03:08.719> make

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
could pass that through and just make

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.629 
could pass that through and just make
sure<00:03:09.109> you<00:03:09.199> don't<00:03:09.230> twist<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.859> or<00:03:10.069> get<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.340> turned

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
sure you don't twist it or get it turned

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.110 
sure you don't twist it or get it turned
around<00:03:10.760> yeah<00:03:11.389> yeah<00:03:12.109> there<00:03:12.650> we<00:03:12.680> go<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:13.099> I<00:03:13.669> loop

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
around yeah yeah there we go and I loop

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.360 
around yeah yeah there we go and I loop
that<00:03:14.329> around<00:03:14.659> and<00:03:14.959> then<00:03:15.620> I'll<00:03:15.769> slide<00:03:16.159> this

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
that around and then I'll slide this

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.670 
that around and then I'll slide this
down<00:03:16.430> here<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.209> connect<00:03:18.079> so<00:03:18.319> there's

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
down here and connect so there's

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.949 
down here and connect so there's
essentially<00:03:19.159> a<00:03:19.459> geared<00:03:20.060> system<00:03:20.569> here<00:03:20.720> Rob<00:03:20.840> I

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
essentially a geared system here Rob I

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.110 
essentially a geared system here Rob I
just<00:03:21.169> stick<00:03:21.470> that<00:03:21.500> yep<00:03:22.129> so<00:03:22.310> it's<00:03:22.489> connected

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
just stick that yep so it's connected

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.399 
just stick that yep so it's connected
and<00:03:23.239> just<00:03:23.389> tighten<00:03:23.509> it<00:03:23.689> down<00:03:23.720> tighten<00:03:24.319> it<00:03:24.379> down

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
and just tighten it down tighten it down

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.939 
and just tighten it down tighten it down
and<00:03:24.949> it<00:03:25.729> locks<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.569> in<00:03:26.900> place<00:03:26.930> then<00:03:27.650> you<00:03:27.709> do<00:03:27.829> the

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
and it locks it in place then you do the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.499 
and it locks it in place then you do the
exact<00:03:28.250> same<00:03:28.280> thing<00:03:28.669> on<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.849> other<00:03:28.879> side<00:03:29.030> yep

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:29.509 
exact same thing on the other side yep

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.229 
exact same thing on the other side yep
and<00:03:29.870> we'll<00:03:30.409> just<00:03:30.439> feed<00:03:30.709> that<00:03:30.769> through<00:03:31.159> I<00:03:31.430> could

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
and we'll just feed that through I could

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.569 
and we'll just feed that through I could
take<00:03:32.540> this<00:03:32.689> back<00:03:32.900> online<00:03:33.109> now<00:03:33.979> I<00:03:34.220> got<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.519> be

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
take this back online now I got to be

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.030 
take this back online now I got to be
careful<00:03:34.849> here<00:03:35.139> notice<00:03:36.139> I<00:03:36.259> actually<00:03:36.439> fed<00:03:36.799> too

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
careful here notice I actually fed too

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.099 
careful here notice I actually fed too
much<00:03:37.220> in<00:03:37.430> initially<00:03:38.209> so<00:03:38.389> you<00:03:38.449> want<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.870> sort<00:03:39.049> of

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
much in initially so you want to sort of

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.439 
much in initially so you want to sort of
split<00:03:39.439> the<00:03:39.560> balance<00:03:39.949> get<00:03:40.609> that<00:03:40.759> on<00:03:40.939> there<00:03:41.299> in

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
split the balance get that on there in

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.629 
split the balance get that on there in
both<00:03:41.599> cases<00:03:41.930> so<00:03:42.290> I'll<00:03:42.409> lock<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.680> one<00:03:43.099> down<00:03:43.400> it

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
both cases so I'll lock the one down it

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.390 
both cases so I'll lock the one down it
is<00:03:44.150> possible<00:03:44.419> to<00:03:44.780> feed<00:03:45.049> it<00:03:45.169> in<00:03:45.319> too<00:03:45.650> far<00:03:46.009> yeah

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
is possible to feed it in too far yeah

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.179 
is possible to feed it in too far yeah
and<00:03:46.579> get<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.209> so<00:03:47.389> one<00:03:47.629> side<00:03:47.900> locks<00:03:48.259> and<00:03:48.620> then

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:49.189 
and get it so one side locks and then

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:50.920 
and get it so one side locks and then
the<00:03:49.280> other<00:03:49.310> side<00:03:49.699> and<00:03:49.909> you<00:03:50.000> want<00:03:50.209> this<00:03:50.419> pretty

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
the other side and you want this pretty

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.020 
the other side and you want this pretty
snug<00:03:51.379> you<00:03:51.620> don't<00:03:51.769> want<00:03:51.949> to<00:03:52.069> really<00:03:52.579> go<00:03:53.000> over

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
snug you don't want to really go over

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.909 
snug you don't want to really go over
yeah<00:03:53.509> if<00:03:53.629> you<00:03:53.750> have<00:03:53.930> too<00:03:54.109> much<00:03:54.259> slack<00:03:54.560> in<00:03:54.769> there

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
yeah if you have too much slack in there

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.039 
yeah if you have too much slack in there
it's<00:03:55.159> obviously<00:03:55.489> going<00:03:55.759> to<00:03:56.060> not<00:03:56.509> work<00:03:56.900> all

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
it's obviously going to not work all

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.270 
it's obviously going to not work all
that<00:03:57.169> well<00:03:57.229> and<00:03:57.469> pull<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:57.859> you<00:03:57.889> get<00:03:58.099> some

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
that well and pull and you get some

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.770 
that well and pull and you get some
bouncing<00:03:58.639> around<00:03:58.759> yeah<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.239> lot<00:03:59.449> of<00:03:59.599> times

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
bouncing around yeah a lot of times

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.179 
bouncing around yeah a lot of times
we're<00:03:59.959> going<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.139> actually<00:04:00.259> set<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.709> slider

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
we're going to actually set the slider

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.699 
we're going to actually set the slider
up<00:04:01.430> at<00:04:01.669> an<00:04:01.819> incline<00:04:02.329> going<00:04:02.449> up<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.139> system<00:04:03.349> so<00:04:03.650> if

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
up at an incline going up a system so if

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.619 
up at an incline going up a system so if
there's<00:04:03.859> too<00:04:04.040> much<00:04:04.069> play<00:04:04.579> in<00:04:04.729> here<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.209> could

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
there's too much play in here it could

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.719 
there's too much play in here it could
actually<00:04:05.870> slip<00:04:06.530> so<00:04:06.799> it's<00:04:07.009> a<00:04:07.099> good<00:04:07.250> idea<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.639> get

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:07.729 
actually slip so it's a good idea to get

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.670 
actually slip so it's a good idea to get
that<00:04:07.909> belt<00:04:08.150> nice<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:09.019> tight<00:04:09.229> now<00:04:09.379> once<00:04:09.560> you've

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
that belt nice and tight now once you've

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.309 
that belt nice and tight now once you've
done<00:04:09.859> that<00:04:09.919> don't<00:04:10.879> pull<00:04:11.269> this<00:04:11.539> because<00:04:11.989> you

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
done that don't pull this because you

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.869 
done that don't pull this because you
actually<00:04:12.530> have<00:04:12.859> a<00:04:12.889> motor<00:04:13.250> here<00:04:13.579> and<00:04:13.729> you<00:04:13.789> could

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
actually have a motor here and you could

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.629 
actually have a motor here and you could
strip<00:04:14.299> it<00:04:14.449> so<00:04:14.900> leave<00:04:15.349> it<00:04:15.379> in<00:04:15.620> place<00:04:15.650> call<00:04:16.459> that

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
strip it so leave it in place call that

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.969 
strip it so leave it in place call that
good<00:04:16.849> now<00:04:17.659> we've<00:04:17.989> got<00:04:18.169> that<00:04:18.349> built<00:04:18.560> we<00:04:18.709> got<00:04:18.829> the

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
good now we've got that built we got the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.610 
good now we've got that built we got the
motor<00:04:19.219> we<00:04:19.909> got<00:04:20.060> this<00:04:20.359> I<00:04:20.599> think<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.109> next<00:04:21.409> thing

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
motor we got this I think the next thing

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.769 
motor we got this I think the next thing
is<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.829> attach<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.400> controller<00:04:23.150> that'll<00:04:23.599> put

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:23.779 
is to attach the controller that'll put

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:26.529 
is to attach the controller that'll put
it<00:04:23.870> all<00:04:24.050> into<00:04:24.260> play
