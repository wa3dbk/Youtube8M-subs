00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
out in increments so that the water

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.080 
out in increments so that the water
drains<00:00:39.120> through<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:41.070> thing<00:00:41.370> maybe<00:00:41.670> you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
drains through so one thing maybe you

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.020 
drains through so one thing maybe you
are<00:00:42.300> over<00:00:42.809> watering<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.770> can<00:00:44.190> help<00:00:44.550> turn<00:00:44.850> it

really well to clean out the toxins in

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.899 
really well to clean out the toxins in
the<00:01:59.490> soil<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:01.560> has<00:02:01.740> been<00:02:01.979> referred<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.399> as

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the soil and it has been referred to as

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.330 
the soil and it has been referred to as
in<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:04.490> liquid<00:02:05.490> aeration<00:02:07.310> we<00:02:08.310> used<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.940> aerate

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
in a liquid aeration we used to aerate

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.710 
in a liquid aeration we used to aerate
twice<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.610> year

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
twice a year

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.500 
twice a year
we<00:02:13.440> found<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:14.070> by<00:02:14.220> aerating<00:02:14.760> once<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.180> year

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
we found that by aerating once a year

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.830 
we found that by aerating once a year
and<00:02:15.720> spraying<00:02:16.500> Medina<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.910> we<00:02:18.150> needed<00:02:18.570> we

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
and spraying Medina that we needed we

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.080 
and spraying Medina that we needed we
could<00:02:19.020> cut<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.410> aeration<00:02:19.950> down<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.430> once<00:02:20.700> and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
could cut that aeration down to once and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.090 
could cut that aeration down to once and
the<00:02:21.570> soil<00:02:21.870> will<00:02:22.110> stay<00:02:22.350> soft<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.180> pliable

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
the soil will stay soft and pliable

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.560 
the soil will stay soft and pliable
these<00:02:26.100> are<00:02:26.280> some<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> things<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.090> can<00:02:27.360> be

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
these are some of the things that can be

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.850 
these are some of the things that can be
