we're<00:00:25.850> in<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.060> f-35<00:00:26.869> final<00:00:27.410> finish<00:00:27.740> area<00:00:28.130> this

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
we're in the f-35 final finish area this

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.359 
we're in the f-35 final finish area this
is<00:00:28.760> a<00:00:28.910> building<00:00:29.539> where<00:00:29.779> we<00:00:29.810> do<00:00:30.199> a<00:00:30.500> lot<00:00:30.890> of<00:00:31.099> new

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
is a building where we do a lot of new

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.610 
is a building where we do a lot of new
technologies<00:00:32.090> like<00:00:32.390> laser<00:00:32.629> projection<00:00:33.200> and

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
technologies like laser projection and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.680 
technologies like laser projection and
robotics<00:00:34.070> yeah<00:00:34.790> we<00:00:34.910> have<00:00:35.000> this<00:00:35.150> intelligent

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
robotics yeah we have this intelligent

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.720 
robotics yeah we have this intelligent
laser<00:00:35.870> system<00:00:36.440> it's<00:00:37.070> actually<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:37.460> first<00:00:37.610> of

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
laser system it's actually the first of

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.549 
laser system it's actually the first of
its<00:00:37.879> kind<00:00:37.970> ever<00:00:38.360> be<00:00:38.570> used<00:00:38.780> in<00:00:38.930> a<00:00:38.989> manufacturing

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
its kind ever be used in a manufacturing

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.460 
its kind ever be used in a manufacturing
facility<00:00:39.820> not<00:00:40.820> just<00:00:41.150> within<00:00:41.390> aviation<00:00:42.199> but

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
facility not just within aviation but

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.009 
facility not just within aviation but
across<00:00:42.650> all<00:00:42.920> industries<00:00:43.400> and<00:00:43.699> it<00:00:44.480> basically

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
across all industries and it basically

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.520 
across all industries and it basically
combines<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:46.250> powers<00:00:46.610> of<00:00:46.989> locating<00:00:47.989> certain

materials with lasers with the
technology<00:00:52.040> of<00:00:52.100> GPS<00:00:52.670> I<00:00:53.059> think<00:00:53.839> a<00:00:53.900> lot<00:00:54.050> of

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
technology of GPS I think a lot of

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.010 
technology of GPS I think a lot of
people<00:00:54.410> think<00:00:54.650> that<00:00:55.210> fly<00:00:56.210> yellow<00:00:56.420> coatings<00:00:56.899> is

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
people think that fly yellow coatings is

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.020 
people think that fly yellow coatings is
just<00:00:57.230> taking<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:57.590> spray<00:00:57.860> gun<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.129> apply<00:00:58.550> it

side<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.660> our<00:02:19.720> aircraft<00:02:20.140> we<00:02:20.500> have<00:02:20.620> our<00:02:20.739> side

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
side of our aircraft we have our side

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.100 
side of our aircraft we have our side
fuselage<00:02:21.550> station<00:02:22.030> laser<00:02:22.209> systems<00:02:22.810> and

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
fuselage station laser systems and

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.530 
fuselage station laser systems and
directly<00:02:23.980> behind<00:02:24.160> me<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.640> our<00:02:24.760> Ford<00:02:25.030> family

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
directly behind me is our Ford family

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.420 
directly behind me is our Ford family
which<00:02:25.989> is<00:02:26.140> representation<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.190> Ford

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
which is representation of the Ford

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.800 
which is representation of the Ford

this<00:02:30.440> this<00:02:30.980> process<00:02:31.790> in<00:02:32.120> combination<00:02:33.020> with

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
this this process in combination with

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.570 
this this process in combination with
the<00:02:33.380> use<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.530> robotics

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
the use of robotics

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.979 
the use of robotics
really<00:02:35.180> makes<00:02:35.390> this<00:02:35.569> one<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.930> most

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
really makes this one of the most

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.700 
really makes this one of the most
