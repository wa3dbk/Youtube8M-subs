00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
look back over the games preceding a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.639

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
Champions League match for this stage I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.170 
Champions League match for this stage I
think<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.129> important<00:00:41.610> rather<00:00:41.790> than<00:00:41.910> look<00:00:42.059> at

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
think it's important rather than look at

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.459 
think it's important rather than look at
the<00:00:42.239> group<00:00:42.420> stage<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.870> look<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> knockout

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the group stage to look at the knockout

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.319 
the group stage to look at the knockout
stage<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.430> think<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.760> know<00:00:44.789> Arsene<00:00:45.149> Wenger

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
stage and I think you know Arsene Wenger

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.450 
stage and I think you know Arsene Wenger
you<00:00:45.690> know<00:00:45.780> he's<00:00:45.930> done<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.410> every<00:00:47.039> year<00:00:47.219> for

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
you know he's done it every year for

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.090 
you know he's done it every year for
what<00:00:47.610> 13<00:00:48.180> years<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.660> something<00:00:48.809> crazy<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:50.039> he

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
what 13 years or something crazy so he

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
what 13 years or something crazy so he
knows<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.760> he<00:00:50.940> knows<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.390> think<00:00:51.600> he

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
knows what to do he knows I think he

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.450 
knows what to do he knows I think he
knows<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.020> building<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> Champions

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
knows that building up to a Champions

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
knows that building up to a Champions
League<00:00:53.640> encounter<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.329> win<00:00:54.539> it's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
League encounter with a win it's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.840 
League encounter with a win it's
obviously<00:00:55.440> better<00:00:55.649> than<00:00:55.890> weakening<00:00:56.280> down<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
obviously better than weakening down and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.250 
obviously better than weakening down and
not<00:00:57.000> willing<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.390> plus<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.140> need

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
not willing and plus you know they need

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.840 
not willing and plus you know they need
to<00:00:58.410> finish<00:00:58.559> full<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.980> stellar<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.520> no<00:00:59.579> point

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to finish full of stellar it's no point

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.990 
to finish full of stellar it's no point
in<00:01:00.000> risking<00:01:00.570> dropping<00:01:01.199> points<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.940> against<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
in risking dropping points and against a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.700 
in risking dropping points and against a
team<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.239> Crystal<00:01:03.719> Palace<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.409> don't

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
team like Crystal Palace so I don't

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.320 
team like Crystal Palace so I don't
think<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.010> will<00:01:05.100> affect<00:01:05.220> them<00:01:05.549> maybe<00:01:06.180> you'll

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
think it will affect them maybe you'll

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.670 
think it will affect them maybe you'll
rotate<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.750> little<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.260> he's<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:07.530> plenty

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
rotate a little bit but he's got plenty

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.590 
rotate a little bit but he's got plenty
of<00:01:07.920> great<00:01:08.070> players<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.909> don't<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.450> look

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
of great players so I don't think I look

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.480 
of great players so I don't think I look
fat<00:01:09.630> them<00:01:09.810> too<00:01:09.960> much<00:01:10.140> all<00:01:10.500> right<00:01:10.770> well<00:01:11.220> then

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
fat them too much all right well then

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.679 
fat them too much all right well then
we've<00:01:11.580> got<00:01:11.610> good<00:01:11.970> value<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
we've got good value here for the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.310 
we've got good value here for the
Gunners<00:01:12.930> win<00:01:13.110> 1.83<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.880> draw<00:01:15.030> 3.75<00:01:15.869> Crystal

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
Gunners win 1.83 the draw 3.75 Crystal

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.249 
Gunners win 1.83 the draw 3.75 Crystal
Palace<00:01:16.640> 4.8<00:01:17.640> will<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.750> playing<00:01:18.869> winners

Palace 4.8 will you be playing winners
market<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.830> think<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.549> asshole<00:01:20.909> price<00:01:21.119> is

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
market I think that asshole price is

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.810 
market I think that asshole price is
good<00:01:21.720> enough<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:22.409> they<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.340> tend

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
good enough you know they they they tend

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.370 
good enough you know they they they tend

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
chelsea and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.910

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
city and arsenal are one of those teams

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.580 
city and arsenal are one of those teams
who<00:03:06.060> we<00:03:06.420> tend<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.720> restrict<00:03:07.200> their<00:03:07.350> opposition

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
who we tend to restrict their opposition

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.220 
who we tend to restrict their opposition
to<00:03:07.890> few<00:03:08.580> chances<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.360> crystal<00:03:09.870> plans<00:03:10.050> can

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
to few chances and crystal plans can

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.170 
to few chances and crystal plans can
never<00:03:10.440> quite<00:03:10.650> managed<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.190> break<00:03:11.340> those<00:03:11.850> sort

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
never quite managed to break those sort

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.290 
never quite managed to break those sort
of<00:03:12.209> teams<00:03:12.450> down<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.990> think<00:03:13.470> they<00:03:13.590> could<00:03:13.800> get<00:03:13.950> one

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
of teams down I think they could get one

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.490 
of teams down I think they could get one
but<00:03:15.300> i'm<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.660> go<00:03:15.750> rather<00:03:16.020> than<00:03:16.110> go<00:03:16.290> for

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
but i'm going to go rather than go for

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.440 
but i'm going to go rather than go for
Arsenal<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.950> win<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.100> both<00:03:17.340> teams<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.850> score<00:03:17.880> I

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
Arsenal to win a both teams to score I

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.600 
Arsenal to win a both teams to score I
go<00:03:18.750> for<00:03:18.959> Arsenal<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.470> win<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.739> over<00:03:19.920> 2.5<00:03:20.550> goals

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
go for Arsenal to win and over 2.5 goals

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.340 
go for Arsenal to win and over 2.5 goals
in<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.090> match<00:03:21.120> because<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.660> means<00:03:21.780> if<00:03:22.110> they

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
in the match because that means if they

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.380 
in the match because that means if they
win<00:03:22.500> three<00:03:22.830> nil<00:03:23.040> then<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.880> still<00:03:24.120> lend<00:03:24.300> you

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
win three nil then you still lend you

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.150 
win three nil then you still lend you

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
priced up at 2.9 19 to 10 so that's fair
