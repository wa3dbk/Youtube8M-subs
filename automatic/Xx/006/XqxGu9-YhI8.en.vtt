have<00:02:22.690> pictures<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.319> I'm<00:02:23.379> just<00:02:23.500> going<00:02:23.650> to

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
have pictures so I'm just going to

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.890 
have pictures so I'm just going to
follow<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.099> I<00:02:24.310> think<00:02:24.370> like<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.510> other<00:02:25.659> one<00:02:25.870> I

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
follow it I think like the other one I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.690 
follow it I think like the other one I
had<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.319> just<00:02:26.500> kind<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.769> fill<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.220> water<00:02:27.430> to

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
had you just kind of fill the water to

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.580 
had you just kind of fill the water to
the<00:02:27.849> line<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.480> mix<00:02:28.720> some<00:02:28.930> packets<00:02:29.319> together

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
the line you mix some packets together

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.580 
the line you mix some packets together
and<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.970> makes<00:02:31.180> like<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.540> goo<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.379> then<00:02:32.500> you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
and it makes like this goo and then you

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.580 
and it makes like this goo and then you
dip<00:02:32.799> it<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.040> sprinkles<00:02:33.700> or<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.780> candy<00:02:35.260> this

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
dip it in sprinkles or like candy this

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.580 
dip it in sprinkles or like candy this
one<00:02:35.829> is<00:02:36.450> soda<00:02:37.450> flavor<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.019> I<00:02:38.049> believe<00:02:38.379> because

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
one is soda flavor and I believe because

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.220 
one is soda flavor and I believe because
of<00:02:38.799> this<00:02:38.890> little<00:02:39.220> bubbly<00:02:39.610> guy<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.239> then<00:02:41.079> this

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
of this little bubbly guy and then this

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.110 
of this little bubbly guy and then this
is<00:02:41.409> pretty<00:02:41.799> much<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.040> same<00:02:42.430> thing<00:02:42.489> but<00:02:43.000> I

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
is pretty much the same thing but I

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.390 
is pretty much the same thing but I
think<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.629> needs<00:02:43.840> yogurt<00:02:44.379> flavor<00:02:44.650> yeah<00:02:45.010> so

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
think this needs yogurt flavor yeah so

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.010 
think this needs yogurt flavor yeah so
the<00:02:45.549> yogurt<00:02:45.879> on<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.090> so

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.100 

probably<00:02:54.020> yogurt<00:02:54.440> flavored<00:02:55.810> yeah<00:02:56.810> if<00:02:56.960> you

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
probably yogurt flavored yeah if you

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.650 
probably yogurt flavored yeah if you
guys<00:02:57.260> can<00:02:57.830> make<00:02:58.400> any<00:02:58.610> of<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:58.940> out<00:02:59.180> or<00:02:59.480> if
