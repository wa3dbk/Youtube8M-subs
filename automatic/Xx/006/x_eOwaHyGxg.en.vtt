00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:11.660
 I want to keep up with the changes in grain height this time 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:16.880
 It is great if you do not know the change in grain height 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:19.080
 Though I often it is a place that it would do not know what the person from his 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.810
 After all 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:28.560
 In the lateral rotation Toka would put grain sales went so but I no longer know myself 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:34.320
 There is no need to do anything complicated 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:38.180
 Basically I think it is best to attack on the top or bottom 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.210
 Inverts the ball say turned a blind after all 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:48.670
 In the place where it changes with the force and point again, it is against it 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:52.440
 Is not so much sudden reversal that changing to defeat the grain that it is under rotation Toka top rotation 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.440
 It's about 2 round trips 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:02.360
 Speaking of which, let's take out the upper rotating dry ball 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.030
 It is a rotation that is forced to use No. 2 or its point of view ability to use the amount of work. 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.500
 multiply 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.620
 Large for downward rotation 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.600
 And strongly push what kind of rotation strongly 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.480
 It is a place to take out a fast ball 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.800
 Epic only 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:23.960
 If you know it, there is no problem if you can calm down and respond 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.900
 What to rotation became weak if strong rotation Once out on the rotation comes back in 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.480
 If you put out the rotation, push your fast ball 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.690
 also 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:39.550
 If it is remembered that the ball is going back a little bit more rotation 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:42.340
 I think that there is no problem at all if there is a chance car and then you hit it 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:47.390
 Therefore we put lateral rotation or 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:50.480
 Then you beat the grain and slide 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.400
 As I will not understand myself 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:58.650
 For grain height 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:02.420
 Rotation two types of on will recommend a place called attack in the society added 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.420
 Please refer to it for reference 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.030
 pr 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.780
 I entered one 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.780
 Putsu 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.820
 The 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.810
 b 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.959
 Yes yes 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.360
 Oh yeah
