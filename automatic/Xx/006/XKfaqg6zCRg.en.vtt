at<00:01:01.050> some<00:01:01.350> point<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.770> means<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.039> become<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
at some point that means you become a

you<00:01:04.559> get<00:01:08.750> I'm<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:10.290> genius<00:01:10.650> fear<00:01:11.640> my<00:01:11.939> mind<00:01:12.240> n<00:01:12.540> my

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you get I'm a genius fear my mind n my

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.750 
you get I'm a genius fear my mind n my
uterus<00:01:13.260> doesn't<00:01:13.920> make<00:01:14.010> any<00:01:14.189> sense

uterus doesn't make any sense
25%<00:01:15.720> maybe<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.740> 25%<00:01:17.159> than<00:01:17.610> 25%<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.360> 25

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
25% maybe it's 25% than 25% of that 25

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.630 
25% maybe it's 25% than 25% of that 25
because<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.110> thinking<00:01:19.259> 25%<00:01:20.100> four<00:01:20.250> times<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
because I'm thinking 25% four times you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.580 
because I'm thinking 25% four times you
got<00:01:20.759> 0%<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.200> more<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.470> your

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
got 0% and then you do one more and your

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.890 
got 0% and then you do one more and your
negative<00:01:22.799> territory<00:01:23.310> well<00:01:23.790> that's<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
negative territory well that's just the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.090 
negative territory well that's just the
problem<00:01:25.229> with<00:01:25.320> smarter<00:01:25.680> women<00:01:25.950> not<00:01:26.070> having
