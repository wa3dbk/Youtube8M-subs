that you look very young is to just do

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.120 
that you look very young is to just do
it<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.250> not<00:01:29.310> think<00:01:29.549> about<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.939> money<00:01:30.180> and

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
an hour or two um I think that helps a

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.920 
an hour or two um I think that helps a
lot<00:06:27.090> and<00:06:28.880> obviously<00:06:29.880> eating<00:06:30.330> the<00:06:30.419> right<00:06:30.600> foods

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
lot and obviously eating the right foods

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.409 
lot and obviously eating the right foods
helps<00:06:31.260> a<00:06:31.350> lot<00:06:31.470> a<00:06:31.710> lot<00:06:31.919> of<00:06:32.039> people<00:06:32.280> go<00:06:32.520> they're

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
helps a lot a lot of people go they're

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.300 
helps a lot a lot of people go they're
stressed<00:06:33.840> out<00:06:34.020> and<00:06:34.229> then<00:06:34.349> they<00:06:34.440> eat<00:06:34.470> crap<00:06:34.950> and

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
stressed out and then they eat crap and

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.630 
stressed out and then they eat crap and
that<00:06:35.340> just<00:06:36.710> enhances<00:06:37.710> the<00:06:37.860> problem<00:06:38.370> because

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
that just enhances the problem because

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.990 
that just enhances the problem because
then<00:06:38.789> you<00:06:38.880> feel<00:06:39.060> like

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
then you feel like

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.030 
then you feel like
so<00:06:40.120> it's<00:06:40.690> hard<00:06:40.930> it<00:06:41.050> is<00:06:41.200> sometimes<00:06:41.470> when<00:06:41.890> you're
