00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:02.680
 Distribution company 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.320
 Today is another video report of water again 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 Eh crystal faced 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:13.019
 In the case of the song collection country that Ikugensan three country traffic 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.459
 I'd like to write a business card for the water source 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.339
 That 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.130
 It will be to reduce the regular deposit 15 days 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.159
 It sold in 68 years 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.179
 I have been editing 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.890
 from youtube users 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.050
 It is interesting that there is a feature of the king of France, Mr. Mizuno 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.660
 I knew you 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.840
 I can not pass Enma 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.400
 However, 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.580
 Oh yes that's America 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.950
 It was there 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.950
 I'm sure I thought I was going to get in 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.970
 American water 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.710
 It is the first time to talk to a customer about water 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.820
 It matches what you taste 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.820
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.560
 Even if it is reflected in the glass 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.560
 Showing off the swan lake 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.850
 That 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 How do you look 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.080
 I would like to drink it for a moment 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.940
 It feels like crispy 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.270
 Mania's 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.240
 The way was open 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.210
 I have a little more persistence now 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.690
 I felt like it was crisp 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.690
 There is no medicine. 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
 I would like 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.480
 To shine in management 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.360
 Though 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.520
 I agree 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.500
 After all water report is difficult 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.970
 Yeah 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.189
 First of all 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:13.219
 Tap water coming out of ordinary Osaka water supply 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.419
 In the situation that does not smell of 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:22.789
 Is it the feeling that rice rice will be such a thing 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.789
 That's why that's right 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.609
 It's not a weird feeling 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.609
 Post an example 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.209
 That's right 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.809
 Half hour ago 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.700
 Is there a taste? 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.940
 It feels like that, but I do not understand a bit 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.259
 Passage 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.039
 That meal 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.469
 That's right, it's not a plan. 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.559
 I think Saito is 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:57.510
 As for elementary school students, etc. made in the United States, special skills are many 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.359
 is not it 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.309
 Yeah it feels like 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:02.399
 I'm sorry 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:04.639
 That is the way I want to appear 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:05.399
 I think
