00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:12.450 

it's<00:01:04.400> both<00:01:04.580> all<00:01:04.820> but<00:01:05.210> it's<00:01:05.390> dirty

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.190 

almost<00:01:13.460> ball<00:01:13.670> which<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.450> about<00:01:14.720> it<00:01:14.840> not<00:01:14.960> having

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
almost ball which is about it not having

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.600 
almost ball which is about it not having
any<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:16.729> ropes<00:01:16.970> been<00:01:17.210> shortened<00:01:17.810> on<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:17.960> bit

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
any the ropes been shortened on a bit

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.980 
any the ropes been shortened on a bit
which<00:01:19.610> is<00:01:19.640> reason<00:01:20.060> why<00:01:20.120> it's<00:01:20.330> not<00:01:20.420> connect<00:01:20.930> to

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
which is reason why it's not connect to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.859 
which is reason why it's not connect to
handlebar<00:01:25.270> let's<00:01:26.270> see<00:01:26.360> if<00:01:26.420> we<00:01:26.510> can<00:01:26.660> get<00:01:26.750> this

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
handlebar let's see if we can get this

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:36.010 
handlebar let's see if we can get this
to<00:01:27.050> run

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.540 

well<00:01:37.020> I've<00:01:37.140> swapped<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.620> spark<00:01:37.890> plug<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.280> I

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
well I've swapped the spark plug out I

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.260 
well I've swapped the spark plug out I
just<00:01:38.760> put<00:01:38.880> an<00:01:38.970> old<00:01:39.150> plug<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:41.270> don't

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
just put an old plug in it and don't

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.510 
just put an old plug in it and don't
think<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.570> was<00:01:42.750> original<00:01:43.230> one<00:01:43.410> looks<00:01:44.130> okay

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
think this was original one looks okay

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.170 
think this was original one looks okay
but<00:01:45.710> I<00:01:46.710> know<00:01:47.010> that<00:01:47.220> one's<00:01:47.460> good<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.700> did<00:01:47.970> see<00:01:48.150> a

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
but I know that one's good I did see a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.410 
but I know that one's good I did see a
spark<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:50.100> maybe<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.640> need<00:01:51.150> to<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
spark so maybe we just need to do a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.890 
spark so maybe we just need to do a
spark<00:01:52.140> plug<00:01:52.170> replacement<00:01:52.500> here<00:01:53.810> we're<00:01:54.810> gonna

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
spark plug replacement here we're gonna

spark plug replacement here we're gonna
give<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.230> try<00:01:58.820> prying<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> few<00:02:00.360> times

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
