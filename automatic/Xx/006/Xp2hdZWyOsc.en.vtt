dishwashing liquid around really doing a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.240 
dishwashing liquid around really doing a
chain<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.140> stuff<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:18.710> global<00:02:19.040> because

chain and stuff in global because

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.640 
chain and stuff in global because
remember<00:02:19.460> it<00:02:19.700> is<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.850> degreaser<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:21.560> guys

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
remember it is a degreaser and you guys

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.590 
remember it is a degreaser and you guys

like this with all the apparatus and
that<00:04:18.049> would<00:04:18.259> probably<00:04:18.289> cost<00:04:18.949> about<00:04:19.190> ten

good alloy and titanium and carbon fiber

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.159 
good alloy and titanium and carbon fiber
and<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.699> materials<00:04:26.270> we're<00:04:26.479> used<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.840> on<00:04:27.020> our

also is still for aesthetic reasons as

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.840 
also is still for aesthetic reasons as
well<00:04:35.570> it's<00:04:35.960> it's<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.530> tradition<00:04:37.039> and<00:04:37.220> there's

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
well it's it's the tradition and there's

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.279 
well it's it's the tradition and there's
a<00:04:37.880> comfortable<00:04:38.389> ride<00:04:38.570> so<00:04:38.900> there's<00:04:39.080> things

a comfortable ride so there's things

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.510 
a comfortable ride so there's things
about<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.680> but<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:39.919> live<00:04:40.100> right<00:04:40.130> near<00:04:40.430> the

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
about that but I live right near the

about that but I live right near the
ocean<00:04:40.669> and<00:04:42.070> so<00:04:43.070> it<00:04:43.370> means<00:04:43.699> i<00:04:43.880> need<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:44.120> protect

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
ocean and so it means i need to protect

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.090 
ocean and so it means i need to protect
this<00:04:44.810> steel<00:04:45.110> if<00:04:45.410> you<00:04:45.530> look<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.770> lot<00:04:45.889> of<00:04:46.010> the

bikes actually cloudy if you look around

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.770 
bikes actually cloudy if you look around
here<00:04:47.960> it's<00:04:48.289> cloudy<00:04:48.590> that's<00:04:48.860> because<00:04:49.479> well<00:04:50.479> the

battery of the camera is been recharging
I've<00:04:53.150> been<00:04:53.810> painting<00:04:54.590> this<00:04:55.310> stuff<00:04:55.610> on<00:04:55.789> just

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
I've been painting this stuff on just

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.260 
I've been painting this stuff on just
thinly<00:04:56.539> just<00:04:57.199> marine<00:04:57.590> wax<00:04:57.919> and<00:04:58.310> dumb<00:04:59.030> I

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
thinly just marine wax and dumb I

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.960 
thinly just marine wax and dumb I
actually<00:04:59.510> do<00:04:59.930> want<00:05:00.289> it<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.740> get<00:05:00.979> into<00:05:01.580> lots<00:05:01.820> of

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
actually do want it to get into lots of

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.050 
actually do want it to get into lots of
nooks<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.510> crannies<00:05:02.990> because<00:05:03.919> if<00:05:04.580> I<00:05:04.759> can't

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
nooks and crannies because if I can't

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.640 
nooks and crannies because if I can't
actually<00:05:05.270> wipe<00:05:05.690> it<00:05:05.840> off<00:05:05.960> I<00:05:06.169> don't<00:05:06.349> care

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
actually wipe it off I don't care

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.140 
actually wipe it off I don't care
because<00:05:06.949> it's<00:05:07.160> those<00:05:07.310> nooks<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:07.669> crannies

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
because it's those nooks and crannies

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.420 
because it's those nooks and crannies
where<00:05:08.289> see<00:05:09.289> the<00:05:09.440> corrosion<00:05:09.740> stuff<00:05:10.220> this

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
where see the corrosion stuff this

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.969 
where see the corrosion stuff this
here's<00:05:10.699> alloy<00:05:11.090> these<00:05:11.570> are<00:05:11.780> galvanized<00:05:12.590> their

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
here's alloy these are galvanized their

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.740

find<00:05:13.250> this<00:05:13.490> stuff<00:05:13.729> back<00:05:13.970> here<00:05:14.270> there's<00:05:14.539> the

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
find this stuff back here there's the

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.010 
find this stuff back here there's the
problem<00:05:15.050> I've<00:05:15.349> had<00:05:15.380> with<00:05:15.650> rust<00:05:16.300> on<00:05:17.300> an<00:05:17.510> earlier

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
problem I've had with rust on an earlier

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.010 
problem I've had with rust on an earlier
bike<00:05:18.289> like<00:05:18.560> this<00:05:18.590> and<00:05:19.120> all<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.360> tubing's<00:05:20.810> I

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
bike like this and all the tubing's I

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.670 
bike like this and all the tubing's I
think<00:05:21.949> it's<00:05:22.070> chrome<00:05:22.510> 04<00:05:23.510> and<00:05:23.720> 30<00:05:24.020> so<00:05:24.500> it's

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
think it's chrome 04 and 30 so it's

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.230 
think it's chrome 04 and 30 so it's
prone<00:05:24.979> to<00:05:25.159> rust<00:05:25.370> as<00:05:25.550> well<00:05:25.729> one<00:05:25.940> of<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.090> best

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
prone to rust as well one of the best

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.730 
prone to rust as well one of the best
things<00:05:26.419> you<00:05:26.510> can<00:05:26.539> do<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:26.810> stop<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.229> rust<00:05:27.440> and

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
things you can do to stop the rust and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.680 
things you can do to stop the rust and
take<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.370> seat<00:05:28.610> off<00:05:28.639> and<00:05:28.970> squirt<00:05:29.270> some<00:05:29.419> fish

from corrosion and later when I've got
it<00:06:04.970> all<00:06:05.060> done<00:06:05.270> we'll<00:06:05.630> film<00:06:05.930> the<00:06:06.050> last<00:06:06.169> little

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
it all done we'll film the last little

in<00:06:07.880> the<00:06:07.970> Sun<00:06:08.180> and<00:06:08.360> you<00:06:08.479> be<00:06:08.599> the<00:06:08.630> judge<00:06:08.960> whether

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
in the Sun and you be the judge whether

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.560 
in the Sun and you be the judge whether
this<00:06:09.500> is<00:06:09.560> a<00:06:09.710> really<00:06:09.979> clean<00:06:10.250> bike<00:06:10.490> or<00:06:10.669> not<00:06:10.849> last

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
this is a really clean bike or not last

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.670 
this is a really clean bike or not last
little<00:06:11.810> thing<00:06:11.900> that<00:06:12.050> we<00:06:12.199> need<00:06:12.320> to<00:06:12.440> do<00:06:12.560> of

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
little thing that we need to do of

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.920 
little thing that we need to do of
course<00:06:12.860> which<00:06:13.099> I<00:06:13.250> I<00:06:13.520> won't<00:06:14.180> show<00:06:14.450> you<00:06:14.479> that<00:06:14.719> get

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
course which I I won't show you that get

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.490 
course which I I won't show you that get
some<00:06:15.080> lubricant<00:06:15.919> down<00:06:16.159> into

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
some lubricant down into

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.060 
some lubricant down into
these<00:06:16.620> words<00:06:16.830> in<00:06:17.010> part<00:06:17.720> wax<00:06:18.720> based<00:06:19.320> lubricant

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
these words in part wax based lubricant

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.210 
these words in part wax based lubricant
on<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:20.610> chain<00:06:21.060> these<00:06:21.330> bikes<00:06:21.570> come<00:06:21.870> with<00:06:22.020> a

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
on the chain these bikes come with a

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.410 
on the chain these bikes come with a
chain<00:06:23.220> that<00:06:23.370> won't<00:06:23.580> rust<00:06:23.850> which<00:06:24.090> is<00:06:24.240> really

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.420 
chain that won't rust which is really

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.740 
chain that won't rust which is really
nice<00:06:24.570> though<00:06:24.840> just<00:06:25.020> a<00:06:25.110> simple<00:06:25.410> wax<00:06:25.650> based

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
nice though just a simple wax based

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.440 
nice though just a simple wax based
lubricant<00:06:27.750> on<00:06:27.900> the<00:06:28.020> chain<00:06:28.260> is<00:06:28.500> sufficient<00:06:29.040> and

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
lubricant on the chain is sufficient and

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.090 
lubricant on the chain is sufficient and
there's<00:06:30.450> really<00:06:30.600> not<00:06:30.810> much<00:06:30.960> to<00:06:31.020> it<00:06:31.230> that's

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
there's really not much to it that's

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.100 
there's really not much to it that's
about<00:06:32.340> it<00:06:32.370> to<00:06:32.670> be<00:06:32.760> honest<00:06:33.030> Lee<00:06:33.180> noticed<00:06:33.960> it

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
about it to be honest Lee noticed it

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.590 
about it to be honest Lee noticed it
probably<00:06:34.590> took<00:06:34.740> me<00:06:34.920> about<00:06:35.160> 20<00:06:36.090> minutes<00:06:36.300> half

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
probably took me about 20 minutes half

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.790 
probably took me about 20 minutes half
an<00:06:36.780> hour<00:06:36.990> to<00:06:38.240> rub<00:06:39.240> all<00:06:39.450> of<00:06:39.630> that<00:06:39.840> polish<00:06:40.530> back

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
an hour to rub all of that polish back

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.070 
an hour to rub all of that polish back
once<00:06:41.040> and<00:06:41.250> dry<00:06:41.580> I<00:06:41.910> haven't<00:06:42.840> got<00:06:42.990> into<00:06:43.350> all

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
once and dry I haven't got into all
