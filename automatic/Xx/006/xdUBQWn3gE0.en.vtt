00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.990 
know some of the quality issues on some
little<00:00:14.009> things<00:00:14.190> could<00:00:14.370> be<00:00:14.490> addressed<00:00:14.820> but

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
little things could be addressed but

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.730 
little things could be addressed but
they<00:00:15.570> do<00:00:15.630> run<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> while<00:00:16.289> some<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
they do run for a while some of the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.500 
they do run for a while some of the
older<00:00:16.770> models<00:00:17.160> are<00:00:17.460> much<00:00:17.699> better<00:00:17.970> than<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
older models are much better than the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.510 
older models are much better than the
newer<00:00:18.660> ones<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.230> will<00:00:19.500> say<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.920> newer<00:00:20.100> ones<00:00:20.369> I

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
newer ones I will say the newer ones I

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.720 
newer ones I will say the newer ones I
am<00:00:20.640> not<00:00:20.880> happy<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> cold

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
am not happy with so this is a cold

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.019 
am not happy with so this is a cold
start<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> Craftsman<00:00:24.830> lt1000<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.730> was<00:00:26.849> put

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
start on a Craftsman lt1000 it was put

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.040 
start on a Craftsman lt1000 it was put
away<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.300> 2006<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.740> now<00:00:29.119> 2013<00:00:30.119> hasn't<00:00:30.929> been

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
away in 2006 it is now 2013 hasn't been

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.979 
away in 2006 it is now 2013 hasn't been
run<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.260> roughly<00:00:31.769> seven<00:00:32.700> years<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.600> was<00:00:33.780> left

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
run for roughly seven years it was left

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.170 
run for roughly seven years it was left
with<00:00:34.170> bad<00:00:34.350> gas<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.280> since<00:00:35.550> remedy

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
with bad gas in it I have since remedy

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.810 
with bad gas in it I have since remedy
that<00:00:36.390> problem<00:00:36.420> clean<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.320> carb<00:00:37.820> probably

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that problem clean the carb probably

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.130 
that problem clean the carb probably
needs<00:00:39.000> an<00:00:39.120> oil<00:00:39.180> change<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> few<00:00:39.989> other

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
needs an oil change and a few other

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
needs an oil change and a few other
things<00:00:40.410> done<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.340> otherwise<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.090> pretty

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
things done but otherwise it's in pretty

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.470 
things done but otherwise it's in pretty
damn<00:00:43.170> good<00:00:43.230> shape<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.210> let's<00:00:45.210> see<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.390> it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
damn good shape and let's see if it

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.840 
damn good shape and let's see if it
starts<00:00:45.739> running<00:00:46.739> low<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.039> battery<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
starts running low on battery on the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.750 
starts running low on battery on the
tractor<00:00:48.600> battery<00:00:49.050> my<00:00:49.320> jumper<00:00:49.649> pack<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.039> low<00:00:50.219> so

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
tractor battery my jumper pack is low so

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.930 
tractor battery my jumper pack is low so
we're<00:00:51.690> running<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:52.190> just<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.309> little<00:00:53.520> bit<00:00:53.670> here

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
we're running on just a little bit here

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:19.359 
we're running on just a little bit here
let's<00:00:54.570> hope<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> works

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.010 

juice<00:01:20.369> we're<00:01:20.790> gonna<00:01:20.909> turn<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.299> jumper<00:01:21.810> pack

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
juice we're gonna turn to jumper pack

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.390 
juice we're gonna turn to jumper pack
number<00:01:22.259> 2<00:01:24.320> jumper<00:01:25.320> pack<00:01:25.500> number<00:01:25.710> 2<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.189> hooked

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
number 2 jumper pack number 2 is hooked

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.600 
number 2 jumper pack number 2 is hooked
up<00:01:26.630> it's<00:01:27.630> kind<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.080> finicky<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.340> switch

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
up it's kind of a finicky one the switch

00:01:29.610 --> 00:02:31.850 
up it's kind of a finicky one the switch
is<00:01:29.790> broken<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.799> works

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.060 

now<00:02:32.860> if<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.610> heard<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.820> run<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:35.530> started

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
now if you heard that run that started

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.300 
now if you heard that run that started
just<00:02:36.250> playing<00:02:36.790> great<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.960> was<00:02:38.230> fantastic

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
just playing great it was fantastic

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.770 
just playing great it was fantastic
I've<00:02:39.520> got<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> little<00:02:39.850> smoke<00:02:40.120> going<00:02:40.390> on<00:02:40.510> there<00:02:40.750> I

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
I've got a little smoke going on there I

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.310 
I've got a little smoke going on there I
think<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.980> valve<00:02:42.670> cover<00:02:42.970> gasket<00:02:43.540> loves<00:02:44.080> to

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
think the valve cover gasket loves to

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.920 
think the valve cover gasket loves to
leak<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.940> they<00:02:46.090> love<00:02:46.270> to<00:02:46.300> leak<00:02:46.600> on<00:02:46.750> these

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
leak and they love to leak on these

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.200 
leak and they love to leak on these
engines<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.440> begin<00:02:47.680> with<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:48.100> that's<00:02:48.970> probably

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
engines to begin with so that's probably

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.990 
engines to begin with so that's probably
weaken<00:02:49.630> but<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:51.130> may<00:02:51.280> or<00:02:51.370> may<00:02:51.460> not<00:02:51.490> hear<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:51.910> on

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
weaken but you may or may not hear it on

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.520 
weaken but you may or may not hear it on
the<00:02:52.120> camera<00:02:52.330> there<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:52.960> a<00:02:53.160> slight<00:02:55.530> clunking

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
the camera there is a slight clunking

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.220 
the camera there is a slight clunking
noise<00:02:56.740> that's<00:02:57.700> going<00:02:57.850> on<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.390> engine<00:02:58.510> now

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
noise that's going on in the engine now

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.430 
noise that's going on in the engine now
that's<00:02:59.470> not<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.830> rod<00:03:00.510> it's<00:03:01.510> most<00:03:01.780> likely<00:03:02.230> the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
that's not the rod it's most likely the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.320 
that's not the rod it's most likely the
balancer<00:03:02.980> arms<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.830> these<00:03:05.830> engines<00:03:06.310> as<00:03:07.030> many

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
balancer arms and these engines as many

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.780 
balancer arms and these engines as many
people<00:03:07.600> know<00:03:07.860> they<00:03:08.860> really<00:03:09.070> have<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.340> tendency

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
people know they really have a tendency

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.360 
people know they really have a tendency
to<00:03:09.880> run<00:03:10.030> low<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.300> oil<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.070> smallest

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
to run low on oil and just the smallest

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.630 
to run low on oil and just the smallest
amount<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.880> low<00:03:13.510> oil<00:03:13.780> or<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.710> smallest<00:03:15.310> low

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
amount of low oil or the smallest low

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.420 
amount of low oil or the smallest low
oil<00:03:15.670> condition<00:03:16.480> on<00:03:16.660> these<00:03:16.930> motors<00:03:17.320> will<00:03:18.130> cause

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
oil condition on these motors will cause

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.900 
oil condition on these motors will cause
a<00:03:20.190> clunking<00:03:21.190> noise<00:03:21.400> like<00:03:21.550> that

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
a clunking noise like that

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.580 
a clunking noise like that
now<00:03:22.240> I<00:03:22.300> can<00:03:22.480> hear<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.750> on<00:03:22.840> low<00:03:22.990> speed<00:03:23.020> on<00:03:23.410> high

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
now I can hear it on low speed on high

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.560 
now I can hear it on low speed on high
speed<00:03:23.860> it's<00:03:24.040> not<00:03:24.100> noticeable<00:03:24.670> that's<00:03:24.910> usually

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
speed it's not noticeable that's usually

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.840 
speed it's not noticeable that's usually
the<00:03:25.840> common<00:03:26.080> symptom<00:03:26.560> if<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:27.220> was<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> rod<00:03:27.580> knock

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
the common symptom if it was a rod knock

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.550 
the common symptom if it was a rod knock
you<00:03:28.060> hear<00:03:28.300> it<00:03:28.390> on<00:03:28.480> both<00:03:28.690> high<00:03:29.020> and<00:03:29.050> low<00:03:29.170> speeds

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
you hear it on both high and low speeds

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.070 
you hear it on both high and low speeds
so<00:03:29.740> I<00:03:29.770> know<00:03:29.890> it's<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.280> balancer<00:03:30.750> I've<00:03:31.750> seen

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
so I know it's the balancer I've seen

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.080 
so I know it's the balancer I've seen
this<00:03:32.200> happen<00:03:32.500> before<00:03:32.530> with<00:03:33.430> this<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:33.970> can

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
this happen before with this you can

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.330 
this happen before with this you can
pretty<00:03:34.300> much<00:03:34.390> run<00:03:34.690> for<00:03:35.260> a<00:03:35.290> while<00:03:35.500> there's<00:03:36.190> no

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
pretty much run for a while there's no

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.890 
pretty much run for a while there's no
point<00:03:36.640> ripping<00:03:37.090> into<00:03:37.210> the<00:03:37.390> engine<00:03:37.720> and

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
point ripping into the engine and

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.540 
point ripping into the engine and
pulling<00:03:38.470> out<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.620> balancers<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:39.250> putting<00:03:39.460> in

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
pulling out the balancers and putting in

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.490 
pulling out the balancers and putting in
new<00:03:39.640> ones<00:03:39.820> it's<00:03:40.030> too<00:03:40.180> expensive<00:03:40.450> whether<00:03:41.260> you

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
new ones it's too expensive whether you

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.310 
new ones it's too expensive whether you
do<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.650> for<00:03:41.920> yourself<00:03:42.810> for<00:03:43.810> yourself<00:03:43.930> maybe

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
do it for yourself for yourself maybe

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.200 
do it for yourself for yourself maybe
for<00:03:44.710> someone<00:03:44.980> else<00:03:45.130> if<00:03:45.400> you're<00:03:45.550> tuning<00:03:46.060> this

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
for someone else if you're tuning this

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.570 
for someone else if you're tuning this
up<00:03:46.360> for<00:03:46.570> someone<00:03:46.750> it's<00:03:47.410> probably<00:03:48.070> not<00:03:48.310> worth

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
up for someone it's probably not worth

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.050 
up for someone it's probably not worth
your<00:03:48.820> time<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.180> not<00:03:49.600> worth<00:03:49.780> their<00:03:50.080> money<00:03:51.060> so

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
your time and not worth their money so

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.790 
your time and not worth their money so
in<00:03:52.180> this<00:03:52.300> case<00:03:52.570> we<00:03:52.780> might<00:03:53.020> have<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:53.470> consider

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
in this case we might have to consider

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.230 
in this case we might have to consider
two<00:03:53.980> options<00:03:54.370> running<00:03:54.610> with<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:54.910> engine

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
two options running with the engine

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.140 
two options running with the engine
until<00:03:55.540> if<00:03:56.020> maybe<00:03:56.710> the<00:03:57.040> balancer<00:03:57.400> arm<00:03:57.610> let's<00:03:58.060> go

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
until if maybe the balancer arm let's go

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.790 
until if maybe the balancer arm let's go
and<00:03:58.570> it'll<00:03:58.870> put<00:03:59.080> a<00:03:59.110> big<00:03:59.320> hole<00:03:59.470> in<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.620> engine

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
and it'll put a big hole in the engine

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.140 
and it'll put a big hole in the engine
block<00:04:00.040> or<00:04:01.170> replace<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.350> engine<00:04:02.880> before<00:04:03.880> that

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
block or replace the engine before that

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.840 
block or replace the engine before that
happens<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:04.860> probably<00:04:05.860> just<00:04:06.100> scrap<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.430> or

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
happens and probably just scrap it or

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.150 
happens and probably just scrap it or
use<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.150> for<00:04:07.180> parts<00:04:07.570> sometimes<00:04:08.410> if<00:04:08.740> you<00:04:08.860> put<00:04:09.130> a

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
use it for parts sometimes if you put a

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.180 
use it for parts sometimes if you put a
thicker<00:04:09.580> oil<00:04:09.880> in<00:04:10.210> these<00:04:10.750> engines<00:04:11.200> the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
thicker oil in these engines the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.190 
thicker oil in these engines the
balancer<00:04:12.640> noise<00:04:12.790> goes<00:04:13.060> away<00:04:13.330> because<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.990> gap

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
balancer noise goes away because the gap

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.750 
balancer noise goes away because the gap
between<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.860> balancer<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.460> crank

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
between the balancer and the crank

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.330 
between the balancer and the crank
reduces<00:04:16.720> because<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.290> thicker<00:04:17.560> oil<00:04:17.830> so

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
reduces because of the thicker oil so

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.729 
reduces because of the thicker oil so
that's<00:04:18.520> one<00:04:18.730> way<00:04:18.880> you<00:04:18.910> can<00:04:19.180> stop<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:20.080> but<00:04:20.350> you

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
that's one way you can stop that but you

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.000 
that's one way you can stop that but you
got<00:04:20.920> to<00:04:21.040> know<00:04:21.070> that<00:04:21.480> that<00:04:22.740> clearance<00:04:23.740> that's

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
got to know that that clearance that's

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.190 
got to know that that clearance that's
there<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.400> still<00:04:24.850> there<00:04:25.120> it's<00:04:25.540> just<00:04:25.780> reduced

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
there is still there it's just reduced

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.020 
there is still there it's just reduced
ever<00:04:26.440> so<00:04:26.650> slightly<00:04:26.890> so<00:04:27.160> it<00:04:27.280> will<00:04:27.430> continue<00:04:27.760> to

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
ever so slightly so it will continue to

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.320 
ever so slightly so it will continue to
wear<00:04:28.270> as<00:04:28.540> it<00:04:28.720> goes<00:04:28.870> along<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:31.090> really

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
wear as it goes along that this really

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.490 
wear as it goes along that this really
sort<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:31.930> sucks<00:04:33.630> wasn't<00:04:34.630> expecting<00:04:35.140> to<00:04:35.170> hear

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
sort of sucks wasn't expecting to hear

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.070 
sort of sucks wasn't expecting to hear
that<00:04:35.710> I'm<00:04:36.190> not<00:04:36.370> gonna<00:04:36.550> lie<00:04:36.730> was<00:04:37.360> not<00:04:37.570> expecting

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
that I'm not gonna lie was not expecting

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.930 
that I'm not gonna lie was not expecting
hear<00:04:38.230> that<00:04:38.410> noise<00:04:38.530> I<00:04:38.770> was<00:04:38.890> hoping<00:04:39.160> this<00:04:39.700> would

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
hear that noise I was hoping this would

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.430 
hear that noise I was hoping this would
be<00:04:40.120> just<00:04:41.190> straight<00:04:42.190> clear<00:04:42.729> cut<00:04:43.110> tuned<00:04:44.110> up<00:04:44.260> and

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
be just straight clear cut tuned up and

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.950 
be just straight clear cut tuned up and
it<00:04:44.590> should

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
it should

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.290 
it should
great<00:04:45.139> but<00:04:45.440> you<00:04:46.430> know<00:04:46.550> people<00:04:47.030> don't<00:04:47.120> always

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
great but you know people don't always

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.290 
great but you know people don't always
mention<00:04:47.750> things<00:04:47.930> like<00:04:48.080> that<00:04:48.350> so<00:04:48.860> I<00:04:49.220> will<00:04:50.090> have

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
mention things like that so I will have

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.990 
mention things like that so I will have
to<00:04:50.479> talk<00:04:51.110> to<00:04:51.860> the<00:04:51.949> owner<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:52.220> figure<00:04:52.580> out<00:04:52.610> what

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
to talk to the owner and figure out what

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.089 
to talk to the owner and figure out what
we<00:04:53.660> should<00:04:53.690> do<00:04:53.960> I<00:04:53.990> mean<00:04:54.259> you<00:04:54.440> can<00:04:54.740> run<00:04:54.919> with

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
we should do I mean you can run with

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.480 
we should do I mean you can run with
this<00:04:55.509> the<00:04:56.509> way<00:04:56.630> it<00:04:56.690> is<00:04:56.840> but<00:04:57.349> chances<00:04:58.099> are<00:04:58.250> it'll

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
this the way it is but chances are it'll

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.870 
this the way it is but chances are it'll
blow<00:04:58.759> up<00:04:58.880> eventually<00:04:59.120> so<00:05:00.400> I'm<00:05:01.400> sure<00:05:01.610> this<00:05:01.759> is

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
blow up eventually so I'm sure this is

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.219 
blow up eventually so I'm sure this is
gonna<00:05:02.000> make<00:05:02.210> for<00:05:02.330> a<00:05:02.389> great<00:05:02.479> cold<00:05:02.780> start<00:05:03.050> but

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
gonna make for a great cold start but

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.570 
gonna make for a great cold start but
not<00:05:03.440> very<00:05:03.740> happy<00:05:04.220> with<00:05:04.370> that<00:05:04.400> noise<00:05:04.729> so<00:05:05.720> I<00:05:05.750> hope

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
not very happy with that noise so I hope

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.800 
not very happy with that noise so I hope
hope<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.729> enjoy<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.030> video<00:05:08.270> is<00:05:08.449> kind<00:05:08.780> of

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
hope you enjoy the video is kind of

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.080 
hope you enjoy the video is kind of
short<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.430> as<00:05:10.430> always<00:05:10.699> thank<00:05:10.970> you<00:05:11.000> for

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
short and as always thank you for
