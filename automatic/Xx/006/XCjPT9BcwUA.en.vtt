00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.839
 Hello everybody I welcome you has just arrived at the Loferer Alm 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.360
 four and a half hours drive from Bamberg 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.700
 At the end of our Online Ski Special you can hear early 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.280
 broken up and to test the ski area in the Saalachtal the outer 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.780
 Conditions are Schwab effect blue sky fresh snow and temperatures around the 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.609
 freezing point 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.179
 Students with children have been registered 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.060
 Dino free 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.869
 it is a real family ski area 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.649
 In the Kinderland, like lawyers, skiing learns playfully 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.290
 even a day trip 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.560
 Paying for two or four child families is worthwhile here 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.560
 66 euros per day 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 also for the big ones and the trip on the career choice 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.350
 Outside the holidays are the waiting times there 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.269
 short 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.220
 be offered 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.870
 Upo is not on the way in the clear ski area 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.090
 Above all, certainly not an address for professional riders 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.620
 Anyone looking for a challenge must take a closer look 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.460
 therefore the Australian ski instructor serves 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.160
 He worked in Lofer six months a year 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 and know where in the ski resort the Reds Ki Ka and Paul cyclists meet it 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.700
 will be a great picture of Terry 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.750
 me and trainers 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.520
 to be the suspect for 19 years 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.520
 the best Swiss result 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.969
 Velden 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.910
 which place would be on request 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.270
 At noon you will be in the cozy supercar 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.400
 the prices are absolutely fair 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.710
 for ten euros you get a hot meal + great drink 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.040
 the mood at the retreat is relaxed 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.040
 We quickly get into conversation with other guests 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.320
 the day is slowly coming to an end one last time he found with the 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.379
 Life of it 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.739
 then it goes for downhill and home
