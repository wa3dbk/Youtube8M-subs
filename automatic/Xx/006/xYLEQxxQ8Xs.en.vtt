00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:11.949 
of my other Scrolls lore series

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.379 
of my other Scrolls lore series
originally<00:00:12.949> I<00:00:12.980> wanted<00:00:13.309> this<00:00:13.639> episode<00:00:14.119> to<00:00:14.270> be

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
originally I wanted this episode to be

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.750 
originally I wanted this episode to be
specifically<00:00:15.170> about<00:00:15.529> Imperials<00:00:16.219> and<00:00:16.430> then

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
specifically about Imperials and then

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.210 
specifically about Imperials and then
move<00:00:17.029> on<00:00:17.240> to<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:17.510> ad<00:00:17.750> races<00:00:18.380> further<00:00:18.770> in<00:00:19.070> the

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
move on to the ad races further in the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.550 
move on to the ad races further in the
series<00:00:19.640> but<00:00:20.270> then<00:00:20.480> I<00:00:20.510> realized<00:00:21.109> that<00:00:21.349> we

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
series but then I realized that we

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.470 
series but then I realized that we
should<00:00:21.769> probably<00:00:22.039> first<00:00:22.609> talk<00:00:22.910> about<00:00:23.240> how<00:00:23.419> the

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
should probably first talk about how the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.929 
should probably first talk about how the
races<00:00:23.779> are<00:00:24.079> divided<00:00:24.589> so<00:00:25.279> that<00:00:25.310> you<00:00:25.730> can

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
races are divided so that you can

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.140 
races are divided so that you can
understand<00:00:26.599> everything<00:00:26.990> better<00:00:27.380> I<00:00:27.759> am<00:00:28.759> going

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
understand everything better I am going
