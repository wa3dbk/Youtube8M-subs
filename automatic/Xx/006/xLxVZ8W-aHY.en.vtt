00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
white and gold there's a lot of

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.350 
white and gold there's a lot of
explanations<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.670> why<00:00:41.790> people<00:00:42.270> are

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
explanations as to why people are

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
perceiving these two radically different

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.680 
perceiving these two radically different
color<00:00:44.160> palettes<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.059> I'll<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.300> touch<00:00:45.510> the

color palettes so I'll just touch the
basics<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.320> I've<00:00:47.039> actually<00:00:47.219> been

rambling on for about 10 minutes but
it's<00:00:49.140> mostly<00:00:49.379> boring<00:00:49.620> technical<00:00:49.890> joking<00:00:50.399> so

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it's mostly boring technical joking so

those of you who already see white and
gold<00:01:34.450> this<00:01:35.260> is<00:01:35.410> not<00:01:35.620> a<00:01:35.650> massive<00:01:36.130> conspiracy<00:01:36.460> I

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
gold this is not a massive conspiracy I

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.390

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
originally saw white and gold until I

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.920 
originally saw white and gold until I
took<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.790> image<00:01:40.120> and<00:01:40.330> adjusted<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.900> exposure

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
took the image and adjusted the exposure

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.370 
took the image and adjusted the exposure
in<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.680> photo<00:01:41.920> processing<00:01:42.240> application<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:44.350> I

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
in a photo processing application now I

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.260 
in a photo processing application now I
could<00:01:44.710> clearly<00:01:45.100> see<00:01:45.490> that<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.790> dress<00:01:46.060> was

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270
