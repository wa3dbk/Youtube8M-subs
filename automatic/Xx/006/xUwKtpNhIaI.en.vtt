 if this can not be allowed to hit the center field 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:48.229

 if it is that people have 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.750

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.759
 final nothing happened 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.729
 what's that 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.470
 at the foot of the mountain that competes in the pocket 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.930
 are the lodge cabins with enough space to house some 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.729

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.259
 of typical cabins as headquarters of the x people

 country houses are not only sophisticated houses in cases of this field but 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.580
 very comfortable all the houses have 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.340
 the main thing is a chimney 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.270
 it's a way to warm up close to people and we have cabins for them to come 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.400
 by the way to me the completes of 10 15 people we have horses with double 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.770
 bedroom and horses a simple bedroom 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.660
 but this style among the people who come will like the field because we are 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.660

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.150
 in the same space which create a chacota in the act 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.509
 It was in boxes derived from Quichua which means Peña is a place that we should 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:50.639
 keep it 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:51.599
