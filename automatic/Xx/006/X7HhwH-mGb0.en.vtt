00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
later this was in a very very different

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.560 
later this was in a very very different
state<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.760> mind<00:00:56.970> and<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:58.200> one<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.950> most

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
state of mind and it's one of the most

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.590 
state of mind and it's one of the most
purely<00:01:00.570> joyful<00:01:01.559> pieces<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:03.120> he<00:01:03.510> ever<00:01:03.690> wrote

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
purely joyful pieces that he ever wrote

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.840 
purely joyful pieces that he ever wrote
he<00:01:06.600> was<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.899> love<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.189> countess<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850

got anywhere

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:20.629 
got anywhere
somehow<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.229> feeling<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.950> joy<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:20.639 
somehow the feeling of joy and

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:24.620 
somehow the feeling of joy and
exploration<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:22.340> alive<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.609> every<00:01:23.850> bar<00:01:24.329> of

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
exploration is alive in every bar of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.399 
exploration is alive in every bar of
this<00:01:24.869> symphony<00:01:25.490> but<00:01:26.490> Beethoven<00:01:27.209> starts<00:01:27.779> in

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
this symphony but Beethoven starts in

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.789 
this symphony but Beethoven starts in
really<00:01:29.039> a<00:01:29.069> type<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.520> Darkness<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.590> know

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
really a type of Darkness you don't know

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.550 
really a type of Darkness you don't know
what<00:01:32.130> P<00:01:32.789> it<00:01:32.969> is<00:01:33.149> you<00:01:33.659> don't<00:01:33.929> know<00:01:34.139> where<00:01:34.380> it's

what P it is you don't know where it's
going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.009> go<00:01:35.329> it<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.569> as<00:01:36.719> though<00:01:39.170> you're

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
going to go it is as though you're

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.819 
going to go it is as though you're
trying<00:01:40.529> to<00:01:40.740> search<00:01:41.069> your<00:01:41.459> way<00:01:41.700> once<00:01:42.179> again<00:01:42.829> out

of some kind of despair some kind of

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.120 
of some kind of despair some kind of
problem<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:48.270> when<00:01:48.479> daylight<00:01:49.049> comes<00:01:49.499> it<00:01:49.889> comes

problem but when daylight comes it comes
in<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.700> kind<00:01:51.029> of<00:01:51.270> blinding<00:01:52.079> flash<00:01:52.499> and<00:01:54.380> then<00:01:55.380> you

in a kind of blinding flash and then you

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:59.179 
in a kind of blinding flash and then you
have<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> symphony<00:01:57.049> indebted<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.529> the<00:01:58.679> idea<00:01:59.099> of

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
have a symphony indebted to the idea of

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.019 
have a symphony indebted to the idea of
Hyden<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.469> intelligence<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.829> joy<00:02:02.459> of<00:02:02.789> high

Hyden of intelligence of joy of high
spirits<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:04.130> humor<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:06.119> also<00:02:07.459> with<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
spirits of humor but also with the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.380 
spirits of humor but also with the
characteristic<00:02:09.800> darkness<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:11.360> Beethoven<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
characteristic darkness of Beethoven the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.160 
characteristic darkness of Beethoven the
characteristic<00:02:13.610> mystery<00:02:14.610> he<00:02:14.910> gives<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:16.020> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
characteristic mystery he gives in the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.200 
characteristic mystery he gives in the
middle<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> first<00:02:16.860> movement<00:02:17.250> there<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.060> a

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
middle of the first movement there is a

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.940 
middle of the first movement there is a
passage

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
passage

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.600 
passage
again<00:02:19.870> where<00:02:20.870> all<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.770> themes<00:02:21.980> seem<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.490> be

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
again where all the themes seem to be

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.220 
again where all the themes seem to be
fragmented<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.480> they're<00:02:23.660> searching<00:02:23.900> for

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
fragmented and they're searching for

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.370 
fragmented and they're searching for
where<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.860> come

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
where to come

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.330 
where to come
extraordinary<00:02:27.380> music<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:29.150> second<00:02:29.599> movement

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
extraordinary music the second movement

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.760 
extraordinary music the second movement
is<00:02:31.340> quite<00:02:31.580> simply<00:02:32.120> one<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.959> great<00:02:33.200> love

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
is quite simply one of the great love

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.360 
is quite simply one of the great love
songs<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:35.180> literature<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:36.370> there's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
songs in the literature and there's

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.760 
songs in the literature and there's
times<00:02:37.700> when<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.330> Beethoven<00:02:38.989> who<00:02:39.080> seems<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:39.500> very

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
times when a Beethoven who seems so very

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.790 
times when a Beethoven who seems so very
Deutsch<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.910> craggy<00:02:41.239> could<00:02:41.959> almost<00:02:42.170> appear

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
Deutsch and craggy could almost appear

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.759 
Deutsch and craggy could almost appear
like<00:02:43.069> an<00:02:43.220> Italian<00:02:43.730> opera<00:02:43.989> composer<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.620> in

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
like an Italian opera composer so in

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.470 
like an Italian opera composer so in
this<00:02:45.920> sings<00:02:46.310> like<00:02:46.760> one<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.269> greatest

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
this sings like one of the greatest

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.460 
this sings like one of the greatest
Sopranos<00:02:48.319> in<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.590> world<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.690> my<00:02:50.690> great<00:02:51.019> late

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
Sopranos in the world and my great late
