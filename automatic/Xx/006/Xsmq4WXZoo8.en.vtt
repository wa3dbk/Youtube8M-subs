00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.160
 but 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.650
 the computer the generation of 800 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.570
 introduce in the early 70's was the first in general to be 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.970
 self-assembled in place with little success 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.220
 however many historians consider it an incentive and 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.220
 principles of the function of personal computers 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.579
 for jobs honduras the assistant of michael in the special 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.349
 from the University of Córdoba 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.289
 the machine he calls seijas downgraded one could have the same impact 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.650
 someday that the itson to drown could be a pity to see machine that 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.000
 replicates claims object loaded on a computer 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.090
 Such a device could change how we acquire products like 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.290
 for example, instead of buying an iphone, it would download the internet plans and the 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.630
 faith and jordan one for you 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.340
 three young machines develop from the used two-dimensional printers 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.410
 currently by industrial engineers for rapid prototypes 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.270
 different parts in design programs started and feed the designs of 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.670
 the printers and nationals to be classic models of work 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.920
 a three-dimensional civilian printer Victor small exploring the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.160
 before and backwards through a surface depositing minute pharmacies 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.760
 the plastic that quickly hardness 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.850
 after each statement the director raised a notch and explored 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.980
 again until it has formed full text layer by layer 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.830
 by nipple injectors with interchangeable cartridges the machine can create 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.120
 objects made of various materials 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.610
 electronic circuit 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.000
 It can be built by combining organic semiconductor ribbons 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.490
 metallic and ceramic insulators 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.640
 the ps for these machines average about 100 thousand 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.570
 dollars but now you can build your own for this reason for 2 thousand 300 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.100
 Dollars 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.390
 is the value of the available pieces 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.100
 the prototype designed for filming brown in dyeing 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.560
 computational itson 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.200
 it's slower than commercial floor models 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.980
 solutions with ability to produce fine details is lower 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.930
 the country machines of the future will use other types of raw materials 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.910
 and will easily deposit the material in three dimensions I am not able 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:17.349
 For this purpose his laboratory is already taking steps to build a machine that 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.859
 use castro 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.879
 Luis Vazquez elaborated in different subjects 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.459
 the long-term goal of living writing a complete robot including the 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.429
 conservative members the control circuit and the batteries 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:35.279
 meanwhile that expects that in the same way as the previous computer 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.179
 I ask a whole generation to add devices such as the 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.839
 keyboard the expected drivers that will impact operating systems and 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:47.719
 word processors maybe the afp work because it explains a new kind of 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.149
 technology
