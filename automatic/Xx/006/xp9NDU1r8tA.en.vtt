00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 that have given the youtube band this 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.779
 your banner drives like this you know today 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.360
 September 19 apple released its last 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.849
 year is the latest version this version is 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.639
 the 6.0 for the following devices 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.820
 for iphone 3gs for the and patache 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.789
 fourth generation for iphone 4 for 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:27.480
 iphone 4s for the new ipad and the 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:30.210
 ipad 2 and obviously for the iphone 5 and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.149
 there is for thaci fifth generation and then 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.590
 the question is 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.289
 sacrifice the jailbreak to update 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.079
 this year is how you already know if 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.449
 you update 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.519
 this year of 6.0 they will lose 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.000
 they will lose Syria they will be able to completely 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:51.479
 what they have come down from Syria and simple 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.969
 break for ios 6.0 but this nothing more 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:57.500
 it's for iphone 4 for battle 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.049
 fourth generation and for the iphone 3gs 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.379
 but this one of him for the one 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:10.259
 device that has brittle helium in 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.409
 the year of 6.0 is the iphone 3gs other is 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:18.060
 simply that device that has the 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:19.890
 helium break understand in the year 6.0 and if 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.080
 they want me I can make a video of how 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.140
 do the jailbreak to those devices 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.750
 fourth generation or iphone 3gs with 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.840
 ios 6.0 just let's see here in the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.180
 comments but as I say it's worth the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.360
 worth sacrificing this 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.140
 I studied a break to have that year of 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.990
 6.0 maybe if it depends on the person if 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.300
 you have maybe an iphone 4s if you have 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.210
 an ipad an ipad 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.910
 third generation because they are the only 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.290
 two devices well obviously the 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:58.470
 iphone 5 and the ipad touch and fifth 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.840
 generation have served now in Spanish 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.310
 and the other one in Spanish and also the maps 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.920
 the three- dimensional tri that now bring 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.360
 on their devices for my 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.790
 opinion for those two reasons 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.160
 would update and lose the I break if 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.870
 I really use those two 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.660
 characteristics that those 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.540
 devices if you have an iphone 4 if 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.160
 you have a 4th generation screen if 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.400
 you have a 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.200
 iphone3gs if you have an ipad 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.230
 second generation I think I already said 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.110
 the truth and I would not recommend them 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.330
 update until there is a field break 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.860
 understand for the year 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.200
 6.0 and good in itself that was all my everything 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:50.340
 this video here I am on the iphone 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.340
 white with ios 6.0 there is 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.829
 just the big two 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.819
 characteristics that it brings is sawdust 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:02.700
 espanyol in the air 6.0 and maps 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:07.049
 three-dimensional but that's just 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.769
 for the iphone 4s and the new ipad touch 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:14.060
 fifth generation the ipad 3 and the new 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.670
 iphone 5 that we hope to be the maximum 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.700
 for this Friday and well that's how it was 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.450
 all about this video and update by 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.780
 error those who have the iphone 4s or the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.090
 ipad 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.280
 the ipad third generation by the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.740
 moment there is no downgrade for those two 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.540
 good devices now yes there we 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.660
 we see in the following video 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.660
