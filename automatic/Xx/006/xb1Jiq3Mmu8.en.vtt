in either case this annoying dinging

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.830 
in either case this annoying dinging
happens<00:00:28.910> for<00:00:29.910> some<00:00:29.939> reason<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.570> all<00:00:30.689> their

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840

happens for some reason and all their
wisdom<00:00:31.019> they<00:00:31.230> decided<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.679> let<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> Bell<00:00:33.090> ding

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
wisdom they decided to let the Bell ding

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.319 
wisdom they decided to let the Bell ding
forever<00:00:33.899> instead<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.829> at<00:00:35.489> some<00:00:35.730> point<00:00:35.969> turning

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
forever instead of at some point turning

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.720 
forever instead of at some point turning
off<00:00:36.480> while<00:00:37.350> you're<00:00:37.530> driving<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.100> fact<00:00:38.399> ours

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
off while you're driving in fact ours

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.700 
off while you're driving in fact ours
would<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.120> going<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.809> while<00:00:40.079> both<00:00:40.320> doors<00:00:40.559> are

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
would be going on while both doors are

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.020 
would be going on while both doors are
shutting<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> keys<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.460> out<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> car<00:00:41.940> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
shutting the keys are out of the car it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.299 
shutting the keys are out of the car it
would<00:00:42.120> still<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.329> dinging<00:00:42.950> which<00:00:43.950> would<00:00:44.190> in

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
would still be dinging which would in

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.619 
would still be dinging which would in
fact<00:00:44.460> drains<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> battery<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> point

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
fact drains the battery to the point

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.000 
fact drains the battery to the point
where<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.989> couldn't<00:00:46.170> start<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> car<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.980> just

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
where we couldn't start the car so just

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.250 
where we couldn't start the car so just
a<00:00:47.309> stupid<00:00:47.640> design<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:51.050> basically<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.079> was

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
a stupid design and basically I was

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.139 
a stupid design and basically I was
googling<00:00:52.530> looking<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> way<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.760> fix<00:00:54.030> this

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
googling looking for a way to fix this

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.020 
googling looking for a way to fix this
stupid<00:00:54.510> thing<00:00:55.460> could<00:00:56.460> bring<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.760> into<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
stupid thing could bring it into the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.910 
stupid thing could bring it into the
shop<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.899> never<00:00:58.050> really<00:00:58.320> cared<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
shop but I never really cared for the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.709 
shop but I never really cared for the
automatic<00:00:59.579> doors<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.090> begin<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> was

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
automatic doors to begin with it was

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.260 
automatic doors to begin with it was
just<00:01:00.930> sort<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.399> bonus<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:03.059> looking

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
just sort of a bonus so I was looking

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.539 
just sort of a bonus so I was looking
there<00:01:03.329> must<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> way<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.379> use<00:01:05.159> these<00:01:05.400> as

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
there must be a way to just use these as

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.210 
there must be a way to just use these as
manual<00:01:06.030> doors<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> tutorial<00:01:07.950> on

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
manual doors so this is a tutorial on

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.830 
manual doors so this is a tutorial on
how<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.490> make<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.000> happen<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.540> actually

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
how to make that happen it's actually

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.740 
how to make that happen it's actually
quite<00:01:10.080> simple<00:01:11.090> it's<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.210> matter<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.600> pulling

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
quite simple it's a matter of pulling

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.740 
quite simple it's a matter of pulling
three<00:01:13.140> fuses<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.970> then<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.270> manual

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
three fuses and then you have manual

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.390 
three fuses and then you have manual
doors<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.259> there's<00:01:16.470> no<00:01:16.619> side<00:01:16.890> effects<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
doors and there's no side effects that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.609 
doors and there's no side effects that
that<00:01:17.759> I've<00:01:18.060> seen<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.930> one<00:01:19.530> of

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
that I've seen so if you have one of

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.289 
that I've seen so if you have one of
these<00:01:19.710> uplanders<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.700> want<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.119> get

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
these uplanders and you want to just get

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.450 
these uplanders and you want to just get
rid<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> power<00:01:21.840> doors<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:23.159> use<00:01:23.280> them

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
rid of the power doors and just use them

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.890 
rid of the power doors and just use them
manually<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.360> rid<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.600> dinging

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
manually and get rid of the dinging

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.410 
manually and get rid of the dinging
there's<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> very<00:01:25.380> easy<00:01:25.439> way<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.430> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
there's a very easy way to do it so to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.450 
there's a very easy way to do it so to
start<00:01:27.659> with<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.950> open<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.220> fuse

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
start with you have to open the fuse

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.100 
start with you have to open the fuse
panel<00:01:29.610> obviously<00:01:30.270> which<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.540> located<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
panel obviously which is located on the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.700 
panel obviously which is located on the
passenger<00:01:31.560> side<00:01:31.770> -<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.200> once<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.320> open<00:01:34.350> that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
passenger side - and once you open that

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.240 
passenger side - and once you open that
up<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.640> pull<00:01:36.390> basically<00:01:37.200> fuses<00:01:37.740> if

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
up you have to pull basically fuses if

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.530 
up you have to pull basically fuses if
you<00:01:38.369> look<00:01:38.490> at<00:01:38.610> your<00:01:38.729> owners<00:01:39.000> manual<00:01:39.030> you'll

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
you look at your owners manual you'll

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.030 
you look at your owners manual you'll
see<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> directions<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.650> basically

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
see the directions for it you basically

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.490 
see the directions for it you basically
see<00:01:41.250> fuses<00:01:43.579> 21and<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.869> two<00:01:46.049> monster

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
see fuses 21and and the two monster

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.480 
see fuses 21and and the two monster
fuses<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.009> bottom<00:01:47.369> which<00:01:47.520> are<00:01:48.320> 24<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.490> 25

off to the races you should no longer
have<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> dinging<00:02:05.040> then<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.759> either

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
have the dinging then you can either

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.660 
have the dinging then you can either
decide<00:02:06.270> or<00:02:06.450> not<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:07.409> get<00:02:08.039> though<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
decide or not to get though the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.850 
decide or not to get though the
actuators<00:02:09.209> fix<00:02:09.450> press<00:02:09.750> we<00:02:09.959> were<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.410> Florida

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
actuators fix press we were in Florida

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.190 
actuators fix press we were in Florida
and<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.569> we<00:02:12.569> need

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
and we we need

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.300 
and we we need
straight<00:02:13.410> away<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:13.860> just<00:02:13.980> pulled<00:02:14.190> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
straight away so we just pulled the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.940 
straight away so we just pulled the
fuses<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:14.910> may<00:02:15.090> or<00:02:15.209> may<00:02:15.330> not<00:02:15.480> ever<00:02:15.959> replace

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
fuses and I may or may not ever replace

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.920 
fuses and I may or may not ever replace
the<00:02:17.280> parts<00:02:17.700> until<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.209> actually<00:02:18.510> sell<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
the parts until I actually sell the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.430 
the parts until I actually sell the
vehicle<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.700> that's<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.940> hope<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:22.230> was

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
vehicle so that's it hope this was

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.190 
vehicle so that's it hope this was
useful<00:02:22.470> for<00:02:22.890> you
