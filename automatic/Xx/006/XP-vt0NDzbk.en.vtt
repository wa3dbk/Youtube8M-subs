00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.889
 good to all of you carnal that I 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.589
 you are seeing life and I bring you a 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:16.670
 gameplay but a tutorial or a way 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:19.340
 easier or so you can learn how 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.400
 change the color looks in the 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.039
 resident evil 6 jazz in the hard demagogue 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.679
 it just that an option sounds like 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.590
 better note more options we are going to 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.940
 game settings 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.940
 and I 'm just a friend 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.770
 Greetings and thanks for having dreamed and 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.390
 here is something very simple very easy but 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.120
 that many do not know I see that all 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.800
 they have a red one and I say if they knew 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.840
 they could change the color or the same 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.309
 they do not like it in that way 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.040
 several laces not to vary because 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.220
 they always give us the red mine and friend 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.129
 Personally I do not like more than anything if 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.860
 we pass the options if it is not in using it 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.710
 will not start to give it a use includes what 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.350
 as the truth that I prefer to show 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.180
 icons yes or no this does not work for the 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.759
 Call of Duty type looks more than anything the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.900
 lines around the weapon for example the 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.210
 as if it were nothing 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.010
 the north and the south the east and the west of 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.430
 these white mines delegated 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.500
 it helps us to leave them to remove them and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.260
 what are you seeing the doctor that is the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.850
 Laser peephole has its disadvantages 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.310
 of 102 advantages 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.930
 to me first I prefer hardware 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.650
 and normal more 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.850
 in the portion of the sight that is normal 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.190
 show that while for advice with 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.250
 a friend can already tell you that you can not 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.130
 yes and the subtitles if they like not 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.320

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.240
 very fast video just so you know if 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.500

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.780
 You can remove that new sight that you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.130

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.619

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.100
