00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that if you actually want to buy him

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.870 
that if you actually want to buy him
even<00:01:39.299> though<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.689> much<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.829> yeah<00:01:40.920> 610<00:01:41.700> k

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
even though is this much but yeah 610 k

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.350 
even though is this much but yeah 610 k
listen<00:01:42.150> 4<00:01:42.360> 820<00:01:43.290> well<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.280> well<00:01:44.670> actually<00:01:45.119> no

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
I'm just more for 800 of 5k which is

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.999 
I'm just more for 800 of 5k which is
ridiculous<00:01:48.020> that's<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.170> does<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.439> 200k

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
ridiculous that's what does have 200k

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.039 
ridiculous that's what does have 200k
profit<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.670> one<00:01:50.820> pyre<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.840> come<00:01:52.020> back

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
profit on one pyre and then we come back

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.600 
profit on one pyre and then we come back
like<00:01:52.350> five<00:01:52.619> minutes<00:01:52.920> later<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.399> he<00:01:53.460> actually

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
like five minutes later and he actually

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.380 
like five minutes later and he actually
sold<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.920> as<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.189> see<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.399> 805<00:01:57.000> k<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
sold and as you can see for 805 k and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.209 
sold and as you can see for 805 k and
look<00:01:57.570> we've<00:01:57.780> we've<00:01:58.320> gotten<00:01:58.590> gotten<00:01:58.740> over<00:01:59.040> 1

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
look we've we've gotten gotten over 1

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.480 
look we've we've gotten gotten over 1
which<00:01:59.880> is<00:01:59.939> mad<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:00.719> we<00:02:00.899> got<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.110> one<00:02:01.259> for

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
which is mad then we got this one for

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.880 
which is mad then we got this one for
655<00:02:02.490> k<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.630> then<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.590> cheapest

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
655 k and we can then this the cheapest

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.999 
655 k and we can then this the cheapest
at<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.070> time<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> think<00:02:05.520> was<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.049> 845<00:02:07.049> one<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
at the time I think was the 845 one that

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.499 
at the time I think was the 845 one that
means<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.399> list<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:08.910> up<00:02:09.000> for<00:02:09.300> a

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
means you can list this one up for a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.290 
means you can list this one up for a
massive<00:02:09.989> 200k<00:02:10.800> profit<00:02:11.250> again

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
massive 200k profit again

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.140 
massive 200k profit again
like<00:02:13.160> 840<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.190> feel<00:02:14.400> really<00:02:14.520> still<00:02:14.790> form<00:02:15.060> not

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
for how much does this one up for quite

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.890 
for how much does this one up for quite
a<00:02:58.830> bit<00:02:59.040> actually<00:02:59.160> with<00:02:59.520> this<00:02:59.610> deal<00:02:59.730> for<00:02:59.940> 290<00:03:00.720> k

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
a bit actually with this deal for 290 k

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.890 
a bit actually with this deal for 290 k
which<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.200> mad<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.920> well<00:03:02.610> just<00:03:02.760> under<00:03:03.030> 290<00:03:03.720> k

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
which is mad and well just under 290 k

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.720 
which is mad and well just under 290 k
which<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.860> nice<00:03:05.040> bit<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.280> profit<00:03:05.430> every<00:03:05.700> a

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
which is a nice bit of profit every a

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.630 
which is a nice bit of profit every a
record<00:03:06.150> for<00:03:06.330> 236<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.410> we<00:03:07.470> can<00:03:07.560> list<00:03:07.710> up<00:03:07.830> for<00:03:07.950> 270

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
record for 236 it we can list up for 270

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.800 
record for 236 it we can list up for 270
I<00:03:08.670> think<00:03:08.910> we<00:03:08.970> list<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.180> all<00:03:09.270> before<00:03:09.510> or<00:03:09.750> just

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
I think we list it all before or just

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.800 
I think we list it all before or just
under<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.560> air<00:03:10.650> just<00:03:10.800> on<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.100> 270<00:03:11.640> which<00:03:12.630> is

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
under the air just on the 270 which is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.080 
under the air just on the 270 which is
sick<00:03:13.410> profit<00:03:13.620> as<00:03:13.890> well<00:03:14.070> we<00:03:14.550> come<00:03:14.700> back<00:03:14.880> and

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
sick profit as well we come back and

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.310 
sick profit as well we come back and
then<00:03:15.210> to<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> sword<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.870> we<00:03:15.960> actually<00:03:16.080> gonna

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
then to a sword and we actually gonna

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.070 
then to a sword and we actually gonna
pick<00:03:16.470> up<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.800> actually<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.370> bomb<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.940> think<00:03:18.930> that's

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080
