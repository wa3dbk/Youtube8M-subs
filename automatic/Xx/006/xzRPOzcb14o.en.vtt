 possible recipes of which at the time 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.320
 to develop the recipe some of its 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.900
 ingredients are either red wine or 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.879

 its varieties so nothing today 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.940
 we started we premiered and the first thing 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.030
 that we are going to teach you how to do is a 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.409
 reduction of red wine a reduction 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.449
 of the red wine that is wonderful in 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.430
 the kitchen is a basic that can be 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.500
 have always and what is ideal for example 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.199
 with what we have on the table with a 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.350
 foie with any type of patten with 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.390
 cheeses is kind of a kind of 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.560
 companion that we could define 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.920
 as a kind of companion to 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.490
 any table what 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.990
 say worth patés cheeses and others is a 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.729
 basic that we can have in the kitchen and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.729
 is a bar according to basic, besides 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.590
 what do you know and have thermomix this 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.080
 machine that is wonderful allows us 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.390
 luxurious allows us at home not to throw 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.369
 ingredients 3 there are times that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.470
 wine bottles even good wines are 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.229
 open and do not end with which we are going 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.020
 good stuffing or having at home 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.030
 of small quantities of bottles of 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.580
 came that logically to serve in a 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.140
 food or dinner does not help us if 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.420
 we leave it a long time loses by 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.450
 complete its properties and that those 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 small and small amounts of wine 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.979
 they do not have any kind of function that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.780
 let's do with it let's make a 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.090
 reduction of wine and I tell you that it is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.780
 ideal allows us to have all those 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.890
 small remains of wine and take advantage of them 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.479
 last a very long time with what 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.850
 we can have done and we can keep it 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.500
 and we're just going to teach 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.590
 the ingredients that are very simple and 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.959
 we already have them ready 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.420
 let's use a cinnamon stick that 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.830
 I'm going to split it into a cinnamon stick 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.690
 that this is the only thing that is going to contribute 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.340
 aroma and nothing else 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.510
 We are going to use half a kilo of sugar 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.890
 brunette or white and half of 500 grams already 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.069
 you know that in thermomix we speak in 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.799
 grams 500 grams of wine worth the wine 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.870
 in this case this is completed 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.239
 bottle here of remains of bottles of 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.640
 wine with which is not a single wine to the 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.799
 time to reduce alcohol logically 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.560
 we're not going to notice that there was wine so 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.599
 nothing happened to you to teach how it is done and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.170
 the final result that I assure you that 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.170
 it is a wonder 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.140
 perfect because we have turned on the 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.790
 thermomix logically open the lid 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.709
 we have removed all kinds of accessories 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.170
 because we are not going to use it included 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.540
 we remove the spatula and the first thing 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.930
 let's do is give the scale and 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.190
 we are going to weigh 500 grams of red wine 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.900
 I already tell you it's a wonder because 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.840
 it is a way of not throwing wine remains 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.250
 and to take advantage of them in the kitchen is a 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.230
 of the things that I like most about 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.900
 thermomix that is not pulled absolutely 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.360
 nothing perfect we already have 500 grams of 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.640
 wine we put back to do to the 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.080
 scale and let's think 500 grams of 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.670
 Sugar me in this case I'm going to throw 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.050
 white but I have already told you that 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.620
 it could be brown sugar 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.020
 perfect although it seems much then 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.600
 result that I am not very greedy is 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:51.450
 ideal is not a sugar paste is a 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.450
 wonder 480 490 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.290
 let's see if they charge the 500 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.569
 perfect 500 and here we have the wand of 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.340
 cinnamon that we leave then it is very 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.830
 easy to remove it with which with three 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.910
 little pieces we would have perfect enough 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.380
 we cover our glass uncover and 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.270
 we removed the cup because what 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.090
 we want the alcohol to evaporate 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.120
 from here we program 35 minutes in 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.060
 the glass for the time it will be 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.800
 boiling already you know that with the little button 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.050
 on the right is accounting for you 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.440
 minutes and you do not have to go second to 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.030
 second you have to go over 35 minutes and 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.210
 nothing else we just need to put 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.890
 Maroma temperature and speed 2 lo 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.410
 we let several yesterday we taught the 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.450
 final result of this perfect recipe 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.550
 because our time has passed 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.500
 expressed our wine we have made a 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.090
 Perfect reduction look at the texture that 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.280
 have we got it in the bottle this 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.600
 which is wonderful to be able to decorate 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.610
 the fire that we had put as 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.860
 suggestion today if you realize it appears 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.470
 a honey of wines to a wonder and already 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.720
 if you try it, we 'll go to remove the 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.540
 hat with which recipe finished 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.520
 Look at what decoration and what a joy because 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.950
 that perfectly matches congresses and 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.750
 combats and in this case we suggest 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.450
 with a good glass of a good wine that 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.610
 we have here in this case red and 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.110
 sung prepared with which we do not 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.270
 there's nothing left but to tell you that it has been 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.980
 a pleasure that we suggest as always
