00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.130
 good day today we will make this structure is 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.369
 a nice flower that we can use for 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.579
 make an earring do several joining the 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:16.209
 and making a bracelet already has many 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.210
 functions 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.970
 although he 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.770
 let's do it with serine this 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.220
 pebble is called flour also 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:31.500
 can occupy a checkbook 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.400
 or can occupy a round shell 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.950
 shell stone 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.710
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.070
 occupy in this case the chaquira we are going to 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.200
 introduce the bead 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.490
 to the wire 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.490
 and with the tweezers 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.269
 we will more or less to measure the size 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.839
 that we want the circle we are going to do 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.850
 similar to this that would be at a height of 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:03.469
 almost maximum of the clamps this is the 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.769
 maximum a little less than there we are going to 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.769
 turn 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.060
 up there staying like that 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.800
 now pegadito to the first circle we are going to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.800
 grab the tweezers from the smaller side 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.890
 let's turn to turn one 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.580
 full turn in such a way that it remains 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.220
 small 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.820
 let's continue 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.850
 giving 20 if it's there, it's small 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.220
 we crush let's make a structure 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.810
 of the same size more or less we measure to 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.310
 the height of the tweezers so you do not 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.290
 forget us 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.370
 and at that height we make the hoop stick 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.230
 tiny 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:55.620
 we grab the tweezers 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.620
 and we turn we turn and stop there 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.550
 we are already a little 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.550
 it's like that we're going to make another small 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.539
 pegadito the first 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.190
 we turn we turn and this one is going to 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.190
 be complete 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.980
 crushed 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.430
 and it's going to stay like that, we're going to do another 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.500
 big 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.500
 equal to the same height of the clamps 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.500
 turn around turn around and we 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.900
 we are there 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.569
 from there 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.749
 we crushed the structure a bit 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.840
 let's make another little girl pegadito 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.840
 there 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.250
 pegaditos 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.610
 and this is and will be complete 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.470
 what 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.190
 we crush 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.880
 and it's going to stay like that we're going to make a 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.880
 last great 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.660
 we turn and we stay there 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.319
 what are we going to do the last little one 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.319
 what are we missing 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.050
 we grab pegadito here 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.290
 and we do 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.890
 sometimes but instead of giving it complete 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:37.069
 it has to stay so we crush 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.180
 and since the wire is so we will 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.180
 grab the checkbook that we put 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.860
 and we're going to leave it in the little box in 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.860
 medium 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.530
 now let's cut the wire not so 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.720
 pegadito 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.720
 to the droughts let's leave 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.000
 so much so 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.890
 so is this hook we can to 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.110
 see if you appreciate and remove turns this 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.530
 part of spinning so you do not 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.620
 leave later 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.100
 so if we see it too big , 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.300
 we cut a little bit like that 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.300
 and with the tweezers 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.310
 and we double 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.580
 we double like that once it's that good 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.470
 friend that remains is to accommodate the 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.050
 wire the wire right now is very 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.449
 malleable because it got hot then 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.830
 we can accommodate more or less 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.830
 in the way that 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.820
 and a little bit of top 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.820
 and ready 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.919
 we are going to 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.400
 turn it comes to the wire 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.030
 so that you can appreciate the four 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.030
 circulitos 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.270
 and ready 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:27.410
 it has stayed that way 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.440
 we can make some bracelet earrings 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.760
 or what you 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.060
 who 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.630
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.810
 introduce any other pebbles 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.860
 preferably small 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.810
 why 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.810
 you can appreciate the figure 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.890
 I hope you liked it remember 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.320
 subscribe comment and if you want to have 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:02.360
 some other structure, they tell me 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.360
 and we do it until later
