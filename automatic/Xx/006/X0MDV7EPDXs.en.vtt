push it into one side as you can see
right<00:02:16.010> there<00:02:16.310> this<00:02:16.580> piece<00:02:16.790> will<00:02:16.910> go<00:02:17.060> up<00:02:17.240> these

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
right there this piece will go up these

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.770 
right there this piece will go up these
pieces<00:02:17.990> go<00:02:18.140> around<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.620> corner<00:02:19.660> flip<00:02:20.660> it

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
pieces go around the corner flip it

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.400 
pieces go around the corner flip it
around<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:22.060> go<00:02:23.060> ahead<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.510> pull<00:02:24.050> this<00:02:24.140> other

piece<00:02:24.740> right<00:02:25.070> over<00:02:25.340> there<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.990> other<00:02:27.110> two

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
piece right over there and the other two

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.030 
piece right over there and the other two
sides<00:02:27.620> will<00:02:28.040> fall<00:02:28.340> right<00:02:28.370> into<00:02:28.820> place<00:02:30.040> and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
sides will fall right into place and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.180 
sides will fall right into place and
then<00:02:31.240> it<00:02:32.240> does<00:02:32.510> close<00:02:32.900> just<00:02:33.260> by<00:02:33.380> going<00:02:34.040> like

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
then it does close just by going like

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.340 
then it does close just by going like
that<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.850> secure<00:02:35.000> on<00:02:35.420> there<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.870> then<00:02:35.930> you

that it is secure on there and then you

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.440 
that it is secure on there and then you
do<00:02:36.500> latch<00:02:36.770> open<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.830> keeps<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.730> closed<00:02:41.030> it's

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
do latch open so it keeps it closed it's

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.230 
do latch open so it keeps it closed it's
nice<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:42.890> can<00:02:43.010> see<00:02:43.160> everything<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.820> open

to you know walk on eggshells with this
just<00:03:24.440> grab<00:03:24.740> it<00:03:25.010> put<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:25.850> down<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.540> is<00:03:26.840> nice<00:03:27.080> and

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
this little crease in the corner right

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.699 
this little crease in the corner right
here<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:31.090> for<00:03:32.090> if<00:03:32.270> you<00:03:32.450> go<00:03:32.600> ahead<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.110> just<00:03:33.320> pop

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
you just pop those two corners that you

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.580 
you just pop those two corners that you
can<00:03:42.170> now<00:03:42.320> actually<00:03:42.620> this<00:03:43.340> comes<00:03:43.640> free<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.590> you

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
can now actually this comes free and you

can now actually this comes free and you
can<00:03:45.620> go<00:03:45.890> ahead<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.280> put<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:47.240> up<00:03:47.390> for<00:03:47.690> viewing

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
can go ahead and put it up for viewing

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.199 
can go ahead and put it up for viewing
so<00:03:50.750> there's<00:03:50.990> that<00:03:51.350> put<00:03:52.310> down<00:03:52.580> again<00:03:52.970> right

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
so there's that put down again right

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.250 
so there's that put down again right
there<00:03:53.860> so<00:03:54.860> now<00:03:55.040> it<00:03:55.250> gives<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.610> this<00:03:55.970> angle<00:03:56.480> so

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
there so now it gives you this angle so

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.150 
there so now it gives you this angle so
either<00:03:57.530> this<00:03:58.130> angle<00:03:58.610> this<00:03:59.330> angle<00:03:59.390> or<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:01.040> can

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
either this angle this angle or you can

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.040 
either this angle this angle or you can
put<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.310> all<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.670> way<00:04:01.700> down<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.180> there's<00:04:02.870> a

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
put it all the way down and there's a

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.860 
put it all the way down and there's a
typing<00:04:03.650> angle<00:04:03.800> as<00:04:04.130> well<00:04:04.420> it's<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.570> slight

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
typing angle as well it's a slight

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.960 
typing angle as well it's a slight
typing<00:04:06.290> angle<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.770> works<00:04:06.980> fine<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.580> actually

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
typing angle it works fine it actually

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.590 
typing angle it works fine it actually
does<00:04:08.330> holster<00:04:08.870> into<00:04:09.080> this<00:04:09.410> little<00:04:10.600> little

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
does holster into this little little

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.110 
does holster into this little little
groove<00:04:11.780> right<00:04:11.959> there<00:04:12.200> so<00:04:12.500> keeps<00:04:12.860> it<00:04:12.980> up<00:04:13.190> it's

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
groove right there so keeps it up it's

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.970 
groove right there so keeps it up it's
kind<00:04:14.450> of<00:04:14.540> nice<00:04:14.660> I<00:04:14.989> don't<00:04:15.170> know<00:04:15.260> if<00:04:15.500> I<00:04:15.620> would<00:04:15.680> use

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
kind of nice I don't know if I would use

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.340 
kind of nice I don't know if I would use
that<00:04:16.010> actually<00:04:16.609> it's<00:04:17.000> not<00:04:17.150> bad<00:04:17.390> I<00:04:17.630> don't

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
that actually it's not bad I don't
