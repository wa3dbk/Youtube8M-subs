is a circular strike to the side of my

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.849 
is a circular strike to the side of my
head<00:00:26.890> I<00:00:27.189> have<00:00:27.760> my<00:00:27.939> cake<00:00:28.269> Kyle<00:00:28.570> today<00:00:29.019> and<00:00:29.650> he's

going to strike circular through my head

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.130 
going to strike circular through my head
like<00:00:32.680> so<00:00:32.860> this<00:00:33.370> is<00:00:33.489> video<00:00:33.640> kunst<00:00:34.120> ray<00:00:34.300> and<00:00:34.600> on

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
like so this is video kunst ray and on

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.870 
like so this is video kunst ray and on
this<00:00:35.290> side<00:00:35.500> offer

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
this side offer

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.790 
this side offer
so<00:00:38.880> when<00:00:39.240> we<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.840> document<00:00:40.320> strike<00:00:40.530> we

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
so when we have this document strike we

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.710 
so when we have this document strike we
can<00:00:40.950> intercept<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.880> absorb<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.570> a

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
can intercept it and absorb it a

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.480 
can intercept it and absorb it a
circular<00:00:43.320> fashion<00:00:43.350> which<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.250> very

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
circular fashion which you see very

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.170 
circular fashion which you see very
often<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.970> which<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.450> fine<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:46.560> so

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
often in which is just fine like so

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.870 
often in which is just fine like so
strikes<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:49.760> circular<00:00:50.760> motion<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:52.880> however

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
strikes a circular motion here however

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.600 
strikes a circular motion here however
or<00:00:54.330> if<00:00:54.450> we<00:00:54.570> stick<00:00:54.780> true<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.080> the<00:00:55.290> rei<00:00:55.440> form<00:00:56.040> we

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
or if we stick true to the rei form we

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.110 
or if we stick true to the rei form we
can<00:00:56.640> strike<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.020> cut<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.100> look<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.790> if<00:00:59.940> our

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
can strike and cut it to look as if our

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.750 
can strike and cut it to look as if our
sort<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.720> our<00:01:00.809> hands<00:01:02.090> raised<00:01:03.090> up<00:01:04.520> okay<00:01:05.520> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
sort is in our hands raised up okay and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.460 
sort is in our hands raised up okay and
then<00:01:05.910> go<00:01:06.060> into<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.420> movement<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.290> is

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
then go into the movement this is

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.810 
then go into the movement this is
actually<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.890> movement<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.340> leads<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
actually a movement that leads to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.880 
actually a movement that leads to
different<00:01:09.420> techniques<00:01:09.990> opening<00:01:10.470> movement<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
different techniques opening movement to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.249 
different techniques opening movement to
transitional<00:01:11.550> motion<00:01:12.000> down<00:01:12.660> to<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.020> Pope

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
transitional motion down to this Pope

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.180 
transitional motion down to this Pope
commotion<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:13.800> or<00:01:14.490> over<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> top<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:16.130> as<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
commotion here or over the top or as a

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.180 
commotion here or over the top or as a
sheep<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.790> our<00:01:17.940> gay<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:19.350> get<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> body

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
sheep on our gay so get the body

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.430 
sheep on our gay so get the body
oriented<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.910> right<00:01:21.150> place<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:22.050> a<00:01:22.259> good

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
oriented in the right place it's a good

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.120 
oriented in the right place it's a good
start<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.570> will<00:01:24.570> strike<00:01:24.840> slowly<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:26.009> I've

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
start I will strike slowly what I've

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.270 
start I will strike slowly what I've
seen<00:01:26.310> happen<00:01:26.759> when<00:01:27.000> our<00:01:27.600> students<00:01:27.990> learn<00:01:28.979> this

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
seen happen when our students learn this

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.850 
seen happen when our students learn this
is<00:01:29.550> we<00:01:30.150> tend<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> grab<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.229> bring<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
is we tend to grab and then bring it

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.180 
is we tend to grab and then bring it
straight<00:01:32.040> down<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.729> we'll<00:01:33.660> grab<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.650> bring<00:01:35.070> it

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
straight down so we'll grab the bring it

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.130 
straight down so we'll grab the bring it
straight<00:01:35.340> down<00:01:35.580> as<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:35.940> it's<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.210> strike<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
straight down as if it's a strike the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.410 
straight down as if it's a strike the
grabbing<00:01:37.920> part<00:01:38.160> of<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.399> reflexive<00:01:39.030> motion

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
grabbing part of the reflexive motion

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.870 
grabbing part of the reflexive motion
it's<00:01:39.570> hard<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.140> resist<00:01:40.470> or<00:01:41.220> we'll<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
it's hard to resist or we'll have a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.820 
it's hard to resist or we'll have a
circular<00:01:42.450> motion<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.930> try<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.200> make<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.440> as<00:01:43.650> a

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
circular motion and try to make it as a

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.750 
circular motion and try to make it as a
linear<00:01:45.830> circular<00:01:46.830> motion<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.430> bring<00:01:47.580> it

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
linear circular motion to bring it

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.890 
linear circular motion to bring it
straight<00:01:47.909> down<00:01:48.150> same<00:01:48.420> thing

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
straight down same thing

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.890 
straight down same thing
okay<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.980> if<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.460> had<00:01:50.670> our<00:01:50.700> source<00:01:53.660> and<00:01:54.660> we<00:01:54.780> were

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
okay so if we had our source and we were

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.190 
okay so if we had our source and we were
to<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> rihanna<00:01:55.680> forum<00:01:56.100> by<00:01:57.030> cut<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:58.080> i

I<00:02:36.739> found<00:02:37.219> that<00:02:37.430> I've<00:02:37.579> had<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.939> break<00:02:38.120> down<00:02:38.299> and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
I found that I've had to break down and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.720 
I found that I've had to break down and
since<00:02:38.750> these<00:02:38.959> techniques<00:02:39.500> especially<00:02:40.219> this
