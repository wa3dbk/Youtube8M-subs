00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.109
 touchscreen combined with the monitor 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.250
 original so as not to change 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.199
 the aesthetics of the car 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.470

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.430
 simple use of the navigator who 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.539
 as we said European 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.539

 Original audio has not been changed 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.550
 because the voice of our navigator 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.970
 will come out of the speaker we have 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.880
