00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 it is common opinion among the uninitiated to think 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.200
 that the selection hunt in 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.080
 particularly the stalking one or 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.380
 to look like the hunter requires 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.830
 unique gift so much patience 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.660
 nothing more fake whoever decides to 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.240
 undertake this type of activity 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.369
 he can do it successfully only when 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.269
 will have acquired a deep knowledge 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.760
 of the different species of ungulates of the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.730
 environments in which they live 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.190
 habits and their behavior that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.460
 it will be different depending on the terrain 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.940
 of the seasons of sex and classes 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.940
 of age 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.450
 here is the hunting adventure of 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.489
 andrea mountain hunter who 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.670
 used to beat the peaks in search 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.970
 of roosters and chamois as a hunter and 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.739
 licensed hunting guide 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.589
 this time it is measured with land and 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.420
 ungulates for him unusual and for this 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.759
 relies on the experience of a friend e 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:14.080
 connects michele who supports him in 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:17.110
 this exit is now day two 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:22.600
 deer move the wait I'm not in the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.880
 plan of the day michele ha 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.930
 preferred this post we say of 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.940
 transit 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.039
 because in the grazing sites the males 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.960
 arrive when it is still dark e 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.140
 fall when just starts 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.630
 dawning is also among these 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.420
 badlands that you are three days ago 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.190
 undefeated even if for a few moments in 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.440
 an 18 spikes is a secluded habitat i 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.899
 animals are not particularly 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.950
 disturbed and in particular circumstances 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.479
 they linger long enough to allow shooting 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.750
 certainly an area to keep in 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.750
 consideration 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.280
 the Serbian despite being able to define a 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.440
 Sedentary animal proves a certain is 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.550
 racism and within a given 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.009
 territory 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.100
 also makes frequent movements of 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.810
 kilometers for food purposes or why 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.600
 disturbed strongly elusive with everyone 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.930
 the highly developed senses excellent runner 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.810
 and also savior as well as swimmer 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.010
 the deer represents a challenge to the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.010
 skill of the hunter 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.480
 the hunt for appearance is perhaps the most 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.230
 penalizing as it obliges the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.540
 hunter at several hours of immobility e 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.030
 the withdrawal activity is limited to 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.980
 just over an hour and a half two hours from 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.460
 when daylight illuminates the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.460
 visual 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.750
 the animal very much from this area 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:04:03.239
 absolutely where it is allowed but yes 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.270
 can choose to continue the action of 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.580
 hunting with the technical search that requires 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.950
 even more in-depth knowledge 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.980
 you try to enter the home of the deer e 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.410
 for this we need to know where to go 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.660
 what character to the landlord the 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.120
 his habits and also know how to move 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.110
 in the woods because in his majesty's house 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.610
 the deer gets on tiptoe yes 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.610
 goes in search of the trophy 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.009
 it is not easy to see and the eye must 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.620
 be well trained to catch a glimpse 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.780
 silhouettes even if they are voluminous like those of 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.789
 a deer among a vegetation that 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.699
 it still has a lot of michele sa leaf 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.320
 for sure that that is a good area 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.360
 loved by animals because it offers a 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.729
 excellent shelter in the short woods in 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.889
 gully bottom 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.560
 With this conviction, he continues 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.919
 without uncertainties towards a goal that to 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.419
 moment appears imaginary again a 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.419
 earth to observe 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.510
 in an elevated position of our friends 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.810
 peering insistently through the foliage 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:31.200
 reddish, the light of the sun flickers 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:35.310
 the reddish leaves favor the dream 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.320
 the mirage but it is not a mirage 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.660
 what michele sees in the viewfinder 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.720
 of the long is the important stage of a 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.180
 handsome male lying down that stands out like 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.510
 an arboreal sculpture among the shrubs and 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.300
 a small group of deer is the beautiful subject 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.460
 majestic and apparently peaceful that 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.910
 in turn it seems to look straight 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.910
 towards its observers the expected head 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:12.020
 the female is alert raises has 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.690
 warned the danger seems to hesitate 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.610
 but then the decision is made a fraction 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.600
 second and pull the group behind 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:24.110
 male including michele is produced in 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.480
 a strangled cry and raul the deer yes 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.050
 firm offers the hunter the cue for 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.050
 the throw 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:05.380
 goes into action at the animal has 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:09.480
 certainly a mortal wound 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.480
 and it must not have come a long way 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:24.270
 nothing can be found easily below 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.140
 in his last bed in the arms of 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:30.510
 a small reed seems to sleep e 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:34.040
 even if a bit broken he did not lose 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.040
 nothing of its majesty
