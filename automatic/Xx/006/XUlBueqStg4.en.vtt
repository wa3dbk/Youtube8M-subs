00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
and an offset the process works simply

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.590 
and an offset the process works simply
because<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.229> ink<00:04:22.410> is<00:04:22.620> transferred<00:04:23.340> from<00:04:23.610> the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
because the ink is transferred from the

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.020 
because the ink is transferred from the
plate<00:04:25.400> during<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.490> operation<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:26.970> the
