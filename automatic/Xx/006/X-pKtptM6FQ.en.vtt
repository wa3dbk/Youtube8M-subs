there kind of interesting each of their

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.100 
there kind of interesting each of their
own<00:01:04.890> separate<00:01:05.309> reflector<00:01:05.640> area<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.990> gonna

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
own separate reflector area it's gonna

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.380 
own separate reflector area it's gonna
be<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> very<00:01:07.530> floody<00:01:07.950> light<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.210> some

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
be a very floody light so you have some

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.359 
be a very floody light so you have some
large<00:01:09.510> LEDs<00:01:10.049> relatively<00:01:10.680> small<00:01:10.920> reflectors

large LEDs relatively small reflectors
you'll<00:01:11.610> see<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.880> better<00:01:12.030> when<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.659> go

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
you'll see that better when we go

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.140 
you'll see that better when we go
outside<00:01:13.040> interface<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.400> switch<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:15.119> on

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
squeeze it's going to turn on which is

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.690 
squeeze it's going to turn on which is
kind<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.439> nice<00:01:19.590> feature<00:01:19.860> especially<00:01:20.310> if

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
kind of a nice feature especially if

it to turn it on press and hold it'll

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.260 
it to turn it on press and hold it'll
cycle<00:01:30.540> through<00:01:30.840> your<00:01:30.960> different<00:01:31.079> outputs

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
cycle through your different outputs

cycle through your different outputs
double<00:01:33.270> click<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.479> strobe<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.860> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
double click for strobe you can do that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.190 
double click for strobe you can do that
from<00:01:35.159> off<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.640> well<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.270> momentary<00:01:36.900> so

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
from off as well you have momentary so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.910 
from off as well you have momentary so
if<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.380> press<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.770> hold<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.970> second<00:01:39.329> or<00:01:39.450> so

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
if you press and hold for a second or so

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.140 
if you press and hold for a second or so
anything<00:01:40.920> longer<00:01:41.189> than<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.939> you're

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
anything longer than that and you're

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.940 
anything longer than that and you're
gonna<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.450> momentary<00:01:42.960> all<00:01:43.560> right<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.829> that's

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
gonna have momentary all right so that's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.370 
gonna have momentary all right so that's
the<00:01:44.070> interface<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.060> SR<00:01:45.360> 96<00:01:45.960> let's<00:01:46.140> go<00:01:46.229> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the interface of the SR 96 let's go and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.780 
the interface of the SR 96 let's go and
take<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.649> outside<00:01:46.829> will<00:01:47.369> show<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> how<00:01:47.700> it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
take this outside will show you how it

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.690 
take this outside will show you how it
performs<00:01:48.210> outside<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.860> outside<00:01:50.250> got<00:01:50.549> about

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
performs outside so outside got about
