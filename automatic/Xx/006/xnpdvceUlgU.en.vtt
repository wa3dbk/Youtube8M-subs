00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.660
 now how about friends and egypt 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.190
 this is my third set 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.740
 and at the moment last video 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.169
 shown 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.769
 and you hacked through the August tutorials after closing 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.329
 in this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.090
 some interesting procedures that are out there in the network for the three 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.089
 consoles 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.279
 can download the internet channel 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.279
 that our navigator for body 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.160
 and you save 500 thousand points what is 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.740
 they charge in everyone's activity 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.500
 then this one 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.540
 Yesterday you can install in our internal channel 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.620
 this is a multimedia player 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 which is a belt 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.860
 music videos 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.769
 in mp3 civil format 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.310
 seen from bb 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.020
 this is what we are going to propose 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.670
 as you will remember the first 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.670
 from the 1st 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.730
 I showed them how we had put a vcd memory inside it 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.860
 our Nobel Committee posts above 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.980
 well I think it's going to be at this moment is to open an audio file 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.210
 dt 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.770
 said shopping bag deserves 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.250
 of the EU cv is that if we fall 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.720
 and here two folders come out 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.070
 we have here we have a debt 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.070
 and we are going to listen 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.070
 something from our folder 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.600
 ap 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.600
 since we already have the song list 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.800
 just put 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.800
 not just attention 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.840
 and with that we are listening 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840
 mp3 files from our wii console 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.410
 we can choose something never 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:11.459
 good 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.299
 There are those who see all 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.969
 I have a successful music that has 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.159
 let's accept 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.389
 a movie 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.389
 inside our console wii 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.909
 we do not wait for the shortage in the two years of October 2 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.579
 we already made some black spots 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.949
 stop us from opening a libya dvd 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.519
 this day as craig of this record as three several movies of man 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.219
 taboada that I laid down chapter 2 which is the movie 2 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.099
 is the abrogation ibarra 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.679
 because he is currently mounting a dvd 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.779
 and our load 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.729
 at this time since it is playing 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:06.029
 they think that this is to say with an arrow 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.029
 we advance a little 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.249
 so that nothing 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:14.249
 we want or not in the credits 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.579
 as you see already this one represents our explained 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.169
 we can have access 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.279
 the menus 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:31.279
 the devedé 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.019
 such as 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.699
 as the language 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.699
 the Spanish state 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.269
 the subtitles 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.619
 We grew to consume meat 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:51.619
 we put ourselves in English 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.799
 both weakened 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.729
 As you can see the resolution is clear and says' it's very good 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.549
 this is a very interesting program if you call 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.549
 emelec laws checks 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.769
 we show it 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.489
 put little problem we go back at least to our console wii 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.139
 he reminded them that for even more a program to appear to them as they keep 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.180
 that are giving the Walkman them 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.490
 downloading it 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.779
 with the point extension 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.529
 in another case 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:30.319
 the executor of john buchán is 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.969
 saving the documents of the files inside the folder to tlc 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:37.529
 in sd memory 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.279
 I know we have a player - equipment 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:45.860
 that would exempt the one that I showed them the previous time that's why it is not necessary to see it 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.279
 this is like the windows explorer 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:54.710
 but for our sd card disqus 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.199
 here as you like it I have some other many comparable data 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.199
 erika what I want to show you is structurally 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.719
 which serves to listen to radio 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.969
 Through internet 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.169
 here it is loading decentralizing the network 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.169
 is connected to the internet loading the skins 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.830
 here is that Valencia is looking for some stations 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.830
 according to what you specify more 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.620
 we can 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.520
 choose some gender 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.520
 dyn-special 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.430
 of the genus 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.430
 we give you for example 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.219
 ma 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.219
 we wanted to give it a genre 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.430
 just choose some performance 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.729
 to start listening to music 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.840
 and there are situations from around the world in our console wii 

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:17.159
 so I hope you get for this series 3 and fears 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.809
 meeting 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:23.559
 know more programs that can make you responsible to the trial we 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:24.909
 times 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:28.349
 but this is the hockey shows houses 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.129
 I remind you that all this makes our kids happy 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:34.589
 friends of serrablo 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:39.229
 everything is safe follow the steps to the letter and you will see that you do not have any 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:40.379
 complication 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:41.949
 and it's very easy 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.550
 I recommend it 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.879
 and he exhorted them to do it 

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.789
 until the next day 10 and see you soon
