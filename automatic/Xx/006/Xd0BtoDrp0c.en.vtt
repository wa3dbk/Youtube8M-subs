 I'm sorry Minister 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.369
 Avenue showed his game 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.300
 This is exactly what he said. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.159

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.999

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.999
 so fly 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.030
 the game is called legend pandora 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.140
 first what to you 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.250
 that I like the name 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.480
 because they do not fit this 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.530
 the game 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.030
 I tried to come up with a long time 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.230
 more suitable name 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.910
 but nothing better than a Viagra 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.020
 Dmitri sands you ask why 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.880
 yes that's why 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.610
 what is your body 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.700
 and now 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.430
 and now 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.030
 the most important thing 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.740
 in this game can take place online 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.700
 fence empty mushrooms answers to trees 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.230
 kan wants a player nhl ok children in fact 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.710
 teahouses such 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.330
 it is water lunch when 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.590
 there is a boy 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.270
 log log 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.690
 wall bookcase debate rather in 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.800
 the selection of Yakutsk product Karabakh 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.490
 heard porvatov music 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.820
 nameplate 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.190
 there it is always there 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.050
 of course 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.780
 lack of sleep 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.190
 that's just nothing monsters with it 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.530
 does not work 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.200
 logically the only one who at least like that of Egypt 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.500
 I have a question 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.620
 so what did the developers think when 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.390
 created this game 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.690
 not 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.080
 of course when the Omsk regiment is still possible 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.010
 understand he stepped in front of a club b and 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.260
 produces solutions called 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.960
 there in canada 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.650
 but why 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.030
 if not able to budge 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.049
 elementary pillar 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.409
 hence it is not only not 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.409
 and what we thought, and that's why 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.150
 in fact, the screen of someone else is not only 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.279
 in that 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.279
 explain why between kan map 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.189
 then don't care who every time i 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.639
 go to the water 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.919
 Are we really looking for appeals? 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.839
 areas 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.059
 and not to get confused granite mastered 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.059
 developers are surrounded with rates 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:38.909
 as for the plot 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.659
 I did not pass it 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.139
 mainly due to two reasons 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.439
 Firstly, I could not understand what was happening to me 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.289
 want others 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.239
 chatted 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.169
 Secondly 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.139
 but then go fuck them 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.569
 much more interesting if they seized it 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:00.969
 summing up 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.309
 I want to say 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.539
 what if the developers decide to continue 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.299
 but I hope not 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.659
 than four ports 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:11.909
 that's all 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.929
 for those who would like to play a lotus package 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.989
 I'm still getting a bit 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.919
 I will try to find Dagestanis 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.839
 adding a goal 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:22.849
 special 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.849
 vaccine doses 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.739
 successes such thrill
