00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.250
 more than 5,000 schools are part of the 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.349
 program more culture the program will 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.419
 finance five thousand cultural projects 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.919
 which should be developed in the second 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.779
 semester of this year 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.000
 the contemplated schools will receive 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.210
 money to invest in 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.160
 theater music dance visual arts beyond 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.969
 external activities such as visits to 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.100
 museums 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.440
 the proposed program is to make the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.390
 school environment is experienced as a 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.140
 space of diversity and production 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.640
 cultural 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.440
 the wording of enem br prepared a 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.440
 report on the subject see 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.489
 in the show the visitors know the work 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.489
 of the Brazilian artist abraham palatinik 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.740
 the exhibition was the destination of these students 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.869
 from elementary school to their school 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:23.070
 frequently promotes activities 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:24.640
 cultural all that is brings a reality 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.490
 new 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.210
 one or something that comes out of the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:35.619
 school students not only do not like 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.990
 that is also adding something positive in the 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.640
 had dinner with other colleagues 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.640
 next to the community, right? 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.350
 This will all enrich the whole 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.380
 their curriculum and make people 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.990
 very diversified not only in their 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.060
 way of learning but 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.060
 differences intelligences 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.670
 I found it very interesting for the reason 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.180
 help students in art and inspiration 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.280
 on the way out I think I left school 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.340
 from time to time to level and this can 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.690
 to help people on certain occasions 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.690
 adds knowledge to wisdom 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.989
 the most culture program in schools 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.480
 launched by the ministries of culture and 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.090
 of education wants to encourage this 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.469
 public education institutions in 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.739
 of importance for all areas of the 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:44.139
 education is this expansion and this 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.959
 government partnership should really 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.969
 this incentive exists in partnership with 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.609
 artists and masters of popular cultures 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:54.280
 how capoeiristas libraries museums 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.019
 cinemas, for example, schools can 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.189
 submitting project activities 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.189
 cultural or artistic 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.360
 of schools want to do something 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.520
 thing is that director who is aware of the 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.890
 what do you do what you want to do but she 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.230
 you do not have this feature to run 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.290
 This is going to make a big difference. 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.730
 great for schools mainly 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.130
 for schools that are already in 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.070
 mec programs that are already period 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.640
 integral and already has an experience 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.850
 in this area we will also encourage 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.520
 its educational territory by strengthening 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.380
 integral education cultural training 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.700
 beyond the walls of the school we 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.730
 we find it important that children 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.220
 have school out of condition do 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.840
 and every school goes there. 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.240
 develop your pedagogical project 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.190
 how does she believe 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.290
 along with what she is already doing in 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.360
 school, she can grow 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.260
 such cultural visits as may be 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.260
 out of school 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.320
 this year will be chosen five thousand 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.630
 schools that will receive from 20 thousand to 22 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.489
 thousand reais in total the program will 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.620
 invest 100 million reais to 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.680
 finance artistic activities and 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.680
 cultural 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.060
 money can be used to buy 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.270
 consumer goods rent equipment 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.280
 hire services and pay for transportation 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.500
 any activity can be contemplated 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.050
 you only need to fit into one of the 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.930
 nine thematic axes defined by 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.810

 innovative middle school program that 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.780
 also have a longer journey which is what 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.660
 allows to develop with more quality 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.400
 these activities are exactly what 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.980
 they have an extended journey 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.930
 students from these schools with more 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.800

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:48.339
 believes that this exchange is good for the 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.339
 learning 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.600
 could have for all the students of the school 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.690

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.100
 because it is the kind of new art that
