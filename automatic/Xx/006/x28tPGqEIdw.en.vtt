00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
motions to blend it out and it looks so

gorgeous and natural and it's from the
Ipsy<00:04:30.650> glam<00:04:30.680> bag<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.610> then<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.120> went<00:04:32.449> ahead<00:04:32.630> and

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
Ipsy glam bag and then I went ahead and

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.430 
Ipsy glam bag and then I went ahead and
put<00:04:33.470> Nick's<00:04:33.970> lipstick<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.210> iris<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.050> again

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.360 
this is also from the Ipsy glam bag and

some<00:04:40.550> lip<00:04:40.729> gloss<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:41.380> so<00:04:42.380> that's<00:04:42.590> Nick's

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
some lip gloss and so that's Nick's

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.939 
some lip gloss and so that's Nick's
beige<00:04:43.460> lip<00:04:43.849> gloss<00:04:44.260> so<00:04:45.260> that's<00:04:45.500> how<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.680> lip

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
beige lip gloss so that's how the lip

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.680 
beige lip gloss so that's how the lip
gloss<00:04:46.160> looks<00:04:46.550> and<00:04:46.849> then<00:04:47.030> that's<00:04:47.240> how<00:04:47.419> it<00:04:47.539> looks

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
gloss looks and then that's how it looks

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.140 
gloss looks and then that's how it looks
