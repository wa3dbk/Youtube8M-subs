00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.929
 do with ukrainian artists 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.670
 a political decision was attached when 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.040
 This is the most diverse and the most 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.130
 interesting and most unexpected valentine 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.640

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.770

 the events taking place there and whatever 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.859

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.060
 bloggers or arms law it all 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.160
 upon closer inspection it turns out 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.160
 measures to counter the Maidan 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.910
 I give 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.970

 musicians were going on tour in 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.620
 Russia, but now they may have 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.360
 I think I should not allow tickets 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.100
 tour 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.310

 musical and other theatrical if you 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:07.900
 their composition are persons who directly 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.640
 took the anti-Russian position here with us 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.690

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.280

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.119

 nuance 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.930
 Russian and I think we should do 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.479
 otherwise to all citizens of Ukraine who wish 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.610
 become citizens of Russia, we must give 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.410
 opportunity for forgiveness to form in 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.750

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.789

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.569
