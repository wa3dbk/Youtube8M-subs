00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
so the the the ecstasy was more than the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.060

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
down from the stands and jump and they

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.620

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.170 

I<00:02:10.509> think<00:02:11.410> sometimes<00:02:11.950> we<00:02:12.160> get<00:02:12.310> pulled<00:02:12.640> out<00:02:12.940> by

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
fear we get pulled down by necessity of

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.520 
fear we get pulled down by necessity of
work<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:18.069> it's<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.580> mistake<00:02:18.900> but<00:02:19.900> having<00:02:20.290> done

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
work and it's a mistake but having done

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.790 
work and it's a mistake but having done
skydive<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.610> learned<00:02:22.239> courage<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.900> learned<00:02:23.709> to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
skydive I learned courage I learned to

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.610 
skydive I learned courage I learned to
go<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:25.120> has<00:02:25.360> been<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.810> biggest<00:02:26.110> turning

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
go and that has been the biggest turning

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.680 
go and that has been the biggest turning
point<00:02:26.800> in<00:02:26.920> my<00:02:27.040> life<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.550> I<00:02:28.000> think<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.390> courage

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
point in my life and I think the courage

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.630 
point in my life and I think the courage
has<00:02:28.810> helped<00:02:29.019> me<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.230> run<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.709> charity<00:02:30.220> which

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
has helped me to run a charity which

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.059 
has helped me to run a charity which
from<00:02:30.880> scratch<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.989> very<00:02:32.380> difficult<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.920> they

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
from scratch is very difficult I they

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.559 
from scratch is very difficult I they
say<00:02:33.280> most<00:02:33.489> charities<00:02:33.849> fail<00:02:34.120> after<00:02:34.300> three

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
say most charities fail after three

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.990 
say most charities fail after three
years<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.650> knew<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.160> had<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.400> program

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000

years and I knew that I had a program
that<00:02:37.540> affected<00:02:38.380> for<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.769> good<00:02:38.980> they

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
that affected for the good they

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.339 
that affected for the good they
profoundly<00:02:40.150> disabled<00:02:40.720> people<00:02:40.989> made<00:02:41.170> them

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
profoundly disabled people made them

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.800
