the<00:02:59.220> most<00:02:59.370> part<00:02:59.580> though<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.820> think<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.300> still

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
the most part though I think it is still

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.180 
the most part though I think it is still
geared<00:03:00.750> towards<00:03:01.020> kids<00:03:01.110> however<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:02.070> this
