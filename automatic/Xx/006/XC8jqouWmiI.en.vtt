00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
Castlevania three for the NES he looks a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
Castlevania three for the NES he looks a
lot<00:01:22.799> different<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.579> same<00:01:23.670> guy<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
lot different but it's the same guy and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.760 
lot different but it's the same guy and
he<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.079> son<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.649> Dracula<00:01:26.369> Dracula<00:01:27.439> had<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
he is the son of Dracula Dracula had a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.570 
he is the son of Dracula Dracula had a
wife<00:01:29.479> was<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> human<00:01:30.899> and<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.679> alucard<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
wife was a human and so alucard is a

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.710 
wife was a human and so alucard is a
half-human<00:01:33.830> half-vampire<00:01:34.939> hybrid<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:38.720> think

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
half-human half-vampire hybrid I think

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.569 
half-human half-vampire hybrid I think
it<00:01:39.810> works<00:01:39.960> well<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.530> game<00:01:40.710> because<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
it works well for this game because the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.429 
it works well for this game because the
way<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.720> all<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> other<00:01:43.320> characters

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
way that the all the other characters

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.990 
way that the all the other characters
interact<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.220> meet<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.549> Richter

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
