00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
place was good I but what really weld me

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.070 
place was good I but what really weld me
was<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.130> sides<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.730> love<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.510> deep<00:03:12.780> fried<00:03:13.049> okra

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
was the sides I love the deep fried okra

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.250 
was the sides I love the deep fried okra
I<00:03:13.860> had<00:03:14.549> deep<00:03:14.760> fried<00:03:14.850> okra<00:03:14.940> cut<00:03:15.570> differently

I had deep fried okra cut differently

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.470 
I had deep fried okra cut differently
but<00:03:16.620> this<00:03:16.799> one<00:03:16.980> they<00:03:17.100> cut<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.459> long<00:03:17.610> way<00:03:17.820> which

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
but this one they cut the long way which

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.000 
but this one they cut the long way which
I<00:03:18.690> think<00:03:18.930> made<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.140> difference<00:03:19.440> because<00:03:19.890> it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
I think made the difference because it

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.590 
I think made the difference because it
was<00:03:20.100> really<00:03:20.430> creamy<00:03:20.640> as<00:03:20.790> i<00:03:20.910> bite<00:03:21.090> into<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.390> and
