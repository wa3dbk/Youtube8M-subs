I've got the backup Mike here and white
um<00:01:20.810> yeah<00:01:21.810> I'm<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.320> forest<00:01:22.650> today<00:01:22.770> I

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
um yeah I'm just in the forest today I

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.130 
um yeah I'm just in the forest today I
thought<00:01:23.159> I'd<00:01:23.280> come<00:01:23.400> out<00:01:23.509> because<00:01:24.509> i<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:24.990> i

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
thought I'd come out because i just i

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.749 
thought I'd come out because i just i
was<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.530> bit<00:01:25.710> stir-crazy<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> house

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
was going to bit stir-crazy in the house

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.090 
was going to bit stir-crazy in the house
again<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.439> now<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> weather<00:01:28.770> has<00:01:28.950> been

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
again and now the weather has been

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.450 
again and now the weather has been
perhaps<00:01:29.610> lutely<00:01:29.939> rotten<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:31.710> again<00:01:32.009> this

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
perhaps lutely rotten but again this

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.499 
perhaps lutely rotten but again this
camera<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.689> actually<00:01:34.439> waterproof<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
camera is actually waterproof so the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.560 
camera is actually waterproof so the
idea<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.409> come<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:38.180> or<00:01:39.180> wherever

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
idea is I can come out here or wherever

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.530 
idea is I can come out here or wherever
in<00:01:40.530> all<00:01:40.740> weathers<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> not<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.509> worry

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
in all weathers and not have to worry

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.649 
in all weathers and not have to worry
about<00:01:42.840> lugging<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.500> lemming<00:01:44.100> great<00:01:44.280> big

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
about lugging a lemming great big

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.469 
about lugging a lemming great big
expensive<00:01:45.659> camera<00:01:45.990> around<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.409> me<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
expensive camera around with me and

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.109 
expensive camera around with me and
worrying<00:01:48.479> about<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.899> being<00:01:49.439> damaged<00:01:50.119> so

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
worrying about it being damaged so

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.179 
worrying about it being damaged so
that's<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> theory<00:01:51.930> anyway<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.680> if<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.920> rains

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
that's the theory anyway so if it rains

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.609 
that's the theory anyway so if it rains
which<00:01:53.759> I'm<00:01:53.880> sort<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> hoping<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.420> will<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:55.380> that

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
which I'm sort of hoping it will is that

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.020 
which I'm sort of hoping it will is that
like<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.829> said<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.189> really<00:01:56.820> enjoy

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
like I said I really really enjoy

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.940 
like I said I really really enjoy
