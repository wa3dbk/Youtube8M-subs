earthquake friend and in here we have a
BG<00:01:56.690> 32<00:01:57.200> for<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:57.950> blade<00:01:58.250> person<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.420> that's<00:01:59.600> his

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
BG 32 for a blade person and that's his

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.560 
BG 32 for a blade person and that's his
number<00:02:00.159> ok<00:02:01.159> on<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.430> upper<00:02:01.760> we<00:02:01.970> have<00:02:02.120> mango

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
number ok on the upper we have mango

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.539 
number ok on the upper we have mango
flywire<00:02:03.020> all<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.440> way<00:02:03.500> around<00:02:03.620> so<00:02:04.430> you<00:02:04.490> can

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
flywire all the way around so you can

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.789 
flywire all the way around so you can
see<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.909> says<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.270> right<00:02:05.420> there<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:06.409> Flywire

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
see it says that right there the Flywire

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.300 
see it says that right there the Flywire
has<00:02:07.070> black<00:02:07.340> strands<00:02:07.760> going<00:02:08.149> up<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:08.360> down<00:02:09.310> ok

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
has black strands going up and down ok

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.059 
has black strands going up and down ok
now<00:02:10.520> we<00:02:10.580> have<00:02:10.850> some<00:02:11.030> 3m<00:02:11.390> parts<00:02:11.750> first<00:02:12.709> the

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
now we have some 3m parts first the

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.559 
now we have some 3m parts first the
check

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
check

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.679 
check
here<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.739> then<00:02:14.859> the<00:02:14.980> check<00:02:15.219> right<00:02:15.430> here<00:02:15.689> and

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
here and then the check right here and

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.080 
here and then the check right here and
then<00:02:16.780> we<00:02:16.870> have<00:02:17.079> the<00:02:17.530> laces<00:02:17.950> embedded<00:02:18.519> in<00:02:18.670> 3<00:02:18.909> and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
then we have the laces embedded in 3 and

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.379 
then we have the laces embedded in 3 and
4<00:02:19.420> 3<00:02:19.659> m<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.049> then<00:02:20.499> we<00:02:20.620> have<00:02:21.090> earthquake<00:02:22.090> print

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:22.389 
4 3 m and then we have earthquake print

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:29.520 
4 3 m and then we have earthquake print
in<00:02:23.139> the<00:02:23.469> 3m<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:25.810> 3m<00:02:26.469> on<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:27.040> fly<00:02:27.969> wire<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.530> it's

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
in the 3m in 3m on the fly wire and it's

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.289 
in the 3m in 3m on the fly wire and it's
actually<00:02:29.709> visible<00:02:30.280> if<00:02:30.609> you<00:02:30.760> sign<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> light<00:02:31.269> on

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
actually visible if you sign a light on

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.170 
actually visible if you sign a light on
it<00:02:31.659> like<00:02:31.870> we're<00:02:32.019> doing<00:02:32.109> now<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:33.060> think<00:02:34.060> it's

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
it like we're doing now I think it's

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.209 
it like we're doing now I think it's
pretty<00:02:34.329> sick<00:02:34.629> it's<00:02:34.959> like<00:02:35.139> really<00:02:35.500> neat<00:02:35.920> like

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:36.219 
pretty sick it's like really neat like

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:37.800 
pretty sick it's like really neat like

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
you'll never see that on another pair of

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.729 
you'll never see that on another pair of
shoes<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.549> really<00:02:39.730> makes<00:02:39.939> them<00:02:40.150> pop<00:02:40.739> so

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739

shoes and it really makes them pop so
yeah<00:02:41.950> with<00:02:42.939> 3m<00:02:43.269> is<00:02:43.389> definitely<00:02:43.749> a<00:02:43.780> nice

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
yeah with 3m is definitely a nice

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.330 
yeah with 3m is definitely a nice
addition<00:02:45.180> some<00:02:46.180> more<00:02:46.359> little<00:02:46.659> details<00:02:47.340> the

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
up here unfortunately those aren't 3m

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.759 
up here unfortunately those aren't 3m
and<00:02:58.180> they<00:02:58.719> don't<00:02:58.840> grow<00:02:59.019> in<00:02:59.169> the<00:02:59.230> dark<00:02:59.439> like<00:02:59.620> the

and they don't grow in the dark like the
back<00:02:59.919> yoke<00:03:00.189> up<00:03:00.599> I'm<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.930> tongue<00:03:02.169> is<00:03:02.919> a<00:03:03.069> mesh

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
back yoke up I'm the tongue is a mesh

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.819 
back yoke up I'm the tongue is a mesh
tongue<00:03:03.609> and<00:03:03.909> then<00:03:04.599> up<00:03:04.930> here<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.379> gets<00:03:05.500> really

flimsy unfortunately but it's like that
so<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.519> they<00:03:09.669> can<00:03:09.819> stay<00:03:10.060> light<00:03:10.389> and<00:03:10.659> good<00:03:11.109> for

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
so that they can stay light and good for

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.199 
so that they can stay light and good for
performance<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.989> tongue<00:03:14.459> has<00:03:15.459> some<00:03:15.790> Jackson

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
performance the tongue has some Jackson

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
on the inside with some earthquake print

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.559 
on the inside with some earthquake print
around<00:03:29.439> it<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:30.790> earthquake<00:03:31.239> print

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
around it and the earthquake print

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.649 
around it and the earthquake print
matches<00:03:31.870> this<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:33.639> behind<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.150> heel<00:03:34.299> cup<00:03:34.509> is

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
matches this this behind the heel cup is

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.890 
matches this this behind the heel cup is
the<00:03:34.750> same<00:03:34.930> thing<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.879> padding<00:03:37.299> is<00:03:37.479> thin<00:03:37.870> but

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
the same thing the padding is thin but

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.289 
the same thing the padding is thin but
it's<00:03:38.349> still<00:03:38.560> comfortable<00:03:39.069> and<00:03:39.340> they<00:03:39.879> kept<00:03:40.120> it

it's still comfortable and they kept it

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.569 
it's still comfortable and they kept it
