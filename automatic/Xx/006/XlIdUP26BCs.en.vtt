00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.710
 n about this leader i want to tell you and about 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.470
 pension system and in bc our smartphone 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.110
 wonderful operating system 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.740
 and in Russia there is a dozen I 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.160
 that is, the early version 9 4 and what is it 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.890
 remarkable topics in tomsk working 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.570
 At the table, we had only 6 visits, and that 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.220
 france 2 3 4 5 6 but as you can see the player 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.039
 they are responsible for different functions this 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:28.769
 example 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.320
 message to me internet from drugs 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.320
 July for example for the sake of one book so on 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.460
 by the way, you can change the percentage here 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.120
 in such a way wants to transfer from 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.520
 one part of a pipe like this 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.510
 Here we push them ready 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.060
 apply in addition can 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.670
 automatically 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.860
 rather, like this, remove it 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.420
 Here we remove but also a sapsan in the same way 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.660
 click and do not add content 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.100
 vodka what content is 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.950
 by the way army if i'm talking about simple 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.690
 the system needs to tell you 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.320
 by speed 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.790
 of this apparatus 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.350
 and how can you anniversary compared to 10 8 00 from 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.170
 other devices of this series are not 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.030
 especially changed kinetic 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.350
 scrolling as you can see here 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.990
 she is 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.540
 spouse march out of him can not be her 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.340
 compare 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 gas kinetic scrolling market what 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.490
 some phones and android 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.470
 contrary to 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.830
 I think it is 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.340
 some kind of nonsense 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.940
 which means 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.460
 the desktop is only one by her 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.939
 way you can only hide 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.740
 all these 3 4 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.470
 arch so many people told her 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.220
 asked to compare the speed of work but 58 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.840
 to 0 36 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.530
 I'll tell you in advance that we will add 0 58 to 0 in 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.670
 this case is the same 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.670
 same firmware as nation 6 since this 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.259
 not so long ago there was an exhibition of works 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.880
 famous TV project 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.500
 which completely replace percent ford 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.299
 need to do exactly komi desktop and 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.959
 loans here we have two phones now 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.550
 we can see the launch speeds 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.619
 eg 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.619
 about the same 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.169
 a little faster she is every 8 00 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.779
 sell Ishim messages 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.779
 a little faster at 58 00 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.059
 tourists from faster 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:34.369
 how can you record yourself from 8 00 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.729
 firmware mbk there is a rub that's such a 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.419
 virtual keyboard 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:40.519
 full sized appolons 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.479
 Keyboard aut firmware c6 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.219
 the original such keyboard no scientists 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.019
 if we turn 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.879
 fleet we stay in that dolls then europe 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.689
 this is understandable because we have with him 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.809
 mechanical keyboard so 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:57.809
 let's go further we get out of the situation 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:02.060
 this close we go out further we 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.049
 we run for example private settings 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.319
 turned on the mood 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.179
 about the same 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:11.999
 to 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.219
 equally 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.219
 in the application 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.999
 that is why then 058 quickly 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:24.269
 society a little bit faster 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.769
 further in the center of the field ator for example 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:34.979
 but about the same as the Greeks 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.290
 note on foot notes 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.329
 converter for example 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.049
 how can you rehearse 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.230
 for some percentage of nugman 58 rubles zero 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.229
 zero starts up a little faster 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.079
 for example that cheat 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.309
 equally expensive we run the camera 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:58.739
 to 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:05.179
 to up to 378 2 0 times faster run in principle 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.570
 this 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.780
 the percentage of me than of course she is not 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.420
 says but nonetheless possible 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.910
 about compare speed percentage 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.690
 considering that this device alas show 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.930
 much earlier than this percentage but not 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.470
 less they will be installed one and the one 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.020
 same processor but what about the time 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.330
 the same exact firmware route 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.310
 nevertheless was empirically because 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:34.050
 that nellie that still 58 00 a little bit 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.050
 faster couture runs 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.400
 unfortunately the animation for some reason is not 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.800
 I wanted to rub here if we go 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.680
 at the construction site 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.200
 ooo cement 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.330
 ordinary 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.210
 function effects included effects but 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.620
 how can you find those who have no 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.930
 manage she could be that's what's 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.650
 this is how our desktop 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.330
 turn over 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.849
 percentage if anyone knows that we all 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.479
 turned pain modified 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.250
 firmware making very beautiful effects there 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.590
 we have such ships really pop up rf 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.259
 as soon as they closed the price very much 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.310
 reversal reversal effects 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.029
 positions 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.710
 fire nevertheless 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.419
 his goal is 6 such a function we do not have 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.210
 such 1 car 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.219
 so I thought perhaps all
