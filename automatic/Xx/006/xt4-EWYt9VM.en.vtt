00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.689
 we are now very far away defended more yes a Bernhard 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:05.970
 Stadler 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.740
 4 Dagmar Staab 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.849
 I can not measure now therefore has not considered 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:12.829
 this is easier in the past 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:16.990
 he wanted to have the world premiere of the new Carrera 4 48 years ago 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.710
 Clock 911 presented and now 48 years later we have the completely new 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.249
 Generation of the Carrera present the seventh generation significantly lighter 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.560
 as the predecessor up to 45 kilos 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.670
 large aluminum share for the first time at Porsche 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.840
 the car is significantly more efficient -16% 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.080
 consumes percent savings 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.000
 and as he became the more powerful and emotional the car became 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.930
 Nordschleife 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.740
 in seven minutes and 40 seconds anyone who knows knows he is right 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.679
 fast time for ten seconds faster than its predecessor 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.109
 and at significantly reduced fuel consumption and a 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.310
 extraordinary two things are really proud of it 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.079
 is fit again but the referee has the staff 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.820
 when I first thought of being a human Norbert 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.210
 I'm going to cost a car based Carrera will cost 88 thousand euros 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.219
 value added tax 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.250
 and as Carrera s one hundred 2000 euros 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.439
 so that's it's spring format now 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.069
 9 11 Parreira is completely new that has the rising center console 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:25.829
 As in% Carrera GTS so basically the paths from the steering wheel to the Pedelec Orwell 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.740
 Lever or the transmission are significantly reduced 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.440
 there and so on it but what is incredibly fast and also switch 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.090
 back the steering wheel 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.980
 the vehicle pass here the question how are they in that 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.890
 Double clutch transmissions from Porsche will offer both with the writing 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.500
 real civilians are nothing
