00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Q: What is the team atmosphere? 

00:00:02.506 --> 00:00:13.506
 I think it's very good. With confidence that I had won in the first match, I think I have to play a good match in the next match against Argentina. 

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:20.578
 Q: Is the goal for the Argentina match victory? 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.989
 Naturally I'm thinking of winning and going to the game 

00:00:25.983 --> 00:00:30.983
 I think that it is not good to go to the game thinking about trying to draw. 

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:37.299
 Q: Which game does Parkchson focus on? 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:44.749
 I'm not focusing on any one match 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:50.749
 As we think that every game is important for all, it is not important that the opponent team is, but I think that each game in front is the most important. 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:04.310
 Q: You said Hojom has changed a lot? 

00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:15.267
 I think it has clearly changed from before, and now I think it has become quite acceptable to the players' opinions. 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:23.649
 Q: What will you talk to everyone in the locker room before the game? 

00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:28.641
 I do not talk in particular. There is no story I would like to say other than to give up 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.740
 Q Please comment on Park Chu Young 

00:01:36.504 --> 00:01:45.504
 Well, yes. Because it is a striker in the national team now. I think that it is a player who is not foolproof even if it is said to be the highest offense. 

00:01:50.132 --> 00:01:59.132
 Q: What is the role of Pakchuyong players in the team? 

00:02:02.134 --> 00:02:19.134
 We are the only striker working on the European stage within the team, so I think his experience will be a great force for the national team. 

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:24.567
 I think that you can see it even if you look at the picture that Pakchuyong showed in Greece. 

00:02:25.657 --> 00:02:29.657
 Q: What is the best part of Pak-cheon players? 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.326
 Other than where I do not hear what I say. 

00:02:34.557 --> 00:02:36.557
 Q: What kind of thing do you mean? 

00:02:37.112 --> 00:02:41.159
 It's all, all. 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.430
 Q: What is the difference between the Premier League and World Cup levels? 

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:56.407
 In the World Cup, players represent one country and 

00:02:57.407 --> 00:03:00.407
 I think the match between the Premier League and the national team is still different. 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:07.549
 I also think that the World Cup is the world's best festival, so that's not the case, but the attitude to play the game is no different. 

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:15.707
 Q: I have a great deal of confidence in the national team, but can you feel for yourself? 

00:03:15.812 --> 00:03:19.812
 No. Not at all. That's not true. 

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:26.735
 Q: I feel that I have a great deal of confidence in him. Especially of juniors. 

00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:32.747
 No, that's not it. 

00:03:35.992 --> 00:03:40.992
 I don't feel that at all. I still think that it is only one of the players. 

00:03:45.652 --> 00:03:52.652
 Q: The atmosphere of the representative team seems to be very good? 

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:05.001
 The atmosphere was very good even in 2002 and it was good in 2006 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.689
 I think that the difference in the atmosphere is not so much. 

00:04:12.608 --> 00:04:16.608
 Q: I would like to ask you personally, but where do you think you will win? 

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:20.257
 Look at how far we can go 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.269
 Q: What do you want to say to juniors for the Argentina match? 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:34.260
 There is nothing in particular. I think it would be nice if you could play the game that you showed in the first match.
