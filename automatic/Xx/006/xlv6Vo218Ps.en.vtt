some of the abnormalities you can see

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.490 
some of the abnormalities you can see
here<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.779> Atlantians<00:00:27.779> interval<00:00:28.320> is

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
here that the Atlantians interval is

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.019 
here that the Atlantians interval is
significantly<00:00:29.070> widened<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.820> should

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
significantly widened you should

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.939 
significantly widened you should
normally<00:00:30.539> be<00:00:30.570> less<00:00:30.929> than<00:00:31.170> three<00:00:31.410> millimeters

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
normally be less than three millimeters

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.830 
normally be less than three millimeters
and<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:32.940> at<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> back<00:00:33.420> there's<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
and you can see at the back there's a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.870 
and you can see at the back there's a
loosened<00:00:34.469> line<00:00:34.680> through<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> posterior<00:00:35.550> arch

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
loosened line through the posterior arch

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.479 
loosened line through the posterior arch
representing<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.960> fracture<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.980> peg<00:00:38.250> view

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
representing a fracture on the peg view

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.069 
representing a fracture on the peg view
we<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.030> both<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> lateral<00:00:39.930> masses

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
we see that both of the lateral masses

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.010 
we see that both of the lateral masses
of<00:00:40.410> c1<00:00:40.950> are<00:00:41.219> displaced<00:00:41.760> laterally<00:00:42.270> relative

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
of c1 are displaced laterally relative

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.709 
of c1 are displaced laterally relative
to<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> lateral<00:00:43.680> passes<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.280> c2<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.510> see

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
to the lateral passes of c2 you can see

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.900 
to the lateral passes of c2 you can see
that<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:46.649> my<00:00:46.800> laser<00:00:46.980> pointer<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.460> c1

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
that here with my laser pointer that c1

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.049 
that here with my laser pointer that c1
is<00:00:48.210> overhanging<00:00:48.800> c2<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.489> should<00:00:50.700> normally<00:00:50.850> be

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
is overhanging c2 it should normally be

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.090 
is overhanging c2 it should normally be
a<00:00:51.180> straight<00:00:51.510> line<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.949> can

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
a straight line like this but you can

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.920 
a straight line like this but you can
see<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.520> both<00:00:53.760> sides<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.510> displaced

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
see that both sides have displaced

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.260 
see that both sides have displaced
laterally<00:00:55.500> now<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.520> only<00:00:56.789> way<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:56.969> can

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
laterally now the only way that can

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.049 
laterally now the only way that can
happen<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.930> arch<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.920> c1<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.489> broken<00:00:59.940> in

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
happen is if the arch of c1 is broken in

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.420 
happen is if the arch of c1 is broken in
two<00:01:00.270> spots<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.289> see<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> CT<00:01:02.399> that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
two spots you see here on the CT that

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.000 
two spots you see here on the CT that
that<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.180> fact<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.600> case<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.710> clearly

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
that is in fact the case we can clearly

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
that is in fact the case we can clearly
see<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> fracture<00:01:05.880> line<00:01:06.090> both<00:01:06.360> through<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
see a fracture line both through the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.740 
see a fracture line both through the
posterior<00:01:07.290> arch<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.790> fracture<00:01:09.240> line<00:01:09.420> here

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
posterior arch and a fracture line here

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.920 
posterior arch and a fracture line here
through<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> anterior<00:01:10.799> arch<00:01:11.299> now<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> other

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
through the anterior arch now the other

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.960 
through the anterior arch now the other
important<00:01:13.409> thing<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.590> note<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.700> bone

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
important thing to note is this bone

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.810 
important thing to note is this bone
fragment<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.869> which<00:01:16.680> represents<00:01:16.860> an<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.549> volt

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820

fragment from the insertion of the
transverse<00:01:21.360> ligament<00:01:21.920> this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.189> rare<00:01:23.549> but

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
transverse ligament this is a rare but

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.219 
transverse ligament this is a rare but
important<00:01:24.299> finding<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> setting<00:01:25.140> of

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
important finding in the setting of

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.289 
important finding in the setting of
Jefferson<00:01:25.710> fracture<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.970> implies

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
Jefferson fracture as it implies

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.940 
Jefferson fracture as it implies
instability<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.259> explains<00:01:28.680> why<00:01:28.890> this

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
instability and explains why this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.580 
instability and explains why this
patient<00:01:29.310> had<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> widened<00:01:30.390> Atlanta<00:01:31.350> dens

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
patient had a widened Atlanta dens

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.429 
patient had a widened Atlanta dens
interval<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.460> lateral<00:01:32.939> view<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:34.079> unlike

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
interval on the lateral view so unlike

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.230 
interval on the lateral view so unlike
the<00:01:34.619> vast<00:01:34.799> majority<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.490> Jefferson's

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the vast majority of Jefferson's

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.640 
the vast majority of Jefferson's
fractures<00:01:36.780> which<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.350> managed

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
fractures which can be managed

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.429 
fractures which can be managed
conservatively<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.810> immobilization<00:01:39.810> this

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
conservatively with immobilization this

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.080 
conservatively with immobilization this
patient<00:01:40.890> may<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.100> fact<00:01:41.189> require<00:01:41.549> more

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
patient may in fact require more

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.899 
patient may in fact require more
definitive<00:01:42.659> surgical<00:01:42.960> management<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> there

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
definitive surgical management so there

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.819 
definitive surgical management so there
you<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.479> Jefferson's<00:01:46.020> fracture<00:01:46.619> of

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
you have it the Jefferson's fracture of
