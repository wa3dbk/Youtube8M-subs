00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.320
 hot mass just hot so a 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.450
 bain-marie what is it just a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.930
 pan with a little bit of water and the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.180
 contact of the steam that the employee is going 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.909
 to make sure we're going to have one heat 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.400
 gentle and regular at risk not you 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.439

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.290
 mix all the way 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.390
 quietly they do not risk 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.950
 burn or miss anything 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.920
 I just raised the angel to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.009
 spread the heat we have 10 4 55 degrees 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 in fact if you 're not term being at 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.009
 the house we will say the reference and the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.420
 temperature of hot tap water 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:45.840
 so it's about 50 55 60 degrees water 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.750
 tap we are in these waters 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.030
 is around 55 60 degrees this is what 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.549
 how to look like that huh 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.969
 sugar is melted damask is hot 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.770
 monday kid and very bright we see what 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.740
 well well beyond the bars and our 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.560
 mass in the drummer's basin 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.930
 now I'm adding the flour and we're going 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.450
 beat all that in 3rd gear until 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.450
 the mixture becomes slightly lukewarm 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.189
 a small mixture is warm there is 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.290
 that it was if we are ready to move on to 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.989
 the dressage phase and preheat the oven 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.879
 at 240 degrees and there I drew up the 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.439
 macaroons a board really do not 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.569
 does not require to cool your mass 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.209
 it must be that they help slightly 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.450
 tepid too hot she ran too much 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.519
 cold fees too hard erected on Thursday 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.890
 makarova and law there that jump to 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.299
 ceiling is also the Congolese 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.359
 after there is a big debate going 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.799
 engage Congolese macaroons me I say 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.750
 that it's a little bit both 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.310
 that the ingredients about it are about 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.030
 his are pretty similar 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.870
 it's egg white it's sugar and 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.639
 coconut 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.519
 it's on the end result it's palm 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.170
 ed baird so here we go bake 240 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.340
 degrees for three four minutes in 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.260
 function of your bread oven and 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.139
 listen to it or anything it's very 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.090
 simple in law we will open the eye 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.329
 because it's going for a while 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.829
 take color very quickly 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.569
 that's to know if our macaroons are 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.980
 cooked insufficiently then we go 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:21.109
 just trust the color me and 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:24.889
 my stopwatch it is really ok 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:28.400
 the Congolese friends it's over the 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:31.010
 macaroons ausy so this little thing or 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.260
 enjoy it in the best day 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.260
 it's now a little lukewarm 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.860
 the best if you want to keep them 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.680
 hooks in an airtight box and 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.240
 after so still need be 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.120
 let people to you for you 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.800
 let it bleed like that I do not know 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.460
 this is not a small little fodder 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.010
