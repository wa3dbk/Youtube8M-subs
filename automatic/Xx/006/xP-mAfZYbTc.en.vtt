00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
if you remember from the first video I

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.769 
if you remember from the first video I
was<00:00:24.960> thinking<00:00:25.589> about<00:00:25.999> painting<00:00:26.999> it<00:00:27.119> all<00:00:27.329> black

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
was thinking about painting it all black

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.019 
was thinking about painting it all black
and<00:00:28.140> then<00:00:28.289> chroming<00:00:28.919> over<00:00:29.249> the<00:00:29.369> black<00:00:29.609> coat

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
and then chroming over the black coat

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.419 
and then chroming over the black coat
but<00:00:30.989> I<00:00:31.019> ended<00:00:31.319> up<00:00:31.409> liking<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.979> white<00:00:32.160> base

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:32.429

light<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.380> now<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.560> use<00:01:56.359> this<00:01:57.359> button<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
light so now we use this button on the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.340 
light so now we use this button on the
right<00:01:58.789> this<00:01:59.789> controls<00:02:00.359> a<00:02:01.070> visor<00:02:02.270> LED<00:02:03.270> bar<00:02:03.539> it's

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
right this controls a visor LED bar it's

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.410 
right this controls a visor LED bar it's
red<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.039> see

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
red you can see

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.639 
red you can see
hopefully<00:02:06.020> probably<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:06.890> don't<00:02:07.070> know<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:08.649> on

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
hopefully probably I don't know and on

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.160 
hopefully probably I don't know and on
the<00:02:09.800> left<00:02:09.979> side<00:02:10.160> we<00:02:10.429> got<00:02:10.550> three<00:02:10.819> buttons<00:02:11.170> front

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
the left side we got three buttons front

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.710 
the left side we got three buttons front
one<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:13.400> think<00:02:13.459> it's<00:02:13.760> yeah<00:02:14.209> these<00:02:14.510> are<00:02:14.660> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
one is I think it's yeah these are the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.550 
one is I think it's yeah these are the
strokes<00:02:15.110> chin<00:02:15.680> strokes<00:02:18.520> internal<00:02:19.520> strobes<00:02:20.560> so

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
strokes chin strokes internal strobes so

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.250 
strokes chin strokes internal strobes so
these<00:02:22.100> are<00:02:22.250> hooked<00:02:22.459> up<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.820> same<00:02:23.260> same

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
these are hooked up to the same same

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.550

button LEDs second button so you can see
that's<00:02:31.040> sort<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.310> my<00:02:31.430> face<00:02:31.610> reflecting

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
that's sort of my face reflecting

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.870 
that's sort of my face reflecting
sometimes<00:02:32.660> if<00:02:33.020> it's<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.230> really<00:02:33.530> really<00:02:33.590> dark

then the side right here is these side

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.300 
then the side right here is these side
mounted<00:02:37.310> strobes<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:38.470> all<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.590> these<00:02:39.739> can<00:02:40.160> be

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
mounted strobes and all of these can be

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.890 
mounted strobes and all of these can be
changed<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:42.340> sort<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.400> modulated<00:02:43.970> with<00:02:44.180> these

little things you can change the
speaking<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.180> which<00:02:50.300> they<00:02:50.570> strobe<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.500> also

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
speaking in which they strobe and also

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.199 
speaking in which they strobe and also
what<00:02:52.100> kind<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.370> stroke<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.850> know<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.060> can

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
have these side ones change back and

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.020 
have these side ones change back and
forth<00:02:56.600> between<00:02:57.080> stroeve's<00:02:57.709> or<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.640> can<00:02:58.820> make

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
forth between stroeve's or you can make

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.630 
forth between stroeve's or you can make
all<00:02:59.360> of<00:02:59.420> these<00:02:59.750> start<00:03:00.530> at<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.709> same<00:03:00.890> time<00:03:01.190> or

all of these start at the same time or

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.120 
all of these start at the same time or
you<00:03:02.090> know<00:03:02.180> go<00:03:02.360> in<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.510> pattern<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.980> that's

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
you know go in a pattern so that's

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.460 
you know go in a pattern so that's
pretty<00:03:04.400> cool<00:03:07.660> put<00:03:08.660> this<00:03:08.750> on<00:03:08.959> I'll<00:03:09.170> show<00:03:09.200> you

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
turn and inside strobe so that looks

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.539 
turn and inside strobe so that looks
nifty<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:33.100> outside<00:03:34.100> strobe<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:36.340> LED<00:03:37.340> bar

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
nifty and outside strobe and LED bar

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.150 
nifty and outside strobe and LED bar
then<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.510> can<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:39.230> know<00:03:39.290> mix<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.799> match<00:03:39.920> them

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
then you can you know mix and match them

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:56.740 
then you can you know mix and match them
put<00:03:40.700> them<00:03:40.820> all<00:03:40.970> together<00:03:52.720> like<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.280> yeah<00:03:56.269> that

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
put them all together like so yeah that

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.390 
put them all together like so yeah that
is<00:03:57.110> pretty<00:03:57.880> much<00:03:58.880> pretty<00:03:59.690> much<00:03:59.720> it<00:04:00.019> normally<00:04:00.860> I
