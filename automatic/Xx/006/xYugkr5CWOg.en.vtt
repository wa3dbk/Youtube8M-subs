thing<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.889> read<00:00:11.340> about<00:00:11.490> Adventure<00:00:12.480> writer<00:00:12.719> is

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
thing I read about Adventure writer is

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.599 
thing I read about Adventure writer is
that<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.610> need<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.940> calibrate<00:00:15.389> our<00:00:16.609> computer

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
that we need to calibrate our computer

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.260 
that we need to calibrate our computer
so<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.300> change<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.750> exhaust<00:00:19.820> we<00:00:20.820> got<00:00:21.000> rid<00:00:21.210> of

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
so we change the exhaust we got rid of

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.390 
so we change the exhaust we got rid of
the<00:00:21.660> cannister<00:00:22.500> under<00:00:22.890> there

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the cannister under there

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.259 
the cannister under there
we<00:00:24.000> got<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> dongle<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:26.310> engine-wise

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
we got a dongle on it engine-wise

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.540 
we got a dongle on it engine-wise
I<00:00:27.720> know<00:00:28.050> that's<00:00:28.380> about<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:29.070> all<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.400> did

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
I know that's about it we all we did

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.600 
I know that's about it we all we did
change<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.000> thermostat<00:00:31.279> under<00:00:32.279> there

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
change the thermostat under there

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.120 
change the thermostat under there
or<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> fan<00:00:33.420> switch<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.590> they<00:00:34.710> say<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.950> do

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
or the fan switch so what they say to do

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.380 
or the fan switch so what they say to do
is<00:00:35.309> turn<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:37.820> very<00:00:38.820> slowly<00:00:41.390> rotate

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
is turn this on and very slowly rotate

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.580 
is turn this on and very slowly rotate
the<00:00:43.230> throttle<00:00:46.039> to<00:00:47.039> full<00:00:47.070> throttle<00:00:48.440> that<00:00:49.440> way

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the throttle to full throttle that way

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.410 
the throttle to full throttle that way
the<00:00:49.710> computer<00:00:50.039> knows<00:00:50.370> where<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> thro

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the computer knows where the thro

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.110 
the computer knows where the thro
throttle<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.140> full<00:00:52.620> throttle<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.129> rotate<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
throttle is full throttle and rotate it

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.680 
throttle is full throttle and rotate it
back<00:00:54.300> nice<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.809> slowly<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.149> knows<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
back nice and slowly so it knows the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.560 
back nice and slowly so it knows the
limits<00:00:58.670> all<00:00:59.670> right<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.000> what's<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.390> done

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
limits all right then what's that done

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.399 
limits all right then what's that done
you<00:01:00.899> turn<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.260> off<00:01:02.719> which<00:01:03.719> will<00:01:03.870> do<00:01:04.019> that

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
you turn it off which will do that

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.050 
you turn it off which will do that
all<00:01:06.409> right<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:06.710> supposedly<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:07.520> does

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
all right so supposedly that does

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.859 
all right so supposedly that does
something<00:01:08.479> to<00:01:08.630> establish<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.290> range<00:01:09.530> now

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
something to establish the range now

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.090 
something to establish the range now
next<00:01:11.869> step<00:01:11.990> is<00:01:13.600> we<00:01:14.600> need<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.049> engine<00:01:15.830> to

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
next step is we need the engine to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.010 
next step is we need the engine to
figure<00:01:16.430> out<00:01:16.750> what<00:01:17.750> all<00:01:17.869> changes<00:01:18.409> were<00:01:18.560> made<00:01:20.020> so

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
figure out what all changes were made so

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.260 
figure out what all changes were made so
what<00:01:21.979> I've<00:01:22.100> got<00:01:22.130> is<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.550> switches<00:01:23.000> on<00:01:23.149> the

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
what I've got is the switches on the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.040 
what I've got is the switches on the
kill<00:01:24.140> switches<00:01:24.409> in<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:24.680> on<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.369> run<00:01:25.550> position

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
kill switches in the on the run position

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.680 
kill switches in the on the run position
that<00:01:27.050> means<00:01:27.200> it's<00:01:27.500> going<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:27.680> be<00:01:27.830> front<00:01:28.070> abs<00:01:28.690> no

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
that means it's going to be front abs no

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.539 
that means it's going to be front abs no
rear<00:01:29.960> abs<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:30.710> we're<00:01:30.950> supposed<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.220> let<00:01:31.369> this

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
rear abs and we're supposed to let this

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.620 
rear abs and we're supposed to let this
run<00:01:31.790> for<00:01:31.820> 15<00:01:32.390> minutes<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:34.610> time<00:01:34.909> stamp<00:01:35.390> on

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
run for 15 minutes so the time stamp on

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.130 
run for 15 minutes so the time stamp on
here<00:01:35.899> says<00:01:36.200> 1519<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:38.119> know<00:01:38.240> maybe<00:01:38.810> this<00:01:38.960> is<00:01:39.080> a

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
here says 1519 you know maybe this is a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.359 
here says 1519 you know maybe this is a
good<00:01:39.259> time<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:40.570> try<00:01:41.570> my<00:01:41.600> trip<00:01:43.720> timer<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:45.369> don't

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
good time to try my trip timer I don't

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.719 
good time to try my trip timer I don't
see<00:01:46.520> how<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:46.700> do<00:01:46.909> that<00:01:47.030> yet<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:48.280> got<00:01:49.280> four<00:01:49.460> hundred

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
let this thing idle nothing more don't

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.100 
let this thing idle nothing more don't
touch<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.640> throttle<00:02:14.060> just<00:02:14.090> let<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.540> idle<00:02:14.720> so

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
touch the throttle just let it idle so

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:24.920 
touch the throttle just let it idle so
it's<00:02:15.230> 15<00:02:15.620> 20<00:02:16.010> right<00:02:16.220> now<00:02:16.400> come<00:02:16.880> back<00:02:17.090> 15<00:02:17.750> 35
