time<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:24.029> one<00:00:24.210> really<00:00:24.420> annoying<00:00:25.140> thing<00:00:25.500> about

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
time the one really annoying thing about

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.980 
time the one really annoying thing about
these<00:00:25.980> creatures<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.090> they<00:00:27.240> drop<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.660> lot

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
these creatures is that they drop a lot

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.400 
these creatures is that they drop a lot
of<00:00:28.289> psionic<00:00:29.130> scales<00:00:29.490> now<00:00:30.140> well<00:00:31.140> that's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
of psionic scales now well that's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.139 
of psionic scales now well that's
actually<00:00:31.590> not<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.009> bad<00:00:32.099> thing<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.969> bad

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
actually not a bad thing but the bad

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.510 
actually not a bad thing but the bad
thing<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.020> if<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.620> drop<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.980> above<00:00:35.280> 1

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
thing is that if a drop is above 1

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.700 
thing is that if a drop is above 1
million<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.300> will<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.870> beam<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.440> light

I<00:01:49.229> guess<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.649> should<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:49.979> done<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.430> because

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
I guess I should have done that because

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.069 
I guess I should have done that because
this<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> loot<00:01:51.659> video<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.880> ideally<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.450> was

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
this is a loot video but ideally I was

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.289 
this is a loot video but ideally I was
too<00:01:55.320> lazy<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:56.009> pick<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.579> hands<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.030> picked

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
too lazy to pick up the hands I picked

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.969 
too lazy to pick up the hands I picked
up<00:01:57.420> everything<00:01:57.930> else<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.530> couldn't

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
up everything else but I just couldn't

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.030 
up everything else but I just couldn't
pick<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.579> helps<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.750> didn't<00:02:01.649> find<00:02:01.829> them

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
pick up the helps I I didn't find them

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.550 
pick up the helps I I didn't find them
to<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.430> worth<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.659> much<00:02:03.930> even<00:02:04.350> though<00:02:04.530> I

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
to be worth that much even though I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.619 
to be worth that much even though I
think<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:05.040> would<00:02:05.250> be<00:02:05.460> additional<00:02:08.149> 1.5<00:02:09.149> mil<00:02:09.509> or

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
think it would be additional 1.5 mil or

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.960 
think it would be additional 1.5 mil or
something<00:02:10.110> ok<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.430> actually<00:02:11.580> not

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
something ok so this is actually not

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.900 
something ok so this is actually not
that<00:02:12.180> accurate<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.020> will<00:02:13.379> need<00:02:13.620> to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
that accurate so I will need to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.700 
that accurate so I will need to
sell<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> few<00:02:14.540> things<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.050> gran<00:02:15.260> exchange

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
sell a few things in the gran exchange

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.110 
sell a few things in the gran exchange
and<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:16.010> will<00:02:16.190> need<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.520> do<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.670> price<00:02:16.910> check

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
and I will need to do a price check

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.240 
and I will need to do a price check
again<00:02:17.480> because<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.960> shows<00:02:18.170> us<00:02:18.200> 41<00:02:18.980> million

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
again because it shows us 41 million

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.170 
again because it shows us 41 million
when<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.630> sirenix<00:02:20.960> scales<00:02:21.530> are<00:02:21.830> like<00:02:22.180> 500k

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
when the sirenix scales are like 500k

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.130 
when the sirenix scales are like 500k
only<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.920> bones<00:02:25.190> add<00:02:25.460> 10,000<00:02:26.390> each<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:26.930> it

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
only and the bones add 10,000 each so it

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.590 
only and the bones add 10,000 each so it
definitely<00:02:27.350> shows<00:02:28.070> some<00:02:28.400> overpriced<00:02:29.120> things

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
definitely shows some overpriced things

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.690 
definitely shows some overpriced things
in<00:02:29.840> here<00:02:30.050> so<00:02:30.410> I'm<00:02:30.680> gonna<00:02:30.830> try<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.130> sell<00:02:31.520> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
in here so I'm gonna try to sell the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.760 
in here so I'm gonna try to sell the
bones<00:02:31.940> first<00:02:32.240> so<00:02:32.600> they<00:02:32.750> should<00:02:33.050> be<00:02:33.230> going<00:02:33.560> for

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.140 
ten thousand I'm gonna try to sell them
for<00:02:35.510> nine<00:02:35.870> thousand<00:02:36.350> each<00:02:36.580> yes<00:02:37.580> they<00:02:37.790> do<00:02:37.850> have

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
for nine thousand each yes they do have

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.570 
for nine thousand each yes they do have
unique<00:02:38.780> bones<00:02:39.410> as<00:02:39.710> well<00:02:39.950> when<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.250> kill<00:02:40.430> them

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
unique bones as well when you kill them

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.120 
unique bones as well when you kill them
which<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:40.910> cool<00:02:41.240> makes<00:02:42.080> them<00:02:42.320> worth<00:02:42.590> killing<00:02:42.920> I

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
which is cool makes them worth killing I

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.940 
which is cool makes them worth killing I
guess<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:43.520> yeah<00:02:43.700> it's<00:02:43.850> around<00:02:44.770> well<00:02:45.770> nine

guess so yeah it's around well nine

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.650 
guess so yeah it's around well nine
point<00:02:46.190> seven<00:02:46.310> thousand<00:02:46.790> for<00:02:46.970> each<00:02:47.000> bone<00:02:47.360> and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
point seven thousand for each bone and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.080 
point seven thousand for each bone and
then<00:02:47.990> I<00:02:48.110> should<00:02:48.350> sell<00:02:48.620> those<00:02:48.830> ionic<00:02:49.370> skills<00:02:49.820> I

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
then I should sell those ionic skills I

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.270 
then I should sell those ionic skills I
have<00:02:50.570> no<00:02:50.840> idea<00:02:51.140> for<00:02:51.320> how<00:02:51.470> much<00:02:51.650> they<00:02:51.890> will<00:02:52.040> go

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280

them so we're gonna what is is around
like<00:03:05.750> let's<00:03:06.380> say<00:03:06.530> six<00:03:06.980> million<00:03:07.280> from<00:03:07.820> satanic

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
like let's say six million from satanic

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.750 
like let's say six million from satanic
scales<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:09.260> let's<00:03:09.470> do<00:03:09.620> plastic<00:03:09.860> again<00:03:10.460> really

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
scales so let's do plastic again really

scales so let's do plastic again really
quickly<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:11.990> is<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.260> final<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:12.860> correct

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
quickly so this is the final and correct

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.730 
quickly so this is the final and correct

rats<00:03:16.690> 23<00:03:17.690> million<00:03:17.930> not<00:03:18.620> bad<00:03:18.950> but<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.459> did<00:03:19.670> take

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
rats 23 million not bad but it did take

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.960 
rats 23 million not bad but it did take
me<00:03:20.209> like<00:03:20.420> 10<00:03:20.600> hours<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.560> while<00:03:22.370> making<00:03:22.610> some

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
me like 10 hours and while making some

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.000 
me like 10 hours and while making some
money<00:03:23.150> at<00:03:23.360> Ghana<00:03:23.630> dynamics<00:03:24.050> and<00:03:24.350> even<00:03:24.650> for<00:03:24.890> us

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
money at Ghana dynamics and even for us

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.770 
money at Ghana dynamics and even for us
leggings<00:03:25.459> I<00:03:25.580> think<00:03:25.880> would<00:03:26.150> make<00:03:26.360> me<00:03:26.540> more

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
leggings I think would make me more

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.620 
leggings I think would make me more
money<00:03:27.140> during<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:27.860> time<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:29.000> they<00:03:29.209> are<00:03:29.300> good

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
money during that time so they are good

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.350 
money during that time so they are good
but<00:03:30.260> definitely<00:03:31.070> definitely<00:03:31.430> not<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.150> best

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
but definitely definitely not the best

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.810 
but definitely definitely not the best
okay<00:03:33.140> so<00:03:33.200> should<00:03:33.680> not<00:03:33.890> be<00:03:34.040> possible<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.640> take

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
okay so should not be possible to take

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.420 
okay so should not be possible to take
mask<00:03:35.180> pads<00:03:35.540> for<00:03:35.870> any<00:03:36.110> items<00:03:36.650> just<00:03:37.100> like<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.370> do

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
mask pads for any items just like I do

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.220 
mask pads for any items just like I do
in<00:03:37.670> this<00:03:37.820> trade<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:38.600> should<00:03:38.900> not<00:03:39.050> be

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
in this trade that should not be

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.990 
in this trade that should not be
possible<00:03:39.440> but<00:03:39.920> because<00:03:40.250> this<00:03:40.520> guy<00:03:40.730> gave<00:03:40.940> me

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
possible but because this guy gave me

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.960 
possible but because this guy gave me
notan<00:03:41.570> mask<00:03:41.810> but<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.620> game<00:03:42.860> allows<00:03:43.280> me<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:43.790> do

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
notan mask but the game allows me to do

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.660 
notan mask but the game allows me to do
the<00:03:44.180> trade<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.980> otherwise<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.220> should<00:03:46.400> tell

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
the trade and otherwise it should tell

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.910 
the trade and otherwise it should tell
me<00:03:46.850> that<00:03:46.880> this<00:03:47.570> part<00:03:47.870> can<00:03:48.110> only<00:03:48.290> be<00:03:48.500> traded<00:03:48.890> for

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
me that this part can only be traded for

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.949 
me that this part can only be traded for
another<00:03:49.489> part<00:03:49.940> so<00:03:50.930> let's<00:03:51.320> build<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.709> mask<00:03:51.950> and

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
another part so let's build the mask and

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.320 
another part so let's build the mask and
let's<00:03:53.959> do<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.010> with<00:03:55.220> it<00:03:55.459> how<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:56.120> can

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
let's do you with it how you can

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.060 
let's do you with it how you can
actually<00:03:56.660> claim<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.080> experience<00:03:57.560> so<00:03:57.800> yeah

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
actually claim the experience so yeah

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.780 
actually claim the experience so yeah
only<00:03:58.459> combat<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.239> as<00:03:59.720> far<00:03:59.900> as<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.140> know<00:04:00.410> it's

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
only combat and as far as I know it's

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.720 
only combat and as far as I know it's
45,000<00:04:01.790> on<00:04:02.260> combat<00:04:03.260> stats<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.860> 10000<00:04:04.459> on<00:04:04.580> this

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
45,000 on combat stats and 10000 on this

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.120 
45,000 on combat stats and 10000 on this
layer<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.989> can<00:04:06.020> only<00:04:06.320> use<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.830> if<00:04:06.980> your

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
layer and you can only use it if your

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.780 
layer and you can only use it if your
level<00:04:07.640> is<00:04:07.850> 90<00:04:08.450> or<00:04:08.480> above<00:04:09.220> so<00:04:10.220> this<00:04:10.459> should<00:04:10.670> not

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
level is 90 or above so this should not

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.449 
level is 90 or above so this should not
be<00:04:10.850> abusable<00:04:11.450> by<00:04:11.720> low<00:04:11.959> levels<00:04:11.989> so<00:04:12.950> let's<00:04:13.160> claim

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
be abusable by low levels so let's claim

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.390 
be abusable by low levels so let's claim
this<00:04:13.700> layer<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.470> yeah<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.500> got<00:04:15.770> oh<00:04:15.980> actually

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
this layer and yeah I got oh actually

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.170 
this layer and yeah I got oh actually
it's<00:04:16.790> instant<00:04:17.299> experience<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.049> thought<00:04:18.290> it<00:04:18.440> was

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
it's instant experience I thought it was

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.930 
it's instant experience I thought it was
okay<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:20.239> currently<00:04:21.080> you<00:04:22.039> have<00:04:22.070> Bibles

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
okay so currently you have Bibles

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.110 
okay so currently you have Bibles
layered<00:04:23.270> experience<00:04:24.430> unless<00:04:25.430> they<00:04:25.669> fix<00:04:25.910> this

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
layered experience unless they fix this

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.760 
layered experience unless they fix this
glitch<00:04:26.419> so<00:04:26.870> that's<00:04:27.110> all<00:04:27.289> for<00:04:27.500> now

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
glitch so that's all for now

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.650 
glitch so that's all for now
hope<00:04:27.919> you<00:04:28.069> enjoyed<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.819> I'll<00:04:29.210> see<00:04:29.240> you
