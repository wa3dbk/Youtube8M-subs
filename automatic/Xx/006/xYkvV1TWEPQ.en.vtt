to<00:01:41.259> apply<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.670> can<00:01:42.700> create<00:01:43.030> meal<00:01:43.330> plans

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
to apply and you can create meal plans

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.450 
to apply and you can create meal plans
from<00:01:43.810> there<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.289> one<00:01:44.710> thing<00:01:44.920> that<00:01:45.039> may<00:01:45.220> help

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
from there and one thing that may help

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.550 
from there and one thing that may help
is<00:01:45.789> dividing<00:01:46.300> your<00:01:46.450> foods<00:01:46.690> into<00:01:46.899> categories

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
is dividing your foods into categories

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
so for me those categories are

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.090 
so for me those categories are
carbohydrates<00:01:49.750> proteins<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:50.920> vegetables

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
carbohydrates proteins and vegetables

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.999 
carbohydrates proteins and vegetables
and<00:01:51.789> that<00:01:52.539> way<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:52.750> can<00:01:52.990> see<00:01:53.289> what<00:01:53.470> I<00:01:53.500> have<00:01:53.560> what

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
and that way I can see what I have what

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.560 
and that way I can see what I have what
I<00:01:54.070> need<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.580> can<00:01:54.729> go<00:01:54.820> from<00:01:54.970> there<00:01:55.210> and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
I need and I can go from there and

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.389 
I need and I can go from there and
