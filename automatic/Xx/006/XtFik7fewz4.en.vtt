00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 and how my crumbs go, I am talent and 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.080
 we are playing a motorcycle race that 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.480
 they know what is said but the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.269
 they put on bikes so they return the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.759
 races and I'm going to bring you to this channel 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.210
 of talent gameplays to see how it is 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.160
 this is called the hype the hype the hype a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.260
 see how it is a return nothing more 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.840
 so as I tell you, the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.849
 races you know I brought them 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.340
 a lot on my main channel 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.980
 I do not have pressure and truth but it was the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.300
 first of facts to take that I took out 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.219
 the top 5 races of the week after 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.829
 all the youtubers started 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.360
 they started doing and just do not 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.600
 I wanted to do the same thing that all 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.460
 others then good but then many 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.539
 of you liked the races and the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.329
 nothing 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.699
 and the other time in the comments I 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.489
 told an SUV that they no longer up to 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.680
 top 5 races of the week because they no longer 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.260
 recorded career 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.280
 that others told me what happened with challenges 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.380
 to the devil 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.840
 reynosa the devil and we just good 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.650
 Curuchet challenges the devil , yet again 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.310
 we finish it and do not pay attention to me it 's all 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.310
 it is not true 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.470
 Well, the point is that I think we're going 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.430
 show your careers in this video 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.200
 because apparently they are very very 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.360
 little bit 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.310
 is very short this race is thought 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.640
 I thought it was a parkour race 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.860
 and apparently it's a lap race 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.049
 it's super easy so good come back 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.420
 the races here to this channel 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.429
 I'm going to put another race down routes 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.500
 the devil is already taking it from me at least 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.990
 get to the sad story looking 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.679
 and nobody else after the 13th so already 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.679
 I know it 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.930
 Well, we're already in the next one and 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.490
 which is called crosses the lake this race 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.200
 they had shown it in the top 5 but 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.570
 thanks to the first principle is when 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.580
 started the series so I remember that 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.740
 It was very funny and very difficult like that 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.200
 that the point is to see something entertaining in 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.820
 these careers remember that if you 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.280
 they have careers that you have 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.330
 liked that they seemed pretty 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.970
 difficult when the hides 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.730
 - can happen but can happen what 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.890
 only they have to do is send you 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.200
 a picture of your eye 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.450
 all they have to do it 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.810
 seriously speaking the only thing they have 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.810
 what to do 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.810
 now yes I just said 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.920
 there was not the only thing they have to do 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.800
 seriously 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.959
 put me in the comments the link of the 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.610
 career that you liked until 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.860

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.959

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.190

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.540

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.950

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:16.140
 say the pack is a term like 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.140
