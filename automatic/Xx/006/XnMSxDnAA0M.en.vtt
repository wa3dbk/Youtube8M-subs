00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.839
 once we finish with the charge of the tariffs 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.289
 the next step is 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.289

 inventory of the rooms 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.239
 a menu is displayed 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.200
 as a liguilla 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 with the month in which we are in force 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.440
 let's spread 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.330
 up there forever 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
 oas the time we have the rate 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.210
 in fact we can choose in which tarija I will load the inventory 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.950
 and notice that he opened a mass for me every month 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.500
 up we have the reference colors 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.799
 by willing 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.540
 The inventory 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.030
 for channels it is closed

 we now have to modify the inventory we must open it and determine 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.390
 a number of rooms 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.880
 that will be marketed for channels 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.270
 for this edition the own ones of the hotel 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.750
 all the rooms are commercialized 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.790
 and it's always open 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.030
 clear that the inventory is in siero for lack of availability or 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.550
 on the rich and famous coast and the canals 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.570
 the hotel must choose the amount that will be available for commercialization 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.130
 first we have to select 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.510
 within the month 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.720
 the room and the date that I am going to modify 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.679

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.210
 so what action 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.079
 let's drink 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.169
 we go to the drift 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.169
 a certain value 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:29.419
 and notice that they put the maximum amount in front of rooms that the 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:30.659
 hotel 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.220
 that category the hotel has two rooms therefore 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.340
 can inhabit a room or nicknames 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.399
 no more let's live 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.329
 two rooms 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.329

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.499
 already entesa and an airplane 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:50.309

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:52.859
 they are in green yes 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.930
 we refer to the references 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.219
 of adobes had accepted 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.450
 it happens the same with the double knew how to select all unexpected leader 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.829
 pressing 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.069
 The Havana room itself could choose one day of all the rooms 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.359
 day pressure 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.969
 we demand the room 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.969
 Right click changes the selection 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.340
 We were going to open 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.340
 and in this case or to pass another modality to open 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:27.419
 let's set a value but a percentage I will set 50% 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.769
 of that category 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.719
 that is half of the rooms and that nextel category 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.719
 available on the channels 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.889
 I keep the changes 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.839

 we both work hard psoe at novak rate 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.400
 it is worth saying the rate to kidnap the month of July 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.839
 the cadiz to canada 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:12.089
 food is therefore available 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:15.570
 however the promotional rate has not yet 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.609
 we do not have an inventory 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.750
 then we go to the former lover in this case are not appointed to go to dinner 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.939
 together for the whole month 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:26.129
 right click 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.249
 We were despondent 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.909
 how much will open us to establish a value also peace we will establish 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.949
 the same value 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.000
 that the cow 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 let's leave it at the same value of the pac 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.800
 vianet in the promotional rate 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.800
 it is open in the same condition as rac 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:47.830
 valecillos 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.110
 we have two rooms 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.969
 if one sees 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.760
 so much to market in raqa 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.639
 as in promotion 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.840
 and a double room a 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.289

 to eat at the time oem promotion 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:10.249
 in the same way you have to be the rest of the months 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.139
 now if I want to be weird 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.050
 a date 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.439
 for example on day 18 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:24.739
 I'm going to close it because it has a group that completes the hotel I'm going to change the 

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:27.849
 selection 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.849

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.770
 and here occurred sarramona rates while 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.659

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:44.039
 automatically closing the streak closes the promotional 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.719
 for July 18 

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:51.900
