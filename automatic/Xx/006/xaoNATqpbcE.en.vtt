00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
what's been so bad about us maybe there

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.300

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
lot of playing in them as long as he

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.850

continues<00:06:14.330> to<00:06:14.659> improve<00:06:15.080> the<00:06:15.229> progressive

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
continues to improve the progressive

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.100 
continues to improve the progressive
work<00:06:16.580> on<00:06:16.759> areas<00:06:17.149> that<00:06:17.180> he<00:06:17.360> needs<00:06:17.599> to<00:06:17.689> in<00:06:18.020> order

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.540 

and<00:06:28.990> so<00:06:29.349> it's<00:06:29.559> up<00:06:29.680> to<00:06:29.710> us<00:06:29.860> in<00:06:30.099> the<00:06:30.159> locker<00:06:30.339> room

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
and so it's up to us in the locker room

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.879 
and so it's up to us in the locker room
until<00:06:30.879> they<00:06:31.029> show<00:06:31.449> people<00:06:32.080> that<00:06:32.229> how<00:06:32.559> good<00:06:32.770> it

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
until they show people that how good it

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.549 
until they show people that how good it
really<00:06:32.979> could<00:06:33.309> mean<00:06:33.520> right<00:06:34.180> now<00:06:34.210> just<00:06:34.659> people

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:35.559 
really could mean right now just people

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:37.439 
really could mean right now just people
say<00:06:35.710> I<00:06:35.740> was<00:06:36.069> attached<00:06:36.369> over<00:06:36.610> very<00:06:36.999> dangerous

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
but we have only proved that to anybody

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.659 
but we have only proved that to anybody
