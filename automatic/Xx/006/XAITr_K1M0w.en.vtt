with one battery pack then the power
motor<00:01:00.710> we<00:01:01.640> developed<00:01:02.149> a<00:01:02.360> new<00:01:02.510> motor

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
motor we developed a new motor

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.300 
motor we developed a new motor
more<00:01:04.789> power<00:01:05.119> with<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.140> special<00:01:06.649> technology

about Mack needs and comfort to work
together<00:01:11.350> and<00:01:12.350> for<00:01:12.859> sure

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.789 

the<00:01:15.860> center<00:01:16.310> ik<00:01:16.490> plate

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
the center ik plate

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.969 
the center ik plate
it<00:01:19.100> means<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.180> bike<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:20.929> the<00:01:21.350> person

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
it means that the bike and the person

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.730 
it means that the bike and the person
the<00:01:22.100> right<00:01:22.310> wrist<00:01:22.729> is<00:01:23.420> one<00:01:23.689> piece

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the right wrist is one piece

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.359 
the right wrist is one piece
I<00:01:25.799> mean<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.520> maybe<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> most

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
I mean it's maybe the most

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.510 
I mean it's maybe the most
sensible<00:01:29.240> biking<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.049> industry<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:31.280> can

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
sensible biking in the industry you can

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.539 
sensible biking in the industry you can
very<00:01:32.299> go<00:01:32.509> smoothly<00:01:32.960> uphill<00:01:33.680> or<00:01:33.860> downhill<00:01:33.890> it's

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
very go smoothly uphill or downhill it's

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.830 
very go smoothly uphill or downhill it's
it's<00:01:34.880> understand<00:01:35.450> your<00:01:35.860> personal<00:01:36.860> feeling

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
it's understand your personal feeling

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.670 
it's understand your personal feeling
and<00:01:38.840> then<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.649> main<00:01:39.860> thing<00:01:39.890> maybe

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
and then the the main thing maybe

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.170 
and then the the main thing maybe
the<00:01:41.920> display<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:43.410> integration<00:01:44.410> of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the display the integration of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.290 
the display the integration of
communication<00:01:46.180> for<00:01:46.990> example<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.740> can<00:01:48.300> track

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
communication for example you can track

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.210 
communication for example you can track
and<00:01:49.570> trace<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.050> back<00:01:50.260> you<00:01:50.500> can<00:01:50.650> see<00:01:50.920> where<00:01:51.130> the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
and trace the back you can see where the

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.220 
and trace the back you can see where the
bike<00:01:51.460> is<00:01:51.790> you<00:01:52.060> can<00:01:52.360> tune<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.320> bike<00:01:53.530> with<00:01:54.460> your

the life they told Tyler how to move may

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.119 
the life they told Tyler how to move may
to<00:03:26.159> be<00:03:26.370> yours<00:03:26.939> in<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.209> free<00:03:27.450> time<00:03:28.129> that's

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
to be yours in the free time that's

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.830 
to be yours in the free time that's
that's<00:03:30.090> too<00:03:30.540> big

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
that's too big

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.240 
that's too big
mostly<00:03:32.650> young<00:03:33.459> trendy<00:03:33.940> ugly<00:03:34.739> now<00:03:35.739> it's<00:03:35.980> really

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
mostly young trendy ugly now it's really

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.520 
mostly young trendy ugly now it's really
good<00:03:36.430> it's<00:03:36.610> absolute<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.510> developed<00:03:37.989> and

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
good it's absolute you developed and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.800 
good it's absolute you developed and
also<00:03:39.340> very<00:03:39.520> powerful

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.170 

those<00:03:42.620> are<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:42.920> efficiency<00:03:43.610> of<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.970> whole

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
those are the efficiency of the whole

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.080 
those are the efficiency of the whole
system<00:03:44.480> is<00:03:44.810> completely<00:03:45.350> new<00:03:45.850> we<00:03:46.850> have<00:03:47.060> a

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
system is completely new we have a

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.930 
system is completely new we have a
campus<00:03:47.720> technology<00:03:48.310> who<00:03:49.310> measure<00:03:49.580> all<00:03:49.910> the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
campus technology who measure all the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.980 
campus technology who measure all the
small<00:03:51.660> steps<00:03:52.050> and<00:03:52.290> that's<00:03:52.470> mine

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.500 

the<00:03:55.170> sensor<00:03:55.650> isn't<00:03:55.950> easy<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.220> torque<00:03:56.550> sensor

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
the sensor isn't easy a torque sensor

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.570 
the sensor isn't easy a torque sensor
are<00:03:59.510> in<00:03:59.630> it<00:03:59.810> yeah<00:04:00.260> we<00:04:00.410> have<00:04:00.590> gear<00:04:00.890> senses<00:04:01.430> but

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
are in it yeah we have gear senses but

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.900 
are in it yeah we have gear senses but
we<00:04:01.730> have<00:04:01.910> false<00:04:02.120> ascends<00:04:02.600> lights<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:03.910> moving

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
we have false ascends lights and moving

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.820 
we have false ascends lights and moving
center<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.540> all<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.170> all<00:04:06.380> everything

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
center and all this and all everything

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:14.480 
center and all this and all everything
together<00:04:07.250> give<00:04:07.730> this<00:04:08.170> feeling

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.740 

and<00:04:14.880> wonder<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.240> felt<00:04:15.420> so<00:04:15.740> everything

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
and wonder it felt so everything

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.370 

yeah<00:04:19.290> that<00:04:19.709> has<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.100> be<00:04:20.190> tested<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:21.380> relaunch

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
yeah that has to be tested to relaunch

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.890 
yeah that has to be tested to relaunch
it<00:04:22.680> soon<00:04:22.980> in<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.340> in<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.550> states<00:04:23.900> I've

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
it soon in the in the states I've

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.860 
it soon in the in the states I've
hopefully<00:04:25.320> we<00:04:25.920> can<00:04:26.160> have<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.790> same<00:04:27.030> success

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
hopefully we can have the same success

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.230 
hopefully we can have the same success
like<00:04:28.440> we<00:04:28.620> have<00:04:28.740> in<00:04:28.950> Switzerland<00:04:29.520> in<00:04:29.670> Europe

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
like we have in Switzerland in Europe

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.980 
like we have in Switzerland in Europe
I<00:04:31.270> think<00:04:31.840> no<00:04:31.990> doubt<00:04:32.199> we<00:04:33.100> brought<00:04:33.310> it<00:04:33.490> for<00:04:33.990> the

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
I think no doubt we brought it for the

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.040 
I think no doubt we brought it for the
first<00:04:35.199> time<00:04:35.410> yesterday<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.419> I<00:04:37.419> can<00:04:37.720> tell<00:04:37.900> you
