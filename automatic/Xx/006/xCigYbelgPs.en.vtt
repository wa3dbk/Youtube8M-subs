00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
to one side on where i'm mark the pliers

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.719 
to one side on where i'm mark the pliers
wrap<00:01:02.100> over<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.180> mark<00:01:03.949> giving<00:01:04.949> us<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> nice<00:01:05.339> loop

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
wrap over the mark giving us a nice loop

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.160 
wrap over the mark giving us a nice loop
that's<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.420> uniform<00:01:06.900> size

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that's going to be uniform size

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.469 
that's going to be uniform size
throughout<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.830> bracelet<00:01:08.310> i've<00:01:08.850> wrapped

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
throughout the bracelet i've wrapped

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.399 
throughout the bracelet i've wrapped
around<00:01:09.659> three<00:01:10.350> times<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:12.049> once<00:01:13.049> I've<00:01:13.229> got

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
around three times and once I've got

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.469 
around three times and once I've got
that<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:14.189> I'll<00:01:14.340> do<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.030> will<00:01:15.060> trim

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
that then what I'll do is I will trim

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.469 
that then what I'll do is I will trim
that<00:01:15.659> off<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.400> use<00:01:17.400> my<00:01:17.670> snipe<00:01:18.030> or<00:01:18.270> chain<00:01:18.299> nose

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
pliers to flatten any little ends now

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.210 
pliers to flatten any little ends now
when<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.020> thread<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> bead<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.920> time

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
when we thread the bead on this time

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.030 
when we thread the bead on this time
instead<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.119> pushing<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.720> right<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
instead of pushing it right up to the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.880 
instead of pushing it right up to the
end<00:01:26.250> I'm<00:01:26.520> leaving<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.030> bit<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.360> wire<00:01:27.799> nestled<00:01:28.799> in

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
end I'm leaving a bit of wire nestled in

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.130 
end I'm leaving a bit of wire nestled in
my<00:01:28.979> finger<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.490> stays<00:01:29.790> put<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:31.049> I

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
my finger so it stays put and then I

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.810 
my finger so it stays put and then I
bring<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.860> wire<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.220> would<00:01:32.340> push<00:01:32.549> through

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
bring the wire that would push through

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.319 
bring the wire that would push through
across<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.079> front<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.700> briella<00:01:36.030> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
across the front of the briella and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.780 
across the front of the briella and
slightly<00:01:36.570> downwards<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.280> when<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> wrap

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
slightly downwards so that when I wrap

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.130 
slightly downwards so that when I wrap
around<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.570> see<00:01:39.720> how<00:01:39.869> I've<00:01:40.020> gone

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
around can you see how I've gone

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.050 
around can you see how I've gone
underneath<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.159> wire<00:01:41.310> sticking<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:41.909> it's

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
underneath the wire sticking out it's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.560 
underneath the wire sticking out it's
got<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.329> loop<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:44.119> sort<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.149> shields<00:01:45.479> it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
got the loop on that sort of shields it

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.420 
got the loop on that sort of shields it
from<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> top<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:46.979> I'm<00:01:47.100> going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.310> do

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
from the top but what I'm going to do

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.760 
from the top but what I'm going to do
now<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.909> I'm<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.299> wrap<00:01:48.540> around<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
now is I'm going to wrap around and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.310 
now is I'm going to wrap around and
around<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:51.060> top<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.509> briolette<00:01:51.689> I've

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
around the top of that briolette I've

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.580 
around the top of that briolette I've
gone<00:01:52.560> round<00:01:52.770> four<00:01:52.979> times<00:01:53.689> so<00:01:54.689> my<00:01:54.930> wire<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.409> now

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
gone round four times so my wire is now

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.990 
gone round four times so my wire is now
coming<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.040> side<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.490> I'm<00:01:56.610> going<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
coming to this side and I'm going to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.920 
coming to this side and I'm going to
make<00:01:57.649> another<00:01:58.649> loop<00:01:59.030> there<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.630> how

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
make another loop there you can see how

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.380 
make another loop there you can see how

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you see a little gap I've got

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.360 
you see a little gap I've got
a<00:02:11.730> piece<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.720> wire<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.500> actually<00:02:13.890> sticks<00:02:14.100> out

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
a piece of wire that actually sticks out

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.809 
a piece of wire that actually sticks out
as<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:15.300> make<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.810> circle<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.530> want<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.580> two

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
as I make the circle I want the two

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.270 
as I make the circle I want the two
sides<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.540> be<00:02:18.630> even<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.910> needs<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:22.319> be<00:02:22.620> about

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
sides to be even so it needs to be about

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.550 
sides to be even so it needs to be about
the<00:02:23.730> same<00:02:23.940> distance<00:02:24.000> away<00:02:24.540> Stern<00:02:25.110> as<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the same distance away Stern as the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.210 
the same distance away Stern as the
other<00:02:25.740> side<00:02:27.410> I've<00:02:28.410> done<00:02:28.590> about<00:02:28.740> three<00:02:28.920> shots

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
other side I've done about three shots

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.260 
other side I've done about three shots
of<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.550> they're<00:02:29.760> all<00:02:30.030> from<00:02:30.209> different

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
of that they're all from different

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.300 
of that they're all from different
angles<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.140> try<00:02:31.350> ensure<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.830> exactly

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
angles just to try ensure you exactly

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.890 
angles just to try ensure you exactly
what<00:02:32.459> I'm<00:02:32.640> doing<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.360> then<00:02:33.600> I'm<00:02:33.720> going<00:02:33.840> to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
what I'm doing and then I'm going to

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.250 
what I'm doing and then I'm going to
wrap<00:02:34.050> around<00:02:34.110> three<00:02:34.590> times<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.990> now<00:02:37.080> I'll

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
wrap around three times and now I'll

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.720 
wrap around three times and now I'll
show<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.620> from<00:02:37.770> another<00:02:37.980> angle<00:02:38.100> because

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
show you this from another angle because

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.150 
show you this from another angle because
you<00:02:39.150> saw<00:02:39.330> how<00:02:39.360> we<00:02:39.540> sort<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.900> came<00:02:40.440> up<00:02:40.680> over<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
you saw how we sort of came up over the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.220 
you saw how we sort of came up over the
top<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.700> briolette<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.239> now<00:02:42.569> want<00:02:42.930> this

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
top of the briolette and now want this

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.130 
top of the briolette and now want this
way<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> come<00:02:44.010> back<00:02:44.280> round<00:02:44.610> underneath<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:46.050> we

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
way to come back round underneath so we

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.350 
way to come back round underneath so we
did<00:02:46.260> our<00:02:46.350> three<00:02:46.590> wraps<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.550> Kym<00:02:47.790> background

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360

really need a lot to hold it there

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.240 
really need a lot to hold it there
but<00:02:57.330> what<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.570> does<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.140> cases<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.040> whole

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
loop on and then of course I'm going to

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.819 
loop on and then of course I'm going to
slide<00:03:39.570> that<00:03:39.810> little<00:03:40.110> loop<00:03:40.290> through<00:03:40.650> and

ears on my briolettes

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.590 
ears on my briolettes
so<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.340> goes<00:03:47.519> round<00:03:47.730> then<00:03:48.150> I'll<00:03:48.269> wrap<00:03:48.570> it

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
so that goes round then I'll wrap it

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.190 
so that goes round then I'll wrap it
round<00:03:48.930> my<00:03:49.890> three-times

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
round my three-times

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.330 
round my three-times
once<00:03:52.200> I've<00:03:52.380> got<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.709> wrapped<00:03:52.860> round<00:03:53.070> three

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
once I've got it wrapped round three

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.840 
once I've got it wrapped round three
times<00:03:54.320> I'll<00:03:55.970> snip<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:58.019> end<00:03:58.200> off<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.769> press<00:03:59.700> it

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
times I'll snip the end off and press it

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.509 
times I'll snip the end off and press it
down<00:04:00.060> with<00:04:00.390> my<00:04:01.230> snipe<00:04:01.590> or<00:04:01.799> chain<00:04:01.829> nose<00:04:02.040> pliers

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
down with my snipe or chain nose pliers

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.420 
down with my snipe or chain nose pliers
so<00:04:03.200> those<00:04:04.200> are<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.410> two<00:04:04.650> links<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.310> were

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
so those are the two links that were

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.819 
so those are the two links that were
using<00:04:05.720> now<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:07.079> know<00:04:07.200> exactly<00:04:07.470> what<00:04:07.709> you're

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
using now you know exactly what you're

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.520 
using now you know exactly what you're
doing<00:04:07.920> now<00:04:08.160> we've<00:04:08.940> made<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.180> others<00:04:09.600> so<00:04:10.320> just

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
doing now we've made the others so just

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.280 
doing now we've made the others so just
keep<00:04:10.829> going<00:04:10.859> until<00:04:11.450> you<00:04:12.450> get<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.109> right

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
keep going until you get to the right

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.340 
keep going until you get to the right
length<00:04:14.060> once<00:04:15.060> you've<00:04:15.390> got<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.049> point

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
length once you've got to the point

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.380 
length once you've got to the point
where<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.459> know<00:04:17.640> you're<00:04:17.820> going<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:17.970> be<00:04:18.090> making

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
where you know you're going to be making

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.469 
where you know you're going to be making
your<00:04:18.510> last<00:04:18.750> loop<00:04:19.019> like<00:04:19.620> this<00:04:20.030> what<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.060> suggest

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
your last loop like this what I suggest

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.940 
your last loop like this what I suggest
you<00:04:21.599> do<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:22.160> start<00:04:23.160> with<00:04:23.340> your<00:04:23.400> piece<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.729> wire

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
you do is start with your piece of wire

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.650 
you do is start with your piece of wire
put<00:04:25.280> your<00:04:25.580> loop<00:04:25.760> through<00:04:26.180> it<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.510> way<00:04:26.600> you

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
put your loop through it the way you

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.790 
put your loop through it the way you
turn<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.140> over<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.800> then<00:04:28.610> attach<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.660> to<00:04:30.230> the

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
turn it over and then attach it to the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.190 
turn it over and then attach it to the
actual<00:04:31.580> fastener<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:32.330> this<00:04:32.540> side<00:04:32.750> of<00:04:32.870> notes<00:04:33.080> of

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
actual fastener so this side of notes of

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.950 
actual fastener so this side of notes of
the<00:04:33.260> t-bar<00:04:33.730> so<00:04:34.730> I've<00:04:34.820> gone<00:04:35.000> through<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.630> tuba

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
the t-bar so I've gone through the tuba

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.220 
the t-bar so I've gone through the tuba
I<00:04:36.200> will<00:04:36.830> wrap<00:04:37.070> around<00:04:37.250> three<00:04:37.580> times<00:04:38.020> cut<00:04:39.020> any

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
I will wrap around three times cut any

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.130 
I will wrap around three times cut any
bits<00:04:39.500> off<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.910> know<00:04:41.060> flatten<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.720> ends<00:04:41.990> down

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
bits off you know flatten the ends down

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.610 
bits off you know flatten the ends down
and<00:04:42.530> then<00:04:43.010> from<00:04:43.280> that<00:04:43.310> point<00:04:43.760> I'll<00:04:43.970> put<00:04:44.240> my

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
and then from that point I'll put my

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.840 
and then from that point I'll put my
little<00:04:45.620> briolette<00:04:45.770> arm<00:04:46.250> because<00:04:46.550> that's<00:04:46.730> the

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
little briolette arm because that's the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.060 
little briolette arm because that's the
realest<00:04:47.180> at<00:04:47.330> that<00:04:47.480> end<00:04:47.780> wrap<00:04:48.470> it<00:04:48.620> round<00:04:48.740> three

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
realest at that end wrap it round three

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.980 
realest at that end wrap it round three
times<00:04:49.100> come<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:49.700> then<00:04:49.940> join<00:04:50.300> in<00:04:50.570> at<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.900> other

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
times come and then join in at the other

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.670 
times come and then join in at the other
side<00:04:51.290> as<00:04:51.500> well<00:04:51.710> so<00:04:53.020> exactly<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.110> same<00:04:54.440> on<00:04:54.590> the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
side as well so exactly the same on the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.100 
side as well so exactly the same on the
other<00:04:54.710> end<00:04:55.360> but<00:04:56.360> I'm<00:04:56.510> going<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.660> join<00:04:56.870> it<00:04:57.020> on

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
other end but I'm going to join it on

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.470 
other end but I'm going to join it on
through<00:04:57.410> one<00:04:57.800> of<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.010> loops<00:04:58.160> on<00:04:58.430> one<00:04:58.880> side<00:04:59.270> of

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
through one of the loops on one side of

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.320 
through one of the loops on one side of
the<00:04:59.600> pink<00:04:59.840> bead<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:00.650> that's<00:05:01.640> your<00:05:01.850> bracelet

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
the pink bead and that's your bracelet

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.740 
the pink bead and that's your bracelet
so<00:05:03.170> even<00:05:03.530> with<00:05:03.650> just<00:05:03.770> two<00:05:04.130> layers<00:05:04.730> it<00:05:05.450> looks

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
so even with just two layers it looks

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.180 
so even with just two layers it looks
very<00:05:05.900> pretty<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:06.410> as<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:06.560> can<00:05:06.680> see<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:07.040> looks

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
very pretty and as you can see it looks

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.220 
very pretty and as you can see it looks
prettier<00:05:07.610> than<00:05:07.730> just<00:05:07.940> one<00:05:08.150> however<00:05:08.900> once<00:05:09.110> we

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
prettier than just one however once we

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.050 
prettier than just one however once we
get<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:09.440> third<00:05:09.650> one<00:05:09.710> it'll<00:05:10.490> be<00:05:10.580> great

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
get the third one it'll be great

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.860 
get the third one it'll be great
