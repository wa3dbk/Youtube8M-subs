brother<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.750> great<00:01:48.930> about<00:01:49.140> duct<00:01:49.409> tape

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
brother now it's great about duct tape

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.920 
brother now it's great about duct tape
is<00:01:49.799> all<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.840> put<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> little

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
is all you have to do is put a little

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.960 
is all you have to do is put a little
snip<00:01:52.290> into<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.180> ripped

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
snip into it and then just ripped

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.750 
snip into it and then just ripped
and<00:01:55.510> I've<00:01:55.630> got<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:56.290> strip<00:01:56.620> so<00:01:57.490> you're<00:01:57.610> going<00:01:57.730> to

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
and I've got to strip so you're going to

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.210 
and I've got to strip so you're going to
take<00:01:57.910> both<00:01:58.480> strips<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.050> put<00:01:59.260> them<00:01:59.380> around<00:01:59.530> the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
take both strips and put them around the

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.030 
take both strips and put them around the
outside<00:02:00.730> edge<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.570> little<00:02:02.410> straps<00:02:02.770> so

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
outside edge of the little straps so

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.390 
outside edge of the little straps so
like<00:02:03.190> so<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.740> just<00:02:05.920> want<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.160> kind<00:02:06.280> of

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
like so and you just want to kind of

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.640 
like so and you just want to kind of
curve<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:06.940> around<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.750> press<00:02:08.350> as<00:02:08.530> you're

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.650 
curve it around and press as you're

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.100 
curve it around and press as you're
going<00:02:08.860> now<00:02:09.430> duct<00:02:09.970> tape<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.240> very<00:02:10.330> flexible<00:02:10.750> so

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
going now duct tape is very flexible so

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.200 
going now duct tape is very flexible so
it<00:02:11.410> does<00:02:11.650> work<00:02:11.680> on<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.040> curve<00:02:12.340> but<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.000> might

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
it does work on a curve but you might

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.790 
it does work on a curve but you might
end<00:02:13.420> up<00:02:13.540> with<00:02:13.720> them<00:02:13.930> as<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.500> can<00:02:14.620> see<00:02:14.740> you

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
end up with them as you can see you

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.500 
end up with them as you can see you
might<00:02:14.950> up<00:02:15.040> end<00:02:15.370> up<00:02:15.490> with<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> couple<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.210> bumps

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
might up end up with a couple of bumps

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.170 
might up end up with a couple of bumps
here<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.720> there<00:02:17.610> just<00:02:18.610> gonna<00:02:18.760> go<00:02:18.910> keep<00:02:19.120> going

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
here and there just gonna go keep going

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.510 
here and there just gonna go keep going
all<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.840> way<00:02:19.870> around<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.260> curve<00:02:20.500> it's<00:02:21.160> okay

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
all the way around the curve it's okay

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.860 
all the way around the curve it's okay
if<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.880> have<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> little<00:02:22.390> bit<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.540> extra

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
if you have a little bit of extra

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.030 
if you have a little bit of extra
sticking<00:02:23.230> out<00:02:23.380> we're<00:02:23.500> going<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.650> get<00:02:23.860> rid<00:02:23.980> of

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
sticking out we're going to get rid of

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.980 
sticking out we're going to get rid of
all<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.520> at<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.850> end<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.600> want<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.870> get

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
all of that at the end you want to get

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.810 
all of that at the end you want to get
as<00:02:26.140> much<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.770> as<00:02:26.920> close<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.490> actual

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
as much of it as close to the actual

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.620 
as much of it as close to the actual
strap<00:02:28.210> as<00:02:28.390> possible<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:31.450> middle

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
strap as possible so that the middle

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.680 
strap as possible so that the middle
section<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.350> just<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.130> right<00:02:33.310> size<00:02:33.550> for<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
section is just the right size for the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.690 
section is just the right size for the
final<00:02:35.080> strap<00:02:35.550> if<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:37.180> have<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.390> particularly

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
final strap if you have a particularly

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.920 
final strap if you have a particularly
strong<00:02:39.700> curve<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.180> your<00:02:40.210> backpack<00:02:40.600> this<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:40.900> a

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
strong curve in your backpack this is a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.880 
strong curve in your backpack this is a
pretty<00:02:41.170> straight<00:02:41.380> line<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.680> yours<00:02:41.830> is

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
pretty straight line that yours is

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.500 
pretty straight line that yours is
particularly<00:02:42.190> strong<00:02:42.520> you<00:02:42.970> can<00:02:43.120> actually<00:02:43.270> do

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
particularly strong you can actually do

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.940 
particularly strong you can actually do
this<00:02:43.630> little<00:02:43.840> trick<00:02:43.990> where<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.170> snip<00:02:44.500> into<00:02:44.830> it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
this little trick where you snip into it

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.980 
this little trick where you snip into it
just<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.280> little<00:02:45.610> bit<00:02:45.760> just<00:02:45.880> like<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.210> and

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
just a little bit just like that and

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.500 
just a little bit just like that and
that<00:02:47.770> makes<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.070> easier<00:02:48.490> to<00:02:48.790> put<00:02:49.180> around<00:02:49.360> the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
that makes it easier to put around the

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.600 
that makes it easier to put around the
curve<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.560> it's<00:02:50.680> kind<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:50.890> up<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.280> can<00:02:51.430> go

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
curve so it's kind of up to you can go

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.010 
curve so it's kind of up to you can go
under<00:02:51.940> curve<00:02:52.240> around<00:02:52.570> or<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:53.260> can<00:02:53.470> trim<00:02:55.020> push

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
under curve around or you can trim push

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.550 
under curve around or you can trim push
push<00:02:56.320> push<00:02:56.350> okay

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.020 

you<00:03:00.130> want<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.310> make<00:03:00.400> sure<00:03:00.430> everything<00:03:00.819> really

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
you want to make sure everything really

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.850 
you want to make sure everything really

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
duct tape that's about the same length

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.000 
duct tape that's about the same length
as<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.569> one<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.840> made<00:03:19.930> seriously<00:03:20.530> and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
as the one that you made seriously and

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.860 
as the one that you made seriously and
let's<00:03:21.880> see<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.269> think<00:03:22.330> that's<00:03:22.630> about<00:03:22.720> right

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
let's see I think that's about right

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.750 
let's see I think that's about right
again<00:03:23.470> don't<00:03:23.680> be<00:03:23.800> afraid<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:24.250> cut<00:03:24.550> a<00:03:24.580> little

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
again don't be afraid to cut a little

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.140 
again don't be afraid to cut a little
bit<00:03:24.880> extra<00:03:25.209> because<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.720> can<00:03:26.470> always<00:03:27.340> trim<00:03:27.970> it

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
bit extra because you can always trim it

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.479 
bit extra because you can always trim it
later<00:03:31.440> all<00:03:32.440> right<00:03:32.500> now<00:03:32.920> as<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.130> guys<00:03:33.280> can<00:03:33.430> see

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
I'm gonna start at the top and I'm gonna

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.350

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
do my best to line it up and I'm just

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.120 
do my best to line it up and I'm just
going<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.540> gently<00:03:40.720> push<00:03:41.080> now<00:03:41.319> again<00:03:41.920> like<00:03:42.040> I

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
going to gently push now again like I

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.830 
going to gently push now again like I
said<00:03:42.340> see<00:03:42.549> how<00:03:42.670> my<00:03:42.760> strap<00:03:43.030> is<00:03:43.150> on<00:03:43.269> on<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.540> curb

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
said see how my strap is on on a curb

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.870 
said see how my strap is on on a curb
I'm<00:03:44.110> gonna<00:03:44.500> have<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.769> carefully<00:03:45.340> go<00:03:45.489> around<00:03:45.730> it

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
I'm gonna have to carefully go around it

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.320 
I'm gonna have to carefully go around it
like<00:03:45.910> this<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:47.769> what's<00:03:48.040> so<00:03:48.220> cool<00:03:48.489> about<00:03:48.760> duct

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
like this and what's so cool about duct

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.289 
like this and what's so cool about duct
tape<00:03:49.569> is<00:03:49.780> even<00:03:50.080> if<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.319> mess<00:03:50.560> up<00:03:50.769> it's<00:03:51.700> okay

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
tape is even if you mess up it's okay

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.970 
tape is even if you mess up it's okay
because<00:03:52.599> it<00:03:52.840> has<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:52.959> pattern<00:03:53.470> on<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.769> at<00:03:53.830> least

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
because it has a pattern on it at least

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.650 
because it has a pattern on it at least
this<00:03:54.099> kind<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.430> duct<00:03:54.549> tape<00:03:54.580> so<00:03:55.330> you<00:03:55.420> can't

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
this kind of duct tape so you can't

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.600 
this kind of duct tape so you can't
really<00:03:55.810> tell<00:03:56.049> too<00:03:56.230> bad<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:56.980> what<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.250> was<00:03:57.400> saying

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
really tell too bad so what I was saying

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.009 
really tell too bad so what I was saying
earlier<00:03:57.730> is<00:03:57.970> when<00:03:58.150> you're<00:03:58.269> on<00:03:58.360> a<00:03:58.420> curb<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:58.930> you

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
earlier is when you're on a curb and you

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.810 
earlier is when you're on a curb and you
really<00:03:59.830> need<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:02.340> turn<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.579> you're<00:04:03.700> not

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
really need to turn and you're not

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.979 
really need to turn and you're not
having<00:04:04.090> an<00:04:04.180> easy<00:04:04.299> time<00:04:04.420> like<00:04:04.660> right<00:04:04.780> now<00:04:04.870> I'm

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
having an easy time like right now I'm

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.479 
having an easy time like right now I'm
having<00:04:05.140> a<00:04:05.260> bit<00:04:05.380> of<00:04:05.410> a<00:04:05.500> problem<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.280> what<00:04:06.400> I'm

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
having a bit of a problem so what I'm

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.130 
having a bit of a problem so what I'm
doing<00:04:06.519> is<00:04:07.000> I'm<00:04:07.150> going<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.299> cut<00:04:07.540> into<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.930> just<00:04:08.079> a

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
doing is I'm going to cut into it just a

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.569 
doing is I'm going to cut into it just a
little<00:04:08.260> bit<00:04:08.410> here<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:08.769> there<00:04:08.829> you<00:04:09.250> can't<00:04:09.459> even

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
little bit here and there you can't even

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:10.500 
little bit here and there you can't even
really<00:04:09.700> see<00:04:09.820> where<00:04:10.000> I'm<00:04:10.090> cutting<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.450> I'm

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
really see where I'm cutting and I'm

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.660 
really see where I'm cutting and I'm
just<00:04:10.600> snipping<00:04:10.989> in<00:04:11.109> about<00:04:11.320> half<00:04:12.010> an<00:04:12.160> inch<00:04:12.280> and

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
just snipping in about half an inch and

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.550 
just snipping in about half an inch and
that<00:04:13.660> little<00:04:13.870> bit<00:04:13.989> of<00:04:14.079> snip<00:04:14.350> will<00:04:15.010> allow<00:04:15.220> me<00:04:15.430> to

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
that little bit of snip will allow me to

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.779 
that little bit of snip will allow me to
overlap<00:04:17.880> easily<00:04:19.019> okay<00:04:20.100> now<00:04:21.100> as<00:04:21.190> you<00:04:21.310> can<00:04:21.400> see<00:04:21.459> I

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
overlap easily okay now as you can see I

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.909 
overlap easily okay now as you can see I
have<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.330> bit<00:04:22.870> of<00:04:22.900> no<00:04:23.440> what<00:04:23.590> do<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.710> guys<00:04:23.860> call

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
have a bit of no what do you guys call

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.650 
have a bit of no what do you guys call
this<00:04:24.370> thing<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.669> don't<00:04:24.850> even<00:04:24.910> know<00:04:25.150> what<00:04:25.539> this

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
this thing I don't even know what this

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.120 
this thing I don't even know what this
thing<00:04:25.720> is<00:04:25.960> just<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.410> length<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.860> strap

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
thing is just the length of the strap

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.770 
thing is just the length of the strap
and<00:04:27.310> it's<00:04:27.400> kind<00:04:27.610> of<00:04:27.669> in<00:04:27.789> my<00:04:27.820> way<00:04:28.060> now<00:04:28.510> if<00:04:28.630> you

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
and it's kind of in my way now if you

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.270 
and it's kind of in my way now if you
want<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.080> can<00:04:29.200> go<00:04:29.320> on<00:04:29.440> top<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.889> but<00:04:30.039> I<00:04:30.070> feel

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
want you can go on top of it but I feel

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.529 
want you can go on top of it but I feel
like<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.550> would<00:04:30.639> render<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:30.970> useless<00:04:31.000> so

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
like that would render it useless so

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.270 
like that would render it useless so
instead<00:04:31.900> we're<00:04:32.590> just<00:04:32.770> gonna<00:04:32.889> cut<00:04:33.190> around<00:04:33.789> it

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
instead we're just gonna cut around it

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.760 
instead we're just gonna cut around it
boom<00:04:36.870> if<00:04:37.870> you'd<00:04:38.110> like<00:04:38.289> you<00:04:38.470> can<00:04:38.560> use<00:04:38.620> an

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
boom if you'd like you can use an

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.200 
boom if you'd like you can use an
opposite<00:04:39.280> color<00:04:39.400> duct<00:04:39.699> tape<00:04:39.880> on<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.180> inside

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
opposite color duct tape on the inside

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.480 
opposite color duct tape on the inside
like<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:41.199> put<00:04:41.380> it<00:04:41.500> here<00:04:41.740> but<00:04:42.100> I<00:04:42.160> actually

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
like to put it here but I actually

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.100 
like to put it here but I actually
preferred<00:04:43.090> if<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.449> leave<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.750> inside

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
preferred if you leave the inside

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.080 
preferred if you leave the inside
without<00:04:44.680> any<00:04:44.979> duct<00:04:45.190> tape<00:04:45.250> on<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.610> because<00:04:45.880> a

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
without any duct tape on it because a

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.330 
without any duct tape on it because a
lot<00:04:46.300> of<00:04:46.479> backpacks<00:04:46.900> have<00:04:47.169> traction<00:04:47.889> on<00:04:48.190> them

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
lot of backpacks have traction on them

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.620 
lot of backpacks have traction on them
so<00:04:48.490> that<00:04:48.610> they<00:04:48.669> stay<00:04:48.850> on<00:04:48.880> your<00:04:49.060> kids<00:04:49.240> shoulders

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
so that they stay on your kids shoulders

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.180 
so that they stay on your kids shoulders
and<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:50.199> way<00:04:50.350> without<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.710> duct<00:04:50.860> tape<00:04:51.039> it'll

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
and this way without the duct tape it'll

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.310
