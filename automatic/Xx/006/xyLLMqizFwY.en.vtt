our<00:00:50.400> ez<00:00:50.610> fuel<00:00:50.970> system<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.480> new<00:00:51.630> for<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.900> year

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
our ez fuel system is new for this year

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.860 
our ez fuel system is new for this year
it's<00:00:52.800> very<00:00:52.920> simple<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:53.940> very<00:00:54.000> basic<00:00:54.690> it's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
it's very simple it's very basic it's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.110 
it's very simple it's very basic it's
very<00:00:55.050> easy<00:00:55.380> to<00:00:55.590> use<00:00:55.830> it<00:00:56.340> does<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.880> what<00:00:57.000> it

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
very easy to use it does just what it

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.900 
very easy to use it does just what it
says<00:00:57.330> ez<00:00:57.720> fuel<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:59.130> particular<00:00:59.700> system

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
says ez fuel in this particular system

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.730 
says ez fuel in this particular system
the<00:01:00.090> spark<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.660> controlled<00:01:01.080> just<00:01:01.380> as<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.620> was

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
the spark is controlled just as it was

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.230 
the spark is controlled just as it was
with<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.950> carburetor<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.610> there's<00:01:02.790> a<00:01:02.880> level<00:01:03.090> of

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.240 
with a carburetor so there's a level of

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.270 
with a carburetor so there's a level of
simplicity<00:01:03.450> added<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.440> that's<00:01:04.980> one

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
simplicity added to that that's one

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.860 
simplicity added to that that's one
thing<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.700> does<00:01:05.850> not<00:01:06.060> get<00:01:06.300> disturbed<00:01:06.630> or
