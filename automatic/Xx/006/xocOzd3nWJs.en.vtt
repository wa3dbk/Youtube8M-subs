00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 adeshina outside and welcome 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.000
 for another part of the tutorial you 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.780
 yes today it's about how to get one 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.610
 automatic monster trap in ticket he 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.330
 presented develops and suffering course 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.490
 as always 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.150
 and yes you see I have here 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.029
 monster turned up loud criticism kripo 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.350
 and so they stand around and I'll do it 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.090
 briefly show how it all works 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.670
 Here you can see the whole technology already 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.309
 It looks complicated 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.690
 but not necessarily see 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.239
 you already from the monster here 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.840
 nice that keeps on coming so much 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.140
 be short 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.010
 s1 easiest located underneath 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.989
 a kind of born in ground like you 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.930
 see or not what points is 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.949
 so it should look here spawn monster 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.730
 and here are such conveyor belt in there 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.289
 because it everyone should know the fans 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.760
 transport items or pugs and 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.859
 you can see there are already spinning 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.719
 spinners hang because it's a burglar 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.280
 of course, there are two more 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.100
 then they will also spin 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.100
 by transporting the guests things as 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.530
 pug if there is just transported yes 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.000
 all this goes through here I have it 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.560
 not everything is darkened here 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.650
 thus this transition go through the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.390
 then and then come out of here so 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.960
 Here you can see you are back there 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.780
 the streets 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.310
 fischer there the commission through here 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.790
 you can see it just in kryta come and 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.640
 a skeleton and then just fall here 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.500
 exactly what happens here they are 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.979
 Everyone should come here too 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.540
 already the motto children know then 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.100
 the following happens i will 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.210
 show my coach when I put it in here 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.770
 perg witherspoon 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.259
 I should still leave the tutorial 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.790
 know who will be here is 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.130
 killed exactly 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.840
 cds have been killed here come the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.549
 items get out these drops then you are 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.450
 really nothing dropped of course if 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.119
 you are lucky here 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.399
 although in the country had a or b 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.719
 exactly 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.100
 and that would not only be that, but 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.590
 like here also from the tutorial 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.020
 they probably knew that too 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.599
 morrison's place of presence is something like that 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.129
 as the experience points this popel 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.410
 this experience scope always the manual 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.170
 you can use human beings 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.480
 andel's in liquid that's just that 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.340
 you do not lose this initial and 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.490
 there is just this car for it 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.430
 that you should know 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.200
 Car removal simply means there you can 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.650
 do it here I can do it here 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.400
 short show between sword so times 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.350
 we can do that here too at level 30 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.140
 jousting eisenstadt pure 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.720
 now he is beginning to be enchanted 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.060
 Here we see this if it is up 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.030
 here below we need to see the status 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.190
 if it is at the top then it is exactly 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.420
 finished a little bit down now 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.550
 because it is fast, of course 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.350
 faster when it is low Lell 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.190
 Here we see the crucial village 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.890
 level 17 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.050
 yes and there we have two cool things 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.250
 got out sheep are still beckys 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.220
 Emails here, too, always fall 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.080
 nice if you always killed 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.080
 and they also funny bats 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.920
 otherwise that's almost it 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.510
 Here are the items Rhine should come 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.800
 who actually know how that is 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.330
 Wired here is actually 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.500
 relatively clear, I already have one here 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.920
 done cheep 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.870
 they should not be out of it 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.340
 the tips tutorials are all so 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.860
 nicely set that the old ones all 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.790
 the direction will be headed there 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.790
 the law 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.230
 just like everyone here is in the right direction 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.439
 directed here they are directed to it 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.810
 Here are a few gold prices back there 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.480
 These rash ones and as a stonemason 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.189
 that will be all in this box here 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.730
 I have a bit of power 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.870
 now here as a high voltage dollar race 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.970
 I do not need so much electricity 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.599
 made yourself so you but like 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.030
 really if you believe me a medium 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.849
 voltage should be enough for a 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.690
 legally solar energy that should 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.950
 so exactly the enchanted fit also electricity 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.730
 I connected again with the 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.820
 Strom and down here are golden goal 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.459
 waterproof pipes should the here 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.680
 you also know that should be relative 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.210
 be clear i can get here right now 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.100
 not moving properly that even worked 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.639
 not yes and people just now 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.010
 in here 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.610
 just this liquid this mob is 1 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.120
 and one last tip last 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.210
 if you have one somewhere 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.110
 then have pug power in your world 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.510
 Please use it around there 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.120
 let monster save so build then 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.910
 this thing around the pug power around here 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.479
 that's what very good ie if you 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.820
 here is here an obscure in it 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.770
 from the board of pug from also again 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.210
 pug and that is much faster 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.550
 and hedgehog seemonster fall is a lot 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.020
 more efficient yes otherwise if one 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.900
 You also want to have some of that size around us 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.370
 You want to store a lot of praise 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.199
 yes, by the way, a logistics system 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.350
 then there is no problem 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.930
 but this box should know and here 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.720
 if you are a big camp anyway 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.130
 Volt from websense you can easily 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:22.260
 Tanks take tanks here and now 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.729
 Just connect so yes and then 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.010
 it will also be directed to the tank rhine 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.199
 So that's not a problem 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.050
 So if it means everything so I want 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.669
 Here are just a few creepers pon 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.370
 then markus show you that too in 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.060
 can initiate tanks 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.199
 so now everything will be nicely killed 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.330
 Morrison's coming soon, I can 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.710
 again pope bonn 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.510
 so and now you should see exactly here 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.400
 here it flows already clean in the tank 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.860
 Of course you can do that again 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.210
 use to enchanted the car here too 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.740
 So either take one here 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:58.120
 restaurant engine and with a with 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.710
 a restoration and a waterproof 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.900
 waterproof pipe were you can either 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.270
 rausholen pull out here because the stuff 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.590
 or I even believe that one is the author 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.720
 in switch next to can place 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.539
 that should work too yes me 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.740
 I would say I hope so I have it 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.620
 understandably explained but is you 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.169
 this time quite simple topic I hope 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.870
 could somehow help you something and yes 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.760
 So I do not know how that is 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.500
 makes sense to enchant but really 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.300
 I really like it a lot 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.139
 I do not know, I have that too 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.180
 do not let it run 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.639
 It was maybe five minutes and 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.120
 then really really so much war 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.979
 crass yes I just want to say that think 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.210
 I watched and wrote me 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.880
 bitter again in the comments what 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.479
 I next time as a bitch tutorial 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.039
 to do 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.150
 otherwise I would say is to for 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.930
 look and see you then 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.930
 next time again typical
