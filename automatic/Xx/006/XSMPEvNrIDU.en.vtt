oh this is Bryan Goodman racing today
we're<00:00:02.340> talking<00:00:02.700> about<00:00:03.000> headers<00:00:03.810> in

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
we're talking about headers in

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.630 
we're talking about headers in
particular<00:00:04.620> street<00:00:05.130> headers<00:00:05.400> with

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
particular street headers with

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.570 
particular street headers with
converters<00:00:06.150> for<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.569> Mazda<00:00:06.960> mx-5<00:00:07.460> 2006<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580

2013<00:00:09.120> first<00:00:10.050> let's<00:00:10.410> take<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.590> brief<00:00:10.830> look<00:00:10.860> at

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
2013 first let's take a brief look at

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.470 
2013 first let's take a brief look at
this<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.420> stock<00:00:12.809> header<00:00:13.230> and

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
this this is the stock header and

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.880 
this this is the stock header and
normally<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.570> don't<00:00:15.719> get<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.929> see<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
normally you don't get to see the the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.410 
normally you don't get to see the the
details<00:00:17.310> because<00:00:17.760> they're<00:00:17.880> all<00:00:18.000> covered<00:00:18.359> with

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
details because they're all covered with

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.300 
details because they're all covered with
heat<00:00:18.779> shielding<00:00:19.170> well<00:00:19.710> once<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.010> take<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
heat shielding well once you take the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.400 
heat shielding well once you take the
close-up<00:00:20.880> look<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.900> stock<00:00:22.109> header

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
close-up look at the stock header

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.410 
close-up look at the stock header
particularly<00:00:23.100> where<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.880> primaries<00:00:24.390> that

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
particularly where the primaries that

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.439 
particularly where the primaries that
are<00:00:24.630> too<00:00:24.779> short<00:00:24.810> get<00:00:25.800> pinched<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.430> half<00:00:27.029> as

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
are too short get pinched in half as

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.410 
are too short get pinched in half as
they<00:00:28.109> go<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.160> collector<00:00:29.609> hole<00:00:30.240> this

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
they go in to the collector hole this

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.450 
they go in to the collector hole this
closer<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> cameras<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:31.439> see<00:00:31.769> where

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
closer to the cameras we can see where

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.620 
closer to the cameras we can see where
the<00:00:32.579> primaries<00:00:33.059> are<00:00:33.180> going<00:00:33.390> into<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the primaries are going into the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.209 
the primaries are going into the
collective<00:00:33.930> there<00:00:34.079> they're<00:00:34.770> essentially

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
collective there they're essentially

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.160 
collective there they're essentially
pinched<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.610> half<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.450> then<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.050> get

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
pinched in half and then when you get

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.080 
pinched in half and then when you get
down<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.500> next<00:00:37.710> section<00:00:38.090> they're

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
down to the next section they're

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.760 
down to the next section they're
restricted<00:00:39.600> even<00:00:39.750> more<00:00:40.110> before<00:00:40.469> they<00:00:40.559> go<00:00:40.680> into

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
restricted even more before they go into

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.860 
restricted even more before they go into
the<00:00:40.890> converter<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:42.360> don't<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.660> look<00:00:42.750> at

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
the converter you don't have to look at

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.959 
the converter you don't have to look at
this<00:00:42.989> long<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.320> realize<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:44.489> could<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> lot

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
this long you realize you could do a lot

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.270 
this long you realize you could do a lot
better<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> flow<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:46.140> lot<00:00:46.469> better<00:00:46.739> for

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
better on the flow a lot better for

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.479 
better on the flow a lot better for
torque<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.000> horsepower<00:00:48.379> by<00:00:49.379> doing<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.039> better

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
torque and horsepower by doing a better

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.459 
torque and horsepower by doing a better
design<00:00:51.739> that<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.370> how<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.469> this

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
design that is how we get to this this

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.220 
design that is how we get to this this
is<00:00:55.649> our<00:00:55.829> Roadster<00:00:56.340> sport<00:00:56.640> street<00:00:57.449> header<00:00:57.660> it's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
is our Roadster sport street header it's

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.500 
is our Roadster sport street header it's
one<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.440> our<00:00:58.559> bestsellers<00:00:58.859> here<00:00:59.420> and<00:01:00.420> you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
one of our bestsellers here and you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.420 
one of our bestsellers here and you
notice<00:01:00.780> first<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.320> our<00:01:01.469> primaries<00:01:02.070> are

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
notice first that our primaries are

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.789 
notice first that our primaries are
about<00:01:02.609> four<00:01:02.940> times<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.570> long<00:01:03.780> as<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.589> stock

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
about four times as long as the stock

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.800 
about four times as long as the stock
header<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.489> fact<00:01:05.729> I'll<00:01:05.880> notice<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.420> twist

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
header in fact I'll notice that we twist

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.899 
header in fact I'll notice that we twist
them<00:01:07.049> around<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.500> center<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.729> in

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
them around the center here so that in

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.179 
them around the center here so that in
the<00:01:09.060> distance<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.780> are<00:01:09.960> covering<00:01:10.409> we

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the distance that we are covering we

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.130 
the distance that we are covering we
want<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.580> them<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.820> long<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.720> we

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
want to get them as long as we can we

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.590 
want to get them as long as we can we
maximize<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.070> distance<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.700> maximize<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
maximize the distance we maximize the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480 
maximize the distance we maximize the
torque<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.409> making<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.920> yet<00:01:17.310> we're

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
torque that we are making and yet we're

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.070 
torque that we are making and yet we're
doing<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.090> design<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.630> fits<00:01:18.900> within
