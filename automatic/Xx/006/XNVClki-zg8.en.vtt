three-two-one

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.240 

well<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.689> brakes<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.140> certainly<00:02:29.620> balanced

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
well the brakes is certainly balanced

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.750 
well the brakes is certainly balanced
and<00:02:30.670> they<00:02:30.879> are<00:02:31.030> synchronized<00:02:32.189> but<00:02:33.189> I<00:02:33.250> didn't

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
and they are synchronized but I didn't

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.910 
and they are synchronized but I didn't
really<00:02:34.060> feel<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.930> had<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.379> ability<00:02:35.890> to

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
really feel that I had the ability to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.099 
really feel that I had the ability to
apply<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.459> gradual<00:02:36.969> pressure<00:02:37.329> and<00:02:37.659> the<00:02:37.719> cars<00:02:37.989> I

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
apply a gradual pressure and the cars I

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.130 
apply a gradual pressure and the cars I
need<00:02:38.349> have<00:02:38.469> 40,000<00:02:39.310> miles<00:02:39.519> so<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.689> cornering

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
need have 40,000 miles so the cornering

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.099 
need have 40,000 miles so the cornering
is<00:02:41.200> not<00:02:41.439> superb<00:02:42.219> and<00:02:42.879> the<00:02:43.389> braking<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:43.930> not

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
is not superb and the braking is not

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.220 
is not superb and the braking is not
great<00:02:44.590> but<00:02:45.250> all<00:02:45.489> in<00:02:45.670> all<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:46.689> is<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> very

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
great but all in all this is a very

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.589 
great but all in all this is a very
impressive<00:02:47.469> car<00:02:47.980> it's<00:02:48.760> very<00:02:49.060> nicely<00:02:49.299> put

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
impressive car it's very nicely put

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.809 
impressive car it's very nicely put
together<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.379> in<00:02:50.799> its<00:02:50.980> class<00:02:51.280> there's<00:02:51.639> not<00:02:51.790> a

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
together and in its class there's not a

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.309 
together and in its class there's not a
lot<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.060> cars<00:02:52.389> that<00:02:52.659> could<00:02:52.810> complete<00:02:53.139> with

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
lot of cars that could complete with

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.039 
lot of cars that could complete with
this<00:02:53.439> at<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.650> moment<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.700> Audi<00:02:54.849> a3<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.840> is

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
this at the moment the Audi a3 it is

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.069 
this at the moment the Audi a3 it is
certainly<00:02:56.379> worth<00:02:56.560> looking<00:02:56.950> at
