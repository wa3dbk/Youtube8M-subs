like this and make it these edges right
here<00:00:27.930> oh<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.550> will<00:00:29.670> make<00:00:30.240> these<00:00:30.480> edges

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
here oh that will make these edges

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.680 
here oh that will make these edges
which<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.859> up<00:00:33.829> sharp<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:36.390> they're<00:00:36.540> not

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
which is up sharp so if they're not

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.950 
which is up sharp so if they're not
sharp<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.440> can't<00:00:37.710> really

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.130 

okay<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:49.090> you<00:00:49.180> see<00:00:49.300> how<00:00:49.390> it's<00:00:49.570> like<00:00:49.720> that<00:00:49.930> and

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
okay so you see how it's like that and

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.049 
okay so you see how it's like that and
then<00:00:50.230> it<00:00:50.320> has<00:00:50.470> the<00:00:50.770> throat<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.280> sharp<00:00:51.790> edges

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
then it has the throat the sharp edges

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.530 
then it has the throat the sharp edges
on<00:00:52.390> both<00:00:52.420> sides<00:00:53.129> okay<00:00:54.129> so<00:00:55.120> once<00:00:55.270> you<00:00:55.360> do<00:00:55.510> that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
on both sides okay so once you do that

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:07.320 
on both sides okay so once you do that
then<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.640> take<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.920> fold<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:06.330> then

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
then you take this and fold it and then

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.040 
then you take this and fold it and then
you<00:01:07.479> fold<00:01:07.690> it<00:01:07.840> again<00:01:09.570> they're<00:01:10.570> going<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:10.869> fold

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
you fold it again they're going to fold

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.670 
you fold it again they're going to fold
it<00:01:11.140> again<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:13.240> then<00:01:13.840> you're<00:01:13.990> basically<00:01:14.080> going

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
it again and then you're basically going

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:23.150 
it again and then you're basically going
to<00:01:16.800> put<00:01:17.800> it<00:01:17.920> together<00:01:20.550> you<00:01:21.550> want<00:01:21.820> you<00:01:21.970> could

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
to put it together you want you could

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.270 
to put it together you want you could
just<00:01:24.160> kind<00:01:24.430> of<00:01:24.550> be<00:01:24.670> careful<00:01:24.910> when<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.539> do<00:01:25.690> this

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
just kind of be careful when you do this

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.790 
just kind of be careful when you do this
because<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:27.490> don't<00:01:27.610> want<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.850> really<00:01:28.530> mess<00:01:29.530> up

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
because you don't want to really mess up

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.410 
because you don't want to really mess up
your<00:01:30.690> plane<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:33.000> we're<00:01:34.000> going<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.149> put<00:01:34.240> it

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
your plane and we're going to put it

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:45.690 
your plane and we're going to put it
together

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:02:23.710 

just

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.410 

okay<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.890> once<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.459> then<00:02:27.269> you're

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
okay and once you have that then you're

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.559 
okay and once you have that then you're
basically<00:02:27.510> done<00:02:28.019> with<00:02:28.349> your<00:02:28.980> paper<00:02:29.099> UFO<00:02:29.670> now

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
basically done with your paper UFO now

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.170 
basically done with your paper UFO now
some<00:02:30.870> people<00:02:31.050> cut<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.950> don't<00:02:32.790> know<00:02:32.970> why<00:02:33.150> I

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
some people cut it I don't know why I

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.910 
some people cut it I don't know why I
think<00:02:33.690> it's<00:02:33.810> easier<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:35.670> when<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:36.000> fly<00:02:36.330> it

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
think it's easier but when you fly it

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.440 
think it's easier but when you fly it
this<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.040> basically<00:02:38.459> what<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.790> do<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:40.830> take

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
this is basically what you do you take

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.080 
this is basically what you do you take
it<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:44.030> let<00:02:45.030> me<00:02:45.060> put<00:02:45.569> this<00:02:45.690> down<00:02:45.750> again<00:02:47.090> okay

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
it and let me put this down again okay

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.910 
it and let me put this down again okay
and<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:48.599> put<00:02:48.780> your<00:02:48.840> two<00:02:48.959> fingers<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.769> here

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
like that so that they fit right in

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.449 
like that so that they fit right in
there<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.569> basically<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.340> you
