00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
and I don't know it would take a little
while<00:01:11.700> explain<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.170> didn't<00:01:13.320> make<00:01:13.409> this

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
while explain it and I didn't make this

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.929 
while explain it and I didn't make this
a<00:01:13.530> long<00:01:13.740> time<00:01:13.920> ago<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.220> I'm<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.640> even<00:01:14.790> sure<00:01:14.820> if

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
a long time ago so I'm not even sure if

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.060 
a long time ago so I'm not even sure if
I<00:01:15.030> could<00:01:15.090> kick<00:01:15.420> explain<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.320> most<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.979> his

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
I could kick explain to most of his

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.880 
I could kick explain to most of his
potential<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.970> let's<00:01:18.270> go<00:01:18.390> over<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:18.890> cool

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
potential so let's go over here cool

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.380 
potential so let's go over here cool
little<00:01:20.040> door<00:01:20.490> device<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.970> might<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.299> even

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
little door device you might not even

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.820 
little door device you might not even
think<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.409> get<00:01:22.500> through<00:01:22.680> this

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
think like you can get through this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.340 
think like you can get through this
without<00:01:23.490> breaking<00:01:24.060> anything<00:01:24.240> we're<00:01:25.200> gonna

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
without breaking anything we're gonna

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.100 
simple but it would say so myself I'm
not<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.119> sure<00:01:42.210> why<00:01:42.600> you'd<00:01:42.780> want<00:01:42.810> this

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
not really sure why you'd want this

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.539 
not really sure why you'd want this
other<00:01:43.290> than<00:01:43.470> having<00:01:43.590> an<00:01:43.799> alternative<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.490> a

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
other than having an alternative to a

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.550 
other than having an alternative to a
door<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> want<00:01:45.299> your<00:01:45.479> house<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:45.990> stand<00:01:46.409> out

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
door if you want your house to stand out

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.600 
door if you want your house to stand out
in<00:01:46.649> your<00:01:46.680> server<00:01:47.070> something<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.430> that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
in your server something like that

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.010 
in your server something like that
massive<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.420> think<00:01:48.689> there's<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
massive like I think there's like a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.230 
massive like I think there's like a
sheep<00:01:49.229> attack<00:01:49.530> outside<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:50.040> something<00:01:50.369> but

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
sheep attack outside of something but

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.090 
sheep attack outside of something but
yep<00:01:51.479> that's<00:01:52.079> basically<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:52.649> there<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.979> this

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
yep that's basically all there is this

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.859 
yep that's basically all there is this
episode<00:01:53.490> I'll<00:01:54.360> go<00:01:54.540> ahead<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.750> walk<00:01:54.810> through

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
episode I'll go ahead and walk through

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.800 
episode I'll go ahead and walk through
some<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.439> circuitry<00:01:56.270> just<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.630> guys

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
some of the circuitry just so you guys

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.120 
some of the circuitry just so you guys
gonna<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.200> another<00:01:58.350> idea<00:01:58.560> what's<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:58.979> on

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
gonna have another idea what's going on

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.600 
gonna have another idea what's going on
that's<00:01:59.640> real<00:02:00.000> lava<00:02:00.180> don't<00:02:00.719> worry<00:02:00.840> about<00:02:00.899> that

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
that's real lava don't worry about that

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.590 
that's real lava don't worry about that
as<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.790> see<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.030> have<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> lot<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.390> stuff

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
as you see I do have a lot of stuff

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.630 
as you see I do have a lot of stuff
labeled<00:02:04.020> over<00:02:04.229> here<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.250> see<00:02:05.520> what's

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
labeled over here so I can see what's

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.830 
labeled over here so I can see what's
going<00:02:05.700> on<00:02:06.469> also<00:02:07.469> another<00:02:07.560> door<00:02:07.799> circuitry<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
going on also another door circuitry and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.420 
going on also another door circuitry and
another<00:02:09.840> door<00:02:10.349> device<00:02:10.649> which<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.160> thing

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
another door device which is that thing

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.140 
another door device which is that thing
we<00:02:11.550> saw<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.879> there

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
we saw it on there

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.390 
we saw it on there
nope<00:02:14.150> yup<00:02:14.450> just<00:02:14.690> go<00:02:14.990> big<00:02:15.380> do<00:02:15.620> on<00:02:15.770> here<00:02:15.980> by<00:02:16.250> the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
nope yup just go big do on here by the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.730 
nope yup just go big do on here by the
Pistons<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.720> basically<00:02:18.020> have<00:02:18.380> repeaters

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
Pistons and I basically have repeaters

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.310 
Pistons and I basically have repeaters
this<00:02:19.370> time<00:02:19.850> differently<00:02:20.390> than<00:02:20.900> all<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.170> other

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
this time differently than all the other

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.430 
this time differently than all the other
repeaters<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.810> that's<00:02:23.810> basically<00:02:23.990> I<00:02:24.200> do<00:02:24.290> it

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
repeaters and that's basically I do it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.230 
repeaters and that's basically I do it
is<00:02:24.560> stagger<00:02:24.890> out<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.280> repeaters<00:02:25.700> different

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
is stagger out the repeaters different

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.390 
is stagger out the repeaters different
delays<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.200> that's<00:02:27.440> really<00:02:27.800> all<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.100> need<00:02:28.310> to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
delays and that's really all you need to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.940 
delays and that's really all you need to
do<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:29.330> just<00:02:29.870> combine<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.410> knowledge<00:02:30.470> the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
do and just combine that knowledge the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.920 
do and just combine that knowledge the
knowledge<00:02:30.980> making<00:02:31.610> piston<00:02:32.150> doors<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.720> you

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
knowledge making piston doors and you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
knowledge making piston doors and you
should<00:02:33.140> be<00:02:33.170> good<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.530> go<00:02:33.620> now<00:02:35.170> make<00:02:36.170> sure<00:02:36.200> you

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
should be good to go now make sure you

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.900 
should be good to go now make sure you
like<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.550> video<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:39.310> favorites<00:02:40.310> hopefully

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910

paintball stuff in my channel and yep
that's<00:03:03.860> basically<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.300> watch<00:03:05.300> our<00:03:05.510> next

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
that's basically it watch our next

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.380 
that's basically it watch our next
episode<00:03:05.930> I'll<00:03:06.440> be<00:03:06.650> making<00:03:06.860> an<00:03:07.160> alarm<00:03:07.580> clock<00:03:07.820> or

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
episode I'll be making an alarm clock or

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.000 
episode I'll be making an alarm clock or
not<00:03:08.720> making<00:03:09.050> one<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.230> was<00:03:09.500> showing<00:03:09.770> off<00:03:09.860> this

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
not making one I was showing off this

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.250 
not making one I was showing off this
alarm<00:03:10.340> clock<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.820> actually<00:03:11.180> works<00:03:11.420> up<00:03:12.200> to

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
alarm clock that actually works up to

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.530 
alarm clock that actually works up to
the<00:03:12.770> three<00:03:13.280> minutes<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:13.790> 30<00:03:14.030> seconds<00:03:14.330> mark

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
the three minutes and 30 seconds mark

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.910 
the three minutes and 30 seconds mark
and<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:15.080> gives<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.320> little<00:03:15.470> jingle<00:03:15.710> when

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
and it gives you a little jingle when

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.950
