00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
demonstrator so you can see I have just

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.630 
demonstrator so you can see I have just
random<00:00:46.050> send<00:00:46.289> intense<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.250> some<00:00:47.399> round

number<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.179> could<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> demonstration

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
number one so I could do a demonstration

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.430 
number one so I could do a demonstration
and<00:00:49.699> if<00:00:50.699> the<00:00:51.210> best<00:00:51.420> thing<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.899> about<00:00:51.929> it<00:00:52.199> is

selected everything if I wanted to cut
it<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.110> could<00:01:13.680> go<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.190> space<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.790> then<00:01:15.000> X

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
it I could go do the space and then X

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.870 
it I could go do the space and then X
which<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.230> controlled<00:01:16.950> X<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:17.640> keyboard

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
which is controlled X on your keyboard

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.480 
which is controlled X on your keyboard

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
and I cut it if I wanted to paste it i

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.240 
and I cut it if I wanted to paste it i
would<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.760> space<00:01:21.090> V<00:01:21.480> which<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.200> control<00:01:22.800> V<00:01:23.040> on

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
would do space V which is control V on

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.860 
would do space V which is control V on
your<00:01:23.430> keyboard<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.360> where<00:01:24.540> I'm<00:01:24.600> going

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
your keyboard you see where I'm going

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.960 
your keyboard you see where I'm going
with<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.440> it<00:01:26.250> will<00:01:26.280> paste<00:01:26.730> everything

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
with this and it will paste everything

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.390 
with this and it will paste everything
so<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.840> basically<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.680> allows<00:01:28.980> you<00:01:29.220> do

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
so that's basically what allows you do

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.430 
so that's basically what allows you do
now<00:01:29.640> there's<00:01:29.940> tons<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.600> different<00:01:30.810> things<00:01:31.290> if

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
now there's tons of different things if

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.970 
now there's tons of different things if
I<00:01:31.860> wonder<00:01:32.160> if<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.490> don't<00:01:32.760> know<00:01:32.940> spanish<00:01:33.510> and<00:01:34.440> and

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
I wonder if I don't know spanish and and

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.700 
I wonder if I don't know spanish and and
I<00:01:35.100> say<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.460> see<00:01:36.000> i<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.150> c<00:01:36.660> which<00:01:37.050> is<00:01:37.080> yes<00:01:37.500> in

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
I say you see i have c which is yes in

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.830 
I say you see i have c which is yes in
Spanish<00:01:38.160> I'll<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.090> select<00:01:39.300> that<00:01:39.660> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
Spanish I'll just go and select that and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840 
Spanish I'll just go and select that and
then<00:01:40.170> I'll<00:01:40.320> lose<00:01:40.440> face<00:01:40.740> t<00:01:41.130> which<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.520> for

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
then I'll lose face t which is for

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.570 
then I'll lose face t which is for
translate<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.290> see<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.590> says<00:01:43.920> yes

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
translate and as you can see it says yes

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.670 
translate and as you can see it says yes
so<00:01:45.000> if<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.180> want<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.510> copy<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.960> translation<00:01:46.560> i

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
so if I want to copy the translation i

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.520 
so if I want to copy the translation i
could<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.190> so<00:01:47.400> it<00:01:47.490> has<00:01:47.990> translation<00:01:48.990> also

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
could do that so it has translation also

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.190 
could do that so it has translation also
thats<00:01:50.040> ten<00:01:50.310> state<00:01:50.550> is<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.880> super<00:01:51.510> awesome<00:01:52.020> at

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
thats ten state is like super awesome at

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.110 
thats ten state is like super awesome at

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
first when I saw it I thought it would
