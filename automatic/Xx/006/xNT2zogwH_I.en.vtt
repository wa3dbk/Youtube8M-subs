00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
three different styles so say if one

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.550 
three different styles so say if one
spell<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.759> weaker<00:01:39.090> against<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:40.170> know<00:01:40.290> say<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
spell is weaker against you know say a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.620

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
zone or someone's weaker up front or you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.789 
zone or someone's weaker up front or you
want<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.899> fast<00:01:43.200> or<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.500> want<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> be

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
want to be fast or you want to be

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.139 
want to be fast or you want to be
powerful<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.399> whatever<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> case<00:01:44.820> may<00:01:45.119> be

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
powerful or whatever the case may be

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.700 
powerful or whatever the case may be
they<00:01:45.360> all<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.720> three<00:01:46.020> different<00:01:46.200> things<00:01:46.500> so

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
they all have three different things so

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.980 
they all have three different things so
it<00:01:47.340> allows<00:01:47.520> your<00:01:47.700> mind<00:01:47.909> more<00:01:48.180> creativity<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it allows your mind more creativity and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.389 
it allows your mind more creativity and
it<00:01:49.350> allows<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.890> really<00:01:49.979> love<00:01:50.280> your

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it allows you to really love your

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.630 
it allows you to really love your
character<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:52.049> learn<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.189> guess

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
character and to learn in and I guess

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.639 
character and to learn in and I guess
just<00:01:53.909> go<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:54.689> as<00:01:54.869> much<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
just go in with as much as you can and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.350 
just go in with as much as you can and
it<00:01:55.740> also<00:01:55.890> makes<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.060> keep<00:01:57.210> it

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
it also makes it or you can keep it

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.300 
it also makes it or you can keep it
fresh<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.770> keep<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.040> fresh<00:01:59.159> with

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
fresh and you can keep it fresh with

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.819 
fresh and you can keep it fresh with
everyone<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.850> think<00:01:59.939> more<00:02:00.540> options<00:02:00.960> makes<00:02:01.710> a

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
everyone so I think more options makes a

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.600 
everyone so I think more options makes a
game<00:02:01.950> more<00:02:02.219> fun<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> really<00:02:03.180> cool

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
game more fun and this is a really cool

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
game more fun and this is a really cool
thing<00:02:04.610> that<00:02:04.729> they<00:02:04.820> put<00:02:05.060> into<00:02:05.180> this<00:02:05.329> mortal

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
thing that they put into this mortal

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.300 
thing that they put into this mortal
kombat<00:02:05.899> x<00:02:05.930> yeah<00:02:06.500> another<00:02:06.680> option<00:02:07.009> you<00:02:07.100> got<00:02:07.220> to
