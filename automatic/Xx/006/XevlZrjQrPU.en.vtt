 hello we are at the cinelli stand and here 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.009
 we have bootleg geo the offroad version 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.710
 della or bootleg of cycle tourism 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.160
 we leave the word fabrizio of habit 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.550
 cinelli 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.830
 hello everyone this is the model it is 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.770
 Was used last month by Lucas 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.680
 brunella his team to cover the 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.020
 stretch of the dariÃ©n gap a piece of 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.660
 jungle that from panama arrives in colombia 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.750
 it is indeed an off-road bicycle 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.670
 a bicycle from the daughter touring bicycle 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.120
 of the two-year tour experience from 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.980
 freak 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.470
 last year we presented it 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.280
 the white street version I have 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.040
 bootleg we see back here and this one 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.500
 is the off road version 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.050
 the choice remained on columbus pipes 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.629
 has variable thickness in ac 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.300
 allow maximum features 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.489
 mechanical and an excellent compromise for 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.880
 regarding the frame weight that comes 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:10.229
 treated with a treatment of 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.030
 cataphoresis that protects the pipe 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.850
 from corrosion even inside the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.360
 frame tubes in four sizes geometry 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.649
 montand mike with 27 and a half wheels 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.140
 choice of 27 and a half we considered 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.880
 the optimal choice between 26 and 29 for 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.780
 however, keep the center of gravity low 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.190
 and have a bike that thanks to 27 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.130
 and a half manages to overcome obstacles 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.170
 with ease possibility of mounting 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.420
 luggage rack both in the back 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.869
 than in the front even though we 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.720
 we favor the use of this type of 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.280
 bags that are in a single trek 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.599
 definitely more comfortable and in any case 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.479
 maintain the center of gravity of the 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:56.560
 bicycle closer to the center of gravity 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:02.520
 physical athlete bike the ECB is mounted 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:05.130
 with the group sram x5 2 x 10 allows 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.670
 to overcome any type of obstacle e 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.790
 of ascent even the most inaccessible fork 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.950
 rigid steel 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.750
 and the geometry of the frame is studied in 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.790
 such a way that those who wanted to do a 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.640
 upgrade for a fork but with one 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.260
 suspension fork the frame lo 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:28.349
 allows spare spoke disc brakes 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.329
 mounted on the fork leg 5 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.609
 attachment points for the portable race 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.170
 also on the fork leg in the 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.569
 in which case they should be used 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.989
 frame becks you can mount the doors 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.709
 he will want on the handlebar fork liners 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.709
 rais with ergonomic knobs allow 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.870
 excellent driveability an excellent point 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.629
 to grip the handlebars and above all 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.900
 a great comfort the bike will be 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:57.709
 available in Italy starting from 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.709
 end of year
