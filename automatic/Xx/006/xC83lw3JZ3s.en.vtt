00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
two-and-a-half years is that they

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.760 
two-and-a-half years is that they
struggle<00:03:53.110> because

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
struggle because

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.460 
struggle because
she's<00:03:55.670> missing<00:03:56.180> she's<00:03:56.570> not<00:03:56.840> here<00:03:57.230> in<00:03:57.350> the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
she's missing she's not here in the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.440 
she's missing she's not here in the
physical<00:03:57.500> sense<00:03:58.220> but<00:03:58.490> she's<00:03:58.790> still<00:03:59.060> there<00:03:59.330> in

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
physical sense but she's still there in

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.350 
physical sense but she's still there in
the<00:03:59.540> emotional<00:04:00.050> sense<00:04:00.490> so<00:04:01.490> you<00:04:01.580> keep<00:04:01.880> looking

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
the emotional sense so you keep looking

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.360 
the emotional sense so you keep looking
and<00:04:02.570> you're<00:04:02.720> wanting<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:03.560> waiting<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.310> I

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
and you're wanting and waiting and I

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.860 
and you're wanting and waiting and I
think<00:04:04.610> it's<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.910> waiting<00:04:05.120> part<00:04:05.480> that's<00:04:05.690> the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
think it's the waiting part that's the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.080 
think it's the waiting part that's the
hardest<00:04:06.290> for<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.530> family<00:04:06.950> but<00:04:07.580> I<00:04:07.640> mean<00:04:07.910> that's

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
hardest for the family but I mean that's

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.550 
hardest for the family but I mean that's
the<00:04:08.300> raw<00:04:08.450> emotion<00:04:08.600> of<00:04:09.050> having<00:04:09.350> somebody

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
the raw emotion of having somebody

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.170 
the raw emotion of having somebody
that's<00:04:09.950> missing<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.610> not<00:04:10.700> knowing<00:04:10.910> exactly

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
that's missing and not knowing exactly

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:29.550 
that's missing and not knowing exactly
where<00:04:11.690> they<00:04:11.900> are<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:13.150> searching<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.300> waiting
