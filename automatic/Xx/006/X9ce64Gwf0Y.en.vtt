00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
ambush position so the instinct of the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.990 
ambush position so the instinct of the
fish<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.290> case<00:00:13.500> salmon<00:00:14.070> find<00:00:14.849> it

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
fish is in this case salmon find it

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.290 
fish is in this case salmon find it
irresistible<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:16.049> bite<00:00:16.880> what<00:00:17.880> we're<00:00:18.029> going<00:00:18.240> to

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
irresistible to bite what we're going to

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.679 
irresistible to bite what we're going to
do<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> flasher<00:00:20.039> down<00:00:20.970> below<00:00:21.359> about

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
do is we have a flasher down below about

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.450 
do is we have a flasher down below about
ten<00:00:21.990> feet<00:00:22.230> below<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.800> we've<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.130> led<00:00:23.340> into

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
ten feet below that we've just led into

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.609 
ten feet below that we've just led into
the<00:00:23.609> water<00:00:23.960> we're<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.170> create<00:00:25.410> this

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
the water we're going to create this

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
the water we're going to create this
loop<00:00:25.920> knot<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> permanent<00:00:27.029> knot<00:00:27.300> on

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
loop knot this is a permanent knot on

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.670 
loop knot this is a permanent knot on
your<00:00:27.510> fishing<00:00:27.840> line<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.349> will<00:00:28.500> go<00:00:28.650> through

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
your fishing line that will go through

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.400 
your fishing line that will go through
the<00:00:29.039> guides<00:00:29.279> we're<00:00:30.210> using<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:31.050> our

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the guides we're using this with our

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.690 
the guides we're using this with our
torpedo<00:00:32.279> fix<00:00:32.759> sliders<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.450> swivel<00:00:33.960> and

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
torpedo fix sliders not swivel and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.160 
torpedo fix sliders not swivel and
behind<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.910> we'd<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.390> about<00:00:36.510> five<00:00:36.930> feet

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
behind this we'd have about five feet

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.850 
behind this we'd have about five feet
with<00:00:37.410> another<00:00:37.710> lure<00:00:38.070> probably<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> spoon<00:00:39.860> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
with another lure probably a spoon the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.580 
with another lure probably a spoon the
idea<00:00:41.219> here<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.000> flasher<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.110> creating<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
idea here is the flasher is creating a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.639 
idea here is the flasher is creating a
lot<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.829> turbulence<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:46.140> outside<00:00:46.590> of

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
lot of turbulence and just outside of

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.049 
lot of turbulence and just outside of
that<00:00:46.770> turbulence<00:00:47.430> we're<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
that turbulence we're going to have a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.060 
that turbulence we're going to have a
spoon<00:00:48.420> sitting<00:00:48.780> there<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.379> those<00:00:49.559> fish<00:00:49.890> are

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
spoon sitting there that those fish are

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.119 
spoon sitting there that those fish are
just<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.520> find<00:00:50.730> irresistible<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.860> first

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
just going to find irresistible so first

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.520 
just going to find irresistible so first
we<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> make<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.820> loop<00:00:54.000> knot<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:55.260> what

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
we have to make this loop knot and what

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.709 
we have to make this loop knot and what
we<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.219> take<00:00:56.460> our<00:00:56.760> line<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.449> case

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
we do is we just take our line this case

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.849 
we do is we just take our line this case
braid<00:00:58.050> we'd<00:00:58.410> create<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> loop<00:00:59.300> crossed<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.539> over

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
braid we'd create a loop crossed it over

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.260 
braid we'd create a loop crossed it over
we're<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.280> cross<00:01:02.640> over<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> two

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
we're going to now cross over the two

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.600 
we're going to now cross over the two
tag<00:01:03.570> ends<00:01:03.989> twice<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:04.920> got<00:01:05.100> once<00:01:05.960> twice

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
tag ends twice so we got once twice

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.130 
tag ends twice so we got once twice
we're<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.909> now<00:01:09.060> pull<00:01:09.510> through<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
we're going to now pull through the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.719 
we're going to now pull through the
other<00:01:10.260> line<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.890> we've<00:01:11.250> pulled<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.700> through

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
other line so we've pulled it through

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.010 
other line so we've pulled it through
and<00:01:12.830> I'm<00:01:13.830> going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.340> use<00:01:14.640> something<00:01:15.119> an<00:01:15.509> object

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and I'm going to use something an object

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.969 
and I'm going to use something an object
in<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.320> case<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:17.220> screwdriver<00:01:18.710> in<00:01:19.710> order

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
in this case this screwdriver in order

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.530 
in this case this screwdriver in order
to<00:01:20.600> cinch<00:01:21.600> down<00:01:21.720> my<00:01:22.229> loop<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> smaller<00:01:23.189> hole

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
to cinch down my loop to a smaller hole

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.370 
to cinch down my loop to a smaller hole
so<00:01:24.540> what<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.259> I'm<00:01:25.350> just

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
so what I'm going to do is I'm just

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560 
so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.680> pull<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:26.970> see<00:01:27.119> there's<00:01:27.330> two

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
going to pull you can see there's two

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.359 
going to pull you can see there's two
tag<00:01:27.869> loops<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.680> I'm<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> pull<00:01:29.189> on

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
tag loops here that I'm going to pull on

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.920 
tag loops here that I'm going to pull on
it's<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.820> tighten<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.710> pull<00:01:31.710> again

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
it's going to tighten it up pull again

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.760 
it's going to tighten it up pull again
tighten<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.140> pull<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:36.560> tighten<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.619> up

tighten it up pull it in tighten it up

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
tighten it up pull it in tighten it up
until<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> size<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.570> think<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.869> have

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
until I have the size and I think I have

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.170 
until I have the size and I think I have
it<00:01:40.170> now<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:41.070> size<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.640> loop<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.060> I'm

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
it now the size of a loop that I'm

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.060 
it now the size of a loop that I'm
looking<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:42.990> I'm<00:01:43.290> going<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.439> tighten<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.950> up

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
looking for I'm going to tighten that up

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.730 
looking for I'm going to tighten that up
and<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> very<00:01:45.899> very<00:01:46.500> very

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and you can see I have a very very very

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.969 
and you can see I have a very very very
small<00:01:47.130> link<00:01:47.430> there<00:01:47.659> it's<00:01:48.659> also<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.530> lines<00:01:49.770> not
