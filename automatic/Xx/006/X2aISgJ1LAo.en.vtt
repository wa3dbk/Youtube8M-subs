00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
hi guys how are you good to see you

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.780 
hi guys how are you good to see you
again

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
again

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.150 
again
okay<00:00:11.660> so<00:00:11.719> now

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
okay so now

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.530 
okay so now
few<00:00:13.340> lessons<00:00:13.550> were<00:00:13.910> concerned<00:00:14.330> with

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
few lessons were concerned with

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.470 
few lessons were concerned with
answering<00:00:15.309> an<00:00:16.309> IELTS<00:00:16.640> question<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:17.330> we've

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
answering an IELTS question so we've

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.230 
answering an IELTS question so we've
looked<00:00:17.660> at<00:00:18.039> combinations<00:00:19.039> of<00:00:19.220> graphs<00:00:19.490> okay<00:00:20.180> so

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
looked at combinations of graphs okay so

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.109 
looked at combinations of graphs okay so
we<00:00:20.480> had<00:00:20.660> a<00:00:20.689> line<00:00:21.050> graph<00:00:21.349> in<00:00:21.560> a<00:00:21.619> bar<00:00:21.800> graph<00:00:22.119> we

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
we had a line graph in a bar graph we

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.420 
we had a line graph in a bar graph we
had<00:00:23.210> a<00:00:23.240> bar<00:00:23.450> graph<00:00:23.599> in<00:00:23.810> a<00:00:23.869> pie<00:00:24.050> chart<00:00:24.080> we<00:00:25.009> had<00:00:25.250> a

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
had a bar graph in a pie chart we had a

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.780 
had a bar graph in a pie chart we had a
table<00:00:25.669> as<00:00:26.060> well<00:00:26.890> so<00:00:27.890> those<00:00:28.009> were<00:00:28.189> in

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
table as well so those were in

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.460 
table as well so those were in
combination<00:00:29.539> except<00:00:29.840> for<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.050> table<00:00:30.380> of

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
combination except for the table of

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.770 
combination except for the table of
course<00:00:30.650> now<00:00:31.609> we're<00:00:31.850> going<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.119> look<00:00:32.269> at<00:00:32.419> a<00:00:32.449> pie

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
course now we're going to look at a pie

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.530 
course now we're going to look at a pie
chart<00:00:33.199> okay<00:00:33.800> we're<00:00:34.550> going<00:00:34.670> to<00:00:34.760> describe<00:00:35.120> three

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
chart okay we're going to describe three

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.080 
chart okay we're going to describe three
small<00:00:35.960> pie<00:00:36.230> charts<00:00:36.710> relating<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:37.879> same

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
small pie charts relating to the same

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.030 
small pie charts relating to the same
idea<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:38.809> there's<00:00:39.019> no<00:00:39.140> they're<00:00:39.440> not<00:00:39.559> actually

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
idea so there's no they're not actually

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.670 
idea so there's no they're not actually
actually<00:00:40.449> separate<00:00:41.449> graphs<00:00:41.780> as<00:00:42.080> such<00:00:42.290> okay

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
actually separate graphs as such okay

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.110 
actually separate graphs as such okay
they're<00:00:43.070> all<00:00:43.190> describing<00:00:43.790> the<00:00:43.879> same<00:00:44.059> thing

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
they're all describing the same thing

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.319 
they're all describing the same thing
okay<00:00:44.809> which<00:00:45.739> has<00:00:46.160> slight<00:00:46.640> different<00:00:46.969> effects

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
okay which has slight different effects

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.360 
okay which has slight different effects
on<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:47.540> paragraphing<00:00:48.350> structure<00:00:48.860> okay<00:00:49.960> so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
on the paragraphing structure okay so

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.639 
on the paragraphing structure okay so
what<00:00:52.370> we're<00:00:52.489> going<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.700> do<00:00:52.910> as<00:00:53.270> usual<00:00:54.020> in<00:00:54.440> the

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
what we're going to do as usual in the

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.610 
what we're going to do as usual in the
last<00:00:54.829> as<00:00:55.789> in<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.059> last<00:00:56.270> few<00:00:56.510> lessons<00:00:56.750> we're

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
last as in the last few lessons we're

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.900 
last as in the last few lessons we're
going<00:00:57.860> to<00:00:57.980> look<00:00:58.100> at<00:00:58.309> reading<00:00:58.789> and

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
going to look at reading and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.689 
going to look at reading and
understanding<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.480> question<00:01:00.699> understanding

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
understanding the question understanding

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.340 
understanding the question understanding
and<00:01:01.850> interpreting<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.449> graphs<00:01:02.690> this<00:01:03.050> time

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
and interpreting the graphs this time

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.600 
and interpreting the graphs this time
I'm<00:01:03.530> going<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.829> talk<00:01:04.039> a<00:01:04.070> little<00:01:04.309> bit<00:01:04.489> more

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
I'm going to talk a little bit more

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.760 
I'm going to talk a little bit more
about<00:01:05.149> the<00:01:05.330> graphs<00:01:05.600> when<00:01:06.229> we're<00:01:06.440> interpreting

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
about the graphs when we're interpreting

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.450 
about the graphs when we're interpreting
it<00:01:07.330> because<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:08.570> don't<00:01:09.410> see<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.950> need<00:01:10.130> after

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
it because I don't see the need after

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.460 
it because I don't see the need after
the<00:01:11.240> last<00:01:11.420> few<00:01:11.660> lessons<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:12.110> going<00:01:12.289> through

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
the last few lessons of going through

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.590 
the last few lessons of going through
everything<00:01:13.100> slowly<00:01:13.789> slowly<00:01:14.360> slowly

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
everything slowly slowly slowly

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.350 
everything slowly slowly slowly
gradually<00:01:15.250> this<00:01:16.250> lesson<00:01:16.640> I'm<00:01:16.850> going<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.149> move

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
gradually this lesson I'm going to move

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.480 
gradually this lesson I'm going to move
through<00:01:17.630> a<00:01:17.929> little<00:01:18.289> bit<00:01:18.410> faster<00:01:18.979> because<00:01:19.190> you

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
through a little bit faster because you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.150 
through a little bit faster because you
should<00:01:19.700> have<00:01:19.729> already<00:01:20.380> got<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.500> idea<00:01:21.920> of

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
should have already got the idea of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.889 
should have already got the idea of
certain<00:01:22.550> aspects<00:01:23.000> of<00:01:23.149> describing<00:01:23.780> these

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
certain aspects of describing these

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.719 
certain aspects of describing these
graphs<00:01:24.259> okay<00:01:24.679> so<00:01:24.740> you're<00:01:25.280> already<00:01:25.550> familiar

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
graphs okay so you're already familiar

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.419 
graphs okay so you're already familiar
we<00:01:26.240> can<00:01:26.390> move<00:01:26.539> move<00:01:27.050> forward<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.069> little<00:01:28.220> bit

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
we can move move forward a little bit

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.419 
we can move move forward a little bit
quicker<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:28.970> I'll<00:01:29.630> talk<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:29.840> bit<00:01:29.929> more<00:01:30.080> about

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
quicker so I'll talk a bit more about

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.290 
quicker so I'll talk a bit more about
understanding<00:01:31.429> and<00:01:31.550> interpreting<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.119> graph

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
understanding and interpreting the graph

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.449 
understanding and interpreting the graph
there<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:33.319> we'll<00:01:33.530> get<00:01:33.770> straight<00:01:34.250> into

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
there and we'll get straight into

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.639 
there and we'll get straight into
paraphrasing<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.390> question<00:01:35.810> very<00:01:35.959> quickly

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
paraphrasing the question very quickly

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.820 
paraphrasing the question very quickly
because<00:01:37.459> you've<00:01:37.610> done<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:37.970> as<00:01:38.149> well<00:01:38.360> and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
because you've done that as well and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.630 
because you've done that as well and
then<00:01:39.830> describing<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.670> proportions

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
then describing the proportions

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.080 
then describing the proportions
paragraphing<00:01:43.670> okay<00:01:44.330> so<00:01:44.959> um<00:01:45.890> we're<00:01:46.759> going<00:01:46.970> to

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
paragraphing okay so um we're going to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.760 
paragraphing okay so um we're going to
go<00:01:47.239> through<00:01:47.479> this<00:01:47.599> in<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.899> similar<00:01:48.380> way<00:01:48.410> to<00:01:48.530> the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
go through this in a similar way to the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.380 
go through this in a similar way to the
other<00:01:48.890> lessons<00:01:49.340> but<00:01:49.700> we're<00:01:49.910> going<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.149> leave

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
other lessons but we're going to leave

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.570 
other lessons but we're going to leave
out<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.869> lot<00:01:51.259> of<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.530> linguistic<00:01:51.860> content

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
out a lot of the linguistic content

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.880 
out a lot of the linguistic content
because<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.030> should<00:01:53.300> already<00:01:53.750> know<00:01:54.080> all

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
because you should already know all

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.609 
because you should already know all
about<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.250> stuff<00:01:55.550> okay<00:01:56.239> good<00:01:56.989> stuff<00:01:57.110> let's

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
about that stuff okay good stuff let's

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.339 
about that stuff okay good stuff let's
move<00:01:57.830> on<00:01:58.119> now<00:01:59.140> reading<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.259> understanding

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
move on now reading and understanding

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.889 
move on now reading and understanding
the<00:02:00.950> questions<00:02:01.399> so<00:02:01.640> what<00:02:02.270> question<00:02:02.690> have<00:02:02.810> we

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
the questions so what question have we

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.770 
the questions so what question have we
got<00:02:03.080> this<00:02:03.649> lesson<00:02:04.069> the<00:02:04.910> charts<00:02:05.330> show<00:02:05.750> the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
got this lesson the charts show the

by<00:02:10.610> children<00:02:11.090> in<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.270> UK<00:02:11.450> in<00:02:12.220> 1997<00:02:13.220> okay<00:02:13.819> let's

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
by children in the UK in 1997 okay let's

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.710 
by children in the UK in 1997 okay let's
take<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.200> look<00:02:15.470> at<00:02:15.709> these<00:02:16.000> these<00:02:17.000> charts<00:02:17.510> a

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
take a look at these these charts a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
take a look at these these charts a
little<00:02:18.349> bit<00:02:18.440> more<00:02:18.590> closely<00:02:18.879> and<00:02:19.900> we<00:02:20.900> will<00:02:21.080> try

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
little bit more closely and we will try

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.620 
little bit more closely and we will try
to<00:02:21.770> understand<00:02:22.370> what's<00:02:22.610> happening<00:02:22.700> in<00:02:23.390> the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
to understand what's happening in the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.130 
to understand what's happening in the
charts<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.230> try<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.440> enter

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
charts and try to enter

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.040 
charts and try to enter
the<00:02:25.290> information<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.450> here<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:27.570> have<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> more

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
the information so here we have a more

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.410 
the information so here we have a more
detailed<00:02:28.260> view<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.070> of<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.910> charts<00:02:30.240> now

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
detailed view of the of the charts now

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.540 
detailed view of the of the charts now
first<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:31.350> what<00:02:31.770> you've<00:02:31.950> got<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.190> look<00:02:32.220> at

first of all what you've got to look at

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.530 
first of all what you've got to look at
is<00:02:32.820> each<00:02:33.720> chart<00:02:34.320> individually<00:02:35.280> okay<00:02:35.820> we've

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
is each chart individually okay we've

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.990 
is each chart individually okay we've
got<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.870> key<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.380> side<00:02:37.620> showing<00:02:38.040> us<00:02:38.670> what

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
got the key to the side showing us what

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.580 
got the key to the side showing us what
the<00:02:39.120> colors<00:02:39.450> mean<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.870> colors<00:02:40.170> mean

the colors mean and the colors mean

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.890 
the colors mean and the colors mean
different<00:02:41.060> amounts<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.150> milk<00:02:42.420> different

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
different amounts of milk different

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.650 
different amounts of milk different
volumes<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.500> milk<00:02:43.740> okay<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.580> pipes<00:02:44.940> as<00:02:45.330> was

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
volumes of milk okay in pipes as was

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.680 
volumes of milk okay in pipes as was
said<00:02:45.870> before<00:02:46.250> if<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.370> look<00:02:47.490> at<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.760> chart<00:02:48.480> for

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
said before if you look at the chart for

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.199 
said before if you look at the chart for
boys<00:02:48.900> now<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:50.190> thing<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.430> jumps<00:02:50.940> out

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
boys now the thing that jumps out

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.230 
boys now the thing that jumps out
immediately<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:53.160> two<00:02:53.370> slices<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
immediately is the two slices of the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.990 
immediately is the two slices of the
chart<00:02:54.510> which<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.980> highest<00:02:56.220> proportions

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
chart which have the highest proportions

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.970 
chart which have the highest proportions
okay<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.420> can<00:02:57.630> see<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.380> yellow<00:02:58.590> or

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
okay you can see that the yellow or

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.170 
okay you can see that the yellow or
slightly<00:02:59.310> orange<00:02:59.790> slice<00:03:00.720> has<00:03:01.650> 27<00:03:02.550> percent<00:03:02.970> of

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
slightly orange slice has 27 percent of

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.750 
slightly orange slice has 27 percent of
the<00:03:03.420> total<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:05.340> pink<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:05.910> has<00:03:06.570> 33<00:03:07.580> so<00:03:08.580> those

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the total the pink one has 33 so those

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.720 
the total the pink one has 33 so those
two<00:03:09.000> are<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.660> most<00:03:09.750> significant<00:03:10.730> proportions

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
two are the most significant proportions

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.750 
two are the most significant proportions
in<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.780> chart<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.230> pie<00:03:13.410> chart<00:03:13.709> for<00:03:13.920> girls

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
in the chart the pie chart for girls

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.479 
in the chart the pie chart for girls
it's<00:03:15.090> slightly<00:03:15.450> different<00:03:15.959> okay<00:03:16.489> what

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
it's slightly different okay what

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.330 
it's slightly different okay what
similar<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.030> boys<00:03:18.300> and<00:03:18.510> girls<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.680> yellow

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
similar to boys and girls is the yellow

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.690 
similar to boys and girls is the yellow
color<00:03:20.640> okay<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.239> half<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.900> pint<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:23.280> the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
color okay so half a pint and the

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.850 
color okay so half a pint and the
proportions<00:03:24.180> are<00:03:24.300> quite<00:03:24.480> similar<00:03:24.720> but<00:03:25.530> for

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
proportions are quite similar but for

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.210 
proportions are quite similar but for
girls<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.330> purple<00:03:28.020> part<00:03:28.260> are<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.920> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
girls the the purple part are the the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.850 
girls the the purple part are the the
pink<00:03:29.580> part<00:03:29.910> which<00:03:30.600> is<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.959> quarter<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.680> point

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
pink part which is a quarter of a point

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.140 
pink part which is a quarter of a point
is<00:03:32.280> now<00:03:32.730> less<00:03:33.299> significant<00:03:34.290> okay<00:03:35.150> there's

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
is now less significant okay there's

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.789 
is now less significant okay there's
another<00:03:36.269> part<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:36.989> chart<00:03:37.230> here<00:03:37.470> which<00:03:37.500> is

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
another part of the chart here which is

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.060 
another part of the chart here which is
more<00:03:37.950> significant<00:03:38.670> which<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.299> for<00:03:39.870> more<00:03:40.590> than

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
more significant which is for more than

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.039 
more significant which is for more than
one<00:03:41.340> pint<00:03:41.670> okay<00:03:42.330> so<00:03:42.390> for<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.750> girls

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
one pint okay so for the girls

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.410 
one pint okay so for the girls
23%<00:03:44.120> drink<00:03:45.120> more<00:03:45.510> than<00:03:45.540> one<00:03:45.989> pint<00:03:46.400> okay<00:03:47.400> if<00:03:48.299> you

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
23% drink more than one pint okay if you

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.270 
23% drink more than one pint okay if you
look<00:03:48.570> at<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.810> graph<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.320> total<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:50.040> chart

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
look at the graph of the total the chart

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.670 
look at the graph of the total the chart
for<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.519> total<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.239> can<00:03:51.390> see<00:03:51.570> it<00:03:51.840> reflects

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
for the total you can see it reflects

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.100 
for the total you can see it reflects
the<00:03:52.980> proportions<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:54.510> significant

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
the proportions the significant

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.110 
the proportions the significant
proportions<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.830> are<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.640> same<00:03:56.790> in<00:03:56.850> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
proportions that are the same in the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.310 
proportions that are the same in the
boys<00:03:57.299> chart

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
boys chart

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.710 
boys chart
okay<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:58.680> again<00:03:59.310> for<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.820> quarter<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.480> pint

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
okay so again for a quarter of a pint

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.930 
okay so again for a quarter of a pint
and<00:04:00.930> half<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.410> pint<00:04:01.650> okay<00:04:02.190> 26<00:04:02.790> percent

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
and half a pint okay 26 percent

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.590 
and half a pint okay 26 percent
respectively<00:04:04.519> then<00:04:05.519> we<00:04:05.910> think<00:04:06.120> about<00:04:06.330> the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
respectively then we think about the

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.259 
respectively then we think about the
less<00:04:06.870> significant<00:04:07.910> proportions<00:04:08.910> in<00:04:09.150> the

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
less significant proportions in the

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.289 
less significant proportions in the
chart<00:04:09.480> so<00:04:09.720> for<00:04:09.900> boys<00:04:10.049> it's<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:11.010> red<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:12.090> blue

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
chart so for boys it's the red the blue

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.350 
chart so for boys it's the red the blue
and<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:13.470> sort<00:04:13.890> of<00:04:13.950> greeny<00:04:14.340> brown<00:04:14.730> color<00:04:15.150> and

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
and the sort of greeny brown color and

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.229 
and the sort of greeny brown color and
those<00:04:16.019> are<00:04:16.440> above<00:04:16.950> three-quarters<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.030> pint

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
those are above three-quarters of a pint

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.240 
those are above three-quarters of a pint
so<00:04:18.390> three<00:04:18.570> quarters<00:04:18.750> one<00:04:19.200> pint<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.709> more<00:04:20.070> than

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
so three quarters one pint and more than

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.480 
so three quarters one pint and more than
one<00:04:20.400> pint<00:04:20.640> for<00:04:20.880> girls<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:22.140> three<00:04:23.070> quarters<00:04:23.460> of

one pint for girls is three quarters of
a<00:04:23.580> pint<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.030> one<00:04:24.240> point<00:04:24.620> okay<00:04:25.620> but<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.490> changes

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
a pint and one point okay but it changes

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.930 
a pint and one point okay but it changes
this<00:04:27.240> time<00:04:27.540> so<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:28.050> quarter<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.890> pint<00:04:29.160> is<00:04:29.430> is

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
this time so a quarter of a pint is is

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.140 
this time so a quarter of a pint is is
one<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.450> those<00:04:30.570> as<00:04:30.840> well<00:04:31.169> okay<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.760> pink

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
one of those as well okay so the pink

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.460 
one of those as well okay so the pink
section<00:04:33.360> on<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.690> purple<00:04:34.020> section

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
section on the purple section

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.220 
section on the purple section
and<00:04:35.560> again<00:04:36.370> for<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.670> total<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.510> can<00:04:37.540> see<00:04:37.780> 15

and again for the total you can see 15

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.610 
and again for the total you can see 15
15<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:38.860> 12<00:04:39.180> are<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.600> less<00:04:40.810> significant

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
15 and 12 are the less significant

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.080 
15 and 12 are the less significant
trends<00:04:41.980> there<00:04:42.190> okay

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
trends there okay

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.010 
trends there okay
now<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:44.740> smallest<00:04:45.100> parts<00:04:46.000> of<00:04:46.210> these<00:04:46.570> charts

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
now the smallest parts of these charts

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.310 
now the smallest parts of these charts
are<00:04:47.230> for<00:04:47.740> those<00:04:47.860> consuming<00:04:48.550> none<00:04:48.850> and<00:04:49.540> okay<00:04:49.810> so

are for those consuming none and okay so
these<00:04:51.160> are<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.490> least<00:04:51.700> significant<00:04:52.480> parts

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
these are the least significant parts

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.050 
these are the least significant parts
which<00:04:52.930> will<00:04:53.050> also<00:04:53.410> be<00:04:53.530> included<00:04:53.920> for<00:04:54.910> those

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
which are less significant so in the

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.480 
which are less significant so in the
subsequent<00:04:57.850> sentences<00:04:58.600> of<00:04:58.810> each<00:04:59.140> paragraph

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490
