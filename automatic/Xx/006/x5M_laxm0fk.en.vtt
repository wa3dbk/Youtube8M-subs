00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.090
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.110
 third series of my series zander 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.580
 others with rubber baits 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.740
 Last week we already had that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.630
 talked about it and this week goes 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.610
 It is about main strings which Hauptstelle 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.730
 I think that's the best way to tell 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.860
 the ideal main cord for you 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.600
 zander on with rubber baits is mine 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.040
 opinion of the braided clearly 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.809
 which has in comparison to a mono 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.670
 many no stretch and we feel 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.450
 bite and the bait contact also on 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.760
 big distance 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.050
 Moreover, braided is only already in 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.730
 small diameter at the high 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.320
 load capacity so we can thinner 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.810
 fish and have strings for example 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.820
 here in the river much lower 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.500
 flow resistance braided cord 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.990
 is therefore a clear must for 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.550
 others on zander the string strength 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.710
 When starting zander I do everything 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.600
 depending on the water in the style of water 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.800
 is indeed mostly smaller the heads 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.690
 or can the heads less 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.340
 use it with an opponent 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.590
 weight then I am with string 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.390
 strengthen from 6 to about eight 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.930
 kilogram , however, I am in flux 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.450
 on road 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.580
 you also have to go 20 25 or even 30 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.440
 throw gram heads then I use 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.619
 strings between 9 and just under twelve kilo 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.670
 Strength in braided disturb eighth 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.770
 I always insist that they be around 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.789
 braided are round braided cords 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.740
 have a very smooth 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.750
 surface and thereby produce in 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.490
 the rain hardly friction that promotes 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.869
 one to the other 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.229
 that reduces the noise in the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.550
 Routes of rain arise when engaging 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.899
 the color of the braided is actually 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.530
 it does not matter if everyone stays for themselves 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.479
 leave 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.340
 I like to use yellow and 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.289
 white strings as I best they 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.880
 In this case I only have pen 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.580
 international premium brands in the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.110
 Strength 0 12 which is braided eight times 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.550
 which is very round so has the before 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.830
 I can address the mentioned characteristics 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.090
 throw it is very resistant to abrasion and 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.470
 has a high knot strength why 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.940
 I prefer braided faster than 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.899
 I would like to use my many strings 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.819
 give you a little example 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.920
 demonstrate that I have a rubber 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.959
 bait taken and rubber band wrestled 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.640
 knotted and the elastic band should be roughly 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.410
 the stretching of the monarch on complete 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.470
 length we look at that 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.280
 whole times more accurate 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.530
 let's imagine the following scenario 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.209
 in front of the cooler is just on the 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.159
 ground and we want him with one 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.910
 animation on the routes tip 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.890
 lupfen 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.290
 Now we are on the route tip pull 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.300
 you only then before our bait 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.040
 starts to start we give the route 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.600
 for example, by 30 centimeters 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.860
 It may be that our bait just around 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.410
 five inches goes up through the 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.450
 stretching the mono many is also the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.860
 energy the bait when putting on 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.600
 pass the reason to the cord 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.220
 we do not feel the whole thing lost 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.220
 more of the route and thus have one 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.600
 lower cooler contact another 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.060
 disadvantage in trading the motto a lot 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.320
 Above all, the following scenario is shown 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.910
 when the magic bait for example 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.200
 painted and we put the stop 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.300
 then want to beat the profile 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.100
 first in the buffer before the 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.230
 bait is moved and the hook to grab 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.730
 comes with the zander the very very hard 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.700
 tomorrow it can be on big distances 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.410
 therefore too much from the just shown 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.090
 I use others for the zander 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.890
 lure with rubber rather plaited 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.510
 However, mono also has many strings 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.280
 cords and flight carbon their 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.570
 authorization just when heartbeat 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.980
 other or when dealing with the world 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.960
 caster, you are clearly here from 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.480
 Advantage for adoption with rubber cooler 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.280
 However, I swear on braided that 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.200
 it was again with the series zander 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.400
 angel with rubber kÃ¶hler part 3 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.900
 next week, it is here in the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.700
 same place continues so switched 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.040
 again that is zander trade with 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.459
 rubber bait this time part 4 of the right one 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.900
 bait 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.220
 Until then I wish you much success 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.220
 and petri safe on the water
