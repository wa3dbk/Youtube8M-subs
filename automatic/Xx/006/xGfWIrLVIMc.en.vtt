00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.299 
specifically for the show but we had to
do<00:00:54.930> some<00:00:55.110> things<00:00:55.140> because<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.039> hard<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
do some things because it was hard to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.500

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
them kind of personal too because they

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.940 
them kind of personal too because they
also<00:02:14.510> had<00:02:14.720> some<00:02:14.900> words<00:02:15.080> about<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.560> piece<00:02:15.740> so

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
also had some words about the piece so

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.290 
also had some words about the piece so
what<00:02:16.070> did<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.310> feel<00:02:16.520> about<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.910> judges

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
what did you feel about the judges

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:27.370 
what did you feel about the judges
reflection<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.590> piece<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.870> was<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.080> cha-cha

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
reflection of the piece it was a cha-cha

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.290 
reflection of the piece it was a cha-cha
enough<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.250> we<00:02:28.400> were<00:02:28.490> really<00:02:28.820> worried<00:02:29.240> about

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
enough and we were really worried about

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.110 
enough and we were really worried about
that<00:02:29.480> because<00:02:29.810> our<00:02:30.470> hip-hop<00:02:31.070> isn't<00:02:31.820> really

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
that because our hip-hop isn't really

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.610 
that because our hip-hop isn't really
hip-hop<00:02:32.510> we<00:02:32.780> don't<00:02:32.990> really<00:02:33.110> like<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.350> call

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
hip-hop we don't really like to call

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.260 
hip-hop we don't really like to call
what<00:02:33.740> we<00:02:33.830> do<00:02:33.920> hip-hop<00:02:34.160> it's<00:02:34.490> like<00:02:34.790> under<00:02:35.150> the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
what we do hip-hop it's like under the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.640 
what we do hip-hop it's like under the
umbrella<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.720> urban<00:02:36.080> dance<00:02:36.230> but<00:02:36.470> it's<00:02:36.590> a

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
umbrella of urban dance but it's a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.770 
umbrella of urban dance but it's a
completely<00:02:36.920> different<00:02:37.190> thing<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.240> we<00:02:38.660> were<00:02:38.750> a

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
completely different thing so we were a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.350 
completely different thing so we were a
little<00:02:38.870> nervous<00:02:39.020> about<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:40.360> ended

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
little nervous about that so that ended

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.020 
little nervous about that so that ended
up<00:02:41.420> being<00:02:41.600> okay<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:43.250> was<00:02:43.400> nice<00:02:43.610> because<00:02:43.880> it

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
up being okay it was nice because it

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.780 
up being okay it was nice because it
seemed<00:02:45.020> like<00:02:45.050> nigel<00:02:45.500> embraced<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.520> this<00:02:46.610> time

seemed like nigel embraced it this time

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.090 
seemed like nigel embraced it this time
around<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.420> he<00:02:47.570> said<00:02:47.810> he<00:02:48.709> pulled<00:02:48.860> us<00:02:48.980> aside

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100
