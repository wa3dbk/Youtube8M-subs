00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
better than this cow but it was easy to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.369 
better than this cow but it was easy to
get<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.269> that<00:01:03.540> was<00:01:03.659> a<00:01:03.690> big<00:01:03.780> deal<00:01:04.049> i<00:01:04.110> just

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
get to and that was a big deal i just

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.670

wanted<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> get<00:01:04.920> cut<00:01:05.159> clean<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:07.229> then

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
wanted to get cut clean and and then

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.020 
wanted to get cut clean and and then
just<00:01:07.920> kind<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.370> lot<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.580> work<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:09.000> time

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
just kind of do a lot of work in time

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.990 
just kind of do a lot of work in time
and<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.350> knew<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.400> knew<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.760> eyebrow

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
