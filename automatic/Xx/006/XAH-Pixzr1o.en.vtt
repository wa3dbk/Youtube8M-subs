 Trojan has a lot coming out as it is 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:47.569
 more liquid than that of declÃ©or me 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.970
 I really like removing makeup in oil 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.880

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.910
 all eyes I have another tile of 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.530
 dior who's eyes and I can not at all 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.730

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.730
 this one does not sting at all 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:43.269
 here I take note of course all the eyelashes 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.269
 because with mascara 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.360
 ana 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.629
 what sacred abl is nice 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.420
 to use so I take two cottons 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.010
 stems gerber a little water and I took 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.049
 lukewarm water 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:30.540
 so much tiff I took two cottons 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:32.870
 no cotton swab and so I prince the 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.870
 face 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
 hop 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.750
 and especially the eyes I think it's 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:06.190
 good when you have skin that date 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:07.960
 dehydrated now it does not allow 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.890
 not have dry skin not to see the 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:17.620
 yard that draws so that looks good ben 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:19.500

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.390
 I'm repenting makes a little knife 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.390
 it seems to me nickel all this 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.930
 because at the level of the eyes there is nothing 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:49.730
 I think there is not much to 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:51.740
 add three bombs has largely 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.330
 sufficient to clean the face 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.030
 I was still wearing makeup 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.270
 had no worries and there I feel my 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:05.300
 silva there is no program a game without 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:07.610

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.960
 eyes a little ti products 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.490
 make-up remover for six vinci keys 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:17.229
 remains at the eye level of makeup 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.229
 but I think they do not stay 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.360
 to send it to eye level and a 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.360

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.350
