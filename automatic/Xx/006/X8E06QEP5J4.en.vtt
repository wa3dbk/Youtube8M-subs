basically rebuild it the plug and

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.799 
basically rebuild it the plug and
everything<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:54.170> in<00:00:54.830> within<00:00:55.370> specs<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.660> we'll

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
everything is in within specs so we'll

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.049 
everything is in within specs so we'll
have<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.050> do<00:00:57.230> nothing<00:00:57.470> to<00:00:57.530> that<00:00:57.760> this<00:00:58.760> shell

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
have to do nothing to that this shell

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.270

that the plug goes into its within specs

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.680
