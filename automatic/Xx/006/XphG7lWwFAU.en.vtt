 appeared a version 2.0 with some 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.330

 the blue hedgehog 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.210
 number 8 the original idea of ​​this game 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.550
 was to be played with three buttons one for 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.400
 attack and another to jump and another to 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.190
 throwing objects then we opted for 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.920
 focus on a single button as well 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.440
 would achieve a simple and focused game 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.490
 speed

 disappearance of the lamp post in games 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.150
 later in design would be

 replaced by star posts 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.280

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.360
 game there is no super sonic besides that 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.510
