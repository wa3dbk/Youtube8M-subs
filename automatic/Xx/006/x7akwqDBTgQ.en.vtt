 Hi everyone, it's blurry and welcome 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.210
 in this video the last one actually 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.600
 two days where you ht phones be 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.599
 is better 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.219
 do not forget to subscribe here on 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.349
 facebook and google + if you wish 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.670
 so in this video actually it's 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.990
 very simple so there I like to buy 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.970
 on one and mutsch been stuck on 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.640
 bootloader as you could see you 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.199
 follow my previous video and I 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.029
 also installed the recovery 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.420
 now I 'll have to know the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.750
 phone to the pc here that will be detected 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.630
 all alone excuse me but you can the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:41.520
 brightness what I changed pc 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:45.809
 meanwhile that's it so we'll see here 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.350
 the deceased who was a man who was 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.350
 detected 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.829
 I also have this file that I was loaded 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.500
 so I'm going to put the link in in the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.690
 description of the video is also at 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.000
 inside 2 of the article on the blog 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.879
 so I simply want to go in 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.809
 in our teens and I'm going to paste it here 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.150
 you can also download 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.630
 directly from your phone is 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.520
 not a problem 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.180
 once it's done unplug the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.939
 phone like that you turn it off is 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.509
 sure before that you already have off 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.509
 quick start 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.830
 the digital phone wanted me bats power 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:30.840
 you turn back on in the bootloader mode 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.930
 you select a recovery here and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.540
 you go on the recovery mode 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.460
 so it is very easy not to worry 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.600
 to do that once it's done 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.979
 so their colleagues already have it 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.280
 installed and there you go go on 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.170
 installed then you will go into the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.439
 nova from where you placed the file 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.700
 route and you click on it you 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.990
 can do a check of 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.479
 signature if you want 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.049
 after you do a swipe down to 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.049
 check that 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:12.840
 so you make a cash wipe 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.840
 dahlvig first came from civilians 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.460
 stop 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.599
 So here you do not 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.160
 verifications do me I do them 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.900
 but in fact it was not worth it 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.319
 do it and there it was done your 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.930
 phone and road and so that's all 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.090
 who is going to do you do reboot and you 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.569
 make a tidal wave that the system 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.410
 is your phone is on the go and 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.150
 nature to start the system 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.310
 the phone is rooted and you can 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.780
 now use apps for 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.500
 the phones voted you can 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.730
 also flashed custom roms so that I 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.530
 did not want to introduce but that's 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.600
 the same manipulation that has to do so 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.530
 no worries for that I tell you to very 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.400
 soon and that was not asking your 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.400
 questions it was flora
