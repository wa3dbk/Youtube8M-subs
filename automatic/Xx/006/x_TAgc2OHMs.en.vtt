to go in with the medium brown and start

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:53.380 
to go in with the medium brown and start

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.120 

I<00:01:53.770> like<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.920> go<00:01:55.040> pretty<00:01:55.250> light<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.030> front

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.730 

and<00:02:01.130> then<00:02:01.580> I<00:02:01.610> just<00:02:01.909> kind<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.150> create<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:03.260> shape

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
and then I just kind of create the shape

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.800 
and then I just kind of create the shape
that<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:03.979> want<00:02:04.100> for<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:04.940> bottom<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.420> brow

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.280 

then<00:02:08.810> I'm<00:02:09.289> going<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:10.039> go<00:02:10.550> in<00:02:10.900> and<00:02:12.459> fill<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.790> top

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
then I'm going to go in and fill the top

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.190 
then I'm going to go in and fill the top
now<00:02:15.290> obviously<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.770> can<00:02:15.830> tell<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.190> really

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
now obviously you can tell a really

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.410 
now obviously you can tell a really
really<00:02:18.340> exaggerated<00:02:19.340> drawing<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.970> top<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.300> it

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
really exaggerated drawing the top of it

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.320 
really exaggerated drawing the top of it
because<00:02:20.510> they<00:02:20.780> really<00:02:21.020> don't<00:02:21.110> have<00:02:21.320> any<00:02:21.560> hairs

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
because they really don't have any hairs

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.360 
because they really don't have any hairs
so<00:02:24.010> that's<00:02:25.010> what<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.250> do<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:26.980> might<00:02:27.980> not<00:02:28.190> need

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
so that's what I do you might not need

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.860 
so that's what I do you might not need
to<00:02:28.430> do<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:28.850> stuff<00:02:29.090> if<00:02:29.239> you've<00:02:29.360> got<00:02:29.510> nice<00:02:29.720> eye
