00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.029
 audi to the question asked 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.410
 the paris saint germain can it eliminate 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.530
 the barça yes or no 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.299
 yes yes it's true but if you have a 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.869
 debate if you think of the league there is there 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:25.880
 all have science infuses the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:27.000
 future foundation ali no ok greg yes 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.060
 fred 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.619
 yes there are three yes luis otherwise as a 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.640
 says one why this sense he did 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.590
 it's good it's good 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.079
 arguments now my arguments 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.719
 and football that's what he said 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.370
 that the the psg could beat the real of 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.940
 madrid remember I believe that in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.110
 we live both matches where we have 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.300
 matches that gives us great 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.030
 emotions because the psg's team 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.079
 the time was not that of today 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.730
 we agree 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.620
 thiago silva is the best 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.079
 best defender of the world at the time 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.149
 it was the Persian terry cardo like drinking 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.559
 and because alain rock was not there 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.059
 he was suspended real madrid you 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.470
 no, I'm talking to you about the country but it's 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.670
 the same because when you were fine 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.159
 time finally it's not dreaming we do not 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.409
 never looking betrayed guignotte had 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.920
 prosinecki tavéa morano you had hugo 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.270
 sanchez 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.100
 when you start quoting all 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.900
 real players from madrid had no 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.299
 photo dr there was no picture and 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.189
 yet we have lived in any case in 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.560
 France one of the highlights of 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.409
 football for you it's these are 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.880
 arguments that's what you already had 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.159
 say yes it's already to believe but 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.900
 because that's football 3 even me I 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.700
 think if such such a such 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.079
 craze tonight is because the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.640
 people they believe what is the question 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.140
 to see that the barça because they are 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.119
 already come this summer in a friendly match 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.590
 it can be this madness to the series that 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.640
 this champions league but me I think 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.409
 that people believe that she leaves 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.200
 so everyone agrees it's 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.000
 Barça is the best team has 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.229
 taught to the world you know how you 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.490
 how do you lose against the barça pass 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.940
 pass and when will it happen what that 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.190
 I'm fine I'll answer you 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.780
 you create a surprise it's you put your 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.030
 life where he waits for me quickly said no to the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.350
 read your arguments it would be that on a 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.120
 match I would say they can 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.000
 yes qualified Thursday on the problem it's 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:11.860
 that it's on two mornings disagree 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.860
 that he is who did not catch the question 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:28.280
 that's why I read they would 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:30.320
 by pascal gentleman so the range and 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.110
 that would be sure of match because 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.580
 myself I put 1 0 for the psg for 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.280
 tonight because I think at home 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.230
 they are able to beat Barcelona in 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.000
 making a big big game like talking 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.010
 so before you go because everyone 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.510
 is behind the psg compared to 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.610
 Barcelona is because we know 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.320
 that they can compete today what 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.780
 evening and like a real show 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.520
 then two teams so paris saint 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.860
 germain that must be 300% to be 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.360
 balanced against barcelona what does 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.120
 will not be the heart the comrade 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.860
 unfortunately at the return leg where there at 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.900
 home they are still very very 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.040
 impressive and paris is not yet 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.870
 completely made to 100% to be able to 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.830
 compete with the pg on two matches a 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.520
 little did you give your arguments 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.600
 olivier question for me the houses 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.709
 for you are just involved 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.360
 the more olive sites like when you 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.640
 know that we do not agree it's 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.800
 not because we agree with us 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.300
 go out to proceed what we have 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.340
 ranong of the psg team was not the 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.989
 even then to return the derricks of the 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.959
 louis yeah me to go back to that 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.910
 just said ali therefore I 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.320
 think that psg qualification can 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.350
 play this can be played on the match 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.330
 return to the qualities of the 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.880
 psg players ie relative to 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.690
 throughout the field of content 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.380
 and in relation to the offensive quality of the 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.080
 paris saint germain 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.680
 if I think if the psg gets to make a 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.480
 result 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.790
 where they lose no more than one goal of gap 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.650
 tonight qualification is possible 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.030
 for the psg at the return match because 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.910
 for you, frédéric le paris saint germain 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.930
 is able 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.940
 mark there since the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.500
 defense of the asean is not relative 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:16.100
 compared to the qualities 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:19.250
 offensive of psg the qualities of speed 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.239
 of percussion that players this 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.490
 psg team at 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.470
 and I think they can ask them 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.680
 a lot of problems on the match 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.680
 return
