00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.230
 Broke into FÃ¼rth in the field 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.589
 a smarter he from Unix 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.969
 the rotor in the future still a lot come to so-called Smart as today is that 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.770
 to plague a banner 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.630
 for days for Adobe Illustrator is the creation of large format Baghlan 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.980

 acquisitions 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.470
 and here is especially important 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.000
 easy to set bad markers 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 and things like lines 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.710
 Another highlight is the creation of overrunners 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.510
 This one needs, for example, at Euro, according to Sven below

 or leads, for example, Knowledge Line Mandy Haase Stretcher 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.010
 Living is that every handy round wood is still working around together 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.360
 that is relatively expensive 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.660
 to order manually and with these days really with basically one 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.660
 single click to accomplish

 I think that's ne pst-file is a PDF TPS whatever 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.990
 more important are fields

 The theme is again here in 30 times 20 centimeters in Factor One 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:53.320
 to ten 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.690
 then the hour work Smart Light in his Bonner so call the whole thing up

 Falk brands could Fini in Schleid brands 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.330

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.729
 Dyed ResMed black frame 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.799

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:23.289
 the evil and the distance 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.319

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.689
 be the additions and here to enter factors in the scaling 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.799

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.769
 and also across, it does not matter if it really does not matter 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.319
 give and become different 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.049
 the thing is prepared
