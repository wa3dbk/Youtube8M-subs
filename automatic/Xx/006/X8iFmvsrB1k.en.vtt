00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
I'm going to just give a little bit of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.170 
I'm going to just give a little bit of
glue<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.339> then<00:00:56.549> imma<00:00:56.699> take<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.909> to<00:00:56.970> this<00:00:57.059> one

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
glue and then imma take it to this one

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.700 
glue and then imma take it to this one
machine<00:00:57.479> and<00:00:57.720> add<00:00:57.809> some<00:00:57.989> quilting<00:00:58.409> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
machine and add some quilting to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.170 
machine and add some quilting to
incorporate<00:00:59.369> this<00:00:59.460> into<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> background

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
incorporate this into the background

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.049 
incorporate this into the background
then<00:01:01.170> I'm<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.530> take<00:01:01.610> make<00:01:02.610> some<00:01:02.790> leaves

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
then I'm going to take make some leaves

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.509 
then I'm going to take make some leaves
and<00:01:03.360> to<00:01:04.199> go<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.530> my<00:01:04.619> verse<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.129> nature's

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and to go all of my verse of nature's

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.820 
and to go all of my verse of nature's
first<00:01:05.880> green<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.420> gold<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.619> paint

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
first green is gold I'm going to paint

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.010 
first green is gold I'm going to paint
some<00:01:08.189> gold<00:01:08.430> shimmers<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.090> cut<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.870> some

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
some gold shimmers and cut out some

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.630 
some gold shimmers and cut out some
little<00:01:10.050> leaves<00:01:10.410> and<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:10.950> attach<00:01:11.190> those<00:01:11.430> down

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
little leaves and just attach those down

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.770 
little leaves and just attach those down
with<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> basic<00:01:12.660> stitch<00:01:14.300> so<00:01:15.300> anyway<00:01:15.480> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.750> my

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
with a basic stitch so anyway this is my

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.960 
with a basic stitch so anyway this is my
solution<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.830> finish<00:01:17.130> off<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.400> project<00:01:17.640> like

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
solution to finish off this project like

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.870 
solution to finish off this project like

I said so many times it's hard to
explain<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.390> you're<00:01:21.480> working<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.870> something

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
I get most of the pieces attached then

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.749 
I get most of the pieces attached then
I'm<00:02:08.099> gonna<00:02:08.190> take<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.580> sewing<00:02:08.640> machine

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
I'm gonna take it to the sewing machine

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.210 
I'm gonna take it to the sewing machine
just<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.360> did<00:02:09.420> before<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:11.009> some

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
just like I did before and just do some

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.640 
just like I did before and just do some
random<00:02:11.700> free<00:02:12.090> motion<00:02:12.269> stitching<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
random free motion stitching on it to

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.410 
random free motion stitching on it to
fill<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.900> all<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.050> blanks<00:02:16.080> spots<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:18.300> will

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
fill in all the blanks spots this will

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.670 
fill in all the blanks spots this will
just<00:02:18.450> kind<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.750> texturize<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.319> paper<00:02:19.530> a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
just kind of texturize the paper a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.400 
just kind of texturize the paper a
little<00:02:19.739> bit<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.299> I<00:02:21.299> think<00:02:22.049> I'm<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.290> end

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
little bit and I think I'm going to end

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.930 
little bit and I think I'm going to end
up<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:22.590> something<00:02:23.250> I'm<00:02:23.370> going<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.549> be<00:02:23.610> really

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
up with something I'm going to be really

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.729 
up with something I'm going to be really
excited<00:02:24.330> about<00:02:26.870> I'm<00:02:27.870> not<00:02:27.900> really<00:02:28.049> worrying<00:02:28.590> if

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
excited about I'm not really worrying if

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.039 
excited about I'm not really worrying if
this<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.040> perfect<00:02:29.519> this<00:02:30.239> is<00:02:30.330> just<00:02:30.510> very<00:02:30.690> very

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
this is perfect this is just very very

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.520 
this is perfect this is just very very
much<00:02:31.680> random<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.930> just<00:02:33.930> kind<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.110> building

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
much random and just kind of building

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.280 
much random and just kind of building
some<00:02:35.099> tree<00:02:35.280> branches<00:02:35.310> here<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:37.170> know

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
some tree branches here and you know

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.250 
some tree branches here and you know
nature<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.769> usually<00:02:38.220> very<00:02:38.430> random<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.480> things

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
nature is usually very random and things

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.580 
nature is usually very random and things
are<00:02:40.470> not<00:02:41.390> for<00:02:42.390> an<00:02:42.450> organic<00:02:42.780> look<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.319> can't<00:02:43.470> do

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
are not for an organic look you can't do

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.750 
are not for an organic look you can't do
too<00:02:43.709> much<00:02:43.739> planning<00:02:44.160> or<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.489> ends<00:02:44.610> up<00:02:44.730> looking

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
too much planning or it ends up looking

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.449 
too much planning or it ends up looking
like<00:02:45.390> you've<00:02:46.230> actually<00:02:46.709> cut<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.160> all<00:02:47.250> out<00:02:47.280> and

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
like you've actually cut it all out and

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.120 
like you've actually cut it all out and
planned<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.620> let's<00:02:49.620> see<00:02:51.920> okay<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:52.950> really

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
planned it so let's see okay I really

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.360

like that so I'm going to just trim a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.619 
like that so I'm going to just trim a
little<00:02:56.700> area<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.319> don't<00:02:58.319> like<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:59.569> so<00:03:00.569> I'm

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
little area here don't like this so I'm

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:01.970 
little area here don't like this so I'm
going<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.840> let<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.079> dry<00:03:01.349> then<00:03:01.650> I'll<00:03:01.739> take<00:03:01.920> you

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
to the Machine and with some probably

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.470 
to the Machine and with some probably
some<00:03:03.810> Brown<00:03:04.019> variegated<00:03:04.590> thread<00:03:05.329> go<00:03:06.329> ahead

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
some Brown variegated thread go ahead

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.780 
some Brown variegated thread go ahead
and<00:03:06.510> stitch<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.079> down<00:03:07.350> make<00:03:08.130> some<00:03:08.160> texture

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
and stitch this down make some texture

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.660 
and stitch this down make some texture
to<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:08.970> bark<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.829> then<00:03:10.829> I'll<00:03:11.160> cut<00:03:11.489> some

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
to the bark and then I'll cut some

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.890 
to the bark and then I'll cut some
leaves<00:03:11.880> out<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.269> I'll<00:03:12.329> come<00:03:12.480> back<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.720> show

you that okay I've gone ahead and sewn
down<00:03:19.440> my<00:03:20.040> tree<00:03:20.310> trunk<00:03:20.639> and<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.269> just<00:03:21.480> did<00:03:21.750> a

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
down my tree trunk and I just did a

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.289 
down my tree trunk and I just did a
brown<00:03:22.560> variegated<00:03:23.010> thread<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.700> just<00:03:24.150> did

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
brown variegated thread and just did

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.740 
brown variegated thread and just did
some<00:03:24.540> kind<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:25.019> random<00:03:25.470> bark<00:03:25.859> type<00:03:26.220> lines<00:03:26.750> just

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
some kind of random bark type lines just

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.110 
some kind of random bark type lines just
to<00:03:27.870> kind<00:03:28.079> of<00:03:28.139> hold<00:03:28.350> everything<00:03:28.590> together<00:03:29.120> then

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
perfect because it's just going to be

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.510 
perfect because it's just going to be
just<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.209> kind<00:04:20.389> of<00:04:20.449> random<00:04:21.070> you've<00:04:22.070> going<00:04:22.310> for

feel<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:27.100> these<00:04:28.100> aren't<00:04:28.280> showing<00:04:28.490> up<00:04:28.669> quite

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
feel and these aren't showing up quite

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.730 
feel and these aren't showing up quite
as<00:04:29.090> much<00:04:29.210> as<00:04:29.330> I<00:04:29.419> would<00:04:29.479> like<00:04:29.720> with<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.470> green

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
as much as I would like with the green

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.740 
as much as I would like with the green
so<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.370> may<00:04:31.580> take<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.850> little<00:04:32.030> bit<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.210> brain<00:04:32.479> pain

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
so I may take a little bit of brain pain

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.420 
so I may take a little bit of brain pain
in<00:04:32.990> touch<00:04:33.289> on<00:04:33.500> these<00:04:34.180> when<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.210> finish<00:04:36.430> one

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
in touch on these when I finish one

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.279 
in touch on these when I finish one
thing<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.729> am<00:04:37.850> thinking<00:04:38.180> about<00:04:38.539> as<00:04:38.690> I<00:04:38.840> i'm<00:04:39.110> not

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
thing I am thinking about as I i'm not

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.420 
thing I am thinking about as I i'm not
going<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.470> do<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.650> whole<00:04:39.889> lot<00:04:39.949> of<00:04:40.190> leaves

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
going to do a whole lot of leaves

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.430 
going to do a whole lot of leaves
because<00:04:41.120> it's<00:04:41.270> a<00:04:41.360> supposed<00:04:42.139> to<00:04:42.229> be<00:04:42.289> like<00:04:42.410> a

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
because it's a supposed to be like a

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.390 
because it's a supposed to be like a
spray<00:04:42.860> look<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:44.680> it's<00:04:45.680> like<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.889> first<00:04:46.100> lien

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
spray look and it's like the first lien

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.950 
spray look and it's like the first lien
so<00:04:46.669> doesn't<00:04:46.880> have<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.060> be<00:04:47.120> covered<00:04:47.419> with

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
so doesn't have to be covered with

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.900 
so doesn't have to be covered with
leaves<00:04:48.229> and<00:04:50.350> just<00:04:51.350> enough<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.740> kind<00:04:51.860> of<00:04:52.039> give

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
leaves and just enough to kind of give

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.150 
leaves and just enough to kind of give
the<00:04:53.030> impression<00:04:53.270> of<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.810> golden<00:04:54.139> leaves<00:04:54.350> so

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
well number one that's already in my

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.469 
well number one that's already in my
machine<00:05:29.599> and<00:05:30.050> also<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.760> brand<00:05:32.060> will<00:05:32.270> help

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
machine and also the brand will help

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:33.909 
machine and also the brand will help
make<00:05:32.720> the<00:05:32.900> leaves<00:05:33.110> stand<00:05:33.500> out<00:05:33.620> a<00:05:33.650> little<00:05:33.740> bit

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
make the leaves stand out a little bit

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.860 
make the leaves stand out a little bit
too<00:05:36.490> so<00:05:37.490> it's<00:05:37.580> going<00:05:37.699> to<00:05:37.760> keep<00:05:37.910> cutting<00:05:38.630> a<00:05:38.690> few

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
too so it's going to keep cutting a few

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:51.159 
too so it's going to keep cutting a few
more<00:05:38.990> leaves<00:05:39.260> and<00:05:45.460> just<00:05:46.460> add<00:05:46.639> these<00:05:46.820> on<00:05:50.169> I'm
