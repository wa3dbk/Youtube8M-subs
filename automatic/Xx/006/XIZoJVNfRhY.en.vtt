through<00:03:21.880> CIEE<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.920> thought<00:03:24.730> I'd<00:03:24.940> be

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
through CIEE and I thought I'd be

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.300 
through CIEE and I thought I'd be
meeting<00:03:25.240> up<00:03:25.510> with<00:03:25.540> some<00:03:25.870> AFS<00:03:26.380> students<00:03:26.800> but<00:03:27.040> I
