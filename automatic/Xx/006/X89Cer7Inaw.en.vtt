00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.570
 s hi everyone what I get 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.980
 video that's this time on the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.530
 sellers that is a medal is 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.780
 made by your dior is a you the 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:23.850
 find in neutral damage this tag 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.590
 corrosive electric and fire for me 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.870
 this machine gun is my little shot 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.390
 of heart beaded weapons so why 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.920
 first of all she has a 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.469
 ammo regeneration that not 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.239
 really huge but who is strong 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.489
 appreciable a Lent in which we 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.850
 gives unlimited ammunition for 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.469
 machine guns means that I let them go 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.409
 and the node sandbox and then I have this 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.170
 weapon I no longer use the sandbox good 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:51.870
 effect 15000 damage but good being 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.339
 given that I'm going in with a bayonet 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.859
 on me that's what takes him away from 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.260
 legacy say that some weapons have some 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.829
 prefixes will have prefixes not both 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.550
 of the dga of the firing rate of the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.750
 bayonet damage after there are some 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.390
 basic dps 1 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.580
 of course as well as durrrr challenge by 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.930
 against I have not 600 pts and dior we have a 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.660
 reload prefix to turn I 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.260
 think that for me it's huge we can 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.630
 recharge faster when you can 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.940
 to see when we reload the army 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.290
 balance and she falls on mm while 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.890
 continuing to shoot 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.360
 it's this weapon is just fusion of 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.740
 of a single ark say of a mode of 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.200
 legendary grenade which kicks 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.790
 if he wants and that's it then we'll talk a 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.890
 little more also of a standard which is also 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.080
 the 20h of a kiwifruit borderlands is not 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.420
 not a machine gun but a rifle 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.280
 assault which also him to a 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.710
 ammunition regeneration but world 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.540
 abandons in one year the artesians out 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.190
 canton reload them have not balanced 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.250
 did a reload like all 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.780
 the other weapons in borderlands 2 the 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.119
 in the shop reloading weapons 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.640
 dior that explodes have been added in 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.920
 bourdin in two it's true that you are 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.720
 outside I did not like them so much that 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.060
 it's going to calm lifehbacher I was really 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.209
 not fan but the avengers is my big 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.989
 what could I say 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.380
 disappointed a little by the gun jack up a 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.850
 game doubts that has a very weak 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.800
 that at two- thirds more lens I find 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.220
 ok world and I try it a little bit more 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.989
 see what really gives critically 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.239
 because in fact his road text ones 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.850
 who have their new strengths on them 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.140
 who is a gun period jacobs the 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.630
 text this red means he has a 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.940
 percentage of critical damage that is 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.950
 at 5 100 % which is still pretty 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.480
 huge 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.420
 from what I understood his tears 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.560
 jacob the more and more powerful the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.120
 player 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.310
 we see the most powerful of the game when 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.090
 you're one of the critical guys here by 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.830
 against if you are not a damage 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.319
 critics it's really the damage is 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.640
 really really blah 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.190
 so it's a year as usual I 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.410
 wanted them to ride on the boom utah 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.430
 legendary who are for me a good 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.680
 thing they would say they had 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.390
 add that but hey it's true that all 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.170
 closed it's a nice goal has gone through 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.269
 an entire area that pretty boring the world 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.280
 after 50 attempts we have a weapon 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.540
 perrier it's a little less to 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.940
 some boss like me doctor 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.380
 mercy during the finishing I have 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.810
 shit I even and I even failed 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.080
 give up infinity game of some 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.959
 arms 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.950
 that's it then I have the whole future the norm 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.810
 years later I 'll have our word name 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.209

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.970
 all these relics farm and where senna 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.590
 beautiful goal is legendary touquet 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.200

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.220
