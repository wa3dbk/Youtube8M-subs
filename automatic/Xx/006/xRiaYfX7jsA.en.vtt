down to the box below so you can follow

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.270 
down to the box below so you can follow
along<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.659> some<00:01:27.990> flour<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.590> case<00:01:28.799> so

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.900 

and<00:01:34.680> give<00:01:34.800> that<00:01:34.950> accurate<00:01:35.370> we<00:01:35.520> T<00:01:35.700> alpha

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
and give that accurate we T alpha

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.360 
and give that accurate we T alpha
silicon<00:01:36.210> light<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.870> fluffy<00:01:37.110> now<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:38.280> those

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
silicon light and fluffy now with those

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.880 
silicon light and fluffy now with those
pass<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.910> semi<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.630> break<00:01:39.960> them<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.350> I

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
pass that semi we can break them so I

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.260 
pass that semi we can break them so I
can<00:01:41.100> carrot<00:01:41.400> cake<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:41.700> do<00:01:41.820> exactly<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.240> same

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
