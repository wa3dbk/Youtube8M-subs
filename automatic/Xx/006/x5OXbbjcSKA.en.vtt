00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.299
 and now we will make coffee in turkish 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.630
 will use coffee production 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.390
 mehmet efendi is the most famous 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.630
 Turkish coffee 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:31.859
 premium segment per serving 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:38.399
 laying 7 grams is about one and a half 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:42.559
 two teaspoons of sugar put too immediately 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.239
 jacket so that later not 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.660
 stir sugar ready drinks and not 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.100
 raise the thick 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.670
 water is desirable to use 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.309
 bottled or filtered not 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.809
 hot room temperature either 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:10.860
 cold pour in the handle and put on 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:13.670
 fire ideal to make coffee on gas 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.670
 hob and 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.790
 process takes less time 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:28.710
 preferably use copper Turk in 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:35.510
 In this case, we cook in Turkish 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:40.350
 Turks another name for evil with her 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:45.050
 wide enough neck which 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:52.160
 promotes better foam formation 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.160
 than in the Turks with a narrow neck 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.450
 most often Turks with a narrow Russian 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.450
 produce it was russia 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:13.460
 coffee can be brewed in time from three to 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.710
 ten minutes depending on your 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.110
 of skills 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.420
 it is not desirable that coffee is brewed for a long time 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.420
 this case 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:30.910
 as a rule there is no foam and taste 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:36.020
 coffee suffers too 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:40.310
 reached some temperature at 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.560
 which the foam starts to rise but 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.140
 it's important to take a moment so she doesn't 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:51.800
 ran outside the Turks in order to 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:58.820
 this moment is desirable to catch constantly 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:01.720
 be near the chicken often 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.760
 making coffee in the morning 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.420
 we are trying to do several things 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.410
 simultaneously and distract from the process 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:16.520
 making coffee in this case he 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:20.530
 often runs away and we have to spend 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.530
 time to clean the stove 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:32.489
 important to catch during the moment of sunrise 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:35.349
 remove foam from the stove 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.709
 fool then put her again on 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:44.670
 plate and so repeat 2-3 times to 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.670
 foam went failed more thick 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.319
 we see that the stump is getting thicker 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.319
 and thicker 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:20.350
 standard portion which is cooked in 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:25.660
 turkey volume is 40 50 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:31.450
 milliliters in russia more often cook more 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:35.440
 a large portion of 140 160 milliliters in 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:38.970
 In this case, more coffee is obtained. 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.970
 but of lesser strength 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:27.970
 make coffee overflow neatly 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.970
 the possibility of retaining a thick skin 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:42.419
 as we see thanks to the correct 

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:45.229
 cooking technology we got 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.229
 good skin 

00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:50.329
 recommend trying
