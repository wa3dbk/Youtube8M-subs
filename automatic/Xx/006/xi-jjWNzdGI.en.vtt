00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 a memorable day for today 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.859
 appears two games of the same 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.600
 popular assassin's creed series 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.490
 while a part only for the new ones 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.019
 consoles and the pc appears power 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.849
 assassin's creed pressure once a 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.990
 trip to the playstation 3 and the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.880
 xbox 360 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.890
 whether it is worth the old ones for you 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.449
 We have to smash carrot again 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.310
 for you after many hours 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.109
 land and at sea found out 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.730
 in the role of shay comeback 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.230
 the gloomy episode and will be after 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.029
 an incident so violent 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.289
 traumatized that you join 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.460
 to take expensive hat and you the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.170
 to join templars 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.520
 a far-reaching venture is waiting 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.380
 but in the previous games of the series 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.510
 exclusively as an assassin on the way 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.340
 the very same Templar hunted and the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.079
 has brought distance yes you have right 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.520
 is one of the very thick ones 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.809
 Surprise that is the creed series 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.700
 the developers have for the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.620
 third part of the north america trilogy 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.969
 repealed the time as a sign of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.590
 Assassin is over for you 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.390
 instead made sympathetic 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.899
 main character hunting his former 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.579
 brothers 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.590
 But why is that? You have to 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.180
 after all , you are yourself 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.770
 still lord over your abilities and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.000
 climbs fight and sneaks you one 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.370
 away through the colorful history 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.170
 again your faithfulness 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.640
 sailing ship because who picks up at the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.150
 all fights are already wet 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.130
 feet 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.930
 This time you go on board in the morning 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.310
 makes the impressive sail more beautiful 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.960
 if that already at the beginning of a lot ago 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.909
 can from you in the further course of play 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.220
 but of course with all sorts of improvements 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.200
 A battering ram will be better equipped 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.900
 cannons and previous bullets are just one 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.369
 few upgrades should be made before 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.530
 it goes into the first sea battles 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.850
 it runs very badly hidden 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.619
 on the enemy ship one 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.579
 the assassin he comes to you on board 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.650
 can you ever go to one 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.970
 Setting a difficult dance differently 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.860
 as the normal flu run here 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.720
 by contrast again very fast 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.189
 and you decide for yourself 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.810
 the battles against the nimble and 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.579
 clever that they a real 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.259
 challenge as in the 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.909
 sharing previous is a good one 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.299
 prepare her already half the time 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.890
 rental fee 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.290
 your ship trips take you in 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.240
 large parts of the north Atlantic but also 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.220
 A detour to the Antarctic stands for 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.570
 Assassin's creed on the travel plan 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.280
 Print is his kinship to the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.840
 clearly to look at previous games 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.670
 especially at the sea battles below 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.130
 heresy in the woodlands if you 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.360
 one or the other the avu overtake that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.490
 but luckily also applies to the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.899
 again pretty pretty optics already 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.390
 To start with a great atmosphere 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.440
 spread when in the far off islands 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.880
 That was when the fog came in or rain 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.860
 ashore the sun through the dense 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.240
 leaves forest seems that has something 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.500
 Of course, the hunt is on 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.450
 different animals also one again 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.060
 major role because for improvement 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.800
 your equipment or the ship may 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.490
 It likes to be the one or the other 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.530
 his skin 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.060
 Hold on land and at sea so always 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.010
 the eyes open otherwise you will miss 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.140
 maybe the big one found one 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.640
 Freud is so sorry for others 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.650
 connoisseur of the series although usual fast 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.510
 get started and easily see 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.860
 but in the course of the game again with 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.020
 Leave the old control 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.640
 faced so often makes the play figure 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.990
 then not what she should and it happens 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.490
 more often that you are up against a wall 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.740
 even though this actually scrambles 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.330
 want to run smoothly if you want 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.920
 but they are also able to live with that 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.270
 small problems in the control 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.270
 Mechanics easily bearable
