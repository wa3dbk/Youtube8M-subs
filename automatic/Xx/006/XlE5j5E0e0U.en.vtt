00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 life is full at the moment I hope that 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:08.160
 it happens that one has to make an effort that 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.719
 prepare for that moment some that 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.330
 another way, because he always tries to be 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.620
 ready for when you get there 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.240
 really that moment where is the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.240
 moment for you to take advantage of it 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.170
 do not 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.690
 but before putting on the shirt I ask 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.600
 first for my family after me 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.850
 in my case I try always study a 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.989
 little forwards before this 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.989
 kind of playing against them 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.440
 above all because 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.660
 we have to be very good 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.460
 concentrated because you can spend something in 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.620
 the first one minute like in the 90th minute 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.790
 there is no soap and as much 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.970
 is the set of all attempts does not lead 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.410
 that pressure but enjoy the pressure 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.720
 then each one is prepared from a 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.110
 different way for me the rituals that 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.030
 do before games or since they help me 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.280
 I always tell myself the right boot first 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.370
 I always enter the field with my foot 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.520
 left a ritual I always carry my my 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.990
 shirt always the same my brother 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.770
 never goes to the bathroom in the middle of a match 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.770
 because it brings bad luck 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.140
 or who they will be but also 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.240
 extraterrestrial 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.950
 I debuted with Real Madrid in CÃ¡diz 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.680
 that was probably the most 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.990
 important of my career the connection 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:48.220
 vial in ipom cell or looking at what 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.220
 that he was going to pass by quoting the play 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.620
 we won 23 and I scored my teeth 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.810
 I do not lose control and when I entered the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.020
 Archery is a moment of relief 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.200
 of tranquility and change change in me 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.200
 lifetime 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.140
 very fast and from one second to another changes 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.450
 completely 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.640
 sergio ramos at the time of throwing the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.320
 penalty the last European Championship in 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.570
 semifinals against portugal comes a 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.030
 moment where I was going to score for good or 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.100
 for bad but I knew it was going to be for 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.040
 all life not with a full and you get to 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.610
 that level knows exactly what 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.450
 everyone is nervous about 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.450
 listen to your heart 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.209
 my heart is accelerating 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.010
 career 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.690
 incredible panenka 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.680
 untie the two we broke that sofa 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.349
 when you scored a goal it's important 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.549
 since they are tremendous and unique joy 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.549
 at the end every second counts
