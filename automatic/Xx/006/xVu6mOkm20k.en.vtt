actually there to feel the environment

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.399 
actually there to feel the environment
so<00:01:34.399> it<00:01:34.460> really<00:01:34.759> sets<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.210> mood<00:01:35.390> that<00:01:35.450> gets<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:36.020> a

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
little spooked well we kind of started

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:42.940 
little spooked well we kind of started
with<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.450> base<00:01:41.600> layout<00:01:41.869> of<00:01:42.080> Alcatraz<00:01:42.530> the

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
entire island we ended up roughing out

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.109 
entire island we ended up roughing out
in<00:01:45.530> kind<00:01:45.679> of<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.800> white<00:01:45.950> box<00:01:46.190> for<00:01:46.520> him<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.819> then

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
in kind of a white box for him and then

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.430 
in kind of a white box for him and then
figuring<00:01:47.360> out<00:01:47.509> what<00:01:47.630> play<00:01:47.780> spaces<00:01:48.020> we<00:01:48.229> wanted

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
figuring out what play spaces we wanted

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.389 
figuring out what play spaces we wanted
to<00:01:48.530> use<00:01:48.649> out<00:01:48.830> of<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:48.979> what<00:01:49.159> would<00:01:49.250> be<00:01:49.340> the

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
to use out of that what would be the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.160 
to use out of that what would be the
most<00:01:49.520> interesting<00:01:49.970> areas<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.630> play<00:01:50.840> in<00:01:51.020> and

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
most interesting areas to play in and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.719 
most interesting areas to play in and
the<00:01:51.380> connections<00:01:51.799> between<00:01:51.860> spaces<00:01:52.369> and

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
the connections between spaces and

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.219 
the connections between spaces and
spaces<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.450> public<00:01:53.720> doesn't<00:01:53.810> necessary

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
spaces that the public doesn't necessary

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.370 
spaces that the public doesn't necessary
to<00:01:54.530> go<00:01:54.619> into<00:01:55.810> we<00:01:56.810> really<00:01:57.020> did<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.170> lot<00:01:57.200> of

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
to go into we really did a lot of

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.960 
to go into we really did a lot of
pushing<00:01:57.679> to<00:01:57.920> really<00:01:58.490> enhance<00:01:58.610> that

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
pushing to really enhance that

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.940 
pushing to really enhance that
psychological<00:01:59.780> horror<00:01:59.990> aspect<00:02:00.649> that<00:02:00.799> we're

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
psychological horror aspect that we're

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.039 
psychological horror aspect that we're
really<00:02:01.190> looking<00:02:01.429> for<00:02:01.640> this<00:02:02.119> is<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.299> really<00:02:02.899> good

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
really looking for this is a really good

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.749 
really looking for this is a really good
opportunity<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.860> really<00:02:04.159> tell<00:02:04.369> something

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
opportunity to really tell something

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.820 
opportunity to really tell something
special<00:02:05.119> I<00:02:06.549> got<00:02:07.549> stuck

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.590 

this<00:02:11.830> time<00:02:12.040> around<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.430> feel<00:02:12.460> like<00:02:12.730> it's<00:02:13.420> been

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
this time around I feel like it's been

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.970 
this time around I feel like it's been
identified<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.290> there<00:02:14.350> are<00:02:14.590> these<00:02:14.770> side

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
identified that there are these side

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.170 
identified that there are these side

try to accomplish owl and the rest of

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.950 
try to accomplish owl and the rest of
the<00:02:18.580> group's<00:02:18.820> put<00:02:19.060> together<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.540> escape

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
the group's put together this escape

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.170 
the group's put together this escape
plan<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.920> point<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.400> get<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.820> parts

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
plan but the point is to get the parts

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.090 
plan but the point is to get the parts
and<00:02:22.450> assemble<00:02:23.020> this<00:02:23.140> plane<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:23.740> they<00:02:23.830> can<00:02:23.980> get

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
and assemble this plane so they can get

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.240 
and assemble this plane so they can get
off<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.730> island<00:02:25.320> we<00:02:26.320> did<00:02:26.470> something<00:02:26.800> new<00:02:27.070> for

it<00:04:30.300> turned<00:04:30.450> into<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.630> penitentiary<00:04:31.170> and<00:04:31.410> so<00:04:31.950> we

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
it turned into a penitentiary and so we

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.440 
it turned into a penitentiary and so we
had<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.220> kind<00:04:32.340> of<00:04:32.430> backstory<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.090> idea<00:04:33.390> that

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
had this kind of backstory the idea that

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.150 
had this kind of backstory the idea that
the<00:04:33.630> warden<00:04:34.050> would<00:04:34.350> have<00:04:34.440> collected<00:04:34.650> Civil

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
the warden would have collected Civil

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.280 
the warden would have collected Civil
War<00:04:35.340> reckoning<00:04:37.880> one<00:04:38.880> of<00:04:39.000> them<00:04:39.090> is<00:04:39.290> blundergat

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
War reckoning one of them is blundergat

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.200 
War reckoning one of them is blundergat
so<00:04:40.830> it's<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.070> fictional<00:04:41.430> referent<00:04:41.760> by<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.880> idea

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
so it's a fictional referent by the idea

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.430 
so it's a fictional referent by the idea
with<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:42.690> combination<00:04:42.960> between<00:04:43.290> a
