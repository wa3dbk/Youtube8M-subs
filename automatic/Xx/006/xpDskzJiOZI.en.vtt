00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.020
 together 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.970
 we had already seen the first installment of 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.880
 how to bring your dragon 'that became 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.810
 almost by surprise in the new franchise 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.080
 of prestige in force the opposite of 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.689
 your previous franchise is network is of 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.330
 is more heroic adult and more 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.510
 dramatic 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.510
 I think it was even a coincidence 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:46.030
 of gender and they ended up doing something more 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.430
 on his turn in the first installment a 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.980
 movie that was and not to be a surprise 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.710
 in which we expected another film of 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.420
 fantasy adventures 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.420
 and instead it was something more dramatic 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.250
 it was a pretty nice surprise and 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.560
 that ended up becoming the new 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.560
 franchise of 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.850
 the title of mimes that's why at the 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.850
 success of the first delivery 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:23.500
 in the second part we see continue with 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.140
 the plot of the life of the characters does not 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.670
 they want to change their character 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.090
 they want to change the tone of the movie 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.530
 but it adds a little more that they add 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.560
 the resources 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.689
 add new resources 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.130
 dramatic in fact what had to be 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.960
 they were going to make more sequels 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.230
 dramatic that the original study that 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.570
 it was precisely 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.790
 everybody left to see the date of 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.040
 delivery with the desire to see a 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.320
 story a little more dramatic than what 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.240
 they had done at the end of all 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.880
 ways here have not come to do that 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.790
 dramatism guajeros I have not seen it the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.680
 movie in itself that continues with 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.369
 its colors 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.650
 of comedy that had the original not me 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.390
 they just convinced the jokes that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.410
 they keep thinking that that's 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.430
 precisely what is left over is in this 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.420
 room the jokes of silly humor and the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.730
 American chuling phrases come in 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.010
 there are villages where they have pets 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.250
 Other ponies that have pet parrots 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.530
 and we dragons for god a 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.800
 dark fantasy story does not have 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.010
 fit couple 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.460
 On the other hand, they do not present us 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.450
 father d 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.010
 and lamadrid and here is not what is more 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.040
 the plot is good what 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:57.590
 and let's say those of direct tasting stories 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.590
 of some villains 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.650
 and the protagonist is involved in 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.570
 a war that continues where the two 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.760
 sides want to destroy each other 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.550
 only that here there are no oral ambiguities 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.710
 let's say those who can update 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.450
 They are good and those who want to end 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.120
 she are fake 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.040
 it is not does not have the dramatic tone of the 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.680
 princess so it does not have its quality 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.420
 argument anyway is a 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.150
 very entertaining movie and it's a 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.650
 season that is not slow down 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.650
 of the first next
