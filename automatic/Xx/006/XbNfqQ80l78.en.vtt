00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
okay this is the Newman here and this is

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.400 
okay this is the Newman here and this is
a<00:00:04.410> request<00:00:04.859> our<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.940> video<00:00:06.629> response<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:07.170> my

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
a request our a video response to my

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.549 
a request our a video response to my
video<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:07.950> made<00:00:08.130> about<00:00:08.990> my<00:00:09.990> dual<00:00:10.200> halo

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
video that I made about my dual halo

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.700 
video that I made about my dual halo
headlights<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.540> Mitsubishi<00:00:12.540> Eclipse<00:00:12.750> 2001

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
headlights for a Mitsubishi Eclipse 2001

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.700 
headlights for a Mitsubishi Eclipse 2001
and<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.000> probably<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:16.020> technique<00:00:16.560> in

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
and this is probably this technique in

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.130 
and this is probably this technique in
you<00:00:16.859> be<00:00:17.039> used<00:00:17.250> universally<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.750> some<00:00:18.900> cars

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
you be used universally for some cars

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.109 
you be used universally for some cars
there's<00:00:20.039> going<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.340> some<00:00:20.580> parts<00:00:20.850> where<00:00:21.000> you

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
there's going to be some parts where you

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.359 
there's going to be some parts where you
have<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.449> change<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.840> up<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.170> use<00:00:23.130> your<00:00:23.340> own

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
have to change it up and use your own

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.019 
have to change it up and use your own
innovative<00:00:24.269> voice<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:25.250> get<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.369> across<00:00:26.609> but

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
innovative voice to get it across but

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.790 
innovative voice to get it across but
this<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.599> basically<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> principle<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.740> I'll

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
this is basically the principle and I'll

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.070 
this is basically the principle and I'll
be<00:00:28.920> diagramming<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.670> basically<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.449> so

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
be diagramming it basically for you so

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.680 
be diagramming it basically for you so
anyone<00:00:31.320> can<00:00:31.529> follow<00:00:31.710> along<00:00:32.189> alright<00:00:32.910> first

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
anyone can follow along alright first

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.420 
anyone can follow along alright first
thing<00:00:33.930> you're<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.380> you're<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
thing you're going to do you're going to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.850 
thing you're going to do you're going to
get<00:00:35.579> your<00:00:36.149> head<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.079> little<00:00:37.200> headlights<00:00:37.590> over

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
get your head a little headlights over

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.280 
get your head a little headlights over
here<00:00:38.090> and<00:00:39.090> one<00:00:39.390> over<00:00:39.420> there<00:00:39.570> too<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.170> you're

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
here and one over there too so you're

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.799 
here and one over there too so you're
going<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> do<00:00:40.559> halo<00:00:40.829> ones<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.969> could<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.270> dual

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
going to do halo ones they could be dual

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.160 
going to do halo ones they could be dual
halo<00:00:43.110> or<00:00:43.260> whatever<00:00:43.789> anyway<00:00:44.989> what's<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.050> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
halo or whatever anyway what's going to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.680 
halo or whatever anyway what's going to
happen<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.680> they're<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> connect<00:00:47.850> with

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
happen is they're going to connect with

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.729 
happen is they're going to connect with
your<00:00:48.899> stock<00:00:49.850> stock<00:00:50.850> headlight<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.590> get

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
your stock stock headlight so you get

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.430 
your stock stock headlight so you get
here<00:00:53.360> lights<00:00:54.360> out<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.780> high<00:00:54.989> beam<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.320> your

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
here lights out your high beam in your

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.470 
here lights out your high beam in your
low<00:00:55.530> beam<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:57.000> basically

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
low beam that it's basically

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.250 
low beam that it's basically
plug-and-play

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
plug-and-play

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.220 
plug-and-play
I<00:00:58.289> put<00:00:59.250> an<00:00:59.430> HID<00:00:59.730> kit<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.050> kind

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
I put an HID kit in there so it's kind

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.119 
I put an HID kit in there so it's kind
of<00:01:01.320> more<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.219> less<00:01:03.530> figuring<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.100> I

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
of more or less figuring that out but I

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.320 
of more or less figuring that out but I
got<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.670> anyway

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
got that in anyway

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.560 
got that in anyway
well<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.170> want<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> know<00:01:07.500> how<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.570> halo

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
well you want to know how to do the halo

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.810 
well you want to know how to do the halo
get<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> halos<00:01:10.530> working<00:01:10.979> without<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.520> popper

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
get the halos working without the popper

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.120 
get the halos working without the popper
lights<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.180> because<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.840> don't<00:01:13.560> want<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:13.860> bumper

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
lights on because I don't want my bumper

lights on because I don't want my bumper
lights<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.760> when<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.119> my<00:01:15.210> halos<00:01:15.479> on

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
lights to be on when I have my halos on

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.859 
lights to be on when I have my halos on
that's<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> stupid<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.869> alright

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that's just kind of stupid so alright

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.469 
that's just kind of stupid so alright
you're<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.950> red<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.580> black<00:01:21.119> wire

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you're going to get a red and black wire

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.690 
you're going to get a red and black wire
coming<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> bottom<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.740> these<00:01:23.310> halo

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
coming out the bottom of these halo

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.390 
coming out the bottom of these halo
headlights<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.040> ran<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.720> black<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> red

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
headlights so I ran the black and red

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.380 
headlights so I ran the black and red
black<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.430> red<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.200> light<00:01:32.390> under

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
black and red one on this light under

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.670 
black and red one on this light under
here<00:01:33.780> under<00:01:34.100> this<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.259> could<00:01:37.380> take<00:01:37.590> out

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
here under this and you could take out

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.580 
here under this and you could take out
the<00:01:39.380> bolts<00:01:40.380> right<00:01:40.590> there<00:01:40.799> yeah<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.590> connect

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the bolts right there yeah and connect

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.980 
the bolts right there yeah and connect
it<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.040> red<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.369> black<00:01:44.520> wire<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
it with the red and black wire from this

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.800 
it with the red and black wire from this
one<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:47.399> then<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> grounded<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> black<00:01:48.570> wire

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
one and then I grounded the black wire

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.850 
one and then I grounded the black wire
right<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:49.399> it's<00:01:50.399> grounded<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.000> then<00:01:51.869> this

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
right here it's grounded and then this

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.340 
right here it's grounded and then this
is<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> part<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.909> lot<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.780> people<00:01:55.110> will

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
is the part that a lot of people will

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.600 
is the part that a lot of people will
look<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.969> ran<00:01:56.969> an<00:01:57.420> inline<00:01:57.840> fuse<00:01:58.140> from<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:59.310> slot

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
look I ran an inline fuse from this slot

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.969 
look I ran an inline fuse from this slot
right<00:01:59.640> here<00:02:00.590> right<00:02:01.590> here

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
right here right here

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.999 
right here right here
this<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.460> for<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> Mitsubishi<00:02:03.270> Eclipse<00:02:03.329> 2001<00:02:04.110> GT

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
this is for a Mitsubishi Eclipse 2001 GT

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.639 
this is for a Mitsubishi Eclipse 2001 GT
model<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.880> might<00:02:06.060> vary<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.990> you're

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
model so it might vary for you you're

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.089 
model so it might vary for you you're
going<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.039> use<00:02:08.160> some<00:02:09.080> power<00:02:10.099> power

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
going to have to use some power power

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.350 
going to have to use some power power
connectors<00:02:11.550> or<00:02:11.670> something<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.209> figure

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
connectors or something just to figure

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.300 
connectors or something just to figure
out

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
out

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.250 
out
where<00:02:13.970> your<00:02:14.090> power<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.420> coming<00:02:14.569> from<00:02:14.720> what

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
where your power is coming from what

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.089 
where your power is coming from what
what<00:02:16.099> fuse<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.620> want<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.860> make<00:02:18.950> sure

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
what fuse so you want to make sure

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.670 
what fuse so you want to make sure
there's<00:02:19.280> metal<00:02:19.700> in<00:02:19.880> there<00:02:20.500> those<00:02:21.500> are<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
there's metal in there those are the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.760 
there's metal in there those are the
conductor<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.400> get<00:02:22.670> electricity<00:02:23.150> and

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
conductor so you get electricity and

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.589 
conductor so you get electricity and
just<00:02:24.770> simple<00:02:25.099> you<00:02:25.489> know<00:02:25.580> testing<00:02:26.420> and

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
just simple you know testing and

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.170 
just simple you know testing and
figuring<00:02:26.930> out<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:28.209> plug<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.239> in<00:02:29.950> put<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.060> 20<00:02:32.060> amp

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
figuring out I plug that in put a 20 amp

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.890 
figuring out I plug that in put a 20 amp
fuse<00:02:32.510> or<00:02:32.690> 10<00:02:32.840> M<00:02:32.989> fuse<00:02:33.260> in<00:02:33.410> here<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:34.510> then<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.540> ran

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
fuse or 10 M fuse in here and then I ran

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.020 
fuse or 10 M fuse in here and then I ran
it<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.260> connected<00:02:37.160> both<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.489> red<00:02:37.670> wires<00:02:37.849> from

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
it to connected both the red wires from

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.199 
it to connected both the red wires from
this<00:02:38.510> headlight<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.860> had<00:02:40.040> like<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.459> put

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
this headlight and that had like and put

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.759 
this headlight and that had like and put
them<00:02:41.300> together<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.959> put<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:43.519> in<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.790> little<00:02:44.150> a

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
them together and put it in a little a

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.770 
them together and put it in a little a
tube<00:02:45.769> I<00:02:45.980> guess<00:02:46.130> like<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> conductor<00:02:47.390> tube<00:02:47.569> and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
tube I guess like a conductor tube and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.789 
tube I guess like a conductor tube and
then<00:02:49.120> taped<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.269> up<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.549> eliminates<00:02:53.799> if

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
then taped it up so that eliminates if

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.539 
then taped it up so that eliminates if
you're<00:02:54.980> using<00:02:55.310> another<00:02:55.459> car<00:02:56.049> just<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:58.430> know

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
you're using another car just you know

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.900 
you're using another car just you know
trial<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.239> error<00:02:59.390> trial<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.110> error<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.440> then

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
trial and error trial and error and then

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.280 
trial and error trial and error and then
you<00:03:01.910> know<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.060> should<00:03:02.420> be<00:03:02.450> able<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:02.900> there

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
you know you should be able to there

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.289 
you know you should be able to there
should<00:03:03.440> be<00:03:03.560> an<00:03:03.650> open<00:03:03.920> fuse<00:03:04.130> there<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.549> what

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
should be an open fuse there and what

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.660 
should be an open fuse there and what
really<00:03:05.450> happens<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.170> now<00:03:06.860> that<00:03:07.099> you<00:03:07.250> have<00:03:07.430> that

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
really happens is now that you have that

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.750 
really happens is now that you have that
installed<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:09.620> wires<00:03:09.860> from<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.519> one

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
installed and the wires from that one

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.050 
installed and the wires from that one
connecting<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:11.690> one<00:03:11.900> into<00:03:12.319> there<00:03:13.060> you

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
connecting that one into there you

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.710 
connecting that one into there you
should<00:03:14.269> be<00:03:14.420> able<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:16.060> not<00:03:17.060> have<00:03:17.209> your<00:03:17.329> bumpers

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
should be able to not have your bumpers

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.900 
should be able to not have your bumpers
on<00:03:17.900> your<00:03:18.410> bumper<00:03:18.620> lights<00:03:18.980> on<00:03:19.250> when<00:03:19.730> you're

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
on your bumper lights on when you're

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.140 
on your bumper lights on when you're
driving<00:03:20.660> around<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.250> will<00:03:22.430> be<00:03:22.519> taunted

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
driving around so this will be taunted

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.310 
driving around so this will be taunted
the<00:03:23.870> daytime<00:03:24.320> running<00:03:24.350> lights<00:03:24.890> which<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:25.970> a

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
the daytime running lights which is a

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.849 
the daytime running lights which is a
good<00:03:27.320> thing<00:03:27.350> I<00:03:27.650> guess<00:03:27.799> I<00:03:28.040> mean<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:29.420> know<00:03:29.510> I

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
good thing I guess I mean you know I

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.289 
good thing I guess I mean you know I
rather<00:03:30.859> have<00:03:31.069> them<00:03:31.160> on<00:03:31.280> full<00:03:31.579> time<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:32.060> just

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
rather have them on full time to just

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.539 
rather have them on full time to just
have<00:03:33.079> my<00:03:33.230> on<00:03:33.410> my<00:03:33.500> bumpers<00:03:33.829> around<00:03:34.040> so<00:03:34.280> I'll

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
have my on my bumpers around so I'll

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.509 
have my on my bumpers around so I'll
show<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.760> what<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.120> mean<00:03:36.130> so<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:38.090> fuse<00:03:39.519> only

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
show you what I mean so that fuse only

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.690 
show you what I mean so that fuse only
gets<00:03:40.730> power<00:03:40.970> once<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:41.870> turn<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:43.160> ignition<00:03:43.280> to

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
gets power once I turn the ignition to

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.560 
gets power once I turn the ignition to
my<00:03:43.850> car

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
my car

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.680

there<00:03:48.610> and<00:03:49.030> now<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:50.860> should<00:03:51.040> see<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:57.330> they

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
there and now you should see that they

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.060 
there and now you should see that they
are<00:03:58.450> they<00:03:58.930> are<00:03:58.960> on<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:02.440> bumper<00:04:02.740> lights<00:04:02.920> are

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
are they are on the bumper lights are

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.600 
are they are on the bumper lights are
not<00:04:03.220> on

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
not on

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.600 
not on
and<00:04:03.700> these<00:04:04.180> will<00:04:04.390> be<00:04:04.420> on<00:04:05.160> when<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.250> drive<00:04:06.460> the

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
and these will be on when you drive the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:25.110 
and these will be on when you drive the
car<00:04:08.820> so

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.540 

and<00:04:26.120> if<00:04:26.330> anyone<00:04:26.660> else<00:04:26.870> wants<00:04:27.169> a<00:04:27.199> video<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:28.130> have

and if anyone else wants a video I have

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.850 
and if anyone else wants a video I have
the<00:04:28.669> sub<00:04:28.910> in<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.150> back<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.930> I<00:04:30.020> ran<00:04:30.229> a<00:04:30.259> inline

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
the sub in the back and I ran a inline

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.010 
the sub in the back and I ran a inline
fuse<00:04:31.069> to<00:04:31.310> my<00:04:31.460> fuse<00:04:32.180> box<00:04:32.389> over<00:04:32.660> here

fuse to my fuse box over here

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.900 
fuse to my fuse box over here
I<00:04:33.050> didn't<00:04:33.410> wants<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.819> make<00:04:34.819> a<00:04:35.470> have<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.500> video

want but just me but basically 30 main
things<00:04:47.479> you<00:04:47.630> got<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:47.810> look<00:04:47.960> for<00:04:48.199> connecting

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
things you got to look for connecting

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.580 
things you got to look for connecting
the<00:04:49.039> lights<00:04:49.330> running<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.419> wires<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:51.110> getting

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
the lights running the wires and getting

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.379 
the lights running the wires and getting
a<00:04:51.650> fuse<00:04:51.889> open<00:04:52.930> once<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:54.110> do<00:04:54.289> that<00:04:54.560> it's<00:04:55.069> pretty

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
a fuse open once you do that it's pretty

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.600 
a fuse open once you do that it's pretty
simple<00:04:56.389> it's<00:04:56.630> not<00:04:57.259> that<00:04:57.680> hard<00:04:57.860> of<00:04:57.949> a<00:04:58.009> process<00:04:58.460> I

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
simple it's not that hard of a process I

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.930 
simple it's not that hard of a process I
think<00:04:58.930> it<00:04:59.930> could<00:05:00.110> be<00:05:00.229> completed<00:05:01.130> in<00:05:01.340> like<00:05:01.550> an

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
think it could be completed in like an

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.180 
think it could be completed in like an
hour<00:05:02.090> too<00:05:02.539> if<00:05:03.470> you<00:05:03.590> know<00:05:03.680> what<00:05:03.800> you're<00:05:03.919> doing

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
hour too if you know what you're doing

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.649 
hour too if you know what you're doing
so<00:05:04.789> again<00:05:05.650> inline<00:05:06.650> fuse<00:05:06.949> to<00:05:07.789> the<00:05:07.880> fuse<00:05:08.120> box<00:05:08.150> and

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659 
so again inline fuse to the fuse box and

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.730 
so again inline fuse to the fuse box and
I'd<00:05:09.169> any<00:05:09.889> fuse<00:05:10.370> box<00:05:10.810> that<00:05:11.810> has<00:05:11.930> an<00:05:12.050> open<00:05:12.319> plug<00:05:12.470> I

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
I'd any fuse box that has an open plug I

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.129 
I'd any fuse box that has an open plug I
don't<00:05:13.280> know<00:05:13.340> on<00:05:14.150> other<00:05:14.240> cars<00:05:14.539> where<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:14.840> is<00:05:14.960> it

place versa and connect the red wires to
the<00:05:26.900> inline<00:05:27.199> fuse<00:05:27.469> to<00:05:27.830> your<00:05:27.979> fuse<00:05:28.219> box<00:05:28.389> and<00:05:29.389> the

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
the inline fuse to your fuse box and the

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.409 
the inline fuse to your fuse box and the
black<00:05:29.690> wire<00:05:29.900> ground<00:05:30.289> it<00:05:31.060> so<00:05:32.060> when<00:05:32.330> the

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
black wire ground it so when the

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.629 
black wire ground it so when the
ignition<00:05:32.630> is<00:05:32.870> on<00:05:33.050> you'll<00:05:33.949> have<00:05:34.099> power<00:05:34.250> to<00:05:34.550> the

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
ignition is on you'll have power to the

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.480 
ignition is on you'll have power to the
Halos<00:05:35.169> once<00:05:36.169> off<00:05:36.380> you<00:05:36.680> won't<00:05:36.800> have<00:05:36.979> power<00:05:37.190> to

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
Halos once off you won't have power to

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.180 
Halos once off you won't have power to
the<00:05:37.580> Halos<00:05:37.940> so<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:39.259> know<00:05:39.349> it's<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.919> best<00:05:40.039> of

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
the Halos so you know it's the best of

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.820 
the Halos so you know it's the best of
both<00:05:40.250> worlds<00:05:40.639> there<00:05:40.960> all<00:05:41.960> right<00:05:42.110> this<00:05:42.650> is

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
both worlds there all right this is
