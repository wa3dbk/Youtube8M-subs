00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.060
 I can not say anything from the piece I'm in 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.650
 Basel 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.650
 should you do something here today at the first 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.230
 swiss colleagues hotel tells 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.170
 have short-term head 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.830
 short difficult i have basically 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.230
 wish to be made a lamb, I have 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.820
 The country relies on a smoked too with 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.510
 bamboo a well made curry sauce with 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.019
 bamboo with green tea was an idea we 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.120
 have discovered tested new travel 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.710
 to have 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.720
 Then we made an ice cream 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.089
 have the cocoons we have the curry 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.309
 Coconut and rice milk tied 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.449
 then the middle of the road has two 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.160
 water spinach limes build with it 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.199
 very very many things very many 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.710
 things that together I think very well 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.619
 the driver then have worked to 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.930
 textures lamb chop bamboo honey on 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.780
 the wooden board exactly and different 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.640
 Bud still a shock to the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.429
 barrel with rice and salt pepper and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.390
 green tea and the risky court was 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:23.100
 very green very easy and very easy 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.649
 graphic actually the amount of ingredients 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.940
 sounds a bit overloaded what 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.679
 very complex 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.760
 but that was not it 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.620
 because you all flavors 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.600
 once on the spoon had if you 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.240
 Eat how did you go about it 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.340
 or is it just your style of clothing yes 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.840
 it was not much more ingredient 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.920
 normal and have plates 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.200
 I just have to get a little bit 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.960
 you can brainstorm so many ideas and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.180
 a rousing noise of the ice girl 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.130
 The rice was tested by the Kremers, too 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.420
 always under well I do not have to 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.850
 spun on and I could 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.260
 always imagine everything together well 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.360
 and yet that's all one 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.460
 uniform color has is also better 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.610
 because you can combine more things yet 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.800
 Absolutely that helps a lot of hearty 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.760
