you're doing gives you the ability to
keep<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> consistent<00:01:04.680> pulse<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
keep a consistent pulse but in a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.660 
keep a consistent pulse but in a
different<00:01:06.510> way<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.619> within<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> body<00:01:08.400> as

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
different way in the within the body as

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
different way in the within the body as
opposed<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.240> keeping<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.930> where<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> music

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
opposed to keeping it where the music

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.080 
opposed to keeping it where the music
set<00:01:10.890> which<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.280> sometimes<00:01:11.400> get<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> way

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
set which can sometimes get in the way

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.510 
set which can sometimes get in the way
it's<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> cool<00:01:13.290> way<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.500> practice<00:01:13.770> man<00:01:14.250> well

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it's a cool way to practice man well

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.859 
it's a cool way to practice man well
let's<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
let's do that this is going to be a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
let's do that this is going to be a
little<00:01:15.990> different<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.009> vibration

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
little different it's it's a vibration

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.219 
little different it's it's a vibration
thing<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:18.479> set<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.810> where<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.110> can

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
thing so it's not set to where you can

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.870 
thing so it's not set to where you can
hear<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.619> fire<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.159> thing<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
hear but fire this thing up I'm going to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.399 
hear but fire this thing up I'm going to
hold<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.390> mic<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.689> see<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.290> can

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
hold it up to the mic and see if we can

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.140 
hold it up to the mic and see if we can
get<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.560> feel<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.100> at<00:01:23.220> least<00:01:23.280> maybe<00:01:23.909> it'll

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
get a feel for it at least maybe it'll

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.969 
get a feel for it at least maybe it'll
vibrate<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:24.750> something<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.770> touch

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
vibrate or something I'm going to touch

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.540
