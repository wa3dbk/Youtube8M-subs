you<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.939> way<00:00:24.810> too<00:00:24.869> much<00:00:25.289> time<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.920> level

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
you is way too much time for this level

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.820 
you is way too much time for this level
but<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.050> funny<00:00:28.260> little<00:00:28.410> thing<00:00:28.710> you

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
but it's just a funny little thing you

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.410 
but it's just a funny little thing you
can<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.130> they<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.519> lead<00:00:29.730> them<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.090> far<00:00:30.330> away

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
can do they just lead them so far away

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.389 
can do they just lead them so far away
from<00:00:30.599> everyone<00:00:30.960> else<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:32.219> actually

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
from everyone else and it actually

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.729 
from everyone else and it actually
screws<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.960> popping<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.530> some

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
screws up the the popping of some

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.430 
screws up the the popping of some
enemies<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.210> right<00:00:36.380> the<00:00:37.380> only

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
enemies if you do it just right the only

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
enemies if you do it just right the only
problem<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.910> he<00:00:39.059> walks<00:00:39.270> so

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
problem is with this is that he walks so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.840 
problem is with this is that he walks so
incredibly<00:00:40.260> slow<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.670> almost

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
incredibly slow that this is almost

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.119 
incredibly slow that this is almost
pointless<00:00:42.350> you're<00:00:43.350> probably<00:00:43.680> losing<00:00:43.890> more

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
pointless you're probably losing more

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.340 
pointless you're probably losing more
time<00:00:44.190> by<00:00:44.579> doing<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.030> than<00:00:45.360> anything<00:00:45.750> else

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
time by doing this than anything else

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.090 
time by doing this than anything else

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
have no other rooms we can go in because

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.070 
have no other rooms we can go in because

so really we have to go back to where we

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.399 
so really we have to go back to where we
started

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409

all<00:03:01.980> right<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:02.459> when<00:03:02.670> dealing<00:03:02.819> with<00:03:03.000> mala

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330

there's<00:03:03.659> really<00:03:04.310> two<00:03:05.310> ways<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.790> fighter<00:03:06.409> one

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
there's really two ways to fighter one

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.229 
there's really two ways to fighter one
is<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.739> go<00:03:07.860> toe-to-toe<00:03:08.069> with<00:03:08.370> her<00:03:08.610> one<00:03:09.090> is

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
is just to go toe-to-toe with her one is

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.490 
is just to go toe-to-toe with her one is
just<00:03:09.420> kind<00:03:09.629> of<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:10.110> muck<00:03:10.319> around<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.709> bit

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
just kind of to muck around a bit

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.710 
just kind of to muck around a bit
traditionally<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> better<00:03:13.799> option<00:03:14.129> is<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.489> go

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
traditionally the better option is to go

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.259 
traditionally the better option is to go
toe<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.750> toe<00:03:15.890> if<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.069> do<00:03:17.220> throw<00:03:17.519> any<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.120> your

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
toe to toe if you do throw any of your

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.600 
toe to toe if you do throw any of your
robot<00:03:18.660> partners<00:03:19.349> at<00:03:19.560> her<00:03:19.709> they<00:03:20.220> will<00:03:20.430> do

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
robot partners at her they will do

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.720 
robot partners at her they will do

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.339 
damage and you have to get rid of them
in<00:03:23.819> some<00:03:23.970> way<00:03:24.209> or<00:03:24.510> be<00:03:24.720> careful<00:03:25.080> with<00:03:25.170> them

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
in some way or be careful with them

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.670 
in some way or be careful with them
because<00:03:26.340> they<00:03:26.790> will<00:03:27.120> blow<00:03:27.690> up<00:03:27.870> or<00:03:28.230> shoot<00:03:28.530> you

both adder you've pretty much killed her
just<00:03:37.829> kind<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.069> loop<00:03:38.250> around<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.700> little<00:03:38.849> Oh

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
just kind of loop around a little Oh

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.770 
just kind of loop around a little Oh
the<00:03:41.160> only<00:03:41.310> problem<00:03:41.609> is<00:03:41.700> if<00:03:41.819> they<00:03:41.910> hit<00:03:42.120> her<00:03:42.239> they

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
the only problem is if they hit her they

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.140 
the only problem is if they hit her they
stay<00:03:43.019> alive<00:03:43.319> so<00:03:44.160> make<00:03:44.670> sure<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.819> throw<00:03:45.060> them

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
stay alive so make sure to throw them

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.979 
stay alive so make sure to throw them
into<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.329> wall<00:03:45.569> afterwards<00:03:50.480> she<00:03:51.480> will<00:03:51.629> also

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
into a wall afterwards she will also

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.599 
into a wall afterwards she will also
stand<00:03:52.170> directly<00:03:52.379> below<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.129> if<00:03:53.400> you're<00:03:53.519> just

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
short guess we're restarting again okay

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.230 
short guess we're restarting again okay
so<00:04:43.949> if<00:04:44.100> we're<00:04:44.220> gonna<00:04:44.310> go<00:04:44.460> toe<00:04:44.639> to<00:04:44.669> toe<00:04:44.790> with<00:04:44.910> her

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
so if we're gonna go toe to toe with her

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.520 
so if we're gonna go toe to toe with her
gonna<00:04:45.660> get<00:04:45.810> in<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:45.900> position<00:04:46.080> where<00:04:46.380> those

there's<00:06:35.039> one<00:06:35.220> in<00:06:35.340> each<00:06:35.550> of<00:06:35.580> the<00:06:36.000> rooms<00:06:36.240> that

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
there's one in each of the rooms that

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.560 
there's one in each of the rooms that
you<00:06:36.930> couldn't<00:06:37.229> get<00:06:37.320> into<00:06:37.440> earlier<00:06:38.389> you<00:06:39.389> know
