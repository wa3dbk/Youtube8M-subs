00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello i'm joel meyer i'll you 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.730
 show how to make two variants on 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.780
 the robot project with wheels 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.240
 use the prism patterns 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.980
 rectangular and hexagonal prism that 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.750
 can be found in the free document of the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.869
 previous video to build the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.410
 robot I will present you a 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.720
 first variant of the robot in this case 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.970
 if I shifted my head to one side of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.470
 body 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.970
 I will use buttons for 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.239
 represent the eyes and mouth of the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.829
 robot I will also used some 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.510
 buttons of different sizes and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.930
 different colors to represent a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.460
 control panel in my bag of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.649
 buttons I found buttons shaped 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.210
 pink leaf 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.489
 I'm going to stick them on both sides of 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.000
 robot face to represent the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.530
 ears I make a hole on the top 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.710
 of the head to be able to place a 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.480
 only antenna this time I take a 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.969
 piece of curepipe that I put in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.239
 circle and I stick it on top of the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.260
 hexagonal prism 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.070
 then I make holes to be able to 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.020
 place the arms I cut two pieces 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.560
 of curepipe that I fold in zigzag and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.360
 then I stick them in place for 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.920
 red and decided to use a cork 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.650
 of cork that I cut in four 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.880
 slices 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.180
 children need to ask for help from a 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.890
 adult to cut a plug for 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.670
 decorate the reds they place a button 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.380
 in the center of each slice then I 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.780
 glued wheel on both sides of the body 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.400
 of the robot 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.180
 be careful to align the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.560
 wheels so that the robot is straight 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.310
 I also want to add little ones 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.079
 robot reactors to represent the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.759
 reactors I have two small pieces of 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.490
 tubes I'm going to be surrounded by paper 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.190
 aluminum 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.810
 I stick each tube behind the robot 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.580
 to represent the flames coming out 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.700
 reactors I use two colors 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.930
 different from curepipe 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.670
 I could have also represented 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.300
 flames with tissue paper or 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.920
 colored cardboard for a second 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.760
 variant of the robot I use beads 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.470
 to represent the face of the robot in 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.790
 my treasure box I find great 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.660
 silver glitter that I'm going 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.250
 use as a beacon at the front of the robot 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.690
 and then I stick a piece of paper 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.690
 silvered as radiator grille 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.850
 this is obviously my interpretation 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.860
 but this time I decided to 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.340
 represent the arms with tongs to 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.320
 ends for each arm it takes a 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.450
 dhimmi curepipe and a smaller piece 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.070
 of curepipe 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.960
 not far from it ends I attach the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.810
 tip of curepipe or half curepipe for 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.400
 form a clamp 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.760
 I proceed in the same way for the other 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.390
 arm and then I stuck arms in place 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.040
 in front of robots I place again 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.490
 a single antenna on the top of the 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.160
 head 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.820
 it's a half curepipe ended by a 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.000
 circle for the reds had used 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.590
 corks of sparkling wine what is 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.940
 interesting with its plugs those who 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.380
 are notched 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.530
 it gives them a wheel look while 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.120
 ground to add something 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.890
 interestingly I stick a big 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.489
 silver sequins as hubcaps 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.430
 on each shower you go to me 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.110
 ask why do I stop plugging you 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.769
 reserve a little surprise with this 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.360
 robot I put some glue on the part 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.980
 lengthened each plug and I the 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.110
 glue on the rectangular prism in 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.580
 leaving the notched part 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.860
 the sides 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.820
 the other four corks will serve 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.230
 wheel for an additional trolley 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.040
 stick the plugs in the same way as 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.420
 for the robot you will find the boss 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.910
 of the cart in the document that 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.680
 accompany this video to mount the 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.750
 trolley must proceed from the same 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.940
 way that for the rectangular prism 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.750
 but the last phase of the prism remains 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.220
 open to attach the robot cart 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.780
 cut out a tab of paper from 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.200
 construction that you are sticking to and 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.180
 else you can then fill the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.550
 trolley of various objects in my case 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.940
 I decided to borrow lego from my 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:20.680
 son why not use the tongs 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.270
 before I make them stand and lego 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.480
 So here are two models of robots 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.220
 extra if you make 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.380
 robots send me your photos and I 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.030
 put your creations on my blog I 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.930
 am certain that you can produce 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.910
 unique and original creations for 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.650
 print the instructions illustrate the 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.729
 trolley boss click on the link 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.980
 under the video 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.960
 e 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.960
 and 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.960
 and
