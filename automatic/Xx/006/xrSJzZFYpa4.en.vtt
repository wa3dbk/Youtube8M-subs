nope all right so I do think that this
is<00:03:04.939> a<00:03:05.209> glitch<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.689> does<00:03:05.900> need<00:03:06.079> to<00:03:06.109> be<00:03:06.260> looked

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
is a glitch that does need to be looked

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.110 
is a glitch that does need to be looked
at<00:03:06.680> or<00:03:07.099> it's<00:03:07.579> not<00:03:07.879> a<00:03:07.939> glitch<00:03:08.299> and<00:03:09.760> enigma<00:03:10.760> just

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
at or it's not a glitch and enigma just

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.129 
at or it's not a glitch and enigma just
made<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.480> perfect<00:03:12.159> bat-trap<00:03:13.159> and<00:03:13.629> now<00:03:14.629> Batman

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
made the perfect bat-trap and now Batman

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.360 
made the perfect bat-trap and now Batman
has<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.680> sit<00:03:15.859> in<00:03:15.949> here<00:03:16.129> and<00:03:16.159> starve<00:03:18.190> which<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.340> a

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
has to sit in here and starve which is a

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.210 
has to sit in here and starve which is a
terrible<00:03:19.909> way<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.060> go<00:03:20.209> out<00:03:20.329> so<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:21.019> guess<00:03:22.010> that

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
terrible way to go out so I guess that

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.740 
terrible way to go out so I guess that
makes<00:03:22.459> enigma<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.090> most<00:03:23.389> evil<00:03:23.989> villain<00:03:24.439> in
