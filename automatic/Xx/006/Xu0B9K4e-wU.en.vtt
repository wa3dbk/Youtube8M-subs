00:00:00.062 --> 00:00:02.064
Pumpkin with shrimp

00:00:05.074 --> 00:00:09.268
Today I'm cooking mini pumpkins
stuffed with shrimp couscous

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.531
with some chopped parsley
that will taste delicious.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.651
Let's cook?

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.874
Let's cook 

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:28.240
I'll start by piercing the pumpkins
with a knife

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.211
then individually wrap them with
aluminum foil

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.394
and bake them at 200ÂºC
for 1h or 1h30

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.474
or until it's very soft.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.194
- In a preheated oven?
- Yes, always.

00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:46.845
While the pumpkins are baking,
I'll prepare half a cup of red quinoa.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.588
Wash the grains and add 
two cups of warm water

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.531
a pinch of salt, a very small 
chopped red onion

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.194
and a clove of garlic without
the small germ in the middle

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:02.190
chopped into small pieces.

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:05.336
1/2 cup red quinoa

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:06.337
1 red onion

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:07.880
1 garlic clove

00:01:10.708 --> 00:01:15.988
When you're chopping something,
place a wet cloth under the board.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.497
If you know why, comment below
and tell the other viewers.

00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:32.488
2 cups of warm water

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:33.405
Salt to taste

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.520
While the quinoa cooks,
I'll prepare the couscous too.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.885
Here is a cup of couscous

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.485
that I'll season with a tablespoon of
couscous flavoring

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.920
which is just some coriander, 
pepper, cumin and fennel.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.840
Just add a little of each, it's delicious.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.971
Or season it with the herbs or 
flavorings you like.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.240
And some salt.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.400
After mixing it all, cover with 
hot water for 7 minutes.

00:02:02.457 --> 00:02:05.760
Well, there's a lot happening, but
here's a summary.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.508
The pumpkins haven't
finished baking yet.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.674
The quinoa is cooking and
the couscous is here.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.702
It's already hydrated, it swelled nicely

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.434
it's ready to mix with all the rest.

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:21.897
Now, I'll grill 15 
medium-sized shrimps

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.068
These are already clean. Click
 here to learn how to clean them.

00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:34.434
It's a lot cheaper if you buy them whole
and clean them at home.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.680
I'll grill them in a very hot pan,
with some clarified butter

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.417
to give a little extra flavor.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:45.908
If you prefer, use any oil or regular butter.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.274
Add a bit of salt and pepper
 to the pan

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.051
and zest from a sicilian lemon.

00:03:03.565 --> 00:03:07.245
Now I'll mix the hydrated couscous
and the quinoa

00:03:07.371 --> 00:03:09.554
I think I'll need a larger pan, right?

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.668
It's kind of full.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.462
It's just lack of experience.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.365
Yes. I'm used to sweets, not savory.
Then this happens.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.782
Cut the shrimps into three pieces, but
leave some whole to decorate the pumpkin.

00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:33.660
Chop two small tomatoes 
into small pieces.

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:38.914
And mix some parsley, coriander and 
chives, finely chopped.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.605
If you're wondering what my method is,
this is a mother method.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.897
When you don't really know what you're
 doing, but it will taste great anyway.

00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:52.537
Yes, but, well. I'm not even
a mother, really.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.851
But I think it will work all the same.
Try it yourself.

00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:04.034
Remove the roasted pumpkin
from the aluminum foil.

00:04:04.057 --> 00:04:09.600
Cut the lid off and remove the
puree in the inside.

00:04:09.634 --> 00:04:11.850
It's not a puree, actually, but it
will become one.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.554
When you mash it.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.531
Anyway, you'll remove the
pulp from the pumpkin

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.177
and mash it to form a puree.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.485
It's easier if you use the aluminum
 foil that wrapped them

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.405
as a basis for holding the pumpkin.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.748
The aluminum prevents you from
burning yourself while you cut.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.937
Don't forget removing the seeds before
mashing the puree.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.685
Seeds in a puree aren't cool.
Do something else with them.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.771
- Like what?
- Like those seed chips, you know?

00:04:45.805 --> 00:04:47.085
Hm, do you know how to make them?

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.971
No. Are these too small for that?

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.765
To finish, I'll mix my puree with the couscous.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.382
Mix everything and try it.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.354
Add some salt or pepper if
you find necessary.

00:04:58.628 --> 00:05:00.708
Now I'll stuff my little pumpkins.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.348
And take them to the oven
just to heat them a little.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.445
If you want, grate some cheese on 
top, it's delicious as well.

00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:12.080
I'm exaggerated and I made a lot of filling.

00:05:12.114 --> 00:05:15.325
But there's a lot of people here,
and not so many pumpkins.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.005
A quarter of the recipe is OK
to fill the pumpkins.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.828
Or serve it as a side plate to
other dishes, like me.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.731
I hope you make this, because
I'm sure you'll love it.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.371
I'll see you next week with another 
delicious and healthy recipe. Bye!
