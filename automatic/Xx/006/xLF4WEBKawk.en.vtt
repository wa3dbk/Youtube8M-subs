00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
 we are in the bathroom layout 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:11.730
 set to drop to be done 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:13.639
 complete renovation of this room pvc wall 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.940
 by panels 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.890
 ceiling with lighting and floor laying 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.039
 tiles 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.529
 this bath will not change in 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.869
 further it will undergo restoration 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.149
 that is, the direction behind the wall is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.910
 restroom 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.590
 the finish of which I have already completed here 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.230
 a full finish was carried out 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.610
 room flooring 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:51.629
 wall finishing on exit panels and finish 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:57.410
 the ceiling with lights was also 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.410
 mounted forced ventilation and 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.350
 mounted a new toilet in which 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.720
 condition was this room you 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.680
 can watch at the end of the video in 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.100
 slide show 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.100
 a photo 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.490
 what condition is it in 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:28.220
 room and indeed this whole house 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:31.399
 which the German prisoners built with you 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:41.159
 see perfectly, that is, everything is showered 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:43.649
 here apparently not even 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.009
 used in the manufacture of cement 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.890
 solution 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:54.569
 as we have is just seeing it 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.610
 known that is first here i will 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:00.619
 make frame and on this frame 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.569
 I will mount 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:08.130
 PVC panel imitation under the ice 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:13.620
 The category of these dashboards are related to 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:17.760
 silent but one word is all 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:23.900
 neatly beautiful tile me 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:30.170
 already been done close to completion 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:32.910
 wall trim frame which I leveled 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.440
 here's how we see this example 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.090
 this plot is left 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.690
 close up from unearthly up above six 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.260
 centimeters this scene falls too 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.290
 accordingly, all these walls are also for me 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.280
 accounted for level with coloring radiance 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.280
 Guriko and time 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.650
 given plot 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:00.989
 there are some shine panels 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.480
 which I will now use in 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.489
 mounting the screen under the bath 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:16.950
 that is, your lesson turns out to be wasteless 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:19.140
 production is everything now I and I will do 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.980
 already mounted the screen under the lamp with 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.049
 access tags and made a way out 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.060
 investment pipe to connect to 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.859
 further washing machine while here 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.810
 put the stub so as not to leave 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.760
 by recording 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:39.720
 also installed a power outlet 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:42.150
 the same washing machine also 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.920
 I'm already ready and ceiling frame now 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.810
 I'll start to mount the ceiling itself with 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.810
 installation of spotlights 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.019
 finishing this room but completely 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.019
 completed 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.100
 I would like to draw attention to this 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.890
 wall panel category include 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.960
 Nicolas silent, that is, the place 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.790
 docking 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.890
 the connection of each subsequent panel is not 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.890
 visible and not conspicuous 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.050
 This is new in the construction markets 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.320
 materials by the way very good 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.560
 quality and rigidity class 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.350
 this type of panel is diverse 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:17.560
 ancient world in ocean themes and so 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:21.740
 Further, if we compare the two types of finishes 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.290
 walls of the bathroom tiles or wall 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.860
 panels of course the second option 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.730
 financially cheaper as 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.750
 material purchases and in cost 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.750
 finishing work 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:44.950
 the choice is always up to you 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.950
 meeting
