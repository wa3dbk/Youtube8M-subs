00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860

25 percent answered D very interesting

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:10.090 
25 percent answered D very interesting
okay<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.290> let's<00:03:01.680> let's<00:03:02.190> take<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> look<00:03:02.700> at<00:03:02.820> that

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.979 

so<00:03:11.100> let's<00:03:11.280> break<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.520> down<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:12.450> first<00:03:12.750> thing

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
so let's break it down the first thing

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.110 
so let's break it down the first thing
to<00:03:13.170> do<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.650> grab<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.459> highlighter<00:03:14.910> and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
to do is grab a highlighter and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.949 
to do is grab a highlighter and
highlight<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:16.230> matching<00:03:16.620> codes<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.959> because

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
highlight the matching codes and because

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.260 
highlight the matching codes and because
of<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.260> webinar<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.800> need<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.459> do<00:03:20.640> color

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
of this webinar I need to do color

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.360 
of this webinar I need to do color
coding<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.290> that's<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.650> made<00:03:22.770> me<00:03:22.920> think<00:03:23.160> of

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
coding so that's it made me think of

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.850 
coding so that's it made me think of
using<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:23.910> highlighter<00:03:24.270> and<00:03:24.830> what<00:03:25.830> I

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
using a highlighter and what I

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.000 
using a highlighter and what I
envisioned<00:03:26.489> was<00:03:26.870> uncapping<00:03:27.870> maybe<00:03:28.380> three<00:03:28.980> or

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
envisioned was uncapping maybe three or

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.350 
envisioned was uncapping maybe three or
four<00:03:29.130> different<00:03:29.400> colored<00:03:29.760> highlighters

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
four different colored highlighters

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.870 
four different colored highlighters
having<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:30.989> in<00:03:31.080> front<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.290> your<00:03:31.440> exam<00:03:32.430> grid<00:03:32.730> and

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
having it in front of your exam grid and

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.190 
having it in front of your exam grid and
just<00:03:33.060> grabbing<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.510> different<00:03:33.810> ones<00:03:33.959> to

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
just grabbing the different ones to

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.460 
just grabbing the different ones to
highlight<00:03:34.560> codes<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.550> match<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.380> one<00:03:37.380> of

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
highlight codes that match and one of

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.520 
highlight codes that match and one of
our<00:03:37.560> students<00:03:37.980> who<00:03:38.570> recently<00:03:39.570> took<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.080> CPC

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
our students who recently took the CPC

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.289 
our students who recently took the CPC
exam<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:41.220> passed<00:03:41.459> said<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.680> she<00:03:44.299> didn't

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
exam and passed said that she didn't

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.090 
exam and passed said that she didn't
feel<00:03:45.420> like<00:03:45.450> she<00:03:45.600> could<00:03:45.810> handle<00:03:46.019> switching<00:03:46.560> the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
feel like she could handle switching the

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.030 
feel like she could handle switching the
markers<00:03:47.519> so<00:03:48.390> what<00:03:49.049> she<00:03:49.260> did<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:49.799> really

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
markers so what she did and I really

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.979 
markers so what she did and I really
liked<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.580> wanted<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.850> share<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.269> was

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
liked this and wanted to share it was

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.360 
liked this and wanted to share it was
she<00:03:52.500> would<00:03:52.739> square<00:03:53.640> off<00:03:54.560> one<00:03:55.560> code<00:03:55.860> and<00:03:56.130> maybe

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
she would square off one code and maybe

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.580 
she would square off one code and maybe
use<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.580> trapezoid<00:03:57.239> for<00:03:57.540> another<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.049> an<00:03:58.140> oval

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
use a trapezoid for another and an oval

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.740 
use a trapezoid for another and an oval
for<00:03:58.830> another<00:03:59.160> so<00:03:59.459> just<00:04:00.000> with<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.269> pencil<00:04:00.630> or

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
for another so just with the pencil or

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.020 
for another so just with the pencil or
you<00:04:01.170> know<00:04:01.290> she<00:04:01.350> would<00:04:01.799> mark<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:02.610> up<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:03.000> that

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
you know she would mark it up so that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.210 
you know she would mark it up so that
they<00:04:03.299> look<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.780> same<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.200> Alicia<00:04:04.709> said<00:04:05.040> she

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
they look the same and Alicia said she

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.530 
they look the same and Alicia said she
kind<00:04:05.430> of<00:04:05.489> would<00:04:05.670> do<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.820> strikethrough

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
kind of would do a strikethrough

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.110 
kind of would do a strikethrough
on<00:04:07.040> ones<00:04:08.040> that<00:04:08.250> she<00:04:08.430> knew<00:04:08.580> she<00:04:08.610> didn't<00:04:08.880> have<00:04:08.940> to

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
on ones that she knew she didn't have to

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.640 
on ones that she knew she didn't have to
look<00:04:09.269> up<00:04:09.450> but<00:04:09.570> that<00:04:09.750> we're<00:04:09.870> okay<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:10.230> whatever

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
look up but that we're okay so whatever

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.949 
look up but that we're okay so whatever
system<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.310> come<00:04:11.519> up<00:04:11.640> with<00:04:11.670> just<00:04:12.090> some<00:04:12.690> things

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
system you come up with just some things

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.810 
system you come up with just some things
that<00:04:13.170> you<00:04:13.320> can<00:04:13.530> group<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:14.040> same<00:04:14.310> codes

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
that you can group the same codes

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.469 
that you can group the same codes
together<00:04:15.360> okay<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:16.769> for<00:04:17.430> for<00:04:17.790> my<00:04:17.910> illustration

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
together okay so for for my illustration

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.690 
together okay so for for my illustration
I'm<00:04:18.570> saying<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:19.109> know<00:04:19.200> use<00:04:19.380> highlighters<00:04:19.950> so

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
I'm saying you know use highlighters so

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.190 
I'm saying you know use highlighters so
in<00:04:21.030> looking<00:04:21.540> at<00:04:21.840> this<00:04:23.390> just<00:04:24.390> by<00:04:24.540> looking<00:04:24.930> at<00:04:25.080> it

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
in looking at this just by looking at it

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.170 
in looking at this just by looking at it
my<00:04:25.350> spidey<00:04:25.740> sense<00:04:26.070> is<00:04:26.340> saying<00:04:26.790> that<00:04:27.030> it's

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
my spidey sense is saying that it's

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.920 
my spidey sense is saying that it's
answer<00:04:27.570> C<00:04:27.810> which<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.410> lot<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:28.860> agreed<00:04:29.190> with

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
answer C which a lot of you agreed with

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.320 
answer C which a lot of you agreed with
obviously<00:04:30.930> 2<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.590> 8<00:04:31.800> 42<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.640> correct

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
obviously 2 to 8 42 is correct

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.050 
obviously 2 to 8 42 is correct
because<00:04:33.930> it's<00:04:34.080> in<00:04:34.200> every<00:04:34.590> single<00:04:34.800> answer<00:04:35.160> so

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
because it's in every single answer so

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.340 
because it's in every single answer so
you<00:04:36.120> don't<00:04:36.240> even<00:04:36.330> really<00:04:36.600> have<00:04:36.750> to<00:04:36.900> look<00:04:37.110> it<00:04:37.260> up

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
you don't even really have to look it up

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.600 
you don't even really have to look it up
okay

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
okay

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.240 
okay
so<00:04:39.419> since<00:04:39.690> I'm<00:04:39.870> kind<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.200> thinking<00:04:40.380> it's<00:04:40.650> it

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
so since I'm kind of thinking it's it

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.270 
so since I'm kind of thinking it's it
might<00:04:41.460> be<00:04:41.700> C<00:04:42.270> I<00:04:42.300> want<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.780> figure<00:04:42.990> out<00:04:43.110> if<00:04:43.560> the

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
might be C I want to figure out if the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.760 
might be C I want to figure out if the
two<00:04:44.490> oh<00:04:44.520> nine<00:04:44.640> three<00:04:45.270> eight<00:04:45.300> is<00:04:45.690> needed<00:04:46.500> or<00:04:46.620> not

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
two oh nine three eight is needed or not

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.329 
two oh nine three eight is needed or not
because<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.220> is<00:04:47.580> in

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:48.339 
because that is in

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:54.089 
because that is in
answer<00:04:48.939> a<00:04:49.179> and<00:04:49.449> C<00:04:50.019> so<00:04:51.539> if<00:04:52.539> it<00:04:52.719> is<00:04:52.949> then<00:04:53.949> I<00:04:54.069> can

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
answer a and C so if it is then I can

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.229 
answer a and C so if it is then I can
throw<00:04:54.459> out<00:04:54.609> B<00:04:54.759> and<00:04:54.909> D<00:04:55.059> and<00:04:55.889> if<00:04:56.889> it<00:04:57.009> isn't<00:04:57.549> then<00:04:58.029> I

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:58.239 
throw out B and D and if it isn't then I

00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:01.199 
throw out B and D and if it isn't then I
throw<00:04:58.539> out<00:04:58.569> a<00:04:59.019> and<00:04:59.679> C<00:05:00.009> I<00:05:00.279> hope<00:05:00.639> that's<00:05:00.849> making

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:01.209 
throw out a and C I hope that's making

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:03.499 
throw out a and C I hope that's making
sense<00:05:01.239> because<00:05:02.109> that's<00:05:02.289> really<00:05:02.619> the<00:05:02.739> goal<00:05:02.919> is

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
sense because that's really the goal is

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.569 
sense because that's really the goal is
process<00:05:04.509> elimination<00:05:05.199> you<00:05:05.559> want<00:05:05.829> to<00:05:05.979> throw

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:06.579 
process elimination you want to throw

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:09.749 
process elimination you want to throw
out<00:05:06.839> two<00:05:07.839> of<00:05:07.869> the<00:05:08.229> four<00:05:08.589> and<00:05:08.919> then<00:05:09.399> narrow<00:05:09.609> it

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
out two of the four and then narrow it

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.249 
out two of the four and then narrow it
down<00:05:09.819> to<00:05:09.939> the<00:05:10.089> two<00:05:10.389> and<00:05:10.689> figure<00:05:10.959> out<00:05:10.989> what<00:05:11.169> the

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
down to the two and figure out what the

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.249 
down to the two and figure out what the
difference<00:05:11.589> is<00:05:11.709> with<00:05:11.739> them<00:05:12.209> so<00:05:13.209> just<00:05:14.109> by<00:05:14.229> doing

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
difference is with them so just by doing

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.579 
difference is with them so just by doing
that<00:05:15.569> you<00:05:16.569> know<00:05:16.659> I<00:05:16.689> think<00:05:16.869> that<00:05:17.199> the<00:05:17.409> answer

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:17.589 
that you know I think that the answer

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:20.549 
that you know I think that the answer
you<00:05:18.099> know<00:05:18.459> is<00:05:18.669> is<00:05:18.999> C<00:05:19.329> now<00:05:19.569> I<00:05:19.599> don't<00:05:19.779> have<00:05:20.199> the

00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:20.559 
you know is is C now I don't have the

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:23.609 
you know is is C now I don't have the
question<00:05:21.159> okay<00:05:21.969> and<00:05:22.839> that<00:05:23.019> wasn't<00:05:23.349> the<00:05:23.439> point

00:05:23.609 --> 00:05:23.619 
question okay and that wasn't the point

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:25.350 
question okay and that wasn't the point
of<00:05:23.799> this<00:05:23.979> slide<00:05:24.129> it<00:05:24.459> was<00:05:24.549> just<00:05:24.759> to<00:05:24.879> show<00:05:25.119> how

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
of this slide it was just to show how

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.100 
of this slide it was just to show how
you<00:05:25.419> can<00:05:25.899> attack<00:05:26.709> a<00:05:27.039> multi<00:05:27.579> code<00:05:28.239> answer<00:05:28.869> on

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
you can attack a multi code answer on

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.649 
you can attack a multi code answer on
the<00:05:29.679> board<00:05:29.709> exam<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:30.489> since<00:05:31.059> the<00:05:31.149> majority<00:05:31.629> of

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:46.149 
you read the scenario well you just

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:48.619 
you read the scenario well you just
don't<00:05:46.269> have<00:05:46.449> time<00:05:46.659> to<00:05:46.839> do<00:05:46.959> that<00:05:47.079> anymore<00:05:47.319> okay

00:05:59.069 --> 00:05:59.079 
lot of them have these multi multi code

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:01.379 
lot of them have these multi multi code
answers<00:05:59.469> versus<00:06:00.279> just<00:06:00.549> one<00:06:00.789> code<00:06:01.089> in<00:06:01.269> each

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
answers versus just one code in each

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.169 
answers versus just one code in each
answer<00:06:01.869> which<00:06:02.860> you<00:06:03.009> can<00:06:03.189> which<00:06:03.610> you<00:06:03.669> can<00:06:03.969> then

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:04.179 
answer which you can which you can then

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:06.089 
answer which you can which you can then

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
look each of them up but in this case

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.909 
look each of them up but in this case
you<00:06:06.249> gotta<00:06:06.429> you<00:06:06.849> gotta<00:06:07.029> look<00:06:07.629> for<00:06:07.689> patterns<00:06:08.289> so

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
you gotta you gotta look for patterns so

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.649 
you gotta you gotta look for patterns so
you<00:06:08.949> can<00:06:09.249> figure<00:06:09.459> out<00:06:09.579> how<00:06:09.939> you<00:06:09.999> can<00:06:10.239> throw<00:06:10.479> out

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
you can figure out how you can throw out

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.829 
you can figure out how you can throw out
two<00:06:10.959> of<00:06:10.989> the<00:06:11.229> four<00:06:11.469> and<00:06:11.799> so<00:06:12.309> two<00:06:13.149> oh<00:06:13.179> nine<00:06:13.299> three

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:13.839 
two of the four and so two oh nine three

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:15.449 
two of the four and so two oh nine three
eight<00:06:13.869> became<00:06:14.409> a<00:06:14.439> critical<00:06:14.949> piece<00:06:15.099> I<00:06:15.249> could

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:15.459 
eight became a critical piece I could

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:16.829 
eight became a critical piece I could
have<00:06:15.549> just<00:06:15.729> as<00:06:15.909> easily<00:06:15.939> done<00:06:16.389> it<00:06:16.539> with<00:06:16.629> two<00:06:16.809> oh

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:16.839 
have just as easily done it with two oh

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.439 
have just as easily done it with two oh
nine<00:06:16.929> thirty<00:06:17.439> you<00:06:18.189> know<00:06:18.219> but<00:06:18.909> I<00:06:18.939> happen<00:06:19.389> to

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 
nine thirty you know but I happen to

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.399 
nine thirty you know but I happen to
pick<00:06:19.659> this<00:06:19.839> one<00:06:21.179> because<00:06:22.179> 209<00:06:22.869> thirty<00:06:23.110> was<00:06:23.289> the

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
pick this one because 209 thirty was the

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.319 
pick this one because 209 thirty was the
same<00:06:23.619> way<00:06:23.799> it<00:06:23.919> was<00:06:24.009> in<00:06:24.189> answer<00:06:24.459> a<00:06:24.639> and<00:06:24.789> C<00:06:25.149> but

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:25.329 
same way it was in answer a and C but

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:29.429 
same way it was in answer a and C but
not<00:06:25.509> B<00:06:25.689> and<00:06:25.809> D<00:06:25.979> okay<00:06:26.979> so<00:06:27.039> hopefully<00:06:27.419> that<00:06:28.439> will

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:29.439 
not B and D okay so hopefully that will

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:32.609 
not B and D okay so hopefully that will
