00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
screen unlike the nexus 7 the school you

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.040 
screen unlike the nexus 7 the school you
know<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:44.700> been<00:00:44.850> even<00:00:44.940> pressure<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.690> update

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050

the<00:00:46.170> screen<00:00:46.410> size<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> lot<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.460> tablets

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the screen size because a lot of tablets

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.819 
the screen size because a lot of tablets
now<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.270> bigger<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.170> instance<00:00:49.200> apple's

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
now are bigger like for instance apple's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.950

ipad<00:00:50.190> mini<00:00:50.520> now<00:00:51.180> i<00:00:51.210> think<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.510> next<00:00:51.809> state

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
ipad mini now i think the next state

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
ipad mini now i think the next state
will<00:00:52.199> ship<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.770> Android<00:00:53.219> L<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.940> would

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
will ship with Android L so I would

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.819 
will ship with Android L so I would
expect<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> tablet<00:00:55.170> lunch<00:00:55.350> around<00:00:55.530> the

november<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:11.580> december<00:01:11.729> i<00:01:12.299> think<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.720> will<00:01:12.840> be

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
november or december i think it will be

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.810 
november or december i think it will be
before<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:13.680> google<00:01:14.340> has<00:01:14.549> been

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
before then because google has been

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.219 
before then because google has been
wanting<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.180> keep<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.570> maybe<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.080> little

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
wanting to keep to maybe just a little

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.870 
wanting to keep to maybe just a little
bit<00:01:16.409> above<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.860> year<00:01:17.130> for<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> release<00:01:17.850> date

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
bit above a year for a release date

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.510 
bit above a year for a release date
cycle<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.900> Apple<00:01:19.259> does<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.830> their<00:01:20.009> tablets

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

there's<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.759> lot<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.970> things<00:01:27.210> school<00:01:27.420> could

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
there's a lot of things school could

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.840 
there's a lot of things school could
pack<00:01:28.020> into<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.439> upcoming<00:01:28.590> tablet<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.310> know<00:01:29.400> one

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
pack into the upcoming tablet I know one

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.969 
pack into the upcoming tablet I know one
of<00:01:29.880> them<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> 3d<00:01:30.750> camera<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.350> amazon<00:01:31.770> has

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
of them is a 3d camera like amazon has
