00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello internet friends today 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.680
 I will teach them to reveal what their 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.510
 decisions previously the good picture 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.700
 that is, the majority must be 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.799
 excited after she's 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.080
 excited you must understand what 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.699
 comes to be the art design that 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.039
 you can do it or have it done 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.570
 in this case I have a sheet I'm going to 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.250
 try this is not a paper canson 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.800
 gentlemen already 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.830
 do not get confused but it has been treated 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.559
 a soap 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.809
 so to speak printed directly not 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.790
 it can be easily revealed that's why it has 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.640
 been treated well now let's 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.070
 proceed more or less where we want that 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.950
 go our 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.140
 our design when it is a single design 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.480
 one color is no problem 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.329
 in how I'm going to put it if you put it 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.120
 a little bit later or something like that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.550
 there is not much problem because you can 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.510
 can fix but when they are two to 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.170
 three to four or five designs that are 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.890
 related and there they do have to put 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.890
 goods but in this case not 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.790
 they have to go to letters but it's not going to fall 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.630
 what they come to do 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.630
 The designs 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.470
 but they do not go that way either 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.750
 if we turn around so they have a lot 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.380
 Carefully place it well 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.970
 and to you 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.980
 Y 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.440
 and it looks good in a little guide to 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.040
 Marked out that will help me to 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.040
 central 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.530
 now like a duct tape 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.530
 I'm going to 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.659
 in the video tape we have already cut 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.909
 but we can not 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.909
 first they started with this little boy 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.300
 we put the side ribbons 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.990
 ready 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.990
 now this from here also to the side 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.220
 if they have not stuck it well 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.220
 it simply takes it off 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.769
 Y 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.190
 the same thing here try to center it well 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.260
 then simply do not stick the tapes 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.370
 two 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.849
 And if you want, you also want 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.959
 formulate a tape by themes of 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.959
 caution and is more 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.819
 Y 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.680
 and ready 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.969
 stand for example do not do everything very 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.969
 well just find out 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.590
 try to stick well 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:31.120
 and they always try to pull it so that 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.760
 be well washed 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.120
 to the mesh and we also put one for your 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.120
 home 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.860
 and said uncle love 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.920
 after having done this time that 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.920
 jaburi my designs 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.180
 well there is the design is how it should be 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.440
 leave because if we did it is stuck 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:01.180
 flipped and the design would not have come out 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.260
 well after that we put it in the 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.260
 stamping table 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.750
 I'm not going to use this iron 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.280
 is for other types of jobs 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.650
 when this is already here what are we going to 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.290
 to do is to turn it on but before all that 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.270
 you need a weight so you started to 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:25.310
 help art to stick with the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.790
 skin because because if I leave it 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.880
 so the design with the mesh will be a 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.100
 little separated and that can cause 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.040
 do not leave 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.710
 so I'm going to place 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.139
 that's 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:46.740
 this glass and advanced 10 kilos 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.319
 enough weight if you realize it myself 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.879
 this part of here so by which 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.949
 I would be putting weight here because I do not 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.279
 serves here we should put the weight 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.279
 so 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:04.590
 weight here and here a little more weight 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.990
 the time for this kind of museum that I 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.470
 I have is the classic evolution of 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.140
 ammunition the micro-mats are 44 minutes 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.760
 the time may vary, it depends on 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.530
 how you prepared the emulsion but 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.940
 that's the standard time now what 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.940
 I'm going to do is just turn on 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.300
 and we hope what comes to do 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.130
 four minutes gentlemen by subjects of 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.990
 this time I will accelerate it 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.990
 ya sir I hope 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.050
 would have to see the final work how 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.650
 is going to be that of them 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.030
 it's been about 4 minutes now 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.810
 what I have to do is simply 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.800
 turn it off 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.800
 and remove the weight 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.260
 withdraw the weight 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.490
 and gentlemen 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.490
 as it is revealed
