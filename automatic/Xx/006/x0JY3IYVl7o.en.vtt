00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
a max line right here you just tilt it

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.490 
a max line right here you just tilt it
like<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.939> water<00:01:54.299> goes<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:54.869> so

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
I picked a vanilla macchiato we'll see

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.870 
I picked a vanilla macchiato we'll see
if<00:02:23.350> this<00:02:23.470> actually<00:02:23.680> makes<00:02:24.130> coffee<00:02:24.400> or<00:02:24.700> if<00:02:24.760> it's

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
if this actually makes coffee or if it's

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.490 
if this actually makes coffee or if it's
just<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.180> heated<00:02:25.630> milk

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
just the heated milk

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.760 
just the heated milk
we'll<00:02:26.800> find<00:02:27.010> out<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:27.340> levers<00:02:28.090> up<00:02:28.590> slide<00:02:29.590> the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
we'll find out so levers up slide the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.070 
we'll find out so levers up slide the
tray<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.420> close<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.570> down<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.810> can<00:02:31.900> hear<00:02:31.990> it

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
tray in close it down you can hear it

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.900 
tray in close it down you can hear it
puncture<00:02:32.910> turn<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.330> power<00:02:34.570> on<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.320> button

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
puncture turn the power on the button

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.970 
puncture turn the power on the button
turns<00:02:36.910> red<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.510> believe<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.960> turns<00:02:38.170> green<00:02:38.590> when

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
turns red I believe it turns green when

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.970 
turns red I believe it turns green when
it's<00:02:39.160> all<00:02:39.400> set<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.180> ready<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:40.450> go<00:02:40.710> okay<00:02:41.710> so

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
it's all set and ready to go okay so

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.120 
it's all set and ready to go okay so
here<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.370> can<00:02:42.490> see<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:43.650> amount<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.830> water

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
here you can see the amount of water

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.620 
here you can see the amount of water
indicator<00:02:45.790> on<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.060> front

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
indicator on the front

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.230 
indicator on the front
I<00:02:47.490> believe<00:02:48.490> it<00:02:48.640> increases<00:02:49.150> as<00:02:49.330> well<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:51.240> just

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
I believe it increases as well to just

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.300 
I believe it increases as well to just
play<00:02:52.510> temperature<00:02:53.170> readiness<00:02:53.770> I'm<00:02:54.040> not

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
little pods you can actually see the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.690 
little pods you can actually see the
recommended<00:03:01.440> water<00:03:02.440> level<00:03:02.890> because<00:03:03.490> that's

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
recommended water level because that's

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.070

what<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.390> okay<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.260> now<00:03:05.560> it's<00:03:06.750> yeah<00:03:07.750> that

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
what it okay so now it's yeah that

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.950 
what it okay so now it's yeah that
initial<00:03:08.500> little<00:03:09.060> sort<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.120> increasing<00:03:10.750> bar
