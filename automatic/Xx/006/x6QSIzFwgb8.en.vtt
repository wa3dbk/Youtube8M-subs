00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.280 
for me no button pressing or Nothing the
mics<00:02:00.000> installed<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.630> little<00:02:00.869> chip<00:02:01.079> right

definitely think the mic is a really

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.620 
definitely think the mic is a really
good<00:02:05.399> addition<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.090> headphone<00:02:06.450> as

good addition to this headphone as

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.210 
good addition to this headphone as

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
definitely worth paying the twenty bucks

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.910 
definitely worth paying the twenty bucks
extra<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.000> plus<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.780> some<00:02:10.319> summer

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920

a<00:02:10.950> switch<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.790> track<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.180> stuff<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.630> may

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
a switch is on track and stuff you may

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.850 
a switch is on track and stuff you may
think<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.290> be<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> better<00:02:13.620> alternative

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
think that that be a better alternative

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.890 
think that that be a better alternative
but<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.910> think<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.330> really<00:02:15.450> convenient

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
but I think this is really convenient

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.000 
but I think this is really convenient
because<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.349> have<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.650> right<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.980> your

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
because you just have it right in your

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.650 
because you just have it right in your
neck<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.610> if<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.060> just<00:02:18.239> want<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.420> use<00:02:18.480> them

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
neck and if you just want to use them

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.930 
neck and if you just want to use them
like<00:02:18.780> feature<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.830> if<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.130> have<00:02:20.250> maybe

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940

automatically stopped working after
using<00:03:48.299> it<00:03:48.420> for<00:03:48.569> about<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.780> month<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.620> right<00:03:49.799> ear

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
using it for about a month the right ear

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.410 
using it for about a month the right ear
piece<00:03:50.340> just<00:03:50.519> stopped<00:03:50.700> working<00:03:50.880> which<00:03:51.209> is<00:03:51.360> the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
piece just stopped working which is the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.300 
piece just stopped working which is the
flow<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.660> these<00:03:51.870> headphones<00:03:52.049> so<00:03:52.920> that's<00:03:53.250> the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
flow of these headphones so that's the

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.190 
flow of these headphones so that's the
bad<00:03:53.519> thing<00:03:53.549> but<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.299> base<00:03:54.510> on<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.930> really

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
bad thing but the base on is a really

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.320 
bad thing but the base on is a really
good<00:03:55.349> i<00:03:55.410> think<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.739> wood<00:03:55.950> around<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.150> ear

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
good i think the wood around the ear

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.699 
good i think the wood around the ear
piece<00:03:57.510> makes<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:57.930> gives<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.349> really<00:03:58.470> good

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
piece makes it gives it a really good

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.860 
piece makes it gives it a really good
base<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.220> overall<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.330> sound<00:04:00.540> card<00:04:00.690> is

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
base and overall the sound card is

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.050 
base and overall the sound card is
really<00:04:01.110> good<00:04:01.260> when<00:04:01.530> both<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.250> them<00:04:02.370> work<00:04:02.610> but

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
really good when both of them work but

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.949 
really good when both of them work but
for<00:04:03.299> me<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.630> left<00:04:03.870> one<00:04:04.049> only<00:04:04.349> works<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:05.549> i

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
for me the left one only works so i

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.330 
for me the left one only works so i
don't<00:04:06.959> know<00:04:07.049> if<00:04:07.260> it's<00:04:07.440> really<00:04:07.650> worth<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:08.160> I

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
don't know if it's really worth it I

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.800 
don't know if it's really worth it I
don't<00:04:08.579> know<00:04:08.640> if<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.820> want<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.090> spend<00:04:09.299> 50<00:04:09.600> bucks

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
don't know if you want to spend 50 bucks

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.360 
don't know if you want to spend 50 bucks
and<00:04:09.959> just<00:04:10.109> risk<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:10.590> not<00:04:10.650> working<00:04:11.190> sometimes

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
and just risk it not working sometimes

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.949 
and just risk it not working sometimes
because<00:04:11.820> for<00:04:12.000> me<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.329> didn't<00:04:12.750> really<00:04:12.840> work

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
because for me it didn't really work

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.199 
because for me it didn't really work
maybe<00:04:13.380> my<00:04:13.620> little<00:04:13.680> defective<00:04:14.310> unit<00:04:14.640> I<00:04:14.790> don't
