00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
has three different what can I call it

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.990 
has three different what can I call it
like<00:03:18.030> little<00:03:18.329> levels<00:03:19.229> the<00:03:19.739> first<00:03:19.769> one<00:03:20.280> it's

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
like little levels the first one it's

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.050 
like little levels the first one it's
the<00:03:21.269> biggest<00:03:21.690> one<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.769> second<00:03:23.250> one<00:03:23.400> medium

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
the biggest one the second one medium

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.270 
the biggest one the second one medium
and<00:03:24.599> that<00:03:25.199> the<00:03:25.319> third<00:03:25.500> one<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.889> the<00:03:25.979> smallest

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
and that the third one is the smallest

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.640 
and that the third one is the smallest
but<00:03:26.699> I<00:03:27.000> think<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.599> can<00:03:27.750> put<00:03:27.930> like<00:03:28.049> silverware

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
but I think you can put like silverware

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.439 
but I think you can put like silverware
in<00:03:28.829> there<00:03:29.090> yeah<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.479> there<00:03:30.689> is<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.500> dishwasher

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
right next to the dishwasher is this

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.159 
right next to the dishwasher is this

like little storage cubby you would

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.020

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
shelves because most kitchens don't have

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.659
