00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.170
 and you want to create your own comic book you want 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.390
 convert a photograph to an image in 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.349
 another drawing effect has been reached 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.730
 perfect site 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.220
 I am fernandez shows and I give you the 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.660
 Welcome to jane basic course in 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.550
 this new delivery we are going to create 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.100
 different visual effects quite 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.220
 cool what it allows is to convert a 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.070
 real image in different images of 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.620
 comic strip freehand drawing of waxes 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.059
 etcetera and they are different ways of 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.010
 do it what we're going to see here 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.020
 we have a photograph as we have 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.239
 converted and here we have another example 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.559
 as for that one landscape we see how it 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.600
 we have also applied an effect of 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.789
 Canvas that seems more than a comic 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.829
 it looks like a freehand drawing and over 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.600
 painted in oil in a box the truth 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.910
 is that this kind of effect is fantastic 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.050
 it's a little bit complicated 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.660
 little bit of the level and it's just 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.940
 adding and creating layers so we 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.220
 we put to work we open the jean 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.690
 and we select the image from which 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.060
 we want to leave and I will use the 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.130
 landscape image fix yota east 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.110
 error or this warning is simply 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.070
 that you need to perform a conversion of 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.250
 colors 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.200
 original image to the rgb system always 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.240
 that asks and is going to modify the jim 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.710
 letten and will be converted without any 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.840
 kind of problem very well here we have 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.670
 the image to be able to clarify not us 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.280
 we are going to handle a lot on the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.510
 layer tab so this layer that 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.580
 It has a very strange name 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.410
 I will put original so we know 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.630
 which is the original layer that we're going to 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.880
 make many copies and we will give 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.979
 the duplicate option to create a copy 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.290
 right up this copy we're going to 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.330
 call black and white and now you're going to 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.460
 understand why selecting that 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.619
 very important layer we are going to give to 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.180
 colors and threshold 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.649
 then you will see how we have here 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.200
 a little window that will allow us 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.750
 convert to black and white scale 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.880
 our photography I advise that the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.080
 edge of the white leave it at the end of the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.000
 all because if I ran it towards the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.649
 left to see we are removing many 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.870
 white whites we turn to 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.970
 up and the blacks and we can move 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.620
 towards our whim you see the more 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.910
 for less less black the more 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.950
 let's go up 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.019
 black tonality masses I will leave a 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.209
 little intermediate once you finish there 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.950
 we give it to accept very well now we go 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.129
 to create another new layer we're going 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.379
 original we are going to give you to duplicate the 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.390
 we drag up we click and 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.540
 we drag and drop we will change 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.030
 the name and we're going to call it pencil like that 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.390
 that we are going to give filters to detect 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.819
 edges and difference of gauss and gas here 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.200
 I advise you to take a position that 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.120
 You understand the drawing I spike and 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.430
 I drag to leave it for example here 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.500
 fix as the pencil effect is 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.630
 very fine I advise that the effect of 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.220
 the more and more thicker the more 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.380
 thick then the effect will be more 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.870
 comic we have the radius 1 then set 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.150
 how can we increase it and increase it 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.130
 You see the thickness of the radius of 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.989
 2 we also take to prove large values 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.549
 is more blurred but the effect 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.959
 it starts interesting yet but we 're going 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:15.260
 lower it by 60 and I always advise that the 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.180
 radio 2 is roughly half of the 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.620
 radio 1 is valid for the effect 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.239
 pretty cool now we can by the 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.620
 image and see how that effect would look 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.090
 pencil so this is if you want what 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.560
 we can fine tune a little by lowering a 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.180
 I'm going to leave it that way because the 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.220
 truth is that as you play what 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.440
 I can stop a thousand different ways like this 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.460
 I like it so I give it to ok once 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.740
 finish processing it 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.960
 you see what has caused this is already 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.270
 effect here we are going to change it to 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.770
 black and white so selecting 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.430
 this pencil layer that we already have 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.050
 selected we go to colors and threshold and 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.340
 let's do something like white 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.070
 you can see that we can drag it 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.510
 down and black we can climb it 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.010
 we can go up until more or less 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.200
 distinguish something if we have not done anything 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.610
 so that a little bit scary you see why 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.170
 the effect that I have given him has been 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.120
 too intense but hey it's not going to 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.880
 to be nothing bad we leave it yourself and 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.770
 accept now let's join the layer of 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.930
 pencil with the black and white layer and 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.490
 for it by selecting the pencil layer 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.480
 we are going to give in a normal way to multiply 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.570
 finally I'm going to hit the right button 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.220
 on the pencil layer and combine towards 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.989
 down we have combined the white layer 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.239
 and black and fixed what cooler effect 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.610
 well now we will give color to 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.740
 our comic drawing our drawing to 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.650
 raised hand etc. we selected the 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.210
 original layer and we duplicated it and not the 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.750
 we drag up and we're going to 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.790
 choose in this layer let's color 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.440
 we select in color type mode 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.930
 very well that what happened that was the same 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.210
 do not worry because because the white 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.440
 and black we have to soften or 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.790
 tint the levels 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.210
 now selecting the white layer and 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.250
 black we 're going to go to colors and levels 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.800
 and now set as the output levels 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.380
 that we have them here we can upload or 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.700
 lower what I advise is to leave the 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.920
 part of the left below the whole 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.170
 so that we have the most real intensity 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.240
 of the drawing and the top part we're going 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.860
 going down to our liking according to 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.520
 let's go down we have colors 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.900
 more intense to see the cool effect 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.220
 good to leave clarito because later we 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.600
 is to add one more layer I give to 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.730
 accept finally let's select 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.610
 again the original layer we 're going to 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:20.430
 double drag it up all 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.500
 and we are going to call it saturation therefore 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.140
 the way you have above we are going to 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.780
 change to saturation and see how our 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.490
 drawing has gained saturation in color 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.040
 and in visual quality 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.260
 this is all even the original layer the 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.940
 we could remove are actually these 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.680
 three layers which are working the 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.570
 black and white that is the comic effect 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.340
 really the color that we are giving 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.350
 and the saturation for 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.389
 the intensity of that color now we're going to 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.760
 apply two effects so that it is 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.560
 even more attractive the drawing and stay 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.270
 something similar to this here precisely 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.850
 what you have applied has been an effect 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.130
 visual blur and a filter 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.000
 artistic canvas type we are going to apply 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.620
 the same effect 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.510
 let's select the layer of white and 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.310
 black that is really the original 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.020
 even as it is no longer black and white 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.750
 we can call it comic and so we do not 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.699
 a great reference we have color comics and 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.280
 saturation we selected comic and you 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.770
 let's give filters blur and 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.750
 Gaussian blur let's select 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.600
 a part of the drawing that we see example 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.310
 here and we can blur a lot or 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.900
 little man I do not advise that since it 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.139
 focus a lot, let's try to see with 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.510
 a 4-4 now and focus a little bit what 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.010
 we just give ok very well and the last 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.110
 effect that is going to be very cool is 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:35.570
 artistic filters and apply canvas 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.370
 the same selected the crosshead I move 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.770
 to a site that I can understand it well 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.860
 and see how I can increase the 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.270
 pixels the pixelated and increases say 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.790
 that canvas so we're going 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.920
 adjust a canvas that more or less 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.150
 attractive for example size 5 depends 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.430
 a lot of the photographs so 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.460
 you will have to change the depth 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:58.220
 of your previous values ok and set 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.200
 what a wonderful effect is amazing 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.120
 this looks like a picture of a picture 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.830
 the last thing that we would have left would be 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.830
 file export as 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.940
 and here you have the new drawing made 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.710
 in white I'm going to apply it to 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.930
 different people and do this kind of 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.360
 effects set this rather drawing of 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.890
 pencil this comic book drawing and this is the 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.410
 original photograph you know that for 

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.990
 likes colors and playing with these three 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.270
 original layers with my color and saturation 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.890
 I could make authentic prayers 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.870
 customize it at your whim if you have 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.760
 of course like to give like that 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.890
 I always appreciate it, I hope it serves you 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.780
 that you apply it in future images and 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.580
 see you later in a following 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.820
 delivery thank you 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:46.520
 nothing else castle we start to cry is a 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.830
 Advancement of the future must enter if it sounds 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.410
 in the background a sad piano you think 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:54.230
 you walk around here where you walked the 

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:56.660
 devil is dressed in wool silk and many 

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:59.390
 broken dreams drowned in my bed you 

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:02.210
 smile wears the one who hates you at the end and 

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:04.670
 at the end only the glory remains 

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.940
 they laugh for what you are but many cry 

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.940
 why
