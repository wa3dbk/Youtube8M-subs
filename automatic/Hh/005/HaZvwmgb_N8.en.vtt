00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
obviously is going to be a reboot of the

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.540 
obviously is going to be a reboot of the
Sam<00:00:31.779> Raimi<00:00:31.960> films<00:00:32.500> would<00:00:33.040> you<00:00:33.160> say<00:00:33.340> that<00:00:33.489> this

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
Sam Raimi films would you say that this

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.460 
Sam Raimi films would you say that this
is<00:00:33.699> a<00:00:33.730> reboot<00:00:34.330> of<00:00:34.449> your<00:00:34.600> previous<00:00:35.019> spider-man

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
is a reboot of your previous spider-man

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.259 
is a reboot of your previous spider-man
games<00:00:35.739> as<00:00:35.920> well<00:00:36.040> I<00:00:36.250> would<00:00:36.820> think<00:00:37.030> that<00:00:37.059> would

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
games as well I would think that would

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.180 
games as well I would think that would
be<00:00:37.300> appropriate<00:00:37.660> yes<00:00:38.199> because<00:00:38.530> when<00:00:38.800> we<00:00:38.949> did

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
be appropriate yes because when we did

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.009 
be appropriate yes because when we did
spider-man<00:00:39.790> shattered<00:00:40.239> Dimensions<00:00:40.300> I<00:00:40.809> think

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
spider-man shattered Dimensions I think

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.259 
spider-man shattered Dimensions I think
we<00:00:41.110> really<00:00:41.320> pushed<00:00:41.979> the<00:00:42.129> edge<00:00:42.250> of<00:00:42.640> on<00:00:43.000> many

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
we really pushed the edge of on many

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.969 
we really pushed the edge of on many
different<00:00:43.510> levels<00:00:43.690> and<00:00:44.440> I<00:00:44.530> think<00:00:44.710> that<00:00:44.830> this

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:44.979 
different levels and I think that this

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.560 
different levels and I think that this
time<00:00:45.159> around<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.820> are<00:00:46.210> shattered<00:00:46.510> Dimensions

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
time around the are shattered Dimensions

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.990 
time around the are shattered Dimensions
team<00:00:47.110> actually<00:00:47.379> worked<00:00:47.769> really<00:00:48.100> hard<00:00:48.250> to

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
team actually worked really hard to

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.520 
team actually worked really hard to
provide<00:00:49.269> the<00:00:49.420> gamers<00:00:49.720> on<00:00:49.900> what's<00:00:50.229> gonna<00:00:50.379> be

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
provide the gamers on what's gonna be

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.439 
provide the gamers on what's gonna be
the<00:00:50.680> next<00:00:50.979> evolution<00:00:51.430> in<00:00:51.519> spider-man<00:00:51.850> titles

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
the next evolution in spider-man titles

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.270 
the next evolution in spider-man titles
I<00:00:52.479> guess<00:00:53.049> the<00:00:53.199> you<00:00:53.290> know<00:00:53.409> the<00:00:53.739> key<00:00:53.920> thing<00:00:54.159> in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
I guess the you know the key thing in

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.130 
I guess the you know the key thing in
all<00:00:54.519> spider-man<00:00:55.059> games<00:00:55.299> is<00:00:55.540> try<00:00:55.720> and<00:00:55.839> make<00:00:56.019> you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
this game first thing that we did is

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.729 
this game first thing that we did is
look<00:01:00.970> at<00:01:01.119> the<00:01:01.269> web<00:01:01.600> swing<00:01:01.930> mechanic<00:01:02.500> I<00:01:02.589> mean

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
look at the web swing mechanic I mean

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:03.899 
look at the web swing mechanic I mean
that's<00:01:02.890> something<00:01:03.250> that's<00:01:03.400> key<00:01:03.580> to<00:01:03.699> any

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
that's something that's key to any

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.030 
that's something that's key to any
spider-man<00:01:04.449> title<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:04.960> this<00:01:05.470> time<00:01:05.710> around

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
spider-man title and this time around

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.399 
spider-man title and this time around
having<00:01:06.729> like<00:01:07.030> giving<00:01:07.479> this<00:01:07.600> level<00:01:08.229> this

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
having like giving this level this

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.289 
having like giving this level this
fantasy<00:01:08.830> of<00:01:09.070> being<00:01:09.340> spider-man<00:01:09.820> we

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
fantasy of being spider-man we

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.090 
fantasy of being spider-man we
completely<00:01:10.840> reward<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.439> camera<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.950> camera

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
completely reward the camera the camera

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.220 
completely reward the camera the camera
is<00:01:12.250> much<00:01:12.520> closer<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.180> action<00:01:13.540> and<00:01:13.900> I<00:01:14.050> think

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
is much closer to the action and I think

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.320 
is much closer to the action and I think
that<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.530> feeling<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.310> web-swinging<00:01:16.000> and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
that the the feeling of web-swinging and

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.090 
that the the feeling of web-swinging and
just<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:16.720> just<00:01:17.050> diving<00:01:17.290> on<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.620> street<00:01:17.890> and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
just and just diving on the street and

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.850 
just and just diving on the street and
at<00:01:18.160> the<00:01:18.190> last<00:01:18.730> minute<00:01:19.030> web-swing<00:01:19.690> just<00:01:20.200> above

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
at the last minute web-swing just above

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.280 
at the last minute web-swing just above
car<00:01:21.130> level<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.580> something<00:01:22.450> that's<00:01:22.630> amazing<00:01:23.230> I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
car level is something that's amazing I

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.780 
car level is something that's amazing I
think<00:01:23.500> that's<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.770> best<00:01:24.010> web<00:01:24.250> swing<00:01:24.550> that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
think that's the best web swing that

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.640 
think that's the best web swing that
you've<00:01:24.910> ever<00:01:25.120> been<00:01:25.480> able<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:26.080> experience<00:01:26.380> in

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
you've ever been able to experience in

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.070 
you've ever been able to experience in
any<00:01:26.980> spider-man<00:01:27.640> title<00:01:28.030> but<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.510> goes<00:01:28.690> beyond

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
any spider-man title but it goes beyond

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.630 
any spider-man title but it goes beyond
like<00:01:29.260> that<00:01:29.470> I<00:01:29.500> mean<00:01:29.740> that's<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.130> camera<00:01:30.460> is

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
like that I mean that's the camera is

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.460 
like that I mean that's the camera is
overall<00:01:30.880> much<00:01:31.090> closer<00:01:31.360> to<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.380> the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
overall much closer to the to the to the

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.530 
overall much closer to the to the to the
character<00:01:32.920> you<00:01:33.400> have<00:01:33.520> things<00:01:33.790> like<00:01:33.880> his<00:01:34.150> suits

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
that's just a navigational aspect

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.340
