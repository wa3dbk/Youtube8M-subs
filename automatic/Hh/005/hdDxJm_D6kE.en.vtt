00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
out of the gas a little bit there

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.240 
out of the gas a little bit there
obviously<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> lead<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.949> a<00:00:38.070> lot

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
obviously going for the lead it's a lot

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.860 
obviously going for the lead it's a lot
different<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.850> he<00:00:39.000> figures<00:00:39.330> if<00:00:39.449> he<00:00:39.540> gets<00:00:39.750> out

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
different and he figures if he gets out

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.210 
different and he figures if he gets out
of<00:00:39.900> the<00:00:40.050> gas<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.589> he's<00:00:40.830> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> lose<00:00:41.190> his

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
of the gas that he's going to lose his

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.920 
of the gas that he's going to lose his
momentum<00:00:41.519> the<00:00:41.970> guys<00:00:42.120> behind<00:00:42.360> him<00:00:42.629> are<00:00:42.809> gonna

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
momentum the guys behind him are gonna

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.110 
momentum the guys behind him are gonna
they're<00:00:43.739> gonna<00:00:43.829> try<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.129> make<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> move<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.820> him

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
they're gonna try to make a move on him

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.959 
they're gonna try to make a move on him
it<00:00:45.930> definitely<00:00:46.110> wasn't<00:00:46.559> intentional<00:00:47.280> incur

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
it definitely wasn't intentional incur

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.049 
it definitely wasn't intentional incur
Ogas<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:49.110> Coronas<00:00:49.680> part<00:00:50.370> i<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:50.760> believe

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
Ogas and on Coronas part i don't believe

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.360 
Ogas and on Coronas part i don't believe
i<00:00:51.239> think<00:00:51.480> he<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.110> was<00:00:52.440> dead<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.949> gas<00:00:53.129> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
i think he just was dead on the gas and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.849 
i think he just was dead on the gas and
as<00:00:53.520> soon<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:54.360> Eric<00:00:54.570> Jones<00:00:54.870> bobbled<00:00:55.379> he<00:00:55.739> was

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
as soon as Eric Jones bobbled he was

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.069 
as soon as Eric Jones bobbled he was
into<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.129> back<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.539> running<00:00:57.539> down<00:00:57.809> pit<00:00:58.350> road

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
into the back of a running down pit road

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.450 
into the back of a running down pit road
I've<00:01:01.079> got<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> feeling<00:01:01.710> they<00:01:01.829> may<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.039> looking

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
I've got a feeling they may be looking

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.960 
I've got a feeling they may be looking
for<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.699> pin<00:01:03.030> pit<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> 77<00:01:04.589> Oman<00:01:05.009> caraga

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
for the pin pit of the 77 Oman caraga

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:26.850 
for the pin pit of the 77 Oman caraga
the<00:01:07.270> officials<00:01:07.690> trying<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.140> slow<00:01:09.010> down

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.790 

yeah<00:01:27.860> I'm<00:01:28.010> fine<00:01:28.310> I<00:01:28.990> guess<00:01:29.990> we<00:01:30.140> just<00:01:30.170> got<00:01:30.410> dumped

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
yeah I'm fine I guess we just got dumped

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.950 
yeah I'm fine I guess we just got dumped
again<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.370> seems<00:01:31.610> like<00:01:31.820> he<00:01:32.090> can't<00:01:32.780> get<00:01:32.870> away

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960
