are<00:00:43.920> some<00:00:44.100> differences<00:00:44.550> between<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.940> two<00:00:45.059> so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
are some differences between the two so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.299 
are some differences between the two so
bear<00:00:45.570> those<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.930> mind<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.860> apart<00:00:47.100> from<00:00:47.190> that

looking at our atto tests they ran in a

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.649 
looking at our atto tests they ran in a
couple<00:04:44.639> different<00:04:44.759> modes<00:04:45.120> queued<00:04:45.419> up<00:04:45.509> the

couple different modes queued up the

four on the Left Q depth of 10 on the
right<00:04:47.789> both<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.150> these<00:04:48.389> scales<00:04:48.659> go<00:04:48.930> up<00:04:49.050> to

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
right both of these scales go up to

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.320 
right both of these scales go up to
1,000<00:04:50.009> so<00:04:50.189> they're<00:04:50.370> fairly<00:04:50.819> similar

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
1,000 so they're fairly similar

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.450 
1,000 so they're fairly similar
you<00:04:51.659> have<00:04:51.780> bit<00:04:51.960> better<00:04:52.139> results<00:04:52.560> on<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.889> q10

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
you have bit better results on the q10

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.619 
you have bit better results on the q10

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
tell you the performance because it runs

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.029 
tell you the performance because it runs

a bunch of different transfer sizes and

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.439 
a bunch of different transfer sizes and
you<00:05:02.099> get<00:05:02.250> two<00:05:02.490> scores<00:05:02.789> across<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.210> board<00:05:03.389> and

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
you get two scores across the board and

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:04.850 
you get two scores across the board and
you<00:05:03.509> can<00:05:03.659> look<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:03.900> see<00:05:03.990> well<00:05:04.169> what's<00:05:04.379> the<00:05:04.590> max

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
you can look and see well what's the max

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.409 
you can look and see well what's the max
