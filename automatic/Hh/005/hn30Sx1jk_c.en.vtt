five golden rules here's a little trick

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.780 
five golden rules here's a little trick
though<00:01:13.659> that<00:01:14.020> helped<00:01:14.260> me<00:01:14.409> establish<00:01:14.500> a<00:01:15.100> little

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
though that helped me establish a little

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.930 
though that helped me establish a little
bit<00:01:15.880> more<00:01:16.030> respect<00:01:16.450> on<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.750> walk<00:01:17.580> one<00:01:18.580> very

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
bit more respect on the walk one very

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.820 
bit more respect on the walk one very
simple<00:01:19.240> way<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.540> getting<00:01:19.720> her<00:01:20.260> to<00:01:20.290> change<00:01:20.710> a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
simple way of getting her to change a

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.890 
simple way of getting her to change a
behavior<00:01:20.980> is<00:01:21.550> to<00:01:21.910> put<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.120> little<00:01:22.450> chain

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
behavior is to put a little chain

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.680 
behavior is to put a little chain
through<00:01:23.740> her<00:01:24.010> collar<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.610> so<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.450> first

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
through her collar and so that the first
