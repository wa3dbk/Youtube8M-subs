we're<00:00:44.340> gonna<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.550> started<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> video

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
we're gonna get started with a video

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.080 
we're gonna get started with a video
this<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.899> pretty<00:00:46.890> much<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.550> peak<00:00:47.789> times

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
this is pretty much all about peak times

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.310 
this is pretty much all about peak times
and<00:00:48.270> off-peak<00:00:48.570> times<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.110> don't<00:00:49.200> want

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
and off-peak times so if you don't want

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.540 
and off-peak times so if you don't want
peak<00:00:49.590> times<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> know<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.430> what

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
peak times out and you know if what

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.130 
peak times out and you know if what
off-peak<00:00:51.180> times<00:00:51.420> either<00:00:51.570> listen<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.050> this

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
off-peak times either listen to this

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.160 
off-peak times either listen to this
part<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.949> basically<00:00:53.309> trading<00:00:53.879> depends<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.870> of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
part so basically trading depends on of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.790 
part so basically trading depends on of
these<00:00:55.320> two<00:00:55.590> things<00:00:55.910> certain<00:00:56.910> markets<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.559> for

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
these two things certain markets and for

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.160 
these two things certain markets and for
instance<00:00:59.070> Gold's<00:00:59.520> actually<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> how<00:01:01.109> does

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
instance Gold's actually and how does

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.410 
instance Gold's actually and how does
its<00:01:01.379> trade<00:01:01.559> within<00:01:01.890> peak<00:01:02.399> times<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.000> silvers

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
its trade within peak times and silvers

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.810 
its trade within peak times and silvers
and<00:01:03.449> bronzes<00:01:04.019> kind<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.650> actually<00:01:04.949> easier<00:01:05.640> in

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and bronzes kind of actually easier in

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.399 
and bronzes kind of actually easier in
peak<00:01:06.030> times<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.479> kind<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.869> varies<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
peak times it kind of varies all the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.230 
peak times it kind of varies all the
time<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.830> difficult<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.310> understand<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:09.119> in

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
time it's difficult to understand but in

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.550 
time it's difficult to understand but in
this<00:01:09.330> video<00:01:09.630> I'm<00:01:09.750> gonna<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.930> explaining<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.530> so

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
14 it's gonna be fairly easy to trade

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.219 
14 it's gonna be fairly easy to trade
the<00:01:20.400> first<00:01:20.640> month<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.150> peak<00:01:21.810> times<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the first month or peak times and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.749 
the first month or peak times and
off-peak<00:01:22.470> times<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.340> no<00:01:23.490> relation

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
off-peak times have kind of no relation

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.060 
off-peak times have kind of no relation
but<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.390> first<00:01:24.659> move<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.409> easy<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.770> trade

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
but I first move it's just easy to trade

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.100 
but I first move it's just easy to trade
through<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.610> pretty<00:01:27.180> much<00:01:27.210> easy<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:27.990> go

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
through and pretty much easy they go

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.380 
through and pretty much easy they go
ezzz<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.759> month<00:01:29.909> afterwards

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
ezzz and then for the month afterwards

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.940 
ezzz and then for the month afterwards
it<00:01:30.479> kind<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.810> depends<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.350> when<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.799> are

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it kind of depends on when you are

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.100 
it kind of depends on when you are
trading<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:32.579> time<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.119> are<00:01:33.210> around<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.900> but

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
six o'clock in the afternoon was really

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.490

in-form method is pretty much so easy to

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.080 
in-form method is pretty much so easy to
use<00:05:20.930> and<00:05:21.289> it<00:05:21.680> works<00:05:21.949> through<00:05:22.310> peak<00:05:22.639> times<00:05:22.940> and

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090
