00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.770
 so that such friends welcome to another 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.050
 video more than 10 their previous encounter 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.539
 today in the city of mexico in the capital 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.340
 where I have come transbored to go to 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.289
 the city of Campeche pick up an airplane 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.419
 that I will take back 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.070
 us and right now that was coming on the flight 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.840
 a lot of nervous hysteria 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.930
 turbulence and for the takeoff and the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.440
 landing and the question is whether we should 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.140
 feel nervous when we fly and the 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.290
 simple answer is whether we should 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.760
 feeling nervous is normal 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.460
 feel nervous when we are in the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.070
 airplane it would be normal not to feel 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.440
 nervous and because I say it's normal 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.540
 feel nervous when we fly good 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.580
 is the fact is that as human beings there 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.890
 we are designed to be in the air 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.810
 we do not have wings like birds so 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.909
 our instinct for conservation always 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.250
 is telling us that you have to have 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.310
 careful because actually flying is a 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.159
 risky experience to notice that it is enjoys 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.560
 like driving a motorcycle or a 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.640
 car or a car on planes 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.270
 commercial according to the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.530
 statistics is more dangerous to handle 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.710
 to the airport that fly the plane is said 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.090
 that you can kill yourself more easily in 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.880
 way to the airport driving what 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.979
 talking about the commercial airplane so you 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.070
 site and survival is going to tell you that 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.450
 be careful with the flown 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.369
 Now if you realize, look when 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.960
 we deploy a small plane of which 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.750
 we train is take off 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.560
 around 70 to 80 knots that are like 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.380
 90 miles if you in a car 90 miles 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.509
 you have an accident can be fatal something 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.219
 I want to arrive is that the mere fact of 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.899
 to be able to accelerate an airplane to be able to 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.819
 take off and keep flying in the air 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.310
 we approach a speed that can 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.009
 be mortal now we can not see the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.079
 things in a gray and black way and 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.860
 negative with heavy aircraft but 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:16.019
 very safe but if that is the risk well 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.319
 Do not wait for fear to be removed 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.209
 the fear or the nerves when you fly 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.610
 that if I already have 10,000 flight hours and 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.980
 I still tell you that I am not afraid in the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.810
 sense of panic or give me fear or 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.239
 terror up there in the air cross and 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.060
 behind my mind there is always that 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.610
 question that if this happens or that if 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.260
 what happens is always there 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.180
 and how do I do to deal with it 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.110
 Well, like when you have a pain 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.700
 head 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.440
 it is a headache does not stop 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.750
 work if it's working follow 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.890
 driving is still your everyday life 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.200
 just try to forget and put it 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.350
 back of your mind is what I do 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.540
 when suddenly you look at the mind and I 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.730
 it passes questions like what if the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.310
 engine or if this happens to the plane 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.560
 I try to understand that it is simply a 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.930
 headache and I put it aside and I 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.990
 I concentrate on what follows to follow 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.150
 go ahead on the flight but if my friends 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.940
 do not wait for that 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.670
 feeling of discomfort when you fly 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.380
 it's normal and you have to accept it as if 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.050
 it was a headache that is going to happen 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.970
 soon when you finish flying still 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.390
 the business vision is still very much 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.780
 very safe compared to moving 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.680
 in a truck or in a car or in a 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.480
 motorcycle is still very very safe 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.680
 this what I have for you is due 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.000
 meanwhile comfort keep the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.489
 safe skies funny clicks kippes 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.760
 caixa juan bread in extra action in the 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.760
 next 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.440
 and
