00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
feet they don't have that much mobility

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.179 
feet they don't have that much mobility
they<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.070> move<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.460> only<00:01:18.680> like<00:01:22.189> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
mouth can open but it's very fragile

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.420 
mouth can open but it's very fragile
yeah<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.960> don't<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:28.590> I'd<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.250> that

yellow

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
yellow

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830 
yellow
it's<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.280> bushing<00:01:44.670> yellow<00:01:44.939> will<00:01:45.360> love<00:01:45.570> some

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it's a bushing yellow will love some

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.210 
it's a bushing yellow will love some
pieces<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.770> green<00:01:47.040> yeah<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:49.380> tail<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> think

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it's a little bit small but we couldn't

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.999 
it's a little bit small but we couldn't
should<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.860> slide<00:01:53.369> kind<00:01:53.970> yeah<00:01:56.780> yeah<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.950> was

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
should be slide kind yeah yeah it was

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.440 
should be slide kind yeah yeah it was
very<00:01:59.159> hard<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.729> build<00:01:59.990> yeah<00:02:01.189> it's<00:02:02.450> this

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
very hard to build yeah it's this

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.819 
very hard to build yeah it's this
special<00:02:03.799> thing<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:06.030> type<00:02:06.360> woody<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
special thing is the type woody is the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.999 
special thing is the type woody is the
type<00:02:08.099> is

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
type is

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:19.559 
type is
it's<00:02:09.580> called<00:02:16.349> electro<00:02:17.349> frag<00:02:17.920> loaf<00:02:18.569> electron

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569

I want to see what you guys can build

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.630 
I want to see what you guys can build
out<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.700> all<00:02:33.970> these<00:02:34.150> mixels<00:02:34.920> does<00:02:35.920> not<00:02:36.099> Ares

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
out of all these mixels does not Ares

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.160 
out of all these mixels does not Ares
doesn't<00:02:37.299> have<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.569> be<00:02:37.690> these<00:02:37.870> yeah<00:02:39.660> yeah<00:02:40.660> we

doesn't have to be these yeah yeah we
would<00:02:41.319> like<00:02:41.410> your<00:02:41.950> iterations<00:02:42.790> so<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.630> can

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
would like your iterations so you can

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.539 
would like your iterations so you can
just<00:02:44.049> give<00:02:44.950> us<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.250> link<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.880> video<00:02:46.030> or<00:02:46.569> Tola
