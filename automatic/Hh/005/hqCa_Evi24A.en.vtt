00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.520
 hello to all these waves and welcome to 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.700
 this top 5 indispensable applications 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.250
 for Christmas so I want to start with the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.230
 first that will be the choice of the gift 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.640
 so the choice of gifts here we have a 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.279
 application called el yvetot 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.279
 which unfortunately does exist and 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.500
 is only in English language here 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.779
 so who actually offers you to choose 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.910
 the sex of the person man or woman 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.239
 for example we will choose someone who 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.360
 is a man 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.350
 we will choose his age group so 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.980
 someone you will see for example 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.870
 over 50 years we will then choose the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.010
 value of the price we want to put 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.199
 so if for example you put a 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.940
 gift that costs between 50 and 100 dollars 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.829
 So that's pretty much 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.379
 Correspondents in English in euros 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.100
 I'm sorry legal person so 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.620
 if it's an intellectual a rebel and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.170
 all the other proposals then the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.199
 otherwise you can not do anything 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.219
 fulfill the interests of the person so 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.379
 for example it is someone who loves 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.740
 cook well this someone also says 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.970
 altruistic in water m we will validate then 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.220
 for what occasion is what we want 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.070
 make this gift we will choose for Christmas 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.390
 christmas and what kind of relationship 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.700
 with this person is what it is 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.560
 our dog natcan 3o is what it is 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.670
 a friend 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.070
 Is that it is someone of the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.570
 family or others so we can be by 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.189
 example I do not know professional 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.619
 fashion etc 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.680
 we choose he looks for the number of 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.450
 gifts that can match 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.850
 then there they find on me 16 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.280
 show the gifts and we'll see our 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.350
 list of jeans and gifts that can 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.689
 to be interesting precisely for the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.520
 nobody of our choice so there by 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.969
 example we are offered this type of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.320
 gift so recipes the wishes of the 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.299
 cheese watches etc 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.609
 a packed basket so for example the 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.350
 level of fruit we will be able to go to 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.909
 inside and there we discover again 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.979
 several categories 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.859
 so if we will choose for example this 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.840
 category here we can access 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.469
 directly as a gift buy it if one 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.390
 wants 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.880
 click on save who will we do so 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.020
 a list of gifts already 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.120
 pre-recorded that we will follow 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.720
 we can save our preferences we have 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.190
 as well 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.990
 nerves to know the price of objects 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.570
 in stores and can also 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.840
 selective feedback a review on 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.510
 the app the second app is going 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.670
 to be just down the suite it's not 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.280
 by the second application will therefore be 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.170
 the list of gifts that is gift list 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.760
 so here we have the list of all 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.260
 people we will be able for which 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.420
 we're going to want to give a gift here by 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.370
 example the 2013 gifts we're going 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.870
 click on add a person we are going 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.180

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.280
 want to put my hand I get the budget 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.850
 which is optional we are obliged to 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.830
 to put 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.060
 who's going to be for example we're going to say 100 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.060
 dollars on valid 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.780
 we then have the person who appears 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.260
 can share 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.690
 we can share that with a list of 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.040
 different from different applications 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.060
 who are already pre-installed on our 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.610
 phone 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.190
 we have the information in relation to 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.350
 players at 20 before the hour before christmas 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.060
 the money spent the total budget that 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.280
 for the zoda 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.810
 people in click on the person and there 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.300
 we can easily add an object 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.550
 so for example we will add here a 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.060
 necklace that has a value one will tell me I 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.160
 do not know 75 euros optional note 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.930
 not for example buy it can be 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.840
 our offer an optional note or 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.980
 share or whatever to see so you 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.620
 can really add the note that 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.360
 you want to validate the collar so 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.790
 we can validate as konÃ© been bought 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.489
 or not so there for example an object to 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.290
 buy as for flights validated we return 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.989
 and there we have the price that has changed we have 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.269
 so used $ 75 on the gift of 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.019
 moment for example other things so 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.060
 there we can share 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.610
 we can avoid the person and it is therefore 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.290
 a really handy app 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.690
 following applications then I'm going 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.640
 offer you the Christmas meal so who 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.320

 she this in other languages 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.100
 and then we will be able to choose what 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.590
 we want to do for Christmas for example 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.230
 a pumpkin blows that reserved for 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.310
 other things we have a lot of 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.780
 finally we have a great choice to see 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.370

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.700
 really a big choice of recipes so 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.370
 for example we will choose 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.440
 Christmas strawberries here so that we 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.630
 load the recipe we know how much 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.650
 we need help from the east we know 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.570
 how much we need a package of 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.110
 strawberries etc and we have all our 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.080
 instructions 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.180
 we have here the little heart for a red 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.920
 add to favorites and time to 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.510
 preparation here 20 minutes for example 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.040
 so really an application that can 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.990
 to be very useful if you do not have a book 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.360
 of recipes under the same for Christmas that to 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.010
 also know that this book is for christmas 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.540
 but also exist for all others 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.590
 for all the other things by 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.600
 example here we find a gray and 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.880
 french stew chops 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.400
 pork the Italian pizza the lobster and 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.140
 all other dishes the last is going 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.520
 now not the last 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.410
 but another application is going to be 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.320
 just had a game so I introduced you 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.600
 the game that is 100 christmas gift that in 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.000
 makes a game that allows us a game 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.380
 of puzzles on which we will make new 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.350
 game for example and here we will be able 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.910
 discover the game the goal being to arrive 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.560
 open the door so the first level 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.110
 is quite simple it just takes 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.330
 touch brings to the level of here we go 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.800
 see that we will have to think a 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.050
 little more before opening the door 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.930
 we will click on the Christmas frame on 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.940
 receives a star so I do not know 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.980
 too much then apparently there is still 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.110
 some pubs 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.950

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.000

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.340
 to you to try to find the solution 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.190
 and the enigma to see the door open 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.500
 this is the christmas game last 3 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.240
 application the 5th and gets wallpaper 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.710
