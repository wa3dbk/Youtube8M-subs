00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.869
 brittany for this grand prize there will be 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.630
 so it counts two laps to go 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.740
 with a length of 5 km 891 stars 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.509
 story by alain prost with five 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.490
 lengths of policies by jim clark 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.410
 asks for the currencies and fernando 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.890
 alonso the three sides of hamilton if there 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.810
 this year

 so what de paul is owned by milton 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.390
 7 in 2013 at 4 29 6 years old is here said wheat 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.120
 is relatively low and is only eleven 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.260
 meters so that's not very important and 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.789
 maintenance for right now 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.510
 for a reconnaissance tour of 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.510
 silverstone circuit 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.010
 pass the line 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.010
 turns that go to the bottom 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.720
 the second corner now 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.280
 my braking for mileage good turn 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.840
 and stinky of the layout 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.840
 in the left here 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.420
 we focused retirement on 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.170
 fifth 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.170
 open the drs 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.900
 in the sector of with a braking for 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.900
 finish at 6 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.570
 dive maintenance is so field 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.890
 acceleration we use will say 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.890
 outdoors 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.340
 as a code for wildlife 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.140
 if it was the old start of the circuit 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.140
 Corsica in fast transfers 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.229
 and we will hear it in the sequence

 mythical maggots becketts chapel 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:57.369
 appear at grade and then from here 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.369
 how has accelerated 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.850

 the right 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.750
 eva club acceleration 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.970
 we finish with the tour of the circuit of
