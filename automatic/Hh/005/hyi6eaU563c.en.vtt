00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 and it has him all hello band feeder 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.420
 we end up talking about narp the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.980
 new champion coming out soon on 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.290
 the live servers and which is now 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.719
 already available on pve as I you 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.450
 had I said I'll let you know 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.460
 I could test the character today on 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.070
 the top line and I can tell you that 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.800
 it's very, but very, very 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.340
 interesting there is a lot of 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.990
 potential on this perso after knowing 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.570
 how can we leave good 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.600
 will have crowds to die detail which 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.160
 will come during the evolution of the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.899
 gameplay of the character of taking in 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.320
 hand by the players 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.420
 for now I played weezer ad so 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.120
 with a stuff similar to the one we 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.430
 can play on united to go to tops to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.070
 right now and I must say that 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.020
 it was interesting to inflate icing 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.110
 case a good synergy with the perso 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.450
 when he's in shape in big shape we 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.170
 will say in the form of 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.760
 big beasts of big nar there is a 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.760
 good synergy that can be nice 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.840
 since it slows enemies that 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.150
 counteract the fact that we have less 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.650
 jld reindeer but honestly 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.730
 honestly what I have to say for 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.790
 the moment is that the character is 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.420
 really excellentissime he is hyper 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.510
 fun to play 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.850
 the gameplay is super nice it's hyper 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.160
 fun to take in hand it's very fluid 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.750
 we have a very good last sitting on a 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.850
 really what to do about this person 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.000
 very good things 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.200
 he is really very interesting 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.550
 honestly from what I could see from this 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.080
 that I could test it makes good 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.229
 damage he's very nice to play he has 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.380
 a mobility in the shape of a little duck 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.420
 who is really enormously really 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.770
 crazy mobility of small rica 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.710
 place and from time to time that are 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.740
 interesting business optimization 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.720
 of I think it's a champion who's going 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.399
 have a good skill cap 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.320
 honestly there's really enough 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.820
 improve a lot on champions I have 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.759
 noticed that being a 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.470
 very interesting technique that to my 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.270
 notice will be coming out very soon that the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.039
 people will start doing there are some 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.340
 very interesting things to do with 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.650
 this person he is really very very good 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.680
 so for now at the stuff level 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.540
 what I did so I left with 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.490
 as I was 10 when the frosty 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.930
 we can also leave with a trinity 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.110
 young and amused to do both as 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.290
 that to mess because I wanted 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.780
 we can indeed also have a land that has 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.410
 so a blade of the fallen king that I find 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.430
 that very interesting about him I had done 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.859
 also 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.629
 the lucidity boots during the cdm to 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.510
 know that i think the cdr is a 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.640
 stat the cooldown reduction is a 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.980
 stat that is really very very 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.069
 interesting about him so the blue is 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.200
 interesting on dinard and the cdr is 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.620
 very interesting about him with canton 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.019
 when we get to really put a good 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.280
 big pile of cd r can be reached 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.629
 swing bombs make everything and 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.510
 three seconds so that's really 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.069
 interesting from what I could test the 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.470
 way I played for now what 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.629
 that stands out for me is that form 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.269
 of mini gnarr is more interesting than 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.280
 the big nar shape nevertheless i think 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.810
 that in front of them teamfight 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.790
 we can have a big in art that is 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.590
 really really interesting 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.510
 since when we go in this form 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.060
 there we come back from life compared to the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.049
 form of mini l'ina one has no more life 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.239
 and we have a booth and suddenly it's 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.310
 really very interesting even though the 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.889
 queen and diminish the stock is a stone 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.959
 of zone we can have a very big 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:39.659
 this teamfight 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.090
 it can really be very interesting 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.769
 he really has a huge potential like 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.139
 I can not stop repeating it is 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.849
 really interesting for once 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.040
 has an eye out of it with a gameplay 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.019
 I like because I do not like 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.710
 gameplay of most yordle I like 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.750
 well 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.400
 he also poc it's nice but I have 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.200
 to admit that we really have 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.520
 novelties in terms of style gameplay 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.330
 cape we really have very things 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.310
 interesting 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.900
 the boomerang's mechanics are also 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.100
 very nice for example the fact that we 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.250
 must catch up with the boomerang for 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.710
 reduce cooldown for recovery 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.450
 of fate we can try to catch up 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.970
 faster running towards the boomerang 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.860
 or doing an e in the boomerang 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.980
 there are some very very interesting things 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.870
 to do with this person and so the cdr 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.070
 as I said when we want to try to 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.720
 do this kind of technique what kind of 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.370
 for example the boomerang 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.680
 to catch up to reduce the cd of the 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.940
 boomerang while having by not having 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.500
 too much to give on the e 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.120
 well that's interesting things 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.560
 with cdr so there is really 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.990
 really optimization to do on this 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.310
 cradle of very interesting things 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.350
 but I think he has a lot of future 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.550
 and who will be playing a lot because 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.350
 that he's really interesting he's 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.840
 really very nice he has a gameplay 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.820
 unique for now I've never seen this 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.770
 kind of gameplay on no champion on 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.750
 can think of mixtures of some 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.510
 other champions the blow boomerang on 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.120
 can think of draven the jump one can 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.050
 to think of the casif the games like that or to 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.060
 everyone who has both 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.410
 young people anyway is really the 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.990
 very interesting things from stone of 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.880
 zone in big did not want to make think of a 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.110
 kind of sna type have reduced I you 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.510
 reassure it's less strong than that 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.970
 obviously but there is really something 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.320
 then do lÃ¼thi let's talk about it ulti 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.870
 glory is really nice too 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.390
 this bug can be really practical on 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.760
 can imagine the technique with a bucket 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.510
 first people jump on the enemy with 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.600
 the big nar and then one links the ulti 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.060
 to bring the enemy back into the teamfight 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.410
 the enemy that is trying to go and it 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.730
 it's really interesting I find it 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.350
 there are really a lot of things to do 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.780
 many techniques to develop on 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.270
 this cradle and for now I'm you 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.180
 admit that clearly I am a mega fan 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.460
 I approve more than ever this person 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.740
 I had made sure I get it 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.980
 always have you and this person 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.810
 honestly for me it's worth you there 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.940
 is as good he is also interesting 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.300
 there are so many things to do it's a 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.680
 who really enjoyed playing fun 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.600
 who in addition is cute who loses to 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.390
 a lot of people 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.370
 blow he is really very nice and I 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:08.300
 waiting a lot in the future and I think 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.280
 that he will be very played very very 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.770
 interesting and have a gameplay 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.210
 dynamic and friendly enough 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.220
 so for now but back it's 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.850
 that he is an excellent person with a good 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.770
 design an extremely fun gameplay with 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.890
 a lot of things to develop on 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.450
 he really has a lot of potential and 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.800
 so for now all I have 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.140
 to say is that this person is really 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.830
 great and that as soon as I leave 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.630
 obviously invites to buy it obviously 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:38.080
 because I really believe in it and I think 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.520
 really that this person is going to be absolutely 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.620
 extraordinary in any case I you 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.230
