you<00:00:00.539> know<00:00:00.630> we<00:00:00.780> kind<00:00:00.960> of<00:00:01.020> set<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.350> bar<00:00:01.560> when<00:00:02.310> we

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
you know we kind of set the bar when we

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.770 
you know we kind of set the bar when we
did<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.610> rampage<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.090> extreme<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.449> lot<00:00:03.659> of

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
did the rampage to extreme a lot of

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.030 
did the rampage to extreme a lot of
people<00:00:03.899> were<00:00:04.110> super<00:00:04.440> juiced<00:00:04.650> about<00:00:04.890> that

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
people were super juiced about that

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.430 
people were super juiced about that
border<00:00:05.339> they<00:00:05.790> said<00:00:06.029> we<00:00:06.540> did<00:00:06.690> them<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:06.960> formula

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
border they said we did them the formula

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.770 
border they said we did them the formula
read<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.010> gene<00:00:08.220> this<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.820> special<00:00:09.360> refresh

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
read the gene this is special refresh

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.780 
read the gene this is special refresh
that<00:00:09.809> we're<00:00:10.110> working<00:00:10.440> on<00:00:10.590> for<00:00:10.830> extra<00:00:11.610> fee

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
that we're working on for extra fee

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.919 
that we're working on for extra fee
because<00:00:12.030> it's<00:00:12.240> still<00:00:12.420> going<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> be<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> only

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
because it's still going to be the only

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.480 
because it's still going to be the only
platform<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.559> can<00:00:13.679> do<00:00:13.799> with<00:00:13.980> six<00:00:14.250> fours

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
platform that you can do with six fours

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.150 
platform that you can do with six fours
so<00:00:15.480> there's<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.109> still<00:00:16.379> holds<00:00:16.529> its<00:00:16.740> position

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
so there's it still holds its position

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.939 
so there's it still holds its position
it's<00:00:17.430> not<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.760> anywhere<00:00:18.350> it's<00:00:19.350> slated<00:00:19.619> for

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
it's not going anywhere it's slated for

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.080 
it's not going anywhere it's slated for
even<00:00:20.189> late<00:00:20.630> 23<00:00:21.630> maybe<00:00:22.140> even<00:00:22.380> early<00:00:23.010> q4<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:23.970> this

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
even late 23 maybe even early q4 so this

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.960 
even late 23 maybe even early q4 so this
isn't<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> stew<00:00:24.689> that's<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.260> anywhere

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
isn't a stew that's going in anywhere

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.550 
isn't a stew that's going in anywhere
p67<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.300> definitely<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.869> think<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.289> premier

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
p67 is definitely I think the premier

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.870 
p67 is definitely I think the premier
product<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.010> think<00:00:29.189> there<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
product I think there is going to be a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.130 
product I think there is going to be a
little<00:00:30.000> bit<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.240> crossover<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:30.840> entry-level

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
little bit of crossover for entry-level

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.830 
little bit of crossover for entry-level
x58<00:00:31.830> adoption<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.030> think<00:00:33.239> when<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> 970

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
x58 adoption but I think when the 970

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.840 
x58 adoption but I think when the 970
price<00:00:34.020> drop<00:00:34.260> hits<00:00:34.440> shortly<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.550> looking<00:00:35.790> at

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
price drop hits shortly just looking at

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.190 
price drop hits shortly just looking at
a<00:00:35.910> lot<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.059> people<00:00:36.300> interested<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.719> wanting<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
a lot of people interested in wanting to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.950 
a lot of people interested in wanting to
get<00:00:37.320> six<00:00:37.829> bolt<00:00:38.040> bass<00:00:38.190> performance<00:00:38.579> right

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
get six bolt bass performance right

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.959 
get six bolt bass performance right
alright<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:41.010> kind<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.370> our<00:00:41.489> focus<00:00:41.700> with

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
alright so that's kind of our focus with

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.970 
alright so that's kind of our focus with
this<00:00:42.149> most<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.290> elements<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.770> talked

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
this most of the elements that I talked

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.610 
this most of the elements that I talked
about<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.520> board<00:00:44.820> they're<00:00:45.360> all<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.809> so

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
about on that board they're all here so

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.380 
about on that board they're all here so
really<00:00:46.950> what<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> special<00:00:47.730> aspects<00:00:48.120> are<00:00:48.270> is

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
really what the special aspects are is

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.100 
really what the special aspects are is
going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.660> what's<00:00:48.840> called<00:00:48.960> our

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
going to be what's called our

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.410 
going to be what's called our
Thunderbolt<00:00:49.500> module<00:00:50.070> that's<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.300> an

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
Thunderbolt module that's going to be an

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.970 
Thunderbolt module that's going to be an
auto<00:00:51.570> module<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.110> brings<00:00:52.320> our<00:00:52.469> zone<00:00:52.739> our

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
auto module that brings our zone our

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.639 
auto module that brings our zone our
class<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.489> audio<00:00:53.940> cards<00:00:54.320> physically<00:00:55.320> onto<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
class of audio cards physically onto the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.869 
class of audio cards physically onto the
board<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.010> bringing<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.550> onboard

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
board so bringing on onboard

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.180 
board so bringing on onboard
amplification<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> audio<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.590> then

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
amplification for the audio and then

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.319 
amplification for the audio and then
we're<00:00:59.340> also<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.850> introduced<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
we're also going to be introduced in the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.180 
we're also going to be introduced in the
killer<00:01:00.570> net<00:01:00.809> now<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.100> be

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190
