00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.800 
if you remember they are really unhappy
with<00:01:42.990> Atlas<00:01:43.680> when<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:44.610> escape<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
with Atlas when they escape one of the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.389 
with Atlas when they escape one of the
first<00:01:46.049> things<00:01:46.259> are<00:01:46.380> probably<00:01:46.770> gonna<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.159> is

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
first things are probably gonna do is

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.490 
first things are probably gonna do is
run<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.000> tell<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> world<00:01:48.600> about<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.170> zombie

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
run and tell the world about the zombie

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.100 
run and tell the world about the zombie
outbreak<00:01:49.680> within<00:01:50.220> atlases<00:01:50.790> facilities<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.689> in

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
outbreak within atlases facilities so in

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.960 
outbreak within atlases facilities so in
order<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.439> keep<00:01:52.680> everything<00:01:52.920> quiet<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.759> keep

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
order to keep everything quiet and keep

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.609 
order to keep everything quiet and keep
everything<00:01:54.299> under<00:01:54.570> wraps<00:01:54.930> they<00:01:55.229> probably

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
everything under wraps they probably

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.740 
everything under wraps they probably
shot<00:01:56.340> down<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.820> warbird<00:01:57.210> that's<00:01:57.390> why<00:01:57.600> they

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
shot down the warbird that's why they

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.179 
shot down the warbird that's why they
wanted<00:01:58.020> them<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.320> die<00:01:58.500> because<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:59.040> they

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
wanted them to die because if they

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.370 
wanted them to die because if they
escape<00:01:59.700> well<00:02:00.180> then<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> world<00:02:00.659> knows<00:02:00.960> about

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
escape well then the world knows about

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.410 
escape well then the world knows about
the<00:02:01.560> zombies<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.189> Atlas<00:02:02.579> wants<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.000> keep<00:02:03.149> this

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the zombies and Atlas wants to keep this

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.170 
the zombies and Atlas wants to keep this
under<00:02:03.780> cover<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.229> do<00:02:04.649> some<00:02:04.860> tests<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.369> them<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
under cover and do some tests on them to

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.389 
under cover and do some tests on them to
get<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.570> return<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.409> their<00:02:07.560> investment<00:02:08.129> as<00:02:08.250> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
get a return on their investment as it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.699 
get a return on their investment as it
was<00:02:08.520> described<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.959> next<00:02:10.229> question<00:02:10.530> comes

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
was described the next question comes

was described the next question comes
from<00:02:10.800> Justice<00:02:11.340> Heckman<00:02:11.700> who<00:02:11.819> says<00:02:12.030> my

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
from Justice Heckman who says my

from Justice Heckman who says my
question<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.720> who

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
question is who

the<00:02:17.470> canisters<00:02:17.860> have<00:02:18.010> been<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.190> point<00:02:18.459> of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
the canisters have been a point of

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.729 
the canisters have been a point of
debate<00:02:18.790> for<00:02:18.819> what<00:02:19.420> quite<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.750> while<00:02:19.989> man<00:02:20.290> when

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
debate for what quite a while man when

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.559 
debate for what quite a while man when
you<00:02:20.830> look<00:02:20.980> at<00:02:21.099> them<00:02:21.250> they<00:02:21.819> seem<00:02:22.060> kind<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.420> like

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
you look at them they seem kind of like

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.690 
you look at them they seem kind of like
deformed<00:02:22.989> humans<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.680> mean<00:02:23.830> they<00:02:23.950> have<00:02:24.190> very

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
deformed humans I mean they have very

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.180 
deformed humans I mean they have very
humanoid<00:02:25.599> facial<00:02:26.170> structures<00:02:26.739> but<00:02:27.010> then

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
humanoid facial structures but then

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.740 
humanoid facial structures but then
there's<00:02:27.370> something<00:02:27.730> just<00:02:27.880> off<00:02:28.209> about<00:02:28.540> them

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
there's something just off about them

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.440 
there's something just off about them
something<00:02:29.050> relatively<00:02:29.769> eerie<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.489> there's

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
something relatively eerie and there's

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.630 
something relatively eerie and there's
two<00:02:31.690> main<00:02:32.019> theories<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.800> first<00:02:33.069> thought<00:02:33.400> is

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
two main theories the first thought is

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.390 
two main theories the first thought is
that<00:02:33.670> they<00:02:34.030> may<00:02:34.209> actually<00:02:34.510> be<00:02:35.010> members<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.040> the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
that they may actually be members of the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.509 
that they may actually be members of the
real<00:02:36.700> race<00:02:37.090> now<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:38.349> Vril<00:02:38.620> are<00:02:38.980> people<00:02:39.400> who

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
real race now the Vril are people who

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.400 
real race now the Vril are people who
live<00:02:39.730> within<00:02:39.940> our<00:02:40.150> Gotha<00:02:40.480> they<00:02:40.900> live<00:02:41.140> in<00:02:41.260> the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
live within our Gotha they live in the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.500 
live within our Gotha they live in the
Hollow<00:02:41.709> Earth<00:02:42.010> they're<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.459> highly<00:02:42.880> advanced

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
Hollow Earth they're a highly advanced

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.440 
Hollow Earth they're a highly advanced
race<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:44.200> people<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.860> it's<00:02:45.760> been<00:02:45.910> theorized

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
race of people and it's been theorized

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.210 
race of people and it's been theorized
that<00:02:46.630> they<00:02:46.930> are<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.440> people<00:02:47.769> within<00:02:47.980> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
that they are the people within the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.370 
that they are the people within the
canisters<00:02:49.000> now<00:02:49.209> another<00:02:49.510> theory<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.080> this<00:02:50.230> is

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
canisters now another theory and this is

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.650 
canisters now another theory and this is
one<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.739> subscribe<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.340> it's<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.180> day<00:02:52.390> our

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
one that I subscribe to it's a day our

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.979 
one that I subscribe to it's a day our
the<00:02:52.989> Nova<00:02:53.319> crawlers<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.040> they<00:02:54.790> infuse<00:02:55.420> Nova

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
the Nova crawlers so they infuse Nova

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.979 
the Nova crawlers so they infuse Nova
gas<00:02:56.200> into<00:02:56.950> zombies<00:02:57.459> or<00:02:57.730> Nova<00:02:58.120> gas<00:02:58.269> into<00:02:58.720> some

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
gas into zombies or Nova gas into some

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.770 
gas into zombies or Nova gas into some
kind<00:02:59.380> of<00:02:59.560> creature<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.730> created<00:03:01.420> the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
kind of creature and that created the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.900 
kind of creature and that created the
Nova<00:03:02.170> crawlers<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.920> Nova<00:03:03.190> crawlers<00:03:03.640> were

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
Nova crawlers the Nova crawlers were

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.809 
Nova crawlers the Nova crawlers were
stored<00:03:04.299> in<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.840> pods<00:03:05.110> alive<00:03:05.830> some<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.700> them

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
stored in the pods alive some of them

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.479 
stored in the pods alive some of them
actually<00:03:07.090> broke<00:03:07.630> out<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.470> pod<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.950> they

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
actually broke out of the pod and they

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.070 
actually broke out of the pod and they
are<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.940> Nova<00:03:10.180> crawlers<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.569> are<00:03:10.780> running

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
are the Nova crawlers that are running

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.680 
are the Nova crawlers that are running
around<00:03:11.230> kino<00:03:11.890> der<00:03:11.920> toten<00:03:12.269> so<00:03:13.269> those<00:03:13.420> are<00:03:13.599> the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
around kino der toten so those are the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.300 
around kino der toten so those are the
two<00:03:13.810> theories<00:03:14.170> revolving<00:03:14.680> around<00:03:14.799> what<00:03:15.160> is

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
two theories revolving around what is

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.039 
two theories revolving around what is
inside<00:03:15.819> those<00:03:16.060> pods<00:03:16.390> when<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.780> look<00:03:16.900> at<00:03:16.989> the

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
inside those pods when you look at the

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.539 
inside those pods when you look at the
faces<00:03:17.260> within<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.769> pots<00:03:17.950> they<00:03:18.130> don't<00:03:18.310> exactly

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
faces within the pots they don't exactly

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.729 
faces within the pots they don't exactly
look<00:03:18.790> like<00:03:18.850> nova<00:03:19.420> crawlers<00:03:19.810> which<00:03:20.320> leans<00:03:20.590> more

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
look like nova crawlers which leans more

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.009 
look like nova crawlers which leans more
towards<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.579> real<00:03:21.790> theory<00:03:22.239> but<00:03:22.720> there<00:03:22.870> also

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
towards the real theory but there also

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.199 
towards the real theory but there also
isn't<00:03:23.290> all<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.530> much<00:03:23.650> betting<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.970> real

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
isn't all that much betting the real

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.630 
isn't all that much betting the real
theory<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:25.780> then<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.829> nova<00:03:27.160> crawler<00:03:27.370> theory

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
theory and then the nova crawler theory

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.370 
theory and then the nova crawler theory
just<00:03:27.910> makes<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.180> little<00:03:28.359> bit<00:03:28.600> more<00:03:28.870> sense<00:03:29.170> and

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
just makes a little bit more sense and

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.840 
just makes a little bit more sense and
explains<00:03:29.769> what<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.040> Nova<00:03:30.280> crawlers<00:03:30.609> came

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
explains what the Nova crawlers came

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.120 
explains what the Nova crawlers came
from<00:03:31.060> neither<00:03:31.359> though<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.840> definitely<00:03:32.739> we're

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
from neither though is definitely we're

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.380 
from neither though is definitely we're

question from transit gamer who asks
during<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.060> infection<00:03:37.359> rounds<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:37.989> can

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
during the infection rounds you can

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.229 
during the infection rounds you can
become<00:03:38.500> cured<00:03:38.950> why<00:03:39.489> can't<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.880> EXO<00:03:40.209> zombies

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
become cured why can't the EXO zombies

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.470 
become cured why can't the EXO zombies
get<00:03:40.750> here<00:03:41.049> from<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.319> curing<00:03:41.620> station<00:03:41.980> as<00:03:42.160> well

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
get here from the curing station as well

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.030 
get here from the curing station as well
so<00:03:43.480> here's<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.109> thing<00:03:44.319> whenever<00:03:44.560> you're<00:03:44.859> hit

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040

by a gas zombie you'll notice a little

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.199 
by a gas zombie you'll notice a little
timer<00:03:47.980> down<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.400> bottom<00:03:48.670> of<00:03:48.790> your<00:03:48.880> screen

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.870 
timer down in the bottom of your screen
when<00:03:50.139> that<00:03:50.410> timer<00:03:50.709> runs<00:03:51.040> out<00:03:51.250> you<00:03:51.280> reach<00:03:51.670> a

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
when that timer runs out you reach a

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.809 
when that timer runs out you reach a
point<00:03:51.910> of<00:03:52.480> no<00:03:52.780> return<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:53.470> point<00:03:53.739> in<00:03:53.950> which<00:03:54.370> you

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
infection has already set in but up

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.259 
infection has already set in but up
until<00:03:59.139> that<00:03:59.350> point<00:03:59.500> you<00:04:00.370> are<00:04:00.549> still<00:04:00.850> able<00:04:01.090> to

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
until that point you are still able to

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.729 
until that point you are still able to
be<00:04:01.359> cured<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.019> zombies<00:04:02.380> who<00:04:02.500> are<00:04:02.560> running

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739
