00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.969
 one of the first lucky ones 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.759
 Argentineans in having the new iPhone 5 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:15.780

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.939

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.640
 programs that come here 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.119

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.119

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.290
 good here comes to me comes 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.500
 exclusively by him by the iphone5 i am 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.710
 very fanatical about this phone and good 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.360
 I came yesterday evening to see that there was 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.730
 people like that, today I got up early and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.230
 it comes to me for the tail so more or 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.970
 less than 7 in the morning I'm here 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.680
 waiting for the phone the phone is 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.410
 for you or for someone from your committee 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.820
 one for me and one for my lady are 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.250
 two phones that I'm going to buy 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.400
 you accidentally grabbed the date or 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.890
 you had already planned to be in the USA 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.140
 when they did launch the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.149
 truth was coincidence because to go out to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.210
 grab this date and good yesterday when 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.640
 I found out that today the launch 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.840
 I took advantage and I came urgently you do not want 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.369
 what do you think about all this 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.410
 movement that has been weapon that people 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.010
 come so early that you are waiting 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.950
 so many hours for a phone 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.360
 I do not think the fanaticism that 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.160
 there's this brand for this technology and 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.500
 good is very good technology and that's why 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.720
 it deserves to be highlighted the one of attendis all 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.270
 that will work well in argentina 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.979
 how will it be 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.159
 apparently I have already acquired a 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.530
 phone last year was the iphone 4 and 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.469
 works very well so far so 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.729
 I calculate that there will be no problems 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.869
 but he is going to leave it he is going to sell it because 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.729
 this one can make a good difference 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:49.030
 in Argentina if I know yes but I do not 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.709
 I'll leave it and one I'll tell you a base 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.369
 for a gift and the other one I'm going to leave 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:56.380
 I tell you it's going to be a luxury good 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.000
 quite exclusive because you do not know very 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.090
 well if one day you can get to enter 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.560
 a phone like this if it really does not 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.360
 we know if it will reach Argentina in 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.360
 how much time do I only
