squares<00:00:24.410> on<00:00:24.560> a<00:00:24.589> round<00:00:24.890> loom<00:00:25.189> is<00:00:25.490> that<00:00:25.789> you<00:00:25.880> have

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
squares on a round loom is that you have

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.509 
squares on a round loom is that you have
to<00:00:26.210> work<00:00:26.359> out<00:00:26.599> before<00:00:27.019> you<00:00:27.140> start<00:00:27.339> how<00:00:28.339> many

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
to work out before you start how many

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.419 
to work out before you start how many
pegs<00:00:28.849> you<00:00:29.119> will<00:00:29.269> need<00:00:29.720> to<00:00:29.900> use<00:00:30.169> and<00:00:30.439> how<00:00:31.160> many

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
pegs you will need to use and how many

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.400 
pegs you will need to use and how many
rows<00:00:31.609> you'll<00:00:31.970> need<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:32.360> knit<00:00:34.900> this<00:00:35.900> is<00:00:36.080> because

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
rows you'll need to knit this is because

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.430 
rows you'll need to knit this is because
once<00:00:36.740> you've<00:00:36.980> started<00:00:37.280> knitting<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.870> part<00:00:39.290> of

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
once you've started knitting the part of

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.680 
once you've started knitting the part of
the<00:00:39.530> knitting<00:00:39.860> nearest<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:40.910> pegs<00:00:41.180> is

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
the knitting nearest to the pegs is

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.820 
the knitting nearest to the pegs is
stretched<00:00:42.530> in<00:00:43.120> both<00:00:44.120> directions<00:00:44.480> both<00:00:45.050> around

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
stretched in both directions both around

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.150 
stretched in both directions both around
the<00:00:45.980> pegs<00:00:46.220> and<00:00:46.490> down<00:00:47.120> into<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.600> work<00:00:48.100> so<00:00:49.100> you

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
the pegs and down into the work so you

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.340 
the pegs and down into the work so you
can't<00:00:49.520> do<00:00:49.910> any<00:00:50.210> accurate<00:00:50.720> measuring<00:00:51.020> as<00:00:51.230> you

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
can't do any accurate measuring as you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.920 
can't do any accurate measuring as you
go<00:00:51.530> along<00:00:51.910> so<00:00:52.910> in<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:53.090> video<00:00:53.270> I'm<00:00:53.690> going<00:00:53.870> to

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
go along so in this video I'm going to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.250 
go along so in this video I'm going to
show<00:00:54.170> quick<00:00:54.770> ways<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.010> estimate<00:00:55.810> the<00:00:56.810> pegs<00:00:57.050> and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
show quick ways to estimate the pegs and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.170 
show quick ways to estimate the pegs and
rows<00:00:57.470> necessary<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:58.280> create<00:00:58.490> an<00:00:58.820> eight<00:00:58.970> inch

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
rows necessary to create an eight inch

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.539 
rows necessary to create an eight inch
square

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.859 

you'll<00:01:05.549> find<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.000> different<00:01:06.390> sized<00:01:06.600> round

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you'll find that different sized round

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.830 
you'll find that different sized round
looms<00:01:07.290> will<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.890> different<00:01:08.520> size<00:01:08.840> spaces

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
looms will have different size spaces

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.380 
looms will have different size spaces
between<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.350> pegs<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> right<00:01:11.939> number<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
between the pegs so the right number of

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.450 
between the pegs so the right number of
pegs<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.869> produce<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.500> square<00:01:13.830> 8<00:01:14.009> inches<00:01:14.399> wide

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
pegs to produce a square 8 inches wide
