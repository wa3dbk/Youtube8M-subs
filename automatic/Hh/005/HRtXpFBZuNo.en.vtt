 from beginning to end 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.700
 The patented cleaning system of three 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.620
 phases of rumba is combined with the 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.720
 hero technology back to get the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.810
 maximum cleaning performance throughout 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.000
 type of floors 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.770
 first the side brush 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.930
 swivel clean wall edges 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.430
 trapping dirt and pushing it 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.920
 towards the passage of the spin brushes 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.900
 otherwise collapses these brushes 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.110
 work together to lift 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.270
 waste dust and hair from the soil to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.770
 then a powerful vacuum removes 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.840
 the dirt and the hair of the brushes 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.270
 collapses and puts them in the tank 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.980
 Aero back optimized airflow 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.200
 directs dirt and hair towards the 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.060
 back of the deposit so 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.000
 fills up evenly and needs 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.340
 emptying less frequently thanks to 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.170
 technology to yadav responsive clean 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.510
 in the advanced software system and 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.700
 rumba robot sensors selected from 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.770
 multiple robotic behaviors more 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.020
 60 times per second 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.409
 rumba runs several times each section
