00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
but that's a pass then isn't it because

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.080 
but that's a pass then isn't it because

Rosberg who gets on the throttle
earliest<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.409> hardest<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.280> take<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.909> place

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
earliest and hardest to take that place

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.429 
earliest and hardest to take that place
there<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.280> go<00:01:38.399> again<00:01:38.719> Rosberg<00:01:39.719> thinks<00:01:40.289> he's

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
there we go again Rosberg thinks he's

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.350 
there we go again Rosberg thinks he's
got<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.649> turn<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.159> curve<00:01:41.759> aligners<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:42.240> you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
got the turn in curve aligners as you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.880 
got the turn in curve aligners as you
know<00:01:42.450> passing<00:01:42.810> me<00:01:42.929> around<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.259> outside<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
know passing me around the outside a
little<00:01:44.039> but<00:01:44.280> you're<00:01:44.460> okay<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.000> hit<00:01:45.479> pretty

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
little but you're okay you hit pretty

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.440 
little but you're okay you hit pretty
much<00:01:46.079> square<00:01:46.469> on<00:01:46.679> like<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.189> curvy<00:01:48.030> line<00:01:48.270> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
much square on like that curvy line and

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.190 

and<00:01:57.770> this<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.460> Renault<00:02:00.060> shaping<00:02:00.750> up<00:02:00.900> on<00:02:01.140> a
