welcome<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.800> the<00:00:04.830> workshop<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:06.319> woodworkers<00:00:07.319> I

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
welcome to the workshop I woodworkers I

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.129 
welcome to the workshop I woodworkers I
just<00:00:08.670> want<00:00:08.850> to<00:00:08.910> explain<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.270> you<00:00:09.450> in<00:00:09.600> this<00:00:09.900> very

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
just want to explain to you in this very

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.039 
just want to explain to you in this very
short<00:00:10.469> video<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.280> reason<00:00:11.700> why<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.270> have<00:00:13.020> a

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
short video the reason why I have a

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.880 
short video the reason why I have a
large<00:00:13.469> hole<00:00:13.799> towards<00:00:14.789> the<00:00:14.969> end<00:00:15.180> of<00:00:15.539> the

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
large hole towards the end of the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.170 
large hole towards the end of the
Dowling<00:00:16.890> guide<00:00:17.190> system<00:00:19.280> this<00:00:20.280> hole<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.730> 19

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
Dowling guide system this hole is 19

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.940 
Dowling guide system this hole is 19
millimeters<00:00:21.870> and<00:00:23.120> that<00:00:24.120> takes<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.950> hardened

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
millimeters and that takes a hardened

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.959 
millimeters and that takes a hardened
drill<00:00:26.490> insert<00:00:29.330> nice<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.600> snuggly<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.759> I<00:00:32.759> have

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
drill insert nice and snuggly and I have

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.899 
drill insert nice and snuggly and I have
a<00:00:33.000> set<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.420> these<00:00:33.510> inserts<00:00:34.250> from<00:00:35.250> another<00:00:35.550> kit

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:35.909 
a set of these inserts from another kit

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:38.239 
a set of these inserts from another kit
which<00:00:36.120> I'll<00:00:36.300> show<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.629> a<00:00:36.780> minute<00:00:37.249> which

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.249 
which I'll show you in a minute which

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:42.410 
which I'll show you in a minute which
gives<00:00:38.460> me<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.609> range<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.089> holes<00:00:41.120> so<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> can

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
gives me a range of holes so I can

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.689 
gives me a range of holes so I can
accurately<00:00:43.079> set<00:00:43.499> up<00:00:43.710> perpendicular<00:00:44.399> distance

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
accurately set up perpendicular distance

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.770 
accurately set up perpendicular distance
to<00:00:44.999> some<00:00:45.179> work<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.659> drill<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.620> range<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.039> holes

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
to some work and drill a range of holes

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.770 
to some work and drill a range of holes
through<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.839> hardened<00:00:49.289> insert<00:00:50.569> this<00:00:51.569> is<00:00:51.749> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
through the hardened insert this is a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.689 
through the hardened insert this is a
system<00:00:52.319> that<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> hardened<00:00:52.890> inserts<00:00:53.339> came

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
system that the hardened inserts came

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
system that the hardened inserts came
with<00:00:54.109> it<00:00:55.109> doesn't<00:00:55.440> actually<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.769> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
with it doesn't actually have a

with it doesn't actually have a
manufacturer's<00:00:56.519> name<00:00:56.550> anywhere<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:58.010> but

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
manufacturer's name anywhere on it but

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.849 
manufacturer's name anywhere on it but
it<00:00:59.159> took<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.940> came<00:01:00.210> from<00:01:00.420> axminster<00:01:01.139> tool

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
it took it came from axminster tool

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.480 
it took it came from axminster tool
center<00:01:04.729> it's<00:01:05.729> called<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.150> drill<00:01:06.390> guide<00:01:06.600> kit<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
center it's called a drill guide kit and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.030 
center it's called a drill guide kit and
it<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:09.540> subheading<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.230> drill<00:01:10.530> perfect

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it the subheading is drill perfect

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.150 
it the subheading is drill perfect
perpendicular<00:01:11.730> holes<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.860> there<00:01:14.070> are

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
perpendicular holes and there are

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.600 
perpendicular holes and there are
inserts<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.850> four<00:01:15.060> mil<00:01:15.300> 5<00:01:15.780> mil<00:01:16.110> 6<00:01:16.140> mil<00:01:16.860> 8<00:01:17.190> mil

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
inserts for four mil 5 mil 6 mil 8 mil

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.700 
inserts for four mil 5 mil 6 mil 8 mil
10<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.570> 12<00:01:18.960> millimeter<00:01:19.590> bits<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.380> they're<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
10 and 12 millimeter bits so they're the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.430 
10 and 12 millimeter bits so they're the
hardened<00:01:23.280> inserts<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.420> I'll<00:01:24.600> use<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:25.260> my

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
hardened inserts that I'll use with my

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.570 
hardened inserts that I'll use with my
own<00:01:25.590> system<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:28.080> reason<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.710> don't<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.280> this

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
own system the reason I don't like this

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.010 
own system the reason I don't like this
system<00:01:30.030> very<00:01:30.300> much<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:31.730> mainly<00:01:32.730> because<00:01:33.120> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
system very much is mainly because the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.700 
system very much is mainly because the
inserts<00:01:35.690> has<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:36.720> very<00:01:37.080> sloppy<00:01:37.500> fit<00:01:38.450> inside<00:01:39.710> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
inserts has a very sloppy fit inside the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.650 
inserts has a very sloppy fit inside the
actual<00:01:40.860> base<00:01:43.400> so<00:01:44.400> for<00:01:44.880> all<00:01:44.910> these<00:01:45.060> claims<00:01:45.420> of

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
actual base so for all these claims of

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.400 
actual base so for all these claims of
drilling<00:01:46.500> perfect<00:01:46.980> perpendicular<00:01:47.640> holes

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
drilling perfect perpendicular holes

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.740 
drilling perfect perpendicular holes
clearly<00:01:50.150> it's<00:01:51.150> not<00:01:51.300> going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.690> give<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.960> that

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
clearly it's not going to give you that

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.650 
clearly it's not going to give you that
when<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.870> have<00:01:55.050> an<00:01:55.200> insert<00:01:55.620> in<00:01:56.310> our<00:01:56.490> system<00:01:56.970> we

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
when we have an insert in our system we

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:05.330 
when we have an insert in our system we
can<00:01:57.810> also<00:01:57.960> use<00:01:59.630> fences<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:01.730> before<00:02:02.730> and<00:02:04.159> we<00:02:05.159> can

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
can also use fences as before and we can

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.710 
can also use fences as before and we can
use<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.900> various<00:02:07.230> holes<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.740> are<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:07.950> there

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
use the various holes that are on there

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.680 
use the various holes that are on there
to<00:02:09.720> clamp<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.129> work<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.910> an<00:02:12.480> all

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
to clamp this on to the work in an all

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.710 
to clamp this on to the work in an all
number<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.080> different<00:02:13.380> ways<00:02:14.300> or<00:02:15.300> we<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.660> just

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
number of different ways or we can just

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.750 
number of different ways or we can just
clamp<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:17.010> actual<00:02:17.370> block

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
clamp the actual block

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.539 
clamp the actual block
down<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.180> work<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.980> hopefully<00:02:20.400> that

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
down on the work so hopefully that

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.099 
down on the work so hopefully that
explains<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.239> reason<00:02:21.629> for<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.290> hole<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.739> my<00:02:22.860> G
