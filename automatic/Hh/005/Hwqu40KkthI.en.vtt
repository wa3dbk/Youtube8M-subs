00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
think so too the first thing we're going

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.310 
think so too the first thing we're going
to<00:00:31.769> talk<00:00:31.949> about<00:00:32.099> today<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.460> runes<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:34.170> one

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
to talk about today are runes on the one

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.750 
to talk about today are runes on the one
thing<00:00:34.500> you'll<00:00:34.680> notice<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.610> can

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
thing you'll notice is that you can

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.700 
thing you'll notice is that you can
switch<00:00:36.000> between<00:00:36.149> either<00:00:36.630> having<00:00:37.110> armor<00:00:37.469> pen

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
switch between either having armor pen

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.590 
switch between either having armor pen
or<00:00:37.950> attack<00:00:38.250> damage<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.879> really<00:00:39.120> based<00:00:39.360> on

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
or attack damage it's really based on

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.229 
or attack damage it's really based on
who<00:00:39.930> you're<00:00:40.110> playing<00:00:40.290> against<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.250> what<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
who you're playing against and what the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.420 
who you're playing against and what the
enemy<00:00:42.480> team<00:00:42.660> has<00:00:42.960> four<00:00:43.590> more<00:00:43.770> tanky<00:00:44.160> team<00:00:44.399> i

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
enemy team has four more tanky team i

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.819 
enemy team has four more tanky team i
recommend<00:00:45.030> armor<00:00:45.270> pen<00:00:45.510> otherwise<00:00:46.350> i<00:00:46.410> just

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
recommend armor pen otherwise i just

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.560 
recommend armor pen otherwise i just
like<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.039> flat<00:00:47.370> ad<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.030> much<00:00:48.149> better<00:00:48.210> it

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
like the flat ad it is much better it

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.740 
like the flat ad it is much better it
makes<00:00:48.719> clearing<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:50.010> much<00:00:50.190> faster<00:00:50.750> another

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
makes clearing so much faster another

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.229 
makes clearing so much faster another
thing<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.860> swap<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.760> magic

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
thing you can do is swap out your magic

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.470 
thing you can do is swap out your magic
resist<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.199> lose<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.879> change<00:00:56.879> those<00:00:57.059> out<00:00:57.210> for

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
resist up lose and change those out for

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.020 
resist up lose and change those out for
attack<00:00:58.020> speed<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:59.070> attack<00:00:59.370> speed<00:00:59.640> makes<00:00:59.910> you

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
attack speed the attack speed makes you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.119 
attack speed the attack speed makes you
clear<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> little<00:01:00.660> bit<00:01:00.870> faster<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.949> only

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
clear a little bit faster on the only

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.250 
clear a little bit faster on the only
reason<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.550> wouldn't<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.750> enemy

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
reason I wouldn't do it is if the enemy

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.160 
reason I wouldn't do it is if the enemy
team<00:01:04.290> has<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> lot<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> AP<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.960> up

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
team has a lot of AP it's just it's up

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.740 
team has a lot of AP it's just it's up
to<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.470> for<00:01:08.280> me<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.460> prefer<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> magic

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
to you for me I prefer to have the magic

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.920 
to you for me I prefer to have the magic
resist<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.420> tankiness<00:01:12.420> endgame

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
resist I just like the tankiness endgame

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.510 
resist I just like the tankiness endgame
it<00:01:13.560> gives<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> little<00:01:14.130> bit<00:01:14.369> more

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it gives you a little bit more

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.460 
it gives you a little bit more
survivability<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.509> helps<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.290> knock

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
survivability and helps you just knock

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.969 
survivability and helps you just knock

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
two different jungle paths you can go

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.190 
two different jungle paths you can go
obviously<00:01:22.259> blue<00:01:23.159> side<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.610> purple<00:01:23.880> side<00:01:24.200> for

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
blue side you want to start a ground

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.850 
blue side you want to start a ground
smite<00:01:27.000> grom<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:27.990> go<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> blue<00:01:28.650> buff

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
smite grom and then go for a blue buff

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.190 
smite grom and then go for a blue buff
after<00:01:29.820> blue<00:01:30.060> buff<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.450> want<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> go<00:01:30.810> head<00:01:30.990> over

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
after blue buff you want to go head over

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.170 
after blue buff you want to go head over
to<00:01:31.320> read<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:32.100> very<00:01:32.340> important<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.909> remember

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
to read it's very important to remember

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.420 
to read it's very important to remember
that<00:01:33.360> when<00:01:33.840> you're<00:01:33.930> smiting<00:01:34.439> red<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.189> want<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
that when you're smiting red you want to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.609 
that when you're smiting red you want to
do<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> at<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.000> last<00:01:36.299> possible<00:01:36.720> second<00:01:37.350> when

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
do it at the last possible second when

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.370 
do it at the last possible second when
it<00:01:37.829> has<00:01:37.950> an<00:01:38.130> equal<00:01:38.549> health<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:39.000> your<00:01:39.390> smite<00:01:39.810> so

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it has an equal health as your smite so

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.970 
it has an equal health as your smite so
you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.100> most<00:01:41.430> health<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.329> it

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
you can get the most health out of it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.610 
you can get the most health out of it
after<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.090> initial<00:01:44.210> clear<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:45.140> can<00:01:45.320> go<00:01:45.470> do

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
after the initial clear you can go do

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.340 
after the initial clear you can go do
golems<00:01:46.040> or<00:01:46.190> something<00:01:46.930> otherwise<00:01:47.930> it's

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
golems or something otherwise it's

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.930 
golems or something otherwise it's
important<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.830> look<00:01:48.980> around<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.340> map<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.790> see
