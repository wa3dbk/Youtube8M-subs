start<00:02:52.010> up<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.489> baby<00:02:58.120> ok<00:02:59.120> first<00:02:59.360> step<00:03:00.280> let's

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
start up this baby ok first step let's

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.030 
start up this baby ok first step let's
just<00:03:01.489> raise<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.730> legs<00:03:04.329> as<00:03:05.329> you<00:03:05.989> can<00:03:06.290> see<00:03:06.440> he<00:03:06.650> he

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
just raise the legs as you can see he he

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.030 
just raise the legs as you can see he he
will<00:03:07.190> move<00:03:07.400> three<00:03:08.090> legs<00:03:08.359> at<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.750> time<00:03:08.989> on<00:03:09.410> top

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
will move three legs at the time on top

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.449 
will move three legs at the time on top
and<00:03:11.560> then<00:03:12.560> he's<00:03:12.769> going<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:12.980> lower<00:03:13.160> them<00:03:13.430> down

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
and then he's going to lower them down

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.900 
and then he's going to lower them down
and<00:03:14.470> they<00:03:15.470> I'll<00:03:15.709> start<00:03:16.130> preparing<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.820> take

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
and they I'll start preparing to take

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:26.309 
and they I'll start preparing to take
another<00:03:17.180> step

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.619 

like<00:03:27.319> that<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.969> he<00:03:28.969> can<00:03:29.090> also<00:03:29.269> do<00:03:29.540> it

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
like that and he can also do it

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.209 
like that and he can also do it
backwards<00:03:31.120> but<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.239> turning<00:03:32.659> is<00:03:32.920> well<00:03:33.920> it

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:34.219 
backwards but the turning is well it

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.759 
backwards but the turning is well it
tastes<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.790> hell<00:03:35.269> of<00:03:35.299> a<00:03:35.480> lot<00:03:35.599> of<00:03:35.629> time<00:03:35.870> for<00:03:36.590> him

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
tastes a hell of a lot of time for him

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:43.179 
tastes a hell of a lot of time for him
to<00:03:36.799> turn<00:03:37.040> around<00:03:41.409> so<00:03:42.409> let's<00:03:42.769> just<00:03:42.859> keep

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189 
to turn around so let's just keep

00:03:43.189 --> 00:04:09.520 
to turn around so let's just keep
working<00:03:43.730> forward<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.269> little<00:03:44.510> bit

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.750 

there<00:04:10.069> that's<00:04:10.370> about<00:04:10.550> eight<00:04:10.970> or<00:04:11.030> ten<00:04:11.569> steps<00:04:12.760> so

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
there that's about eight or ten steps so

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.440 
there that's about eight or ten steps so
he<00:04:13.910> can<00:04:14.090> move<00:04:14.450> quite<00:04:14.780> well<00:04:15.070> but<00:04:16.070> slowly<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.639> I

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
he can move quite well but slowly and I

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.110 
he can move quite well but slowly and I
will<00:04:17.630> show<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:18.169> little<00:04:18.769> bit<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.459> fast

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
will show you a little bit of fast

00:04:20.120 --> 00:05:08.020 
will show you a little bit of fast
rewinded<00:04:20.840> version<00:04:21.560> of<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.550> working<00:04:23.000> soon

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.090 

so<00:05:09.030> it<00:05:09.150> doesn't<00:05:09.450> move<00:05:09.600> very<00:05:09.720> fast<00:05:10.169> but<00:05:10.410> it<00:05:10.889> will

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
so it doesn't move very fast but it will

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.860 
so it doesn't move very fast but it will
still<00:05:11.370> work<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:12.470> it's<00:05:13.470> safe<00:05:13.980> to<00:05:14.220> use<00:05:14.870> it

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
still work and it's safe to use it

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.060 
still work and it's safe to use it
doesn't<00:05:16.200> fall<00:05:16.410> down<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:18.740> if<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:19.919> add

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
doesn't fall down and if you add

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.850 
doesn't fall down and if you add
something<00:05:20.340> to<00:05:20.520> it<00:05:21.050> it<00:05:22.050> can<00:05:22.350> become<00:05:22.710> very

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
something to it it can become very

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.190 
something to it it can become very
useful<00:05:23.550> also<00:05:24.530> or<00:05:25.530> if<00:05:25.830> you<00:05:25.950> make<00:05:26.160> it<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:27.200> lighter

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
useful also or if you make it a lighter

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.010 
useful also or if you make it a lighter
lighter<00:05:28.740> version<00:05:29.250> of<00:05:29.370> it<00:05:29.600> but<00:05:30.600> this<00:05:30.750> is<00:05:30.870> how

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
lighter version of it but this is how

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.700 
lighter version of it but this is how
the<00:05:31.440> legs<00:05:31.650> will<00:05:32.250> work<00:05:32.690> what's<00:05:33.690> closely<00:05:34.350> how

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
the legs will work what's closely how

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.190 
the legs will work what's closely how
the<00:05:34.770> legs<00:05:35.070> we<00:05:35.280> will<00:05:35.400> move<00:05:35.580> three<00:05:36.570> of<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:37.050> lakes

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
the legs we will move three of the lakes

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.969 
the legs we will move three of the lakes
one<00:05:38.160> from<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.550> side<00:05:38.700> front<00:05:39.690> side<00:05:39.990> and<00:05:40.620> back

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
one from the side front side and back

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:47.360 
one from the side front side and back
will<00:05:41.250> move<00:05:41.430> at<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.700> same<00:05:41.850> time<00:05:45.470> it<00:05:46.470> will<00:05:46.710> raise

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
will move at the same time it will raise

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.000 
will move at the same time it will raise
them<00:05:47.780> three<00:05:48.780> legs<00:05:48.990> will<00:05:49.380> be<00:05:49.560> raised<00:05:50.870> as<00:05:52.010> you

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
them three legs will be raised as you

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:59.330 
them three legs will be raised as you
see<00:05:54.410> here<00:05:55.460> here<00:05:56.460> and<00:05:56.639> here<00:05:57.350> just<00:05:58.350> three<00:05:59.100> legs

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
see here here and here just three legs

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.659 
see here here and here just three legs
supporting<00:05:59.910> them<00:06:00.090> at<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.360> same<00:06:00.510> time<00:06:02.510> and

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
supporting them at the same time and

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.190 
supporting them at the same time and
when<00:06:05.669> he<00:06:05.850> lends<00:06:06.060> them<00:06:06.240> down<00:06:06.600> the<00:06:06.990> other<00:06:07.110> side

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
when he lends them down the other side

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.600 
when he lends them down the other side
other<00:06:07.919> three<00:06:08.580> will<00:06:09.410> start<00:06:10.410> the<00:06:10.560> same<00:06:10.770> project

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
other three will start the same project

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:24.990 
other three will start the same project
again<00:06:18.229> like<00:06:19.229> that

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.220 

so<00:06:26.000> this<00:06:26.450> is<00:06:26.570> my<00:06:28.210> first<00:06:29.210> video<00:06:29.480> on<00:06:29.630> walking

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
so this is my first video on walking

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.840 
so this is my first video on walking
robots<00:06:30.670> or<00:06:31.900> walking<00:06:32.900> rowers<00:06:33.550> what<00:06:34.550> you<00:06:34.670> might

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
robots or walking rowers what you might

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.930 
robots or walking rowers what you might
call<00:06:34.970> them<00:06:35.120> or<00:06:35.990> where<00:06:36.470> he<00:06:36.560> goes<00:06:36.740> such<00:06:36.980> robots

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.070 

let's<00:06:40.940> see<00:06:41.180> what<00:06:41.390> when<00:06:41.870> I<00:06:41.900> can<00:06:42.230> make<00:06:42.440> a<00:06:42.880> either

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
let's see what when I can make a either

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.260 
let's see what when I can make a either
eight-legged<00:06:45.080> 14<00:06:46.010> like<00:06:46.250> at<00:06:46.370> one<00:06:46.580> or<00:06:46.820> two<00:06:46.850> like

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
eight-legged 14 like at one or two like

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.180 
eight-legged 14 like at one or two like
it<00:06:47.420> already<00:06:47.600> if<00:06:48.020> it's<00:06:48.440> too<00:06:48.590> like<00:06:48.770> at<00:06:48.890> one<00:06:49.040> it

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
it already if it's too like at one it

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.360 
it already if it's too like at one it
will<00:06:49.370> be<00:06:49.580> the<00:06:50.030> Metal<00:06:50.300> Gear<00:06:50.330> Rex<00:06:51.100> see<00:06:52.100> you<00:06:52.220> in
