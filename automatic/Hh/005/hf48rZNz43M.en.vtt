00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
courses we offer in our university

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.029

equivalent to courses offered at the
University<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.309> main<00:00:32.489> thing<00:00:32.730> is

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
University I think the main thing is

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.639 
University I think the main thing is
that<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.420> courses<00:00:33.840> are<00:00:33.989> transferable<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
that the courses are transferable the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.770 
that the courses are transferable the
credit<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.910> easily<00:00:36.059> transfer<00:00:36.570> them<00:00:36.750> to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
credit you can easily transfer them to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.260 
credit you can easily transfer them to
other<00:00:37.020> universities<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.950> UBC<00:00:38.520> SFU<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
other universities like UBC SFU the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.299 
other universities like UBC SFU the
larger<00:00:39.570> ones<00:00:39.750> most<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.500> our<00:00:40.620> students<00:00:41.100> will

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
larger ones most of our students will

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.520 
larger ones most of our students will
take<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:41.940> example<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.750> year<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.350> business

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
take for example one year of business

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.910 
take for example one year of business
with<00:00:44.370> us<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.329> go<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.230> university<00:00:46.800> as

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
with us and then go on to university as

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
with us and then go on to university as
2nd<00:00:47.309> year<00:00:47.430> students<00:00:47.940> our<00:00:48.270> particular

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
2nd year students our particular

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.750 
2nd year students our particular
specialization<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.370> international

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
specialization is for international

specialization is for international
students<00:00:51.480> when<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:51.870> first<00:00:52.140> arrived<00:00:52.530> in

students when they first arrived in
Canada<00:00:53.070> they're<00:00:53.789> perhaps<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.809> familiar<00:00:55.260> with

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620

Canada they're perhaps not familiar with
the<00:00:55.800> Canadian<00:00:56.280> system<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.940> really<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:57.809> it's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the Canadian system I really think it's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.750 
the Canadian system I really think it's
it's<00:00:58.230> very<00:00:58.350> very<00:00:58.890> difficult<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.489> make<00:00:59.640> an

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it's very very difficult to make an

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.580 
it's very very difficult to make an
adjustment<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.930> international<00:01:01.559> student

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
adjustment for an international student

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.509 
adjustment for an international student
to<00:01:02.100> go<00:01:02.370> into<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> these<00:01:03.239> big<00:01:03.600> universities

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
to go into one of these big universities

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.179 
to go into one of these big universities
30,000<00:01:05.519> students<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.270> huge<00:01:06.659> adjustment

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
30,000 students it's a huge adjustment
