00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
their light they'll get overwhelmed if

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.650 
their light they'll get overwhelmed if
they<00:04:32.280> get<00:04:32.400> into<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.580> fight<00:04:32.850> with<00:04:33.000> them<00:04:33.240> guys<00:04:33.360> so

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
they get into a fight with them guys so

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.990

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
back them up as well and then your

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.689 
back them up as well and then your
general<00:04:37.770> should<00:04:37.949> hopefully<00:04:38.130> still<00:04:38.490> be<00:04:38.610> around

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
general should hopefully still be around

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.210 
general should hopefully still be around
so<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:38.970> have<00:04:39.210> him<00:04:39.449> gage<00:04:40.110> as<00:04:40.290> well<00:04:40.470> if<00:04:40.800> units

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
so you have him gage as well if units

are<00:04:41.310> withdrawing<00:04:41.669> they're<00:04:42.000> still<00:04:42.270> in<00:04:42.389> a

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
are withdrawing they're still in a

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.300 
are withdrawing they're still in a
cohesive<00:04:42.750> form<00:04:43.169> so<00:04:43.620> that's<00:04:43.949> when<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.160> use

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
cohesive form so that's when you use

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.520 
cohesive form so that's when you use
your<00:04:44.520> general<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.660> basically<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.139> know<00:04:46.199> flank

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530

them and attack it from the site the

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.189 
them and attack it from the site the
reason<00:04:48.180> why<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.300> take<00:04:48.479> them<00:04:48.600> from<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.810> size<00:04:49.020> of

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
reason why I take them from the size of

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.620 
reason why I take them from the size of
generals<00:04:49.530> because<00:04:49.860> then<00:04:50.550> you're<00:04:50.970> your<00:04:51.449> guys

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
generals because then you're your guys

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
are attacking from the flank as well if

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.600 
are attacking from the flank as well if
you<00:04:53.820> just<00:04:53.970> try<00:04:54.090> to<00:04:54.120> attack<00:04:54.389> from<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.630> rear

you just try to attack from the rear

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.830 
you just try to attack from the rear
then<00:04:56.610> guess<00:04:56.760> what<00:04:56.850> all<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.180> guys<00:04:57.270> are<00:04:57.449> facing

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
then guess what all the guys are facing

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.230 
then guess what all the guys are facing
your<00:04:58.530> guys<00:04:58.889> and<00:04:59.220> it's<00:04:59.430> like<00:04:59.550> Canada's<00:04:59.940> work<00:05:00.090> so

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
your guys and it's like Canada's work so

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.450 
your guys and it's like Canada's work so
well<00:05:00.419> so<00:05:01.110> that<00:05:01.530> is<00:05:01.740> my<00:05:01.889> hand<00:05:02.130> for<00:05:02.250> an<00:05:02.340> anvil

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
well so that is my hand for an anvil

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.820 
well so that is my hand for an anvil
tactic<00:05:02.970> you<00:05:03.510> know<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:03.870> as<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.110> see<00:05:04.289> you<00:05:04.680> will

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
tactic you know and as you see you will

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.310 
tactic you know and as you see you will
do<00:05:04.919> a<00:05:04.949> clean<00:05:05.370> sweep<00:05:05.729> of<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.030> map<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.479> can<00:05:07.080> be

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
do a clean sweep of the map you can be

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.409 
do a clean sweep of the map you can be
greatly<00:05:07.860> outnumbered<00:05:08.340> like<00:05:08.639> ten<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:08.970> one<00:05:09.150> even

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
greatly outnumbered like ten to one even

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.229 
greatly outnumbered like ten to one even
and<00:05:09.539> you<00:05:09.870> will<00:05:10.020> succeed
