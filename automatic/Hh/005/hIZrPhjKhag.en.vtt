today<00:01:44.520> against<00:01:44.850> us<00:01:45.030> hopes<00:01:45.299> he<00:01:45.420> looked<00:01:45.600> very

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
today against us hopes he looked very

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.160 
today against us hopes he looked very
strong<00:01:46.640> I'm<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.060> think<00:01:48.329> he<00:01:48.600> already<00:01:48.840> lost

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
strong I'm see I think he already lost

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.039 
strong I'm see I think he already lost
to<00:01:49.409> TIA<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.979> second<00:01:50.250> group<00:01:50.369> stage<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.049> not

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
to TIA on the second group stage so not

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.020 
to TIA on the second group stage so not
looking<00:01:52.170> too<00:01:52.409> strong<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.340> definitely<00:01:53.729> he

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
looking too strong so it's definitely he

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.560 
looking too strong so it's definitely he
on<00:01:54.119> favor<00:01:54.750> here<00:01:55.079> yeah<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.700> too<00:01:56.729> it's

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
on favor here yeah I think so too it's

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.280 
on favor here yeah I think so too it's
it's<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.619> MCS<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> shape<00:02:00.180> he<00:02:00.360> was<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
it's not like MCS and the shape he was a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.580 
it's not like MCS and the shape he was a
while<00:02:02.009> ago<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:03.810> mean<00:02:04.049> he's<00:02:04.170> still<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> good

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
while ago and I mean he's still a good

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.950 
while ago and I mean he's still a good
player<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.219> he<00:02:06.180> will<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.360> tough<00:02:06.689> times

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
player but he will have tough times

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.990 
player but he will have tough times
beating<00:02:07.380> him<00:02:07.560> its<00:02:07.860> best<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.220> five<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.910> you

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
beating him its best of five do you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.300 
beating him its best of five do you
think<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.420> might<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.720> worse<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.170> him<00:02:10.530> yeah

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
think this might be worse for him yeah

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.260 
think this might be worse for him yeah
yeah<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.670> agree

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
yeah I agree

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.870 
yeah I agree
just<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.160> more<00:02:15.310> favored<00:02:15.490> one<00:02:15.670> players

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
just like the more favored one players

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.780 
just like the more favored one players
always<00:02:16.660> with<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.020> high<00:02:17.680> amount<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.100> maps<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.670> be

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
always with a high amount of maps to be

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.300 
always with a high amount of maps to be
played<00:02:19.030> at<00:02:19.780> favors<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.320> favor<00:02:20.500> even<00:02:20.980> more<00:02:21.100> so

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
played at favors the favor even more so

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.670 
played at favors the favor even more so
I'd<00:02:21.460> say<00:02:21.730> has<00:02:22.390> ever<00:02:22.600> looking<00:02:22.810> before<00:02:22.990> young<00:02:23.470> I

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
think so too in the best afraid that

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.810 
think so too in the best afraid that
could<00:02:26.320> be<00:02:26.440> too<00:02:26.650> good<00:02:26.770> all<00:02:26.920> ends<00:02:27.100> from<00:02:27.280> MC<00:02:27.610> he's

what did I always do you think he go he
goes<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.720> semi-final<00:04:20.470> oh<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:21.880> sure<00:04:22.510> don't

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
goes to the semi-final oh I sure don't

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.000 
goes to the semi-final oh I sure don't
think<00:04:22.870> so<00:04:23.050> about<00:04:23.320> it

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
think so about it

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.190 
think so about it
along<00:04:25.580> with<00:04:25.610> Yun<00:04:26.060> probably<00:04:26.540> like<00:04:26.780> those<00:04:26.990> two

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
along with Yun probably like those two

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.390 
along with Yun probably like those two
would<00:04:27.350> be<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.590> favorites<00:04:27.890> me<00:04:28.070> in<00:04:28.130> this<00:04:28.220> event

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
would be the favorites me in this event

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.520 
would be the favorites me in this event
so<00:04:29.390> it's<00:04:29.420> going<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:29.780> be<00:04:29.840> very<00:04:29.870> touched<00:04:30.260> tough

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
so it's going to be very touched tough

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:38.260 
so it's going to be very touched tough
match<00:04:31.160> Ryan<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.670> now<00:04:32.620> Susie<00:04:35.140> I<00:04:36.310> think<00:04:37.310> they're

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
match Ryan and now Susie I think they're

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.000 
match Ryan and now Susie I think they're
listening<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.870> many<00:04:39.020> possibilities<00:04:39.380> do<00:04:39.800> some

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
listening to many possibilities do some

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.560 
listening to many possibilities do some
kind<00:04:40.190> of<00:04:40.300> conflict<00:04:41.300> or<00:04:41.630> all<00:04:41.900> in<00:04:42.110> its<00:04:42.260> place<00:04:42.470> so

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
kind of conflict or all in its place so

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.150
