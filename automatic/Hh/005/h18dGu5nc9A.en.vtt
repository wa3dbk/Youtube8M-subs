00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
very hard for me to be calm sometimes I

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.259 
very hard for me to be calm sometimes I
will<00:02:48.390> get<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:48.900> hyper<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:49.980> crazy<00:02:50.340> going<00:02:51.000> on

the<00:02:52.170> 6th<00:02:52.470> grade<00:02:52.680> comes<00:02:53.010> along<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:55.200> was

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the 6th grade comes along and this was

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.740 
the 6th grade comes along and this was
the<00:02:55.800> type<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.040> school<00:02:56.489> where<00:02:56.640> we<00:02:56.790> had<00:02:56.970> periods

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the type of school where we had periods

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.530 
the type of school where we had periods
and<00:02:57.989> stuff<00:02:58.380> not<00:02:59.190> like<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.610> minstrel<00:03:00.030> cycle

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
and stuff not like the minstrel cycle

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.650 
and stuff not like the minstrel cycle
but<00:03:00.780> actual<00:03:01.739> like<00:03:02.100> class<00:03:02.489> period<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.390> think

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
but actual like class period and I think

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.660 
but actual like class period and I think
there<00:03:03.870> was<00:03:04.080> four<00:03:04.530> or<00:03:04.709> five<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:05.250> we<00:03:05.400> had<00:03:05.580> to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
there was four or five that we had to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.220 
there was four or five that we had to
change<00:03:05.970> through<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:06.420> there<00:03:06.600> was<00:03:06.720> three<00:03:07.050> or

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
change through so there was three or

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.520 
change through so there was three or
four<00:03:07.260> teachers<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:08.220> we<00:03:08.370> had<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.500> none<00:03:10.500> of

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
four teachers that we had and none of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.070 
four teachers that we had and none of
them<00:03:10.890> liked<00:03:11.220> me

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
them liked me

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.280 
them liked me
I<00:03:13.610> think<00:03:14.610> only<00:03:14.910> like<00:03:15.239> one<00:03:15.510> teacher<00:03:15.840> really

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
I think only like one teacher really

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.410 
I think only like one teacher really
liked<00:03:16.530> me<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.100> my<00:03:17.640> bus<00:03:17.910> driver

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
liked me and my bus driver

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.699 
liked me and my bus driver
but<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.470> was<00:03:19.650> about<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.519> would<00:03:20.850> say<00:03:21.060> I'd<00:03:21.209> be

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
but that was about it I would say I'd be

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.039 
but that was about it I would say I'd be
1112<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.070> sixth<00:03:23.370> grade<00:03:23.640> I'm<00:03:23.970> not<00:03:24.239> too<00:03:24.450> sure<00:03:24.750> I

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049
