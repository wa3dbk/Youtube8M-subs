00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:33.270
 the jo is the son who in all being 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 who are nothing else 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.010
 so today if it's not a 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.720
 technique I will introduce but rather 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.070
 to play the major title sales 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.340
 walk for toddlers as well 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.680
 lost you and me but it's true that 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.500
 a lot of people ask me on skype 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.830
 in the comments on youtube or on 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.430
 the xbox with such player we can make 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.860
 resale purchase 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.620
 maj and I told myself why not do 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.420
 a video for to answer your you 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.250
 all and not each time sent a 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.620
 message to everyone because yes it is 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.030
 very very boring so here I preferred 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.320
 really explain to you all I think 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.430
 that really you have seen that there is 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.560
 many people who ask me to 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.909
 every time which player to use so 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.350
 I can not necessarily answer every 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.080
 time to everyone so listen 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.549
 first player kim kallstrom the swedish 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.440
 from spartak moscow 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.670
 so here is a very very good player for 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.900
 the resale purchase you can also the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.070
 look in excess there is way to do 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.450
 very good deals 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.130
 so that's the view that costs around 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.230
 4 min credit is really way to get 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.230
 make good profits 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.960
 excuse me next player this is a 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.090
 Belgian or embarked nice 1st league in 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.550
 Guillou lighted estrie it is bronze 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.490
 the blair has obviously young 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.470
 jeanne use so here is a player in 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.840
 bronze that still costs 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.250
 around 13 14 me credit in syria 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.580
 that it's very expensive for a player in 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.080
 bronze 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.510
 but it is true that there is really a way 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.400
 to do good business on given 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.560
 that it is true that I have a little bit 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.330
 there are quite a few on the market and then 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.640
 that's everybody and not do do 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.319
 do on the bronze players so so 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.940
 here it is I have already managed to 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.610
 do a lot of good business on him 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.260
 so it's a 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.780
 that I advise you obviously 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.910
 then next players again 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.370
 a Belgian this time he he plays in 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.860
 easy team at psv eindhoven it's a 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.260
 Belgian nugget and I speak obviously 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.570
 of bakkali guys so bakkali costs 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.190
 around 7 me credit so that's it 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.260
 it's a stadium and you can 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.790
 look also had it or mde 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.400
 there is really a way to be very 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.580
 very good deals with him that's true 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.500
 he is very young and there is 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.850
 inherits aims there is not really 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.400
 a lot of choices so here you go 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.110
 it's the right side yace ago 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.760
 almost bakkali so that's why 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.489
 that with him there is really a way to 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.930
 to make good business and do not hesitate 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:56.350
 especially not to test it in game too 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.350
 because he was dead it's a day 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.950
 it's a Roman player who plays at 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:05.719
 stuttgart guys so that's it 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.280
 maxime you could see I was going 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.140
 jane I had already used it in my 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.159
 novel last episode of thunes 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.129
 formally from what they listen to in 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.689
 around the 4 5 credits and 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.189
 do not hesitate to look for it in mc 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.959
 omdc even down 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.010
 do not hesitate to actually use 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.269
 the technique of phase changes 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.950

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.609
 great with all the players these 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.189
 technical changes of position and 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.989
 I really invite you to go see her if 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.090

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.099
 really way to do very good 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.209
 business on it do not hesitate 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.650
 also she seeks in excess that's true 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.139
 that most of the business that I have 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.389
 done on him he was m so that's it 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.730
 go go take a ride on on boca 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.000
 and you will see that there is really 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.000
 way to do very good business 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.669
 following players it's a nahd and he 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.979
 plays in Bundesliga in Stuttgart 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.870

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.360
 look at 1 md and I already really 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.120

 he is playing atletico mineiro 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.880
 everyone comes everyone sees 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.250

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.199
 ronaldinho there guys the legend 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.990
 alive then ronaldinho cases and 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.669
 costs almost nothing but it is very very 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.320
 good for the technique of changes of 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.720
 post so that's so especially hesitate 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.909
 not seek to b taken even when 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.380

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.930

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.500
 a turn at ronaldinho next player 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.990
 it's benteke as we can see 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.240
 benteke in my series recounts a form 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.490
 lewandowski I say it often but more 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.310
 in enamels is to see in has one is a 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.970
 little like lukaku in fact and that's 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.590
 really what I advise you 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.090
 to go for a ride on the benteke in 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.010
 mcm also there is really way to do 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.990
 very good deals 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.130
 player following a cheek at lazio rome 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.920
 he is Brazilian 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.630
 he is m basic ruler and he is in gold 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.830
 I am obviously talking about hernanes 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.300
 with its four gesture stars 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.040
 five-star technical bad foot 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.750
 he is a player who leaves very well 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.130
 since it is broken although 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.780
 plus he has five bad foot stars 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.530
 do not hesitate to look for it in 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.810
 mdc we like ocean busa really tried 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.130
 all possible positions 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.390
 and as I told you it's really 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.130
 use the technique of changes of 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.340
 post especially all the players that I 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:53.080
 you presented next player this is 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.820
 a md who plays in liga bbva attention 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.920
 maybe see who I'm talking about not 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.190
 trailing the Croatian it's not a 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.010
 mtpa md CRMC pardon excuse me he plays 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.870
 enough life etc rakitic booster so I 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.260
 use them in my last episode of 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.760
 my king everything and it's true that after I 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.620
 told myself I was going to try on my 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.240
 main account and rakitic for the purchase 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.950
 resale boost one I was well boosted 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.720
 even if the normal it works it can 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.490
 also walk but the booster guys 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.500
 it works a crazy thing so go 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.300
 take a ride on the side of rakitic booster 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.580
 because frankly in resale purchase 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.910
 with rakitic booster I already 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.910
 made 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.990
 is easy said even credit just on him 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.169
 in one day so so do not hesitate 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.759
 especially not to go for a ride 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.400

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:52.780
 it is true that this video purchase 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.180
 resale on took me a lot of time 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.919
