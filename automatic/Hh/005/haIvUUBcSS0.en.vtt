a short Kenichi haul this November
December<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:21.180> thought<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.510> would<00:00:21.570> be<00:00:21.720> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
December and I thought it would be a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.840 
December and I thought it would be a
good<00:00:21.960> idea<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:23.070> try<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.310> make<00:00:23.430> something

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
good idea to just try and make something

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.630 
good idea to just try and make something
in<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.810> sock<00:00:25.019> puppet<00:00:25.050> line<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.460> do

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
either at home or in class so to give

to the side or a little bit spike here

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.780 
to the side or a little bit spike here
or<00:01:24.150> could<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.320> mouth<00:01:26.009> be<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> little<00:01:26.670> bit

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
trying to do there is completely change

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.999 
trying to do there is completely change
your<00:01:35.970> design<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:37.619> becomes

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
your design so that it then becomes

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.490 
your design so that it then becomes
something<00:01:38.159> else<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.970> evolves<00:01:39.540> into<00:01:39.720> another

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
something else it evolves into another

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.940 
something else it evolves into another
character<00:01:41.490> by<00:01:41.909> simply<00:01:42.420> doing<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.799> what

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
character by simply doing that so what

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.969 
character by simply doing that so what
I've<00:01:44.130> got<00:01:44.159> here<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> few<00:01:45.479> M<00:01:46.170> bits<00:01:46.770> and

what I've done here is I've taken an
ordinary<00:03:02.980> sock<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.550> on<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.420> inside<00:03:05.020> I've<00:03:05.320> cut

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
ordinary sock and on the inside I've cut

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.490 
ordinary sock and on the inside I've cut
out<00:03:05.770> a<00:03:05.920> piece<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.340> card<00:03:06.750> which<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.989> shape

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
out a piece of card which is the shape

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.910 
out a piece of card which is the shape
here<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.209> looks<00:03:10.270> a<00:03:10.600> little<00:03:10.690> bit<00:03:11.380> like<00:03:11.860> a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
here so it looks a little bit like a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.090 
here so it looks a little bit like a
mouth<00:03:12.310> but<00:03:12.550> it's<00:03:12.730> quite<00:03:13.000> flat<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.720> I've<00:03:14.650> stuck

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
mouth but it's quite flat and I've stuck

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.850 
mouth but it's quite flat and I've stuck
that<00:03:15.489> piece<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:15.970> card<00:03:16.270> on<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.200> end<00:03:17.410> of<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
that piece of card on to the end of the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.640 
that piece of card on to the end of the
sock<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.549> that's<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.510> nice<00:03:19.720> sheet<00:03:20.080> for<00:03:20.350> you<00:03:20.470> to

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
sock and that's a nice sheet for you to

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.199 
sock and that's a nice sheet for you to
hold<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.160> it's<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.370> little<00:03:21.610> bit<00:03:21.760> firmer<00:03:22.030> than

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
hold and it's a little bit firmer than

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.710 
hold and it's a little bit firmer than
the<00:03:22.450> sock<00:03:22.690> itself<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.489> would<00:03:24.640> then<00:03:24.880> fold

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
the sock itself so you would then fold

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.500 
the sock itself so you would then fold
the<00:03:26.170> sock<00:03:26.440> back<00:03:26.739> over<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.519> piece<00:03:28.360> of

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
cardboard that you've put in here and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.449 
cardboard that you've put in here and
set<00:03:30.580> it<00:03:30.610> in<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.209> then<00:03:32.080> on<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.590> inside<00:03:33.190> I've

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
set it in and then on the inside I've

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.650 
set it in and then on the inside I've
also<00:03:33.810> glued<00:03:34.810> in<00:03:35.049> a<00:03:35.410> little<00:03:35.980> mouth<00:03:36.450> now<00:03:37.450> your

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
also glued in a little mouth now your

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.390 
also glued in a little mouth now your
mouth<00:03:37.900> doesn't<00:03:38.260> necessarily<00:03:38.769> have<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:38.920> be<00:03:39.070> red

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
mouth doesn't necessarily have to be red

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.360 
mouth doesn't necessarily have to be red
you<00:03:40.090> could<00:03:40.299> take<00:03:40.540> another<00:03:41.170> piece<00:03:41.500> of<00:03:41.709> felt

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
you could take another piece of felt

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.970 
you could take another piece of felt
another<00:03:42.730> color<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.450> try<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.200> apply<00:03:44.470> that<00:03:44.500> to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
another color and try and apply that to

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.680 
another color and try and apply that to
your<00:03:45.040> sock<00:03:45.370> again<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:46.030> make<00:03:46.180> something<00:03:46.660> a

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
your sock again to make something a

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.170 
your sock again to make something a
little<00:03:46.930> bit<00:03:47.080> different<00:03:47.769> more<00:03:48.400> alien<00:03:48.940> or

something<00:03:50.170> from<00:03:50.530> another<00:03:50.769> planet<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.750> that's

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
something from another planet so that's

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.320 
something from another planet so that's
the<00:03:53.140> basic<00:03:53.590> sheet<00:03:53.890> for<00:03:54.250> your<00:03:54.459> sock<00:03:54.730> puppet<00:03:54.760> so

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
if it did have here would you have

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.480 
if it did have here would you have
something<00:04:49.710> on<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.640> here<00:04:50.910> perhaps<00:04:51.600> a<00:04:51.750> ball

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
something on the here perhaps a ball

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.550 
something on the here perhaps a ball
something<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.820> stand<00:04:54.030> out<00:04:54.420> is<00:04:54.840> you<00:04:55.050> puppet

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
something to stand out is you puppet

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.860 
something to stand out is you puppet
doing<00:04:56.220> something<00:04:56.700> special<00:04:57.270> that<00:04:57.300> your<00:04:57.510> puppet
