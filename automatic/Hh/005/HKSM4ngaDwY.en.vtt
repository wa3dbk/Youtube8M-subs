00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
have stopped much much earlier so it is

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.870 
have stopped much much earlier so it is

the message which you must do something
is<00:01:49.020> wrong<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.520> Artic<00:01:50.940> changes<00:01:51.330> can

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
is wrong because the Artic changes can

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.530 
is wrong because the Artic changes can
