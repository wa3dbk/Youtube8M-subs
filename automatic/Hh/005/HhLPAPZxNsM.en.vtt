00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
the pickup now we may see it be a little

erratic at first no problem there times

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.500 
erratic at first no problem there times
we've<00:00:46.350> got<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> tweak<00:00:47.010> where<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.969> pickup<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.480> on

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
we've got a tweak where the pickup is on

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
we've got a tweak where the pickup is on
the<00:00:48.780> alternator<00:00:49.260> when<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.620> find<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.070> sweet

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the alternator when we find that sweet

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.979 
the alternator when we find that sweet
spot<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> fall<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.780> line

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
spot it's going to fall right in line

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.439 
spot it's going to fall right in line
now<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:52.980> your<00:00:53.129> alternator<00:00:53.579> spins<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
now because your alternator spins at a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.150 
now because your alternator spins at a
different<00:00:55.110> rate<00:00:55.260> than<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.559> crank<00:00:55.890> we're

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
different rate than the crank we're

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.029 
different rate than the crank we're
going<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> need<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.000> calibrate<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.690> tach<00:00:58.050> we

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
going to need to calibrate the tach we

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
going to need to calibrate the tach we
can<00:00:59.190> open<00:00:59.399> up<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> back<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> case<00:01:00.539> here

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
can open up the back of the case here

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.560 
can open up the back of the case here
it's<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.440> bolt<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.359> you'll<00:01:03.359> see

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
it's just one bolt and you'll see

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.230 
it's just one bolt and you'll see
there's<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.809> there's<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.439> small<00:01:04.799> hole<00:01:05.100> where<00:01:06.090> we

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
there's a there's a small hole where we

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.539 
there's a there's a small hole where we
insert<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.990> screwdriver<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.920> inside<00:01:08.340> there's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
insert a screwdriver the inside there's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.030 
insert a screwdriver the inside there's
a<00:01:08.610> set<00:01:08.909> screw<00:01:09.210> we're<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.170> turn<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.590> and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
a set screw we're going to turn that and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.760 
a set screw we're going to turn that and
adjust<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.670> now<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.390> use<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> strobe<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
adjust it now you can use a strobe or a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.999 
adjust it now you can use a strobe or a
scam<00:01:14.159> tool<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.320> we<00:01:16.320> started<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:16.979> a

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
scam tool to get that we started with a

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.880 
scam tool to get that we started with a
scam<00:01:17.400> tool<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:19.710> get

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
scam tool here and you can see we get

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.749 
scam tool here and you can see we get
that<00:01:20.130> matched<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:22.220> there's<00:01:23.220> our<00:01:23.520> sweet

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
that matched up and there's our sweet

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.490 
that matched up and there's our sweet
spot<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.150> there<00:01:24.570> now<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:24.780> also<00:01:24.930> tried<00:01:25.290> two

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
spot right there now we also tried two

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.200 
spot right there now we also tried two
different<00:01:25.530> diesel<00:01:26.220> strokes<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.909> monarch

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
different diesel strokes if the monarch

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.630 
different diesel strokes if the monarch
PT<00:01:27.900> 99<00:01:28.560> she<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> little<00:01:29.280> more<00:01:29.400> expensive

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
PT 99 she was a little more expensive

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.929 
PT 99 she was a little more expensive
and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> unity<00:01:31.710> which<00:01:32.610> was<00:01:32.790> our

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
and then we have the unity which was our

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.960 
and then we have the unity which was our
budget<00:01:33.420> model<00:01:34.009> both<00:01:35.009> required<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.579> piece<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
budget model both required a piece of

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.420 
budget model both required a piece of
reflective<00:01:36.540> tape<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.110> installed<00:01:37.530> onto<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
reflective tape to be installed onto the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.460 
reflective tape to be installed onto the
crank<00:01:38.700> pulley<00:01:38.970> you'd<00:01:39.540> see<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.930> right<00:01:40.170> there

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
crank pulley you'd see that right there

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.100 
crank pulley you'd see that right there
now<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.009> unity<00:01:41.579> was<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> little<00:01:42.540> bit<00:01:42.720> harder<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
now the unity was a little bit harder to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.719 
now the unity was a little bit harder to
get<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> signal<00:01:43.740> didn't<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.070> quite<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.460> wide

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
get the signal didn't have quite as wide

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.389 
get the signal didn't have quite as wide
of<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:45.000> dispersion<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.649> laser<00:01:46.860> pattern

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
of a dispersion of the laser pattern
