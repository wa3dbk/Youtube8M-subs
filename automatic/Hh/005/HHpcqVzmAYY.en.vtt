recipes<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.309> my<00:00:14.429> blender<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.150> how<00:00:15.299> it

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
recipes in my blender and this is how it

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.260 
recipes in my blender and this is how it
starts<00:00:16.289> first<00:00:16.650> off<00:00:16.920> you've<00:00:17.550> got<00:00:17.820> your<00:00:18.060> water

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
starts first off you've got your water

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.720 
starts first off you've got your water
water<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.020> important<00:00:19.680> because<00:00:19.949> since<00:00:20.580> you're

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
water is important because since you're

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.880 
water is important because since you're
not<00:00:20.850> juicing<00:00:21.510> you're<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.650> put

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
not juicing you're going to have to put

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.830 
not juicing you're going to have to put
in<00:00:23.039> some<00:00:23.250> liquid<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.730> kind<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.750> know

put<00:00:27.960> ice<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.380> there<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.680> because<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.369> does

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
put ice in there is because what it does

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.910 
put ice in there is because what it does
it<00:00:29.760> keeps<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.330> cool<00:00:30.630> as<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:30.900> blender<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.650> like

give it that punch of a lemon flavor as
well<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.290> nutrients<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.310> are<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
well as the nutrients that are in the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.200 
well as the nutrients that are in the
skin<00:01:12.229> last<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.590> least<00:01:13.920> apples<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.090> there

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
skin last but not least apples in there

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.570 
skin last but not least apples in there
just<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.659> would<00:01:16.049> any<00:01:16.320> kind<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.770> juicer<00:01:17.280> on

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
just like I would any kind of juicer on

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.490 
just like I would any kind of juicer on
mixture<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> give<00:01:19.409> you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
mixture this is just going to give you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.100 
mixture this is just going to give you
the<00:01:19.619> sweetness<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.520> you're<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.659> need

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the sweetness and you're going to need

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.770 
the sweetness and you're going to need
less<00:01:22.619> apples<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.729> make<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.119> green<00:01:24.450> juice

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
less apples to make this green juice

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.160 
less apples to make this green juice
because<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:26.400> gives<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> lot<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.390> body<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
because this gives it a lot of body and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.810 
because this gives it a lot of body and
sometimes<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.890> actually<00:01:29.310> makes<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.640> too

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
sometimes this actually makes it too

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.510 
sometimes this actually makes it too
thick<00:01:30.150> first<00:01:30.570> off<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.170> lot<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> blending

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
thick first off a lot of blending

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.730 
thick first off a lot of blending
recipes<00:01:33.210> will<00:01:33.479> tell<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> put<00:01:34.110> your<00:01:34.140> greens

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
recipes will tell you to put your greens

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.730 
recipes will tell you to put your greens
in<00:01:34.979> first<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.729> agree<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.380> this

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
in first I agree with that but in this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.249 
in first I agree with that but in this
case<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.579> actually<00:01:39.119> put<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.659> some<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
case I actually put in some of the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.920 
case I actually put in some of the
solids<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.000> reason<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.540> when<00:01:42.810> it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
solids in with it the reason is when it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.350 
solids in with it the reason is when it
starts<00:01:43.259> blending<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:44.040> nice<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> blades

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
starts blending it's nice for the blades

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.330 
starts blending it's nice for the blades
that<00:01:45.689> actually<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.259> something<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.829> catch<00:01:47.070> on

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
that actually have something to catch on

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.179 
that actually have something to catch on
other<00:01:47.610> than<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.869> water<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.920> Leafs

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
other than just the water and the Leafs

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.520 
other than just the water and the Leafs
I'm<00:01:50.549> using<00:01:50.880> spinach<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.140> would<00:01:52.320> suggest

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
I'm using spinach and I would suggest

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.130 
I'm using spinach and I would suggest
using<00:01:52.979> more<00:01:53.369> spinach<00:01:53.909> than<00:01:54.210> any<00:01:54.600> other<00:01:54.869> leaf

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
using more spinach than any other leaf

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.830 
using more spinach than any other leaf
because<00:01:55.470> when<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.219> blends<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.969> flavors

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
because when it blends the flavors

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.920 
because when it blends the flavors
really<00:01:58.290> are<00:01:58.619> palatable<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.520> it<00:02:00.479> actually

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
really are palatable and it actually

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.530 
really are palatable and it actually
blends<00:02:01.439> very<00:02:01.829> smooth<00:02:02.159> put<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> lemon

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
and then the solids up top to help push

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.699 
and then the solids up top to help push
it<00:02:33.250> down<00:02:33.580> very<00:02:34.390> important<00:02:34.900> when<00:02:35.020> blending<00:02:35.560> so

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
it down very important when blending so

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.250 
it down very important when blending so
now<00:02:35.830> let's<00:02:36.130> go<00:02:36.310> ahead<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.700> hit<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.060> button

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.690 

okay<00:02:41.260> sometimes<00:02:41.739> you<00:02:41.890> actually<00:02:42.040> have<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.430> push

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
okay sometimes you actually have to push

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:52.940 
okay sometimes you actually have to push
it<00:02:42.880> down<00:02:43.470> cut<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.830> night

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.150 

so<00:02:53.520> we<00:02:53.730> got<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.120> green<00:02:54.540> juice<00:02:54.840> mixture<00:02:55.410> test

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
so we got a green juice mixture test

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.910 
so we got a green juice mixture test
this<00:02:57.030> out<00:02:57.270> with<00:02:57.510> your<00:02:57.630> blender<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.349> would

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
this out with your blender I would

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.220 
this out with your blender I would
suggest<00:02:59.130> not<00:02:59.430> putting<00:02:59.910> as<00:03:00.060> much<00:03:00.390> in<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.930> made

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
suggest not putting as much in I made

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.059 
suggest not putting as much in I made
enough<00:03:01.560> for<00:03:02.130> two<00:03:02.190> people<00:03:02.730> here<00:03:03.630> as<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.890> can

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
enough for two people here as you can

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.920 
enough for two people here as you can
see<00:03:05.220> it's<00:03:05.340> nice<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.880> smooth<00:03:06.209> it's<00:03:06.569> almost

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
see it's nice and smooth it's almost

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.720 
see it's nice and smooth it's almost
just<00:03:07.050> like<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.440> juice<00:03:07.830> depending<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.520> how

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
just like a juice depending on how

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.180 
just like a juice depending on how

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
proper your blender is you can probably

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.370 
proper your blender is you can probably
get<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.640> same<00:03:11.850> consistency<00:03:12.510> what's<00:03:13.140> nice

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
get the same consistency what's nice

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.229 
get the same consistency what's nice
about<00:03:13.410> this<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.160> can<00:03:14.430> just<00:03:14.550> put<00:03:14.819> this<00:03:14.970> into
