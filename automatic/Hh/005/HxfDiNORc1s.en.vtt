00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.589
 hello everyone welcome back to a 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.720
 more chapter of the harbor at home here I 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.950
 you have with the seeds that we plant in 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.949
 the previous chapter that are already 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.900
 turned into beautiful campuses in the 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.640
 today's chapter we will discuss the parties 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.080
 that make up these campuses as 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.080
 transplanted and how 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.790
 in the previous chapter we sow many 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.220
 first campuses of the autumn study 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.290
 you will remember that we have directly in 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.570
 lands what the radishes give the 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.580
 Mallorca's long summers moved and 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.160
 being longer than if I like it a lot 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.610
 eat it with a recent paella in 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.840
 our little ones and the obstacles 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.450
 we sing all those plants that 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.250
 they need first individualized oscar 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.560
 for then you're singing the ones in the garden 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.600
 and as you can see, almost all 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.000
 today I wanted to tell you about the phases of 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.729
 these little seedlings when they are so 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.369
 young people the first thing we see appear 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.650
 from our genius are the leaves 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.110
 embryonic and embryonic leaves 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.050
 are true leaves are some leaves that 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.940
 they serve us so that the plant has 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.479
 enough nutrients for this first 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.090
 completion phase these sheets do not 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.100
 they look like the final sheets that will have 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.750
 each of our plants and sometimes 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.850
 they can confuse us without 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.310
 clearly identified each one of 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.230
 our cancers as you can see the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.750
 Most of them are heart - shaped 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.070
 what happens when they are in this phase 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.770
 embryonic of which only to 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.020
 distant two things as I commented not 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.540
 Ultimately sometimes it produces 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.800
 called embryonic shock this has 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.990
 happened to me a lot when it was a 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.810
 beginner I sowed with all my 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.460
 illusion the seeds I saw them sprout 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.710
 I was very happy and the next day 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.410
 candle was with him fell the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.270
 rotten and the plant totally dead 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.070
 algae that did not understand what it is that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.990
 happened as I followed the process 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.420
 since I have been taught step by step 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.190
 until I discovered is that I think that 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.780
 millionaire does not have to happen 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.910
 always but it is quite usual 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.590
 when we are for example in this 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.350
 fall season in which the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.690
 rain and sun areas still not 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.660
 they are very well compensated that you can 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.370
 originate the poverty of tango 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.620
 besides the lands always have a 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.170
 series of fungi and bacteria that affect 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.660
 these small ones so hard because how 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.870
 we can avoid this embryonic shock 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.019
 when the plant was of the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.640
 in this case it is an olive plant in 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.590
 which we can see the partners in 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.610
 plenary that we have commented on in this 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.890
 case they are not so heart kill with day 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.629
 with one more sheet form but neither 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.379
 will be the definitive one and he told us that 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:00.870
 we have to make tables or pulverize 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.640
 with the infusion of chamomile I suppose 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.890
 that you all know perfectly the most 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.349
 quality but maybe someone has not 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.810
 seen outside the tea bag with the 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.870
 that nothing sell in this case this is 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.170
 It's about self-cultivated chamomile 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.730
 from last year 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.920
 in some chapter how to cultivate the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.010
 Chamomile is one of the friends of the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.140
 orchard in this case we pick the flowers 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.300
 as long as the petals of the flower 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.610
 of chamomile have gone back what 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.709
 we collect the put on a paper 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.170
 and we let them dry and we have this 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.600
 chamomile we can use throughout 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.010
 the following year as infusions like os 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.209
 he said he would try to make a 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.100
 chamomile infusion as the 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.750
 we would take for ourselves but you should owe me 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.750
 win we give it to our capsules 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.220
 good for today nothing more simply 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.050
 remember that what I have told you in 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.060
 The theme of chamomile is vital for 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.980
 that our seedlings grow without 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.960
 problems the embryonic shock is much 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.550
 more usual than it seems and although 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.860
 you buy how to make many of you 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.110
 the seedlings already directly in a 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.180
 nursery even these plants can 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.060
 have a posterior embryonic shock 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.550
 so to avoid it remember to use 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.370
 the infusion of chamomile and delivering 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.840
 with it does not return leaving it good 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.090
 nothing else for today I hope that you have 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.170
 been very useful and do not miss the 21 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.170
 chapters of the faithful
