attached<00:02:00.860> already<00:02:01.330> another<00:02:02.330> thing<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:02.689> can<00:02:02.840> do

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
attached already another thing I can do

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.620 
attached already another thing I can do
because<00:02:04.430> I<00:02:04.670> can<00:02:04.820> coil<00:02:05.030> this<00:02:05.270> up<00:02:05.979> like<00:02:06.979> this

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
because I can coil this up like this

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.559 
because I can coil this up like this
then<00:02:08.630> I<00:02:08.720> could<00:02:08.899> tie<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.849> to<00:02:10.849> a<00:02:10.880> saddle<00:02:11.209> string

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
then I could tie this to a saddle string

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.740 
then I could tie this to a saddle string
on<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.500> side<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:12.739> my<00:02:12.920> saddle<00:02:13.370> we<00:02:14.180> just<00:02:14.390> pop<00:02:14.600> it

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
on the side of my saddle we just pop it

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.199 
on the side of my saddle we just pop it
free<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.920> have<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.250> in<00:02:16.310> hand<00:02:16.550> when<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:16.880> get<00:02:17.090> off
