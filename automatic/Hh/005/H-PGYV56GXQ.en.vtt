00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
doing which is a good thing so it's a

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.830 
doing which is a good thing so it's a
great<00:02:46.950> line<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.550> totally<00:02:47.850> works<00:02:48.180> because<00:02:48.720> of

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
great line it totally works because of

great line it totally works because of
the<00:02:48.930> substance<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.920> by<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.670> way<00:02:50.850> when<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.180> go

individual uh tax rate cuts that are

well<00:03:01.680> they<00:03:01.800> did<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.070> math<00:03:02.250> on<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.850> Tax

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
well they did the math on this the Tax

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.930 
well they did the math on this the Tax
Policy<00:03:03.180> Center<00:03:03.690> did<00:03:03.960> so<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:05.220> portion<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.850> the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
Policy Center did so that portion of the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.870 
Policy Center did so that portion of the
tax<00:03:06.120> cuts<00:03:06.390> alone<00:03:06.960> cost<00:03:07.800> us<00:03:08.100> four<00:03:08.520> trillion

tax cuts alone cost us four trillion
dollars<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.600> would<00:03:09.690> be<00:03:09.840> reducing<00:03:10.350> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
dollars that would be reducing the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.080 
dollars that would be reducing the
revenue<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.920> government<00:03:11.310> takes<00:03:11.520> in<00:03:11.700> by<00:03:11.820> four

with a some plan saying okay you know

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.700 
with a some plan saying okay you know
what<00:03:19.190> I'm<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.310> cap<00:03:20.580> personal<00:03:21.120> deductions<00:03:21.240> at

what I'm a cap personal deductions at

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.070 
what I'm a cap personal deductions at
$25,000<00:03:22.710> okay<00:03:23.640> well<00:03:23.820> that's<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:24.060> plan<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:24.600> good

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
$25,000 okay well that's a plan so good

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.890 
$25,000 okay well that's a plan so good
let's<00:03:25.620> okay<00:03:26.040> crunch<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.430> numbers<00:03:26.460> on<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:26.940> so

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
let's okay crunch the numbers on that so

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.570 
let's okay crunch the numbers on that so
if<00:03:28.200> you're<00:03:28.440> taking<00:03:28.590> deductions<00:03:29.100> beyond<00:03:29.340> that

if you're taking deductions beyond that

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.950 
if you're taking deductions beyond that
you're<00:03:29.760> wealthy<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.330> you're<00:03:30.510> taking<00:03:30.630> more

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
you're wealthy and you're taking more

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.440 
you're wealthy and you're taking more
than<00:03:31.050> 25,000<00:03:31.770> deductions<00:03:32.760> well<00:03:33.180> he's<00:03:33.300> in<00:03:33.420> a

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
than 25,000 deductions well he's in a

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.270 
than 25,000 deductions well he's in a
stop<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.870> okay<00:03:34.140> good<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:34.560> how<00:03:35.010> much<00:03:35.130> would

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
stop that okay good so how much would

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.400 
stop that okay good so how much would
that<00:03:35.340> say<00:03:35.700> well<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.750> would<00:03:36.840> save<00:03:37.020> apparently

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
that say well that would save apparently

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.270 
that say well that would save apparently
1.3<00:03:38.280> trillion<00:03:38.790> dollars<00:03:39.210> now<00:03:39.930> uh<00:03:40.470> quick<00:03:41.070> math

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
1.3 trillion dollars now uh quick math

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.670 
1.3 trillion dollars now uh quick math
you<00:03:41.490> guys<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.910> turns<00:03:42.090> out<00:03:42.270> four<00:03:42.690> trillion<00:03:43.020> is

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
you guys it turns out four trillion is

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.970 
you guys it turns out four trillion is
higher<00:03:44.220> number<00:03:44.760> than<00:03:44.790> 1.3<00:03:45.450> trillion<00:03:45.980> so

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
higher number than 1.3 trillion so

deficit now the two trillion number you
just<00:04:00.360> saw<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:01.080> if<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.950> gave<00:04:02.340> Mitt<00:04:02.640> Romney<00:04:03.090> the

just saw is if you gave Mitt Romney the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.970 
just saw is if you gave Mitt Romney the
benefit<00:04:03.630> of<00:04:03.720> doubt<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.050> eliminated<00:04:04.590> all

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
benefit of doubt you eliminated all

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.699 
benefit of doubt you eliminated all
deductions<00:04:05.690> so<00:04:06.690> your<00:04:06.840> home<00:04:07.050> mortgage<00:04:07.500> rate

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
deductions so your home mortgage rate

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.070

deduction god child tax credit gone

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.850

which a charitable deductions gone well

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.640 
which a charitable deductions gone well
then<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.190> saves<00:04:14.459> us<00:04:14.550> two<00:04:14.910> trillion<00:04:15.180> dollars

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
then that saves us two trillion dollars

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.659 
then that saves us two trillion dollars

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
for you now two trillion still smaller

for you now two trillion still smaller
than<00:04:22.860> fortunately<00:04:23.540> so<00:04:24.540> it<00:04:24.840> would<00:04:24.990> still<00:04:25.320> under

the best-case scenario one that Mitt

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
Romney says he will not do even if you

Romney says he will not do even if you
give<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:30.960> benefit<00:04:31.500> out<00:04:31.800> we<00:04:32.580> would<00:04:32.730> still<00:04:32.970> add

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
give that benefit out we would still add

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.120 
give that benefit out we would still add
two<00:04:33.419> trillion<00:04:33.720> dollars<00:04:33.840> over<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.290> next<00:04:34.740> ten
