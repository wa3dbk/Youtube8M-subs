overridden<00:06:02.490> with<00:06:02.640> bugs<00:06:03.150> and<00:06:04.050> we<00:06:04.110> just<00:06:04.290> find

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
overridden with bugs and we just find

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.720 
overridden with bugs and we just find
the<00:06:04.560> tick<00:06:04.770> on<00:06:04.890> the<00:06:04.950> dogs<00:06:05.190> every<00:06:05.430> once<00:06:05.610> in<00:06:05.670> a

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
the tick on the dogs every once in a

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.950 
the tick on the dogs every once in a
while<00:06:05.820> we're<00:06:06.060> like<00:06:06.120> we<00:06:06.300> need<00:06:06.450> to<00:06:06.510> stop<00:06:06.720> this

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
while we're like we need to stop this

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.290 
while we're like we need to stop this
and<00:06:07.230> so<00:06:07.950> the<00:06:08.070> idea<00:06:08.370> after<00:06:08.640> we<00:06:08.880> talking<00:06:09.120> to<00:06:09.210> this

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
and so the idea after we talking to this

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.540 
and so the idea after we talking to this
guy<00:06:09.540> that<00:06:10.380> owns<00:06:10.590> the<00:06:10.800> Do<00:06:10.920> It<00:06:10.980> Yourself<00:06:11.040> bug

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
pest control place he said that the real

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.690 
pest control place he said that the real
issue<00:06:15.210> isn't<00:06:15.660> the<00:06:16.440> the<00:06:16.830> adult<00:06:17.190> ticks<00:06:17.460> that<00:06:17.550> are

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
issue isn't the the adult ticks that are

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.630 
issue isn't the the adult ticks that are
biting<00:06:18.060> the<00:06:18.180> dogs<00:06:18.390> it's<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.380> one<00:06:20.070> tick<00:06:20.430> can

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
biting the dogs it's the one tick can

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.600 
biting the dogs it's the one tick can
lay<00:06:20.850> thousands<00:06:21.600> of<00:06:21.690> eggs<00:06:21.840> and<00:06:22.370> those<00:06:23.370> eggs

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
lay thousands of eggs and those eggs

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.300 
lay thousands of eggs and those eggs
maybe<00:06:24.120> in<00:06:24.510> our<00:06:24.600> house<00:06:24.900> that<00:06:25.260> might<00:06:25.860> be<00:06:25.890> why<00:06:26.130> we

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
maybe in our house that might be why we

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.810 
maybe in our house that might be why we
have<00:06:26.460> ticks<00:06:26.730> so<00:06:27.290> thus<00:06:28.290> why<00:06:29.010> we<00:06:29.280> sprayed<00:06:29.580> this

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
have ticks so thus why we sprayed this

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.460 
have ticks so thus why we sprayed this
ridiculous<00:06:30.420> poison<00:06:30.780> everywhere<00:06:31.110> they<00:06:31.410> can

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
ridiculous poison everywhere they can

ridiculous poison everywhere they can
survive<00:06:31.950> the<00:06:32.340> poison<00:06:32.820> inside<00:06:33.060> of<00:06:33.360> their<00:06:33.510> eggs

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
survive the poison inside of their eggs

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.230 
survive the poison inside of their eggs
what<00:06:34.350> you<00:06:34.440> do<00:06:34.530> is<00:06:34.620> you<00:06:34.710> vacuum<00:06:35.130> first<00:06:35.460> and<00:06:35.760> that

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
what you do is you vacuum first and that

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.920 
what you do is you vacuum first and that
gets<00:06:36.420> them<00:06:36.540> all<00:06:36.660> riled<00:06:36.870> up<00:06:37.110> in<00:06:37.260> the

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
gets them all riled up in the

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
and the one they hatch then they die

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.860 
and the one they hatch then they die
because<00:06:39.880> they're<00:06:40.120> poison<00:06:40.570> everywhere

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870
