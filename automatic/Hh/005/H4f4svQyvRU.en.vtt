00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 it's classic that even though we carry 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.200
 years wearing brassieres from which keys and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.880
 you have this age you do not know how to measure yourself and 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.440
 which of the correct brazil so 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.679
 you can comfortable and healthy 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.870
 so we brought them to an expert 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.340
 skillful that will teach us how to take 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.550
 the means to know what size of 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.650
 funny and card 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.230
 avilÃ©s eight out of ten women 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.380
 they use the street 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.109
 this fact is because if you gain weight you 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.609
 you had hormonal changes 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.890
 changing with age your body goes 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.890
 we also recommend that once 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.430
 here is half an inch 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.440
 I need an exact synthetic and I need 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.730
 bring a big very light that if you have 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.620
 Clear 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.620
 I can not do it better, more perfect 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.670
 so the idea is to measure this first 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.199
 in all ok as I saw it and a little 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.360
 right messenger 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.050
 confident bass music is by 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.180
 example here gives us that you are 30 that to 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.649
 This measure will take 2 inches 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.789
 although what does it mean that you are 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:20.830
 32 torso although yes very well 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.830
 then we go to girls 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.740
 then I have to check here right where 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.740
 all the little arrows here 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.270
 32 234 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.530
 then from there you will measure the taste 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.530
 from the most prominent part 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.920
 I did not put but soon 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.909
 I can not but it has to be in inches 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.709
 this tape is special, that is, the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.440
 perfect for accurate measuring the bra 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.560
 flower but if it is homemade give me souls with 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.060
 a tape in inches 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.060
 now you are going to measure the cup 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.920
 it gives me that you are 34 ok the difference between 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.110
 your torso and your dad is 2 inches if 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.110
 it's one inch you're 72 inches 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.150
 look here I was wearing the tournament measurements and 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.890
 sums 2 500 you look at the part 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:44.599
 prominent aha and subtract your torso 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:50.760
 and my prominent part was 32 mm and torso 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:52.040
 32 ab32 and I have to ask once for 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.280
 year 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.349
 if I change weight if you have a baby or if 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.890
 you suffer from a hormonal issue 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.140
 there's also nobody telling you 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.540
 in the store you see you know there are 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.400
 Ready several tasks until you 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.609
 feel that they do not hurt you that you do not 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.720
 rubs that does not squeeze you, not that you do not 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:21.200
 It takes out chubby alone is to coordinate is already 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.200
 ready 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.269
 I love 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:32.140
 now if I am then I am at 34 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.540
 and now it gives you 36 the difference is 2 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.930
 it means that they have been beaten that 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.930
 we have
