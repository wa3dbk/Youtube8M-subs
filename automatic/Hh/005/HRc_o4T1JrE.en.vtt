their hand up you keep that head up you

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.180 
their hand up you keep that head up you
solid<00:02:13.019> why<00:02:13.560> are<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.709> breathing<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:14.099> your

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
solid why are you breathing on your

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.220 
solid why are you breathing on your
tippy<00:02:14.519> toes

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
tippy toes

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.710 
tippy toes
pass<00:02:16.230> down<00:02:16.549> and<00:02:17.549> so<00:02:17.700> that's<00:02:17.849> best<00:02:18.269> of<00:02:18.510> hold

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
pass down and so that's best of hold

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.800 
pass down and so that's best of hold
yeah<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.310> power<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:21.239> got<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.540> be<00:02:21.629> able<00:02:21.720> to
