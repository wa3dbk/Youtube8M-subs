but I can't imagine even starting
thinking<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.970> could<00:00:30.119> ever<00:00:30.269> get<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.720> fast<00:00:31.080> I

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
thinking you could ever get that fast I

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
thinking you could ever get that fast I
mean<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.910> there<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
mean it's it's really and is there a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.000 
mean it's it's really and is there a
trick<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.410> memorization

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
trick to it it's is it a memorization
