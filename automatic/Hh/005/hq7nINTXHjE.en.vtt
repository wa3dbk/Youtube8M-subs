00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.830
 Y 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.600
 ah 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.300
 Hello my loves today I bring you 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.450
 another Dominican recipe that is called 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.700
 soup or this is more or less like it's 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.020
 a rice soup with meat we could 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.180
 define it this way to people who do not 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.970
 they know the dish the ingredients are 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.070
 basically simple since I have 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.320
 chicken this is chicken full chicken be 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.300
 with bones but they can also use 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.059
 the chicken breasts the image germany 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.170
 because they always get easier 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.420
 but in American tepic we do it with 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.460
 the whole chicken I also have here 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.250
 pork ribs or better said 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.270
 smoked chop smoked chop and here 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.530
 is the part of the back of the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.720
 chop that leaves it complete because I 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.330
 like then will begin to crumble this 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.080
 bone with meat and chop them more or 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.960
 less so 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:25.060
 well read the rest is onion so here 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.390
 I have a little tomato put more or 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.110
 minus all chopped tomatoes 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.290
 and this is sweet potato sweet potato or like you 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.330
 call her Dominicans surely 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.240
 they will think there but it happens as flame 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.080
 it's not that I'm that the sweet potato here is 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.160
 so an orange color is the kind of 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.790
 call that is sweet potato that they sell here 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.409
 to season, we're going to need seasoning 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.259
 powdered 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.689
 down if this Dominican water what 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.819
 they brought from Dominican Republic that already 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.380
 they asked me in the other video that what 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.670
 they brought Dominican replica but I 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.049
 I have a store that sells products 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.450
 Americans I'm going to place an order on 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.250
 coming next month all these 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.479
 products and with them the order and everything 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.980
 I'm going to do it also teaches the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.010
 shop to all the Dominicans so that 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.340
 see then if that website works and it's 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.290
 another central well down the oregano 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.480
 add a little bit of oregano and I 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.560
 I put and I put spicy and spicy to me 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.690
 I like to use cayenne pepper 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.290
 who does not like spicy does not put 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.780
 spicy then to the payments we 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.420
 we usually put it can be two 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.080
 versions or just meat or just from 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.450
 large grains when they habichuela that 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.760
 back but I personally like it 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.450
 mix the two things I put him 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.910
 forever 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.019
 snap beans or pigeon peas when you read 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.930
 I have when then I always 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.460
 I use links that are called German 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.190
 that are lentils 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.320
 lentils are and these have already 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.590
 seasoning have celery have that ko and 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.030
 They also have carrots in cubes 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.200
 that I like to use that for this kind of 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.540
 preparation here is everything not the ones that do not 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.239
 it is not necessary this step what 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.909
 and the rice obviously I put a 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:22.140
 cup of rice to all this preparation 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.799
 he always used mathematics that I 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.150
 had previously commented then 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.299
 we need a little bit of oil 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.709
 olive to sauté the meat and that already 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.299
 let's do it and a little bit of lemon or 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.530
 orange sour from what we use 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.930
 Dominicans to give a little bit of a 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.480
 screams but as that here does not exist then 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.859
 the lemon we will then continue with my 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.620
 silver but I have a pot 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.940
 big and what I'm going to do now is 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.400
 put oil 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.960
 more or less something projectile or too 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.380
 I use it too much oil my 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.380
 loves 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.640
 I'm going to remove the pot because the one 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:01.920
 very hot 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.920
 to put the meat inside 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.849
 and let the meat brown a little 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.849
 when it leaves gold 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.830
 well we have all the ingredients 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:02.060
 inside and the rest is to put water we are going to 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.129
 put water that covers all the meat and what 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.910
 that we have more or less until it covers 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:09.760
 others 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.440
 and this we are going to let it boil 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.930
 it actually comes right away because I 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.410
 I put hot water so it's more 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.410
 Quick 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.569
 and when the water boils we're going to put 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.909
 the cup of rice 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.819
 ok ya come is boiling is the time 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:30.460
 to put the rice we put all the 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.990
 rice well and now let's leave let's 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.879
 stir let's let this boil over 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.369
 space for 15 to 20 minutes until the 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:38.080
 rice soften well and those and the meat and 

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:41.819
 everything that is inside is true and 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.819
 we follow then with the final step 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.880
 well my loves as you see 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.190
 They have spent about 20 minutes 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.810
 I almost told you to put it to 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.420
 medium fire because if they put it on fire 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.670
 high is going to burn the bottom and it's not going to 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.530
 sew well more or less this is the 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.370
 consistency that more or less has to 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.530
 have to be loose but not too 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:19.650
 acted but not so thick that the 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:19.650
 rice that looks like a I think so 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:26.610
 and now it's time for the sour or 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.610
 lemon that you are going to use 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:35.719
 I like well that milestone here and 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:38.569
 itching peak ok so the spicy is 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:40.309
 vinegar is everyone's choice of 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.679
 personal taste of each and of course of 

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:44.179
 your family is true also they 

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:47.670
 I remember that instead of the spicy that I 

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:50.790
 I use can also use chile 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:55.290
 or spicy jalapeños or ajicito that 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:58.250
 will also treat or pepper or none is 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:02.990
 optional ok it's ready I'm going to pay 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.990
 I can clean a little and do more 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.940
 and well my easy loves how has 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.970
 left 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:27.390
 I hope you liked the recipe 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:31.440
 and tell me in which of your countries 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:33.000
 they also make a similar recipe like this 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.760
 how do you put a rice soup and 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.230
 flame soup or nothing my loves will already be 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.380
