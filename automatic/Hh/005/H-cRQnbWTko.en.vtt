00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.490
 hello girls I received an email from 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.439
 may 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.719
 she tells me that she has tattoos and 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.849
 she fascinates him but there are situations in 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.459
 where she needs to cover herself 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.340
 wants to know how to cover those 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.890
 tattoos in your house easily so 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.270
 Today I 'm going to show her and you 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.270
 how can they be covered 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.050
 hello maite what are you here thanks for 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.540
 have written me and also for having 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.610
 come so tell us what it is that 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.050
 is happening here with the tattoos myself 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.010
 I have four years with the sector 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.650
 I plan on doing more and a 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.040
 little more discrete but sometimes by 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.239
 I have to cover certain jobs 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.890
 waiting we have to cover with broken not 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.230
 you see with makeup how can I 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.300
 do excellent ok sometimes many of 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.860
 we have that situation or 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.170
 we just want to learn how 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.969
 do it then right now easily 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.740
 I will show how they can do it and in 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.320
 his house 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.380
 The first thing you will need is a 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.080
 99% alcohol because we're going to have to 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.540
 clean the area we are not going to put a 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.730
 little alcohol nothing else will 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.590
 clean and then as to theory the 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.210
 color we have to see the tones 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.370
 with which we are working and always 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.500
 we have to go to the opposite side of the 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.780
 opposite of the color with which we are going to 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.090
 work in this case this area is a 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.250
 more bluish area then we are going to 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.530
 work with your color the orange to 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.720
 cancel that color will you take your 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.670
 brochita and we will work in the area 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.340
 very important is that when you go to 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.530
 cover certain areas for example here if 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.570
 we want nothing more to leave the color the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.340
 orange in that area because if we go 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.140
 more down then we are going to change 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.820
 the tone of your skin then from here to 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.880
 up then we can go a little bit 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.650
 more solid and we can pat him 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.660
 because that's the way in which the 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.000
 makeup works better and is where 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.000
 we can cover better also then 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.090
 there we can see that you almost do not notice 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.210
 since we did that we are going to do very 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.069
 friends of the dust is very important 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.379
 because this helps us to do 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.139
 to what we just applied we take a 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.629
 little powder a fat brush 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.840
 we remove the excess and we put the 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.300
 pure 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.910
 then this does not run the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.640
 color that we put down since we have 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.069
 this we have to look for tones that are 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.780
 the same color as your skin and that's 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.519
 very important because if it is not of 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.010
 same tone not your skin the concealer that 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.140
 we are using or makeup as it 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.940
 will not notice the difference as we are going to 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.489
 see this have a little more esteban 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.430
 clearer but then we find these 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.379
 two tones that are already more according to 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.769
 your skin color then I will use 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:52.620
 this on top of the orange to be able 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.660
 equal to your tone I take a brush and go 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.880
 to do the same thing we did with the tone 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.010
 orange for this is very important that 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.230
 look for makeups that are a little 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.450
 thicker because if not then they will not 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.579
 cover a lot if they go to the supermarket the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.160
 truth is that they will not find there 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:11.340
 then they need a little bit this 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.720
 with more coverage and how are you seeing what 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.390
 what I'm doing here is that 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.350
 I'm just patting 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.750
 because I do not want to run 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.380
 since I had already applied it makes me 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.580
 it's looking pretty good 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.140
 we just need to have that color 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.240
 right I like to look how it is 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.630
 losing this point with your skin tone 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.630
 it looks super super natural 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.590
 we take the dust again but crisis 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.450
 soon 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.370
 how long will it last me? 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.560
 all day but if you want it to last you 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.050
 more you do this same procedure and 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.840
 then what you can do is seal it 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.940
 with this spray that is a fixative is like 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.110
 for brides or sometimes I like 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.000
 use them for every day so that 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.620
 improve my makeup more and then with 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.560
 this and nothing else you give a little 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.360
 you let it dry well and it lasts all 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.130
 the day is against the water you are not going to 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.870
 be staining your clothes then what 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.240
 you can use it safely and it's not going to 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.610
 spend nothing even will not take you like this 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.110
 like that a lot of time and they are with 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.780
 products that sure if you have at home 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.450
 you do not have very basic in fact you tried 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.880
 also for those who have dark circles 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.890
 very pronounced that they have in an area 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:24.280
 of coloration on the skin or some 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.650
 hickeys that prevail of this very good 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.810
 technique that they can use to be able to 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.510
 cover all those obscurities in 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.280
 blue tones and then right now 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.690
 what I'm going to do is that I'm going to continue 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.860
 with your tattoo so that now you can see the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.789
 difference in such 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.789
 Andale passes 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.759
 Well, you're ready, what do you think? 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.620
 well you do not look anything looks excellent 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.749
 then as you can see it's something super 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.409
 super practical and then here the important 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:05:01.120
 guys is that you have to be you and 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.680
 you must enjoy who you are if you 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.779
 they like tattoos if you do not like 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.430
 whatever suits you but there are times where 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:09.819
 we have to adapt to certain 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.189
 situations true then already with that and 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:14.499
 Knowing how to do it will leave you all 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:17.979
 very well so thank you very much for 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:20.409
