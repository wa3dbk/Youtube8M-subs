00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.200
 showing a preliminary good day 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:09.930
 gentlemen 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:18.590
 showing preliminary work here 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:21.470
 this transformer here is a formation 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:27.770
 mean he's here 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.770
 power regulator on inlet and outlet 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:40.100
 200 watt lamp starting capacitor 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.640
 transformer we have 500 wadded 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:49.309
 power 500 watt factory 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.860
 Now here inter meter output 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:58.590
 take on exit 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:06.380
 ammeter inlet voltmeter inlet yes 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:11.959
 and we still have forgotten chastotnik here 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.959
 straight frequency converter 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.049
 turn on 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.940
 so look at the devices 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:44.600
 why the centurion turned off again 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:48.020
 the fact that chastotnik 150 cotton on 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.460
 dear money was not enough and it is therefore not 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.610
 pulls load transformations 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.420
 at the same time we are looking at the devices 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.420
 the lamp is on 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.569
 again shut down but once again turn on 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.790
 we can even play a little 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.790
 adjustment 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:59.050
 at the prime minister a pack a little bit corrected and 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:02.890
 centurion does not shut off 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:08.730
 now we will turn it on and still 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:12.420
 adjusting let's play at the entrance with us 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:19.050
 10 volts 2 amps 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.050
 output 200 volts 1 amp 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.980
 so far so here so long 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:54.440
 well for tomorrow tomorrow i 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:59.090
 Iâ€™ll just adjust the problem 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:02.000
 with right behind with frequency converter 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:07.560
 maybe I will be able to take time 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.700
 more powerful expensive and not very people 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.010
 for me dear 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:19.730
 all the best of luck to you all the benefits yet 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:24.900
 just showing how it looks like 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:28.710
 power control one at the inlet to 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.810
 Primary here after the secondary cost is still 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.700
 one power control then goes 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.680
 Conder then comes the load lamp 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.930
 goodbye 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.930
 until next time good luck to you than
