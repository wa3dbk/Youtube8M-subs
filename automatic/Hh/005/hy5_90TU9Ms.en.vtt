00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
so we're the parrot ar.drone team does

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.030 
so we're the parrot ar.drone team does
anybody<00:00:03.179> know<00:00:03.300> what<00:00:03.419> an<00:00:03.750> AR<00:00:04.020> Drone<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:04.410> has

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
anybody know what an AR Drone is has

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.619 
anybody know what an AR Drone is has
anybody<00:00:05.220> heard<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.520> it<00:00:05.640> all<00:00:06.240> right<00:00:06.359> it<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.540> a

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
anybody heard of it all right it is a

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.049 
anybody heard of it all right it is a
recreational<00:00:07.620> quadcopter<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.490> it's<00:00:08.910> used

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
recreational quadcopter that it's used

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.400 
recreational quadcopter that it's used
by<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.210> lot<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.389> students<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.019> just<00:00:10.080> buy<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> lot

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
by a lot of students and just buy a lot

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.709 
by a lot of students and just buy a lot
of<00:00:10.500> people<00:00:10.679> who<00:00:10.800> are<00:00:10.860> enthusiastic<00:00:11.010> about

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
of people who are enthusiastic about

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.740 
of people who are enthusiastic about
just<00:00:12.719> using<00:00:12.990> remote<00:00:13.259> control<00:00:13.740> flying<00:00:14.250> stuff

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
just using remote control flying stuff

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.939 
just using remote control flying stuff
and<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.230> let<00:00:16.410> me<00:00:16.470> tell<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> little<00:00:16.740> bit

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
and so let me tell you a little bit

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.040 
and so let me tell you a little bit
about<00:00:17.640> me<00:00:17.820> AR<00:00:18.029> Drone<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.390> built<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.690> labview<00:00:18.869> of

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
about me AR Drone we built a labview of

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.540 
about me AR Drone we built a labview of
interface<00:00:19.380> for<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.590> AR<00:00:19.859> drugs<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.400> can

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
interface for the AR drugs that you can

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.810 
interface for the AR drugs that you can
control<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.029> using<00:00:21.960> your<00:00:22.230> computer<00:00:22.820> basically

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
control it using your computer basically

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.790 
control it using your computer basically
when<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.180> buy<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.480> ar.drone<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.380> intended

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
when you buy the ar.drone it's intended

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.670 
when you buy the ar.drone it's intended
to<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.160> used<00:00:26.359> through<00:00:27.359> an<00:00:27.449> iOS<00:00:27.930> or<00:00:28.140> Android<00:00:28.500> app

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
to be used through an iOS or Android app

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.620 
to be used through an iOS or Android app
so<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> way<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.189> works<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.330> ar.drone

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
so the way it works is the ar.drone

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.999 
so the way it works is the ar.drone
which<00:00:30.990> Tim<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.380> kind<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.560> hold<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:31.859> right

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
which Tim can kind of hold up right

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.380 
which Tim can kind of hold up right
there<00:00:32.149> it<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.809> hear<00:00:34.050> me<00:00:34.140> ok<00:00:34.320> leather<00:00:34.700> go<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.940> it

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
there it can hear me ok leather go on it

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.450 
there it can hear me ok leather go on it
actually<00:00:36.510> broadcasts<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> Wi-Fi<00:00:37.770> signal<00:00:37.829> so

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
actually broadcasts a Wi-Fi signal so

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.760 
actually broadcasts a Wi-Fi signal so
Wi-Fi<00:00:38.940> Wi-Fi<00:00:39.809> signal<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.590> just

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
Wi-Fi Wi-Fi signal that you can just

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.459 
Wi-Fi Wi-Fi signal that you can just
attach<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:41.430> your<00:00:41.550> phone<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.149> then<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
attach to with your phone and then and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.959 
attach to with your phone and then and
with<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.890> then<00:00:43.980> using<00:00:44.219> your<00:00:44.250> iPhone<00:00:44.670> app<00:00:44.820> you

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
with and then using your iPhone app you

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.700 
with and then using your iPhone app you
can<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.239> control<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> air<00:00:45.809> go<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.530> that's

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
can just control the air go so that's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.560 
can just control the air go so that's
typically<00:00:47.370> how<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.610> control<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.329> said

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
typically how you control it but we said

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.279 
typically how you control it but we said
let's<00:00:49.140> try<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> use<00:00:49.469> laughing<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.480> people

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
let's try to use laughing so the people

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.170 
let's try to use laughing so the people
at<00:00:52.350> parrot<00:00:52.649> actually<00:00:52.949> provide<00:00:53.280> an<00:00:53.430> API<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
at parrot actually provide an API so a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.790 
at parrot actually provide an API so a
set<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.660> code<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.289> actually<00:00:55.440> write

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
set of code that you can actually write

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.439 
set of code that you can actually write
and<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.399> send<00:00:56.699> those<00:00:56.850> commands<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
and if you send those commands to the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
and if you send those commands to the
ar.drone<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.260> actually<00:00:58.350> control<00:00:58.770> over

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
ar.drone you can actually control over

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.450 
ar.drone you can actually control over
that<00:00:59.520> Wi-Fi<00:00:59.850> signal<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:01.920> actually<00:01:02.100> has<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
that Wi-Fi signal so it actually has a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.840 
that Wi-Fi signal so it actually has a
mountain<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.090> HD<00:01:03.449> 720p<00:01:04.409> camera<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.700> can

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
mountain to HD 720p camera on it you can

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060 
mountain to HD 720p camera on it you can
stream<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.450> 360<00:01:07.020> p<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:07.710> Wi-Fi

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
stream up to 360 p just because Wi-Fi

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.270 
stream up to 360 p just because Wi-Fi
signals<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.330> little<00:01:09.920> shaky<00:01:10.920> sometimes

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
signals can be a little shaky sometimes

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.760 
signals can be a little shaky sometimes
it<00:01:11.909> has<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> white<00:01:12.270> carbon<00:01:12.720> fiber<00:01:12.990> structure<00:01:13.409> so

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
it has a white carbon fiber structure so

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.520 
it has a white carbon fiber structure so
it's<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.159> pretty<00:01:14.700> aerodynamic<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.229> also<00:01:16.350> do

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it's a pretty aerodynamic it can also do

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.890 
it's a pretty aerodynamic it can also do
some<00:01:16.680> frequent<00:01:17.040> animations<00:01:17.549> or<00:01:17.670> tricks<00:01:18.090> which

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
some frequent animations or tricks which

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.440 
some frequent animations or tricks which
might<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.439> your<00:01:19.890> reporting<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:21.030> might<00:01:21.240> show

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
might be your reporting I we might show

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.480 
might be your reporting I we might show
you<00:01:21.479> some<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.750> those<00:01:21.869> later<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> also

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
you some of those later on and it also

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
you some of those later on and it also
has<00:01:23.610> built-in<00:01:23.970> stable<00:01:24.600> flight<00:01:24.720> algorithms<00:01:25.229> so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
has built-in stable flight algorithms so

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.100 
has built-in stable flight algorithms so
you<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.710> worry<00:01:25.890> about<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.880> pitch<00:01:27.810> roll

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
you have to worry about like pitch roll

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.840 
you have to worry about like pitch roll
and<00:01:28.140> yaw<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.770> all<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.009> those<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.340> complex

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
and yaw and all of those really complex

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.130 
and yaw and all of those really complex
algorithms<00:01:30.360> yourself<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.869> all<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.079> don't

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
algorithms yourself and all you don't

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.109 
algorithms yourself and all you don't
have<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.500> an<00:01:31.590> aerospace<00:01:31.920> engineer<00:01:32.119> it

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
have to be an aerospace engineer it

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.359 
have to be an aerospace engineer it
takes<00:01:33.570> care<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:35.189> that

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
takes care of all that for you with that

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.530 
takes care of all that for you with that
I'm<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.640> turn<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.880> over<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> Justin<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
I'm going to turn it over to Justin you

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.969 
I'm going to turn it over to Justin you
can<00:01:36.659> explain<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> little<00:01:37.140> bit<00:01:37.290> more<00:01:37.500> about<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
can explain a little bit more about the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:52.410 
can explain a little bit more about the
details<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> ticket

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.520 

alright<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:53.570> here's<00:01:53.780> just<00:01:53.870> a<00:01:54.080> little<00:01:54.260> overview

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
alright so here's just a little overview

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.670 
alright so here's just a little overview
of<00:01:54.890> how<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:55.880> toolkit<00:01:56.330> itself<00:01:56.420> interact<00:01:57.350> with

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
of how the toolkit itself interact with

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.550 
of how the toolkit itself interact with
Erica<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:59.270> basically<00:01:59.600> we<00:01:59.810> can<00:01:59.960> take<00:02:00.140> input

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
Erica so basically we can take input

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.500 
Erica so basically we can take input
from<00:02:00.590> many<00:02:01.160> different<00:02:01.400> sources<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.210> like

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
from many different sources so like

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.420 
from many different sources so like
gaming<00:02:02.810> control<00:02:03.290> words<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.100> can<00:02:04.280> use

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
gaming control words you can use

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.340 
gaming control words you can use
automation<00:02:04.880> or<00:02:05.270> like<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.570> keyboard<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:06.200> mouse

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
automation or like a keyboard and mouse

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.499 
automation or like a keyboard and mouse
really<00:02:06.860> anything<00:02:07.400> that<00:02:07.580> can<00:02:07.790> proper<00:02:08.060> lab<00:02:08.330> you

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
really anything that can proper lab you

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.020 
really anything that can proper lab you
at<00:02:08.600> all<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.710> we<00:02:09.950> use<00:02:10.100> that<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.460> communicate<00:02:10.910> the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
at all so we use that to communicate the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.420 
at all so we use that to communicate the
LabVIEW<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.660> then<00:02:11.840> we<00:02:12.740> actually<00:02:13.070> connect

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
LabVIEW and then we actually connect

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.240 
LabVIEW and then we actually connect
with<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.850> QC<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.020> Aragon<00:02:15.470> Wi-Fi<00:02:15.920> network

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
with the QC to the Aragon Wi-Fi network

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.060 
with the QC to the Aragon Wi-Fi network
and<00:02:16.460> run<00:02:16.640> would<00:02:17.480> say<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.050> then<00:02:18.380> we<00:02:18.980> actually

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
and run would say and then we actually

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.940 
and run would say and then we actually
control<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:20.060> by<00:02:20.270> sending<00:02:20.630> commands<00:02:21.110> over<00:02:21.470> UDP

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
control it by sending commands over UDP

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.750 
control it by sending commands over UDP
as<00:02:22.790> well<00:02:23.060> as<00:02:23.209> PC<00:02:23.450> be<00:02:23.750> packed<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:25.190> all<00:02:25.610> those

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
as well as PC be packed and all those

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.870 
as well as PC be packed and all those
are<00:02:26.030> defined<00:02:26.450> an<00:02:26.630> API<00:02:27.020> which<00:02:27.520> paired<00:02:28.520> athlete

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
are defined an API which paired athlete

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.970 
are defined an API which paired athlete
outline<00:02:29.240> so<00:02:29.420> we<00:02:29.540> just<00:02:29.750> implemented<00:02:30.140> their

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
outline so we just implemented their

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.160 
outline so we just implemented their
guidelines<00:02:31.220> with<00:02:31.790> our<00:02:31.910> lab<00:02:32.090> ubs<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:33.020> then

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
guidelines with our lab ubs and then

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.220 
guidelines with our lab ubs and then
basically<00:02:33.610> translate<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.760> input<00:02:35.120> here<00:02:35.390> into

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
basically translate the input here into

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.270 
basically translate the input here into
commands<00:02:36.590> for<00:02:36.800> they<00:02:36.890> are<00:02:38.800> so<00:02:39.800> all<00:02:40.160> the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
commands for they are so all the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.040 
commands for they are so all the
communication<00:02:40.820> like<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.000> said<00:02:41.330> has<00:02:41.510> done<00:02:41.720> over

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
communication like I said has done over

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.620 
communication like I said has done over
Wi-Fi<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.980> we<00:02:43.100> also<00:02:43.250> use<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.420> standard

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
Wi-Fi and we also use the standard

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.980 
Wi-Fi and we also use the standard
LabVIEW<00:02:45.260> open<00:02:45.740> control<00:02:46.220> photobucket

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
LabVIEW open control photobucket

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.640 
LabVIEW open control photobucket
architecture<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.110> you're<00:02:48.290> probably

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
architecture that you're probably

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.800 
architecture that you're probably
familiar<00:02:48.950> with<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.940> as<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.180> see<00:02:50.330> down<00:02:50.480> here<00:02:50.660> we

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
familiar with so as you see down here we

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.930 
familiar with so as you see down here we
open<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.230> connection<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.010> drone<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:52.700> work

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
open the connection to the drone we work

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.240 
open the connection to the drone we work
through<00:02:53.300> sending<00:02:54.170> our<00:02:54.290> control<00:02:54.650> signals<00:02:55.070> and

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
through sending our control signals and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.759 
through sending our control signals and
then<00:02:55.760> finally<00:02:56.300> than<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.570> gun<00:02:56.750> because<00:02:57.560> that

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
then finally than the gun because that

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.770 
then finally than the gun because that
are<00:02:57.890> AR<00:02:58.130> been<00:02:58.310> set<00:02:58.489> I'm<00:02:59.269> we're<00:02:59.510> able<00:02:59.660> to

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
are AR been set I'm we're able to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.470 
are AR been set I'm we're able to
control<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.350> pitch<00:03:00.560> roll<00:03:01.160> yah<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:01.910> vertical

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
control the pitch roll yah and vertical

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.850 
control the pitch roll yah and vertical
speed<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:05.510> we<00:03:05.720> also<00:03:05.900> received<00:03:06.410> some<00:03:06.650> data

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
speed and so we also received some data

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.290 
speed and so we also received some data
back<00:03:07.130> from<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.400> drug<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.720> also<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:10.300> it's

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
back from the drug so it also it it's

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.570 
back from the drug so it also it it's
ins<00:03:11.660> navigation<00:03:12.380> data<00:03:12.560> over<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.519> network

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
ins navigation data over the network

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.910 
ins navigation data over the network
back<00:03:14.300> to

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
back to

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.790 
back to
so<00:03:15.819> this<00:03:16.060> data<00:03:16.240> includes<00:03:16.810> like<00:03:17.020> battery<00:03:17.530> data

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
so this data includes like battery data

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.400 
so this data includes like battery data
as<00:03:18.069> well<00:03:18.370> as<00:03:18.430> some<00:03:18.760> flight<00:03:19.000> parameters

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
as well as some flight parameters

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.229 
as well as some flight parameters
someone<00:03:20.410> stuff<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.800> listed<00:03:21.190> here<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:22.180> you

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
someone stuff is listed here and so you

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.970 
someone stuff is listed here and so you
can<00:03:22.420> use<00:03:22.569> after<00:03:23.020> processing<00:03:23.410> on<00:03:24.040> here<00:03:24.580> in<00:03:25.980> we

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
can use after processing on here in we

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.339 
can use after processing on here in we
also<00:03:27.160> receive<00:03:27.670> video<00:03:28.180> data<00:03:28.450> from<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.870> drum<00:03:29.080> so

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
also receive video data from the drum so

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.800 
also receive video data from the drum so
it<00:03:29.640> transfers<00:03:30.640> video<00:03:31.090> data<00:03:31.300> over<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.720> network

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
it transfers video data over the network

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.470 
it transfers video data over the network
after<00:03:32.709> you've<00:03:32.860> requested<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.300> host

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
after you've requested to the host

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.620 
after you've requested to the host
computer<00:03:34.690> we<00:03:35.080> actually<00:03:35.770> use<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.630> open-source

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
computer we actually use a open-source

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.460 
computer we actually use a open-source
piece<00:03:37.989> of<00:03:38.140> software<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.800> it<00:03:38.860> wrote<00:03:39.040> this<00:03:39.220> in

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
piece of software and it wrote this in

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.220 
piece of software and it wrote this in
h.264<00:03:41.470> format<00:03:41.800> Lee<00:03:42.459> it's<00:03:42.730> called<00:03:42.880> FF<00:03:43.269> play<00:03:43.540> it

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
h.264 format Lee it's called FF play it

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.020 
h.264 format Lee it's called FF play it
basically<00:03:44.500> just<00:03:44.709> taste<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.160> screen<00:03:45.459> because

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
basically just taste the screen because

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.930 
basically just taste the screen because
it<00:03:46.239> can<00:03:46.750> show<00:03:46.959> it<00:03:47.110> on<00:03:47.200> string<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:49.989> now<00:03:50.940> on

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
it can show it on string and so now on

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.190 
it can show it on string and so now on
show<00:03:52.269> you<00:03:52.330> guys<00:03:52.480> how<00:03:52.750> this<00:03:52.900> thing<00:03:53.110> actually

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
show you guys how this thing actually

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:04.350 
show you guys how this thing actually
works

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.610 
going to control the the VI so he's
gonna<00:04:09.220> run<00:04:09.370> it<00:04:09.490> over<00:04:09.550> there<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.180> Tim<00:04:10.510> his<00:04:11.320> lot

gonna run it over there and Tim his lot
your<00:04:11.860> lives<00:04:12.130> are<00:04:12.340> in<00:04:12.460> his<00:04:12.490> hands<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.810> he's

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
your lives are in his hands so he's

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.229 
your lives are in his hands so he's
going<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.650> be<00:04:14.800> actually<00:04:15.010> operating<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.820> xbox

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
going to be actually operating the xbox

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.330 
going to be actually operating the xbox
controller<00:04:16.630> so<00:04:16.870> we<00:04:16.989> actually<00:04:17.340> started

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
controller so we actually started

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.920 
controller so we actually started
reading<00:04:18.640> in<00:04:18.760> data<00:04:18.940> from<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.180> wireless<00:04:19.570> xbox

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
reading in data from a wireless xbox

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.880 
reading in data from a wireless xbox
controller<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.859> translated<00:04:21.790> that<00:04:21.910> into

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
controller and translated that into

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.380 
controller and translated that into
basic<00:04:23.890> commands<00:04:24.250> that<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.670> ar.drone<00:04:24.940> takes

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
basic commands that the ar.drone takes

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.360 
basic commands that the ar.drone takes
so<00:04:25.720> that's<00:04:26.560> kind<00:04:26.740> of<00:04:26.770> how<00:04:26.860> this<00:04:27.040> is<00:04:27.160> going<00:04:27.280> to

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
so that's kind of how this is going to

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.560 
so that's kind of how this is going to
work<00:04:27.460> I'm<00:04:27.670> going<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:27.880> step<00:04:28.090> out<00:04:28.210> of<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.420> way<00:04:28.540> I

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
work I'm going to step out of the way I

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.970 
work I'm going to step out of the way I
think<00:04:28.930> right<00:04:29.170> show<00:04:29.590> step<00:04:29.830> out<00:04:29.980> of<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.130> way

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
think right show step out of the way

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.500 
think right show step out of the way
it's<00:04:32.980> actually<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.340> pretty<00:04:33.370> relatively<00:04:34.090> safe

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
it's actually a pretty relatively safe

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.990 
it's actually a pretty relatively safe
blog<00:04:35.020> dr.<00:04:35.380> like<00:04:35.530> it's<00:04:35.710> not<00:04:35.830> it<00:04:36.160> actually<00:04:36.760> has<00:04:36.940> a

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
blog dr. like it's not it actually has a

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.640 
blog dr. like it's not it actually has a
lot<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.210> safety<00:04:37.570> mechanisms<00:04:38.050> built<00:04:38.260> in<00:04:38.440> and

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
lot of safety mechanisms built in and

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.210 
lot of safety mechanisms built in and
whatnot<00:04:38.860> so<00:04:38.890> don't<00:04:39.370> be<00:04:39.460> too<00:04:39.490> scared<00:04:40.950> we<00:04:41.950> flood

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
whatnot so don't be too scared we flood

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.170 
whatnot so don't be too scared we flood
it<00:04:42.340> hurts<00:04:42.580> small<00:04:42.700> children<00:04:43.150> before<00:04:45.180> alright

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
cool so as you can see you can already

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.060 
cool so as you can see you can already
see<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.660> video<00:04:49.960> data<00:04:50.230> coming<00:04:50.500> in<00:04:50.680> from<00:04:50.950> the

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
see the video data coming in from the

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.890 
see the video data coming in from the
ar.drone<00:04:51.280> we<00:04:51.850> are<00:04:51.940> earning<00:04:52.240> connected<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.750> it

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
ar.drone we are earning connected to it

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.040 
ar.drone we are earning connected to it
and<00:04:53.340> so<00:04:54.340> how<00:04:55.060> much<00:04:55.470> right<00:04:56.470> all<00:04:57.430> right<00:04:57.520> all

alright so as you can see a response to
Tim's<00:05:13.559> commands<00:05:13.949> to<00:05:14.129> do<00:05:14.249> some<00:05:14.399> basic<00:05:14.659> forward

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
Tim's commands to do some basic forward

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:17.749 
Tim's commands to do some basic forward
and<00:05:15.779> backward<00:05:16.139> movement<00:05:16.369> twisting<00:05:17.369> movement

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
and backward movement twisting movement

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.029 
and backward movement twisting movement
and<00:05:17.879> whatnot<00:05:18.209> on<00:05:18.419> in<00:05:19.139> addition<00:05:19.379> so<00:05:19.769> this<00:05:19.919> is

and whatnot on in addition so this is
just<00:05:20.129> basic<00:05:20.339> movement<00:05:20.849> that<00:05:20.909> you<00:05:20.999> can<00:05:21.179> do<00:05:21.300> with

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
just basic movement that you can do with

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.899 
just basic movement that you can do with
the<00:05:21.479> iOS<00:05:21.839> f<00:05:22.050> you<00:05:22.409> can<00:05:22.649> also<00:05:22.800> do<00:05:23.039> it<00:05:23.189> with<00:05:23.219> with

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
the iOS f you can also do it with with

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.299 
the iOS f you can also do it with with
our<00:05:24.029> xbox<00:05:24.389> controller<00:05:24.719> in<00:05:24.899> this<00:05:24.989> case<00:05:25.199> if<00:05:26.039> you

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:26.309 
our xbox controller in this case if you

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:28.939 
our xbox controller in this case if you
if<00:05:26.969> we<00:05:27.809> have<00:05:27.929> we<00:05:28.139> had<00:05:28.289> some<00:05:28.439> people<00:05:28.649> just<00:05:28.769> pick

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
if we have we had some people just pick

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.469 
if we have we had some people just pick
up<00:05:29.069> the<00:05:29.189> xbox<00:05:29.369> controller<00:05:29.849> and<00:05:30.059> start<00:05:30.269> flying

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
up the xbox controller and start flying

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.869 
up the xbox controller and start flying
in<00:05:30.659> it's<00:05:30.809> extremely<00:05:31.289> intuitive<00:05:31.639> so<00:05:32.639> this<00:05:32.789> is

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:32.879 
in it's extremely intuitive so this is

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:34.189 
in it's extremely intuitive so this is
not<00:05:33.029> something<00:05:33.209> that<00:05:33.330> was<00:05:33.569> available<00:05:33.689> until

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
not something that was available until

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.589 
not something that was available until
we<00:05:34.319> hacked<00:05:34.499> it<00:05:34.759> one<00:05:35.759> thing<00:05:35.909> that<00:05:35.939> we<00:05:36.119> can<00:05:36.239> do

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
we hacked it one thing that we can do

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.809 
we hacked it one thing that we can do
that<00:05:36.749> we<00:05:36.779> built<00:05:37.019> in<00:05:37.199> was<00:05:37.559> using<00:05:38.369> the<00:05:38.489> previous

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
that we built in was using the previous

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.939 
that we built in was using the previous
Twitter<00:05:39.149> API<00:05:39.869> that<00:05:40.169> was<00:05:40.409> discussed<00:05:40.800> we

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
Twitter API that was discussed we

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.829 
Twitter API that was discussed we
actually<00:05:41.279> were<00:05:42.119> able<00:05:42.360> to<00:05:42.419> start<00:05:42.599> tweeting

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:42.839 
actually were able to start tweeting

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:44.359 
actually were able to start tweeting
pictures<00:05:43.169> that<00:05:43.559> were<00:05:43.649> coming<00:05:43.919> from<00:05:44.189> the

00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:44.369 
pictures that were coming from the

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:46.969 
pictures that were coming from the
ar.drone<00:05:44.639> so<00:05:45.449> Tim<00:05:45.959> if<00:05:46.110> you<00:05:46.199> can<00:05:46.319> if<00:05:46.769> the

ar.drone so Tim if you can if the

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.850 
ar.drone so Tim if you can if the
audience<00:05:47.399> can<00:05:47.639> kind<00:05:47.849> of<00:05:47.879> wave<00:05:48.119> maybe<00:05:48.989> smile

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
audience can kind of wave maybe smile
