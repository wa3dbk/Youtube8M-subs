00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
loss so how how does it feel one to come

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.049 
loss so how how does it feel one to come
back<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.070> get<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.429> win<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.849> much-needed

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
win but two more so is how the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.120 
win but two more so is how the
preparation<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.630> after<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> loss<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.830> come<00:00:17.010> back

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
preparation is after a loss to come back

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.760 
preparation is after a loss to come back
into<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.400> win<00:00:17.580> lemon<00:00:17.910> well<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:18.779> only<00:00:18.900> had<00:00:19.140> one

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
into a win lemon well we only had one

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.099 
into a win lemon well we only had one
game<00:00:20.100> between<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.640> actually<00:00:21.000> look<00:00:21.720> at<00:00:21.930> what

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
game between to actually look at what

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.380 
game between to actually look at what
they<00:00:22.230> did<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.560> their<00:00:22.740> initial<00:00:22.949> game<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.550> see

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
they did in their initial game and see

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.730 
they did in their initial game and see
how<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:24.900> affects<00:00:25.230> their<00:00:25.350> game<00:00:25.439> plan<00:00:25.500> going

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
how that affects their game plan going

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.769 
how that affects their game plan going
in<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.670> kinda<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.180> get<00:00:27.330> over<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
in so we kinda just have to get over the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.910 
in so we kinda just have to get over the
game<00:00:27.930> loss<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:28.529> quickly<00:00:28.710> as<00:00:28.890> possible

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
game loss like as quickly as possible

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.950 
game loss like as quickly as possible
just<00:00:29.310> basically<00:00:29.820> ignore<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.480> move

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
just basically ignore it and just move

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.479 
just basically ignore it and just move
from<00:00:31.109> there<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> there<00:00:32.279> anything

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
from there so is there anything

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.010 
from there so is there anything
specifically<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.329> gleaned<00:00:33.750> from

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
specifically that you gleaned from

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.080 
specifically that you gleaned from
complexities<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.250> game<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> day<00:00:35.790> that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
complexities first game of the day that

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.370 
complexities first game of the day that
you<00:00:36.239> were<00:00:36.329> able<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.600> utilize<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.230> game

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
you were able to utilize in this game

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.530 
you were able to utilize in this game
yeah<00:00:38.070> we<00:00:38.190> saw<00:00:38.370> them<00:00:38.550> prioritize<00:00:39.030> Malachi

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
yeah we saw them prioritize Malachi

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.990 
yeah we saw them prioritize Malachi
extremely<00:00:40.350> highly<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.829> think<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.790> was<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
extremely highly I think that was the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.280 
extremely highly I think that was the
most<00:00:42.180> interesting<00:00:42.719> thing<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.110> didn't

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
most interesting thing that we didn't

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.020 
most interesting thing that we didn't
actually<00:00:43.379> know<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.620> they<00:00:43.739> had<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.700> parity<00:00:45.000> or

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
actually know if they had that parity or

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
actually know if they had that parity or
not<00:00:45.239> all<00:00:45.690> right<00:00:45.870> well<00:00:46.200> then<00:00:46.289> sneaky<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.770> that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
not all right well then sneaky with that

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.100 
not all right well then sneaky with that
Malachi<00:00:47.489> priority<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.210> guys<00:00:48.360> chose<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.930> pull

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
Malachi priority you guys chose to pull

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.750 
Malachi priority you guys chose to pull
the<00:00:49.260> lane<00:00:49.410> swap<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.100> had<00:00:50.190> two<00:00:50.370> giant

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the lane swap because you had two giant

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.670 
the lane swap because you had two giant
tanks<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.660> picked<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> twitch<00:00:52.559> so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
tanks and you picked up the twitch so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.930 
tanks and you picked up the twitch so
talk<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.010> me<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.160> little<00:00:53.250> bit<00:00:53.460> about<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
talk to me a little bit about the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
talk to me a little bit about the
decision<00:00:54.360> there<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.809> lane<00:00:54.989> swap<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.469> how

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
decision there for the lane swap and how

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
decision there for the lane swap and how
it<00:00:55.949> ended<00:00:56.129> up<00:00:56.250> benefiting<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.820> guys<00:00:57.000> more<00:00:57.270> so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
it ended up benefiting you guys more so

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.139 
it ended up benefiting you guys more so
than<00:00:57.660> them<00:00:57.870> um<00:00:58.309> well<00:00:59.309> twitch<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.820> actually<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
than them um well twitch is actually a

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.430 
than them um well twitch is actually a
pretty<00:01:00.359> bad<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.989> her<00:01:01.109> unless<00:01:01.230> he's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
pretty bad to be to her unless he's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.900 
pretty bad to be to her unless he's
against<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> really<00:01:01.890> weak<00:01:02.070> cleaner<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:02.609> of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
against a really weak cleaner because of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.369 
against a really weak cleaner because of
the<00:01:02.969> nerf<00:01:03.180> steady<00:01:03.570> most<00:01:03.750> recently<00:01:04.049> got<00:01:04.229> is

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the nerf steady most recently got is

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.560 
the nerf steady most recently got is
like<00:01:04.500> base<00:01:04.739> ad<00:01:04.979> poison<00:01:05.489> damage<00:01:05.610> I've<00:01:06.240> tried<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
like base ad poison damage I've tried to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.090 
like base ad poison damage I've tried to
be<00:01:06.600> tuning<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.080> much<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.650> lose<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:07.979> in

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
be tuning so much and I just lose out in

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.310 
be tuning so much and I just lose out in
almost<00:01:08.340> all<00:01:08.549> trades<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.119> I'd<00:01:09.720> miss<00:01:10.080> kills

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
almost all trades and I'd miss kills

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.109 
almost all trades and I'd miss kills
because<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.770> nerve<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.189> tivity<00:01:11.909> wanting

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
because of the nerve so tivity wanting

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.730 
because of the nerve so tivity wanting
is<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.630> most<00:01:12.750> optimal<00:01:13.110> Stratford<00:01:13.590> which

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
is like the most optimal Stratford which

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.800 
is like the most optimal Stratford which
and<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.460> came<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.180> really<00:01:15.360> well<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:15.630> us

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and it came out really well for us

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.469 
and it came out really well for us
because<00:01:16.049> Malachi<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:17.090> I'm<00:01:18.090> not<00:01:18.299> really<00:01:18.390> sure

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
because Malachi was I'm not really sure

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.850 
because Malachi was I'm not really sure
exactly<00:01:18.630> where<00:01:19.080> he<00:01:19.140> was<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> entire<00:01:19.560> time<00:01:19.710> but

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
exactly where he was the entire time but

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.710 
exactly where he was the entire time but
he<00:01:19.920> got<00:01:20.009> super<00:01:20.400> behind<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.299> literally

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
he got super behind and I was literally

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.810 
he got super behind and I was literally
double<00:01:21.810> his<00:01:22.170> level<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.680> 3<00:01:22.950> or<00:01:23.100> he<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.580> 3<00:01:23.790> I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
double his level I was 3 or he was 3 I

strong compared to like a mage like
maokai<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.009> didn't<00:02:08.160> actually<00:02:08.250> want<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
prediction there it'll definitely be a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.530 
prediction there it'll definitely be a
lot<00:02:38.340> harder<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.670> talk<00:02:38.820> about<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.060> tease<00:02:39.270> because

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
right now it's super awkward where twist

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.470 
right now it's super awkward where twist
tristana<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.770> kog'maw<00:02:44.430> are<00:02:44.610> like<00:02:44.850> super<00:02:45.390> high

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
and he's kind of best two threes mess 25

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.020 
and he's kind of best two threes mess 25
so<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.260> think<00:04:22.349> it'll<00:04:22.530> be<00:04:22.590> quite<00:04:22.860> good<00:04:23.789> for<00:04:23.940> us

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
so I think it'll be quite good for us

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.820 
so I think it'll be quite good for us
alright<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:24.720> yeah<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:25.140> think<00:04:25.410> we've<00:04:25.560> learned<00:04:25.710> a

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
alright and yeah I think we've learned a

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.810 
alright and yeah I think we've learned a
lot<00:04:25.950> through<00:04:26.250> our

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
lot through our

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.090 
lot through our
best<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.120> threes<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.660> best<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:27.990> fives<00:04:28.260> usually

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
best of threes and best of fives usually

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.700 
best of threes and best of fives usually
it's<00:04:29.250> like<00:04:29.600> adaptability<00:04:30.600> throughout<00:04:31.560> the

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
it's like adaptability throughout the

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.860 
it's like adaptability throughout the
entire<00:04:31.980> series<00:04:32.370> is<00:04:32.820> what<00:04:33.060> needs<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.780> be

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
entire series is what needs to be

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.030 
entire series is what needs to be
learned<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.260> I<00:04:34.320> don't<00:04:34.440> know<00:04:34.530> if<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.920> lot<00:04:34.950> of

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
learned and I don't know if a lot of

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.710 
learned and I don't know if a lot of
teams<00:04:35.280> like<00:04:35.580> say<00:04:35.910> complexity<00:04:36.420> who<00:04:36.510> hasn't

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
teams like say complexity who hasn't

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.380 
teams like say complexity who hasn't
actually<00:04:36.810> done<00:04:37.020> many<00:04:37.230> of<00:04:37.350> them<00:04:37.470> would<00:04:37.770> know

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
actually done many of them would know

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.940 
actually done many of them would know
well<00:04:39.390> so<00:04:39.540> you<00:04:39.600> you<00:04:39.990> had<00:04:40.200> touched<00:04:40.500> on<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.920> fact

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
well so you you had touched on the fact

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.710 
well so you you had touched on the fact

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
that you had you kind of had to do that

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.450 
that you had you kind of had to do that
today<00:04:42.900> even<00:04:43.260> right<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.770> you<00:04:43.980> played<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.220> game

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
today even right you you played a game

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.180 
today even right you you played a game
you<00:04:44.910> had<00:04:45.060> only<00:04:45.180> one<00:04:45.540> game<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:45.990> kind<00:04:46.200> of<00:04:46.260> let

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
you had only one game to kind of let

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.160 
you had only one game to kind of let
everything<00:04:47.460> go<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:47.790> then<00:04:48.150> study<00:04:48.450> up<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:48.870> make

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
everything go and then study up and make

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.050 
everything go and then study up and make
your<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.650> know<00:04:49.770> your<00:04:49.800> decisions<00:04:50.430> based<00:04:50.880> on

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
your you know your decisions based on

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.700 
your you know your decisions based on
the<00:04:51.180> next<00:04:51.390> match<00:04:51.540> granted<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.140> different<00:04:52.500> team

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
the next match granted a different team

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.950 
the next match granted a different team
so<00:04:53.160> my<00:04:53.250> final<00:04:53.400> question<00:04:53.640> to<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.420> sneaky<00:04:54.840> is

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
so my final question to you sneaky is

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.200 
so my final question to you sneaky is
just<00:04:55.200> looking<00:04:55.770> forward<00:04:56.100> what<00:04:56.580> are<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.790> what

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
just looking forward what are the what

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.550 
just looking forward what are the what
are<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.360> finishing<00:04:57.540> touches<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.170> make<00:04:58.380> sure

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
are the finishing touches to make sure

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.620 
are the finishing touches to make sure
that<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:58.740> guys<00:04:58.860> can<00:04:59.220> you<00:04:59.490> know<00:04:59.580> 30<00:04:59.910> a<00:05:00.000> team<00:05:00.330> or

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
that you guys can you know 30 a team or

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.690 
that you guys can you know 30 a team or
whatever<00:05:01.110> going<00:05:01.350> through<00:05:01.500> playoffs<00:05:01.800> I<00:05:02.040> think

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
whatever going through playoffs I think

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.220 
whatever going through playoffs I think
it's<00:05:02.820> just<00:05:02.880> perfecting<00:05:03.510> our<00:05:03.570> practice<00:05:03.960> coming

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
it's just perfecting our practice coming

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.100 
it's just perfecting our practice coming
in<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.470> next<00:05:04.560> two<00:05:05.160> weeks<00:05:05.190> that<00:05:05.910> we<00:05:06.030> have<00:05:06.210> so<00:05:06.720> if

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
in the next two weeks that we have so if

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.960 
in the next two weeks that we have so if
we<00:05:07.350> get<00:05:07.920> down<00:05:08.130> our<00:05:08.250> practice<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.790> best

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
we get down our practice to the best

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.250 
we get down our practice to the best
that<00:05:09.030> it<00:05:09.210> can<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:09.570> we<00:05:09.690> come<00:05:10.050> out<00:05:10.080> ahead

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
that it can and we come out ahead

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.890 
that it can and we come out ahead
through<00:05:10.770> that<00:05:10.920> then<00:05:11.310> we'll<00:05:11.790> be<00:05:11.820> good<00:05:11.910> anything

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
through that then we'll be good anything

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.780 
through that then we'll be good anything
to<00:05:12.990> add<00:05:13.020> their<00:05:13.230> lemon<00:05:13.440> it's<00:05:13.890> an<00:05:14.070> extremely<00:05:14.550> big

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
to add their lemon it's an extremely big

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.030 
to add their lemon it's an extremely big
patch<00:05:14.970> that's<00:05:15.270> actually<00:05:15.660> coming<00:05:15.840> out<00:05:16.020> so<00:05:16.830> we

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
patch that's actually coming out so we

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.310 
patch that's actually coming out so we
have<00:05:17.130> to<00:05:17.250> adapt<00:05:17.550> like<00:05:17.670> very<00:05:18.120> quickly<00:05:18.930> to<00:05:19.080> this

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
have to adapt like very quickly to this

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.620 
have to adapt like very quickly to this
do<00:05:19.920> you<00:05:20.040> find<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:20.550> your<00:05:20.730> team<00:05:21.000> is<00:05:21.030> one<00:05:21.450> that

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
do you find that your team is one that

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.720 
do you find that your team is one that
can<00:05:21.930> adapt<00:05:22.230> more<00:05:22.890> quickly<00:05:22.950> than<00:05:23.340> others<00:05:23.580> do

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
can adapt more quickly than others do

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.830 
can adapt more quickly than others do
you<00:05:23.790> think<00:05:23.940> that's<00:05:24.060> an<00:05:24.150> advantage<00:05:24.300> for<00:05:24.720> you

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
you think that's an advantage for you

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.630 
you think that's an advantage for you
historically<00:05:25.530> we<00:05:25.770> have<00:05:25.800> been<00:05:26.160> able<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.400> adapt

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
historically we have been able to adapt

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.670 
historically we have been able to adapt
quite<00:05:27.450> well<00:05:27.660> compared<00:05:28.050> to<00:05:28.110> other<00:05:28.200> teams<00:05:28.410> but

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
quite well compared to other teams but

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.440 
quite well compared to other teams but
it's<00:05:29.010> different<00:05:29.730> every<00:05:29.850> patch<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.360> never

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
it's different every patch so you never

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.450 
it's different every patch so you never
know<00:05:30.660> all<00:05:30.990> right<00:05:31.200> well<00:05:31.560> best<00:05:31.800> of<00:05:31.950> luck<00:05:32.010> in<00:05:32.220> that
