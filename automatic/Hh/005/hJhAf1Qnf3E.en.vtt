used in the crease just to create this

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.510 
used in the crease just to create this

then<00:03:20.470> what<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.680> did<00:03:20.950> was<00:03:21.190> went<00:03:21.370> back<00:03:21.550> in<00:03:21.760> with

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
then what I did was went back in with

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.060 
then what I did was went back in with
the<00:03:22.000> very<00:03:22.270> first<00:03:22.420> color<00:03:22.960> that<00:03:23.050> foxy<00:03:23.680> shade<00:03:23.890> the

the very first color that foxy shade the

the very first color that foxy shade the
very<00:03:24.340> neutral<00:03:24.970> one<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:26.290> kind<00:03:26.710> of<00:03:26.800> redefined

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
very neutral one and I kind of redefined

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.640 
very neutral one and I kind of redefined
the<00:03:27.610> area<00:03:27.940> where<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.270> was<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:29.050> guess<00:03:29.260> in<00:03:29.500> a

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
the area where that was and I guess in a

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.650 
the area where that was and I guess in a
way<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:30.100> kind<00:03:30.310> of<00:03:30.370> shows<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.240> sticking

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
way that kind of shows that the sticking

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.600 
way that kind of shows that the sticking
to<00:03:31.780> like<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.140> roots<00:03:32.410> slightly<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.130> not<00:03:33.160> quite

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
to like the roots slightly and not quite

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.240 
to like the roots slightly and not quite
letting<00:03:33.910> go<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.390> more<00:03:35.380> innocent<00:03:35.860> side<00:03:36.070> of

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
letting go of the more innocent side of

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.390 
letting go of the more innocent side of
the<00:03:36.370> look

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.520 

then<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.060> wish<00:03:42.209> use<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.390> tiny<00:03:42.720> bit<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.140> snake

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
then I wish use a tiny bit of the snake

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.399 
then I wish use a tiny bit of the snake
bite<00:03:43.829> shade<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.310> middle<00:03:44.640> shade<00:03:44.900> just<00:03:45.900> under

but<00:03:53.510> I<00:03:53.600> used<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.870> white<00:03:54.050> eyeliner<00:03:54.290> in<00:03:54.980> the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:20.069 

you

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.779 

then<00:04:20.680> I'm<00:04:20.769> going<00:04:20.889> to<00:04:20.949> use<00:04:21.069> a<00:04:21.099> tiny<00:04:21.370> bit<00:04:21.609> of<00:04:21.699> the

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
palette and this is called naked and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.570 
palette and this is called naked and
it's<00:04:25.720> just<00:04:25.840> this<00:04:25.930> little<00:04:26.110> troop<00:04:26.620> here<00:04:26.860> some

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
it's just this little troop here some

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.129 
it's just this little troop here some
skins<00:04:27.849> needs<00:04:27.970> a<00:04:28.090> tiny<00:04:28.330> little<00:04:28.539> bit<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:28.960> on

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
skins needs a tiny little bit of this on

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:37.170 
skins needs a tiny little bit of this on
the<00:04:29.259> lips<00:04:30.960> bit<00:04:31.960> too<00:04:32.110> much

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.700 

I'm<00:04:37.870> actually<00:04:38.050> going<00:04:38.289> to<00:04:38.350> block<00:04:38.530> that<00:04:38.650> off

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
I'm actually going to block that off

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.800 
I'm actually going to block that off
slightly<00:04:39.070> because<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.820> doesn't<00:04:40.210> seem<00:04:40.660> to

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
slightly because it doesn't seem to

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.260 
slightly because it doesn't seem to
quite<00:04:41.050> fit<00:04:41.470> with<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.740> character<00:04:42.220> somehow<00:04:42.580> so

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
quite fit with the character somehow so

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.460 
quite fit with the character somehow so
I'm<00:04:43.360> going<00:04:43.389> to<00:04:43.570> leave<00:04:43.690> a<00:04:43.720> very<00:04:43.990> slight<00:04:44.350> trace
