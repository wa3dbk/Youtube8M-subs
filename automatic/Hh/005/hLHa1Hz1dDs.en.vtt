00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
the doors themselves right here I have

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.170 
the doors themselves right here I have
to<00:00:23.919> say<00:00:24.130> in<00:00:24.189> this<00:00:24.279> little<00:00:24.550> bit<00:00:24.669> right<00:00:24.849> here<00:00:24.880> but

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
to say in this little bit right here but

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.950 
to say in this little bit right here but
i<00:00:25.210> sealed<00:00:25.540> up<00:00:25.720> the<00:00:25.779> gap<00:00:26.110> in<00:00:27.070> between<00:00:27.310> so<00:00:28.000> the

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
i sealed up the gap in between so the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.979 
i sealed up the gap in between so the
10-inch<00:00:29.649> will<00:00:29.800> have<00:00:29.950> they<00:00:30.270> have<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:31.300> clear<00:00:31.810> air

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
10-inch will have they have a clear air

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:33.210 
10-inch will have they have a clear air
flowing<00:00:32.349> have<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:32.680> worry<00:00:32.829> about<00:00:32.950> you<00:00:33.190> know

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
much leg room as i thought you know i'm

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.599 
much leg room as i thought you know i'm
really<00:01:21.219> going<00:01:21.490> up<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.909> 250<00:01:22.600> Hertz<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:23.170> um<00:01:23.609> it

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
really going up to 250 Hertz so um it

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.099 
really going up to 250 Hertz so um it
should<00:01:24.819> be<00:01:24.939> pretty<00:01:25.119> straight<00:01:25.509> you<00:01:25.689> know<00:01:25.719> I<00:01:25.840> got

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
should be pretty straight you know I got

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:27.840 
should be pretty straight you know I got
to<00:01:26.139> fabricate<00:01:26.590> someone<00:01:27.159> how<00:01:27.219> to<00:01:27.249> grill<00:01:27.549> but<00:01:27.789> I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850

know<00:01:53.289> i<00:01:54.749> have<00:01:55.749> to<00:01:55.779> hit<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.649> with<00:01:56.920> some<00:01:57.399> 50<00:01:57.609> s<00:01:57.789> on

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999 
know i have to hit it with some 50 s on

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:02.669 
know i have to hit it with some 50 s on
the<00:01:58.090> back<00:01:58.270> too<00:01:58.569> but<00:02:01.139> this<00:02:02.139> is<00:02:02.289> give<00:02:02.439> you<00:02:02.560> an

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679

idea<00:02:02.799> I<00:02:03.039> got<00:02:03.099> to<00:02:03.310> put<00:02:03.399> my<00:02:03.459> hand<00:02:03.789> over<00:02:03.909> so<00:02:04.179> the

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
idea I got to put my hand over so the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.230 
idea I got to put my hand over so the
glare<00:02:04.479> doesn't<00:02:04.810> get<00:02:04.899> you<00:02:05.020> it's<00:02:05.139> late<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.729> as

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
you can see it's a it's countersunk so

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.630 
you can see it's a it's countersunk so
the<00:02:11.080> subs<00:02:11.709> are<00:02:11.860> actually<00:02:12.130> going<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.310> be<00:02:12.370> flush

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
the subs are actually going to be flush

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.020 
the subs are actually going to be flush
mounting<00:02:13.000> all<00:02:13.090> this'll<00:02:13.570> all<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:15.670> right<00:02:15.850> here

what's going to be the problem now the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.490 
what's going to be the problem now the
back<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.819> baffle<00:02:32.240> itself<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.870> actually<00:02:33.080> um

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
back of the baffle itself is actually um

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.360 
back of the baffle itself is actually um
is<00:02:34.280> actually<00:02:35.320> still<00:02:36.320> foam<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.890> wood<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.100> what

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
is actually still foam and wood and what

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.890 
is actually still foam and wood and what
we're<00:02:37.459> going<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.640> do<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.970> we're<00:02:38.120> about<00:02:38.330> as<00:02:38.660> much

we're going to do is we're about as much

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.100 
we're going to do is we're about as much
fun<00:02:38.959> as<00:02:39.410> we<00:02:39.560> can<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.940> know<00:02:41.060> make<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.510> um<00:02:41.690> you

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
know just give it as much as the foam as

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
know just give it as much as the foam as
we<00:02:44.180> can<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.480> then<00:02:44.540> we're<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:44.750> going<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:44.989> go

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
we can and then we're just going to go

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.710 
we can and then we're just going to go
ahead<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.940> fiberglass<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.150> rear<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.630> as

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
ahead and fiberglass the rear of it as

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.729 
ahead and fiberglass the rear of it as
well<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:49.510> in<00:02:50.510> any<00:02:50.660> case<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:53.410> baffles<00:02:54.410> get<00:02:54.620> in

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
well so in any case the baffles get in

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.900 
well so in any case the baffles get in
there<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:56.209> looks<00:02:56.540> rough<00:02:56.780> now<00:02:57.080> but<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:58.519> needs<00:02:58.730> to

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
there it looks rough now but it needs to

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.979 
there it looks rough now but it needs to
be<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:01.010> needs<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.340> be<00:03:01.459> sanded<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.720> needs<00:03:02.900> to

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
be it needs to be sanded and it needs to

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.460 
be it needs to be sanded and it needs to
have<00:03:03.170> body<00:03:03.410> filler<00:03:03.739> um<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:05.870> little<00:03:06.110> gap<00:03:06.290> you

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
have body filler um that little gap you

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.810 
have body filler um that little gap you
see<00:03:06.680> right<00:03:06.890> there<00:03:07.100> i<00:03:07.130> think<00:03:07.459> i'm<00:03:07.550> going<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.730> try

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
see right there i think i'm going to try

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.350 
see right there i think i'm going to try
to<00:03:07.880> make<00:03:08.030> like<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.450> like<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:08.989> seat<00:03:09.290> back<00:03:09.500> here<00:03:09.560> so

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
to make like a like a seat back here so

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.120 
to make like a like a seat back here so
there<00:03:11.360> might<00:03:11.510> be<00:03:11.570> like<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.870> long<00:03:12.320> one<00:03:12.890> or<00:03:13.010> two

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
there might be like a long one or two

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.280 
there might be like a long one or two
struts<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.640> run<00:03:13.880> across<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.570> will<00:03:14.870> tie<00:03:15.110> in

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
struts that run across and will tie in

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.100 
struts that run across and will tie in
in<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.530> center<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:16.010> then<00:03:16.870> what<00:03:17.870> I'm<00:03:17.930> going<00:03:18.050> to

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
in the center and then what I'm going to

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.770 
in the center and then what I'm going to
try<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.320> do<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:18.739> basically<00:03:19.130> fabricate<00:03:19.970> so

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
try to do is basically fabricate so

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.140 
try to do is basically fabricate so
it'll<00:03:21.019> be<00:03:21.050> on<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.530> baffle<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:23.000> amp

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
it'll be on the baffle and the the amp

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.020 
it'll be on the baffle and the the amp
raksin<00:03:23.630> down<00:03:23.780> here<00:03:23.989> in<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.140> nasty<00:03:24.350> area<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.030> I

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
raksin down here in the nasty area and I

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.789 
raksin down here in the nasty area and I
want<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.269> fabricate<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:26.900> bunch<00:03:27.200> of<00:03:27.320> little

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
want to fabricate a bunch of little

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.530 
want to fabricate a bunch of little
slats<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.519> can<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:29.030> know<00:03:29.120> screw<00:03:29.360> together

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
slats that I can you know screw together

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.319 
slats that I can you know screw together
and<00:03:30.160> making<00:03:31.160> different<00:03:31.459> gaps<00:03:31.790> or<00:03:32.090> making

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
and making different gaps or making

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.569 
and making different gaps or making
different<00:03:32.540> different<00:03:32.870> distances<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:34.370> way<00:03:34.549> I

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
different different distances that way I

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.400 
different different distances that way I
can<00:03:34.850> make<00:03:35.030> them<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.510> can<00:03:35.870> still<00:03:36.110> make<00:03:36.230> it<00:03:36.260> a

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
can make them I can still make it a

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.810 
can make them I can still make it a
usable<00:03:36.709> seat<00:03:36.980> back<00:03:37.160> there<00:03:37.190> but<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:37.670> will<00:03:37.760> be

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
usable seat back there but it will be

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.210 
usable seat back there but it will be
mostly<00:03:37.970> fiberglass<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:39.140> know<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:39.530> I'm<00:03:40.040> going

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
mostly fiberglass you know and I'm going

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.710 
mostly fiberglass you know and I'm going
to<00:03:40.250> tie<00:03:40.459> in<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.700> little<00:03:41.030> gaps<00:03:41.239> that<00:03:41.510> will<00:03:41.630> be

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
to tie in the little gaps that will be

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.910 
to tie in the little gaps that will be
on<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.840> corners<00:03:42.260> here<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.650> on<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:42.829> other

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
on the corners here and on the other

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.530 
on the corners here and on the other
side<00:03:43.220> as<00:03:43.370> well<00:03:43.400> so<00:03:45.130> in<00:03:46.130> any<00:03:46.280> case<00:03:46.400> um<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.450> know

side as well so in any case um you know

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.350 
side as well so in any case um you know
the<00:03:47.690> expanding<00:03:48.110> foam<00:03:48.290> took<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.620> while<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:49.360> then

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
the expanding foam took a while and then

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.880 
the expanding foam took a while and then
I<00:03:50.450> ran<00:03:50.600> out<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.810> glass<00:03:51.049> so<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.470> got<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.709> get<00:03:51.829> some

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
I ran out of glass so I got to get some

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.880 
I ran out of glass so I got to get some
more<00:03:52.070> glass<00:03:52.310> but<00:03:52.700> um<00:03:52.910> as<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:54.590> can<00:03:54.650> see<00:03:54.860> I

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.620 
more glass but um as you can see I
didn't<00:03:55.160> even<00:03:55.310> try<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:55.489> waste<00:03:55.790> it<00:03:56.030> on<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.269> edges

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
didn't even try to waste it on the edges

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.420 
didn't even try to waste it on the edges
right<00:03:56.780> there<00:03:57.049> you<00:03:57.410> know<00:03:57.530> that's<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.100> just<00:03:58.280> left

that little stuff so as long as it came
up<00:04:00.860> to<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.070> corner<00:04:01.430> while<00:04:01.579> I<00:04:01.610> was

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
up to the corner while I was

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.539 
up to the corner while I was
fiberglassing<00:04:02.299> I<00:04:02.480> just<00:04:02.690> lifted<00:04:02.870> bear<00:04:03.549> you

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
fiberglassing I just lifted bear you

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.039

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
because I don't want to waste anything

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.449 
because I don't want to waste anything
so<00:04:07.579> um<00:04:08.890> yeah<00:04:09.890> I<00:04:11.680> was<00:04:12.680> thinking<00:04:12.980> about<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.250> and

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
so um yeah I was thinking about it and

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.759 
so um yeah I was thinking about it and
it<00:04:13.579> should<00:04:13.640> make<00:04:13.940> a<00:04:13.970> pretty<00:04:14.769> pretty

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
it should make a pretty pretty

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.500 
it should make a pretty pretty
impressive<00:04:16.220> sound<00:04:16.489> stage<00:04:16.820> when<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.120> gets<00:04:17.269> done

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
impressive sound stage when it gets done

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.199 
impressive sound stage when it gets done
now<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:18.350> think<00:04:19.340> in<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.549> interim<00:04:19.880> I'm<00:04:20.000> just

to<00:05:47.810> worry<00:05:47.840> about<00:05:47.990> any<00:05:48.289> tape<00:05:48.620> so<00:05:48.919> it's<00:05:49.099> just

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
to worry about any tape so it's just

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.250 
to worry about any tape so it's just
like<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.639> rear<00:05:49.849> of<00:05:49.880> it<00:05:50.240> and<00:05:50.419> the<00:05:50.599> very<00:05:50.840> core<00:05:51.229> of

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
the top of it really gave it a like

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.409 
the top of it really gave it a like
almost<00:06:06.020> like<00:06:06.139> a<00:06:06.260> clean<00:06:06.590> edge<00:06:06.860> so<00:06:07.310> um<00:06:07.550> you<00:06:08.330> know

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
when i sanded bondo and it should be it
