 new blog new blood and talk about the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.729
 events before the human war 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.440
 covenant during the human war eat 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.550
 before and after the human war 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.290
 covenant 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.030
 this from the sergeant's perspective 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.490
 of artillery edward box 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.770
 is known as what is the leader of the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.200
 halo squadron 3 or 10 and all 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.940
 we remember is very good and all this 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.400
 talks about what happened to the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.970
 squad after the game during and 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.090
 before all this very well beginning 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.430
 we can see what is this here the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.780
 most important points of the book and from 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.270
 what vox 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.759
 miki and romeo willing that the other 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.700
 about if everyone becomes a sparta 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.039
 in 4 all of this in fact is that they are 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.350
 the first generation of Spartans 4 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.600
 of the spartan project 4 and they are all 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.940
 recruited by the spartan hyung so is 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.789
 the same halo spartan reach the one that 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.979
 the sniper was the spartan 3 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:09.100
 We can also see how that 2 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.120
 retires from the ufc and goes to what is the 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.380
 bible with his ex-wife who 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.170
 reconciled and it turns out that already 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.870
 it was an audi steel we can also see 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.090
 like in a draco operation 3 this 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.730
 they still hate you 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.040
 track or 3 is the home planet of box 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.709
 we see how in this operation it was 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.440
 requested by veronica of remember that 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.480
 she is his girlfriend and he is also an agent 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.849
 office of naval intelligence is 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.099
 say of the onic we can see how the 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.900
 operation unfortunately what is the 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.810
 novice who is the character we play 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.970
 like him in the game for say so 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.519
 say it as it is mainly 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.280
 unfortunately killed for what it is 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.230
 a captain of the united rebel front is 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.360
 say the insurrection istas 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.510
 we also see how in an operation 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.580
 before all this before he saw 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.200
 we look at vogue with everyone who is 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.840
 his men that the three Audi esti to 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.049
 he had the same squad but he had 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.330
 what other men are we see how it is 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.190
 that saves the expert in sara palmer 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.769
 although in those moments she too 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.500
 he was still hostile so how are you going to 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.099
 lift up palmer and that 's how it's like 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.599
 they already know each other in the future after 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.030
 we also see how in that same 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.370
 operation is of box they put what is before 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.530
 all their men's lives because they 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.390
 that operation he had to recover a 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.910
 pretty important data chip for 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.910
 the onu this all entrusted 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.299
 by veronica under but I repeat he 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:45.200
 what is this his human sense came out before 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.030
 all these adversities also the book 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.129
 talks about what is the relationship that 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.859
 they have vÃ©ronique aubert and this box 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.230
 during the war and as it is something very 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.959
 difficult because they remember that he is 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.120
 part of the nfc and she of the un and this one 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.110
 it's not a war that the 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.360
 truth could 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.240
 exterminate humanity get up 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.240
 those points we also see how is your 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.610
 life before joining the nfc and which 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.580
 are the reasons for what he joined 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.470
 the need because he enlisted we see that 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.390
 once humanity in general is 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.850
 he learned from the covenant was that he when 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.100
 He turned 18 he enlisted in his center 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.990
 of recruitment and after several 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.480
 years of service in the body of hobbies 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.730
 of good etc is that he decided 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.360
 transfer what is the audi 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.860
 Orbital styles drop softwares because the 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.350
 so I thought I could do it that is 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.480
 this one a better job and more than anything else 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.820
 fast what is a response to the 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.560
 young boys 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.050
 we also see the book as we 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.440
 confirms hyung that this noble 6 was 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.200
 murdered and that his gender was that he was 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.970
 male very well also shows us 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.800
 how is it that box never wanted to be a 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.830
 spartan since he preferred to remain 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.500
 which is 110 but the circumstances 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.480
 led to this we also see how in 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.930
 an operation that was in this box 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.420
 mickey and romeo all already as spartan 4 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.430
 They were in an operation to rescue 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.170
 what is to open I remember is the 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.690
 engineer that we have to rescue the 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.580
 end of the halo 3 odst we see as a 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.990
 operation were in what is the 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.940
 rescue the duty of which he was 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.700
 kidnapped by the insurrection istas 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.220
 wings and also what this sail is like 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.310
 and that she is the one of the miniterminal 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.960
 of halo 3 odst we see how in this 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.480
 operation is that mickey becomes 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.120
 a traitor of the good sc and joins the 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.310
 rebel front united also after 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.560
 we already see what the outcome of the 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.660
 book how is it that I am taken to what 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.880
 is to a court martial and then they have 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.670
 led from there to what it is to jail 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.940
 the nfc good one of his several prisons 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.340
 we also do not see them I repeat how is it 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.190
 two the already retired and that the rookie was 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.800
 murdered which leaves us the squadron 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.950
 only with mouth and romeo then 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.810
 this is a speculation that very 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.000
 likely to box one of the members 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.190
 of the spartan team what due to 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.350
 your terms that you have with the office of 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.810
 naval intelligence remember that the 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.550
 make a boyfriend of this veronica we can 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.230
 see what is how it is that the on and 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.850
 obviously you are going to investigate a lot 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.820
 about him that is something that is seen in the 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.910
 book also something that we see this from the 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.230
 spartans remember that this the spartan 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.910
 what also has to look pretty 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.100
 colom and therefore this would have 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.720
 sense but in general gang the 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.670
 truth is very good the book I know the 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.920
 I recommend everyone who wants a 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.660
 sequel to halo 3 or 10 and must 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.390
 buy this book since here we see more 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.060
 things also of what is the point of 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.860
 game halo 3 av 10 and we see how it is 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.900
 that this box is narrating from his 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.820
 perspective and that is the truth is 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.380
 pretty good the book has parts 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.380
 strong such as the death of the 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.030
 rookie 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.280
 the truth is very interesting and they 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.380
 I recommend that you read it unfortunately 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.420
 I only found it in English therefore 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.770
 if they do not speak English if they want to read what 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.200
 they will have to wait until it comes out 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.630
 a Spanish version but not but it 's 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.150
 very good and for 5 dollars 75 pesos 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.890
 they should check them so 1 gang 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.140
