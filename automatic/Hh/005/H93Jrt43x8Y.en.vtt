lounge around about eight years old and

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.480 
lounge around about eight years old and
I<00:00:22.869> decided<00:00:22.930> I<00:00:23.380> wanted<00:00:23.980> to<00:00:24.039> try<00:00:24.220> out<00:00:24.279> as<00:00:24.430> a

alternate<00:00:26.650> so<00:00:27.039> from<00:00:27.250> there<00:00:27.400> I<00:00:27.429> just<00:00:27.460> kind<00:00:27.670> of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
alternate so from there I just kind of

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.450 
alternate so from there I just kind of
stuck<00:00:27.970> with<00:00:28.000> it<00:00:28.330> and<00:00:28.480> I<00:00:29.199> just<00:00:29.590> kept<00:00:29.740> playing<00:00:29.920> I
