technology you may be wondering what the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.450 
technology you may be wondering what the
heck<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.710> means<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.160> board

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
heck is that that means that this board

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.959 
heck is that that means that this board
is<00:00:33.050> asymmetrical<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.260> course<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:35.340> means<00:00:35.700> that

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
is asymmetrical of course it means that

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.420 
is asymmetrical of course it means that
the<00:00:36.390> toe<00:00:36.660> side<00:00:36.930> edge<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.320> longer<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.219> heel

a pretty soft flex rating to this deck
now<00:01:19.049> canoe<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.920> believe<00:01:20.250> racist<00:01:20.790> thing<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> have

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
now canoe I believe racist thing to have

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.700 
now canoe I believe racist thing to have
a<00:01:21.240> fluctuating<00:01:21.780> between<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:22.080> got<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
a fluctuating between they got like a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.820 
a fluctuating between they got like a
3.5<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> 5<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.080> think<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> entire

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
3.5 to like a 5 or so I think the entire

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.300 
3.5 to like a 5 or so I think the entire
line<00:01:26.299> has<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> flex<00:01:27.630> rating<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.350> 4<00:01:28.590> but

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
line has a flex rating of about of 4 but

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.880 
line has a flex rating of about of 4 but
past<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.000> contact<00:01:30.450> points<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.930> feel<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
past the contact points I feel that the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.240 
past the contact points I feel that the
board<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.549> really<00:01:32.939> really<00:01:33.210> soft

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.690 
that heel side edge and the reason that
this<00:01:45.479> board<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.979> asymmetrical<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
this board is asymmetrical it's just a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.060 
this board is asymmetrical it's just a
turn<00:01:47.970> easier<00:01:48.390> when<00:01:48.930> you're<00:01:49.079> rocking<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
turn easier when you're rocking on that

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.889 
turn easier when you're rocking on that
heel<00:01:50.280> side<00:01:50.520> edge<00:01:50.549> there's<00:01:51.270> also<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.600> liquid

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
heel side edge there's also a liquid

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.899 
heel side edge there's also a liquid
crystal<00:01:52.079> polymer<00:01:52.770> fibers<00:01:53.189> better<00:01:53.490> run

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
crystal polymer fibers better run

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.520 
crystal polymer fibers better run
throughout<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> deck<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:55.020> kind<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.290> act

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
throughout the deck that kind of act

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.260 
throughout the deck that kind of act
like<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> fiberglass<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.060> there's<00:01:57.210> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
like a fiberglass and then there's a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.510 
like a fiberglass and then there's a
space<00:01:57.600> bar<00:01:57.960> now<00:01:58.469> there's<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.799> second<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.430> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
space bar now there's a second it's a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.399 
space bar now there's a second it's a
great<00:01:59.729> name<00:01:59.909> for<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.329> because<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.259> actually

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
great name for it because it's actually

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.830 
great name for it because it's actually
the<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.219> between<00:02:02.579> your<00:02:02.700> feet<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.210> it

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the just in between your feet and it

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
the just in between your feet and it
adds<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.229> little<00:02:04.439> bit<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.710> more<00:02:05.009> structure<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
adds a little bit of more structure to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.340 
adds a little bit of more structure to
the<00:02:05.909> board<00:02:06.149> when<00:02:06.540> you're<00:02:06.659> landing<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.170> like

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the board when you're landing in like

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.830 
the board when you're landing in like
really<00:02:08.129> deep<00:02:08.340> board<00:02:08.640> slides<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.119> go<00:02:09.239> back<00:02:09.569> lip

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
really deep board slides you go back lip

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.170 
really deep board slides you go back lip
over<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> huge<00:02:10.410> gap<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.009> gives<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.849> board<00:02:12.030> a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
over a huge gap and gives the board a

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.030 
over a huge gap and gives the board a
little<00:02:12.270> bit<00:02:12.390> more<00:02:12.599> strength<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.319> between<00:02:13.890> your

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
little bit more strength in between your

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.100 
little bit more strength in between your
feet<00:02:14.250> without<00:02:14.760> adding<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.239> lot<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.450> torsional

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
feet without adding a lot of torsional

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.440 
feet without adding a lot of torsional
rigid<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:17.459> base<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.790> going<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.000> be<00:02:18.090> nice<00:02:18.270> and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
rigid the base is going to be nice and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.360 
rigid the base is going to be nice and
fast<00:02:18.629> it's<00:02:19.020> been<00:02:19.200> factory<00:02:19.590> waxed<00:02:19.890> by<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.220> ball
