00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
sizes smaller on your ring mandrel you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.220 
sizes smaller on your ring mandrel you
can<00:00:34.380> push<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.770> around<00:00:34.829> with<00:00:35.160> your<00:00:35.280> fingers<00:00:36.230> if

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.880 
can push it around with your fingers if
you<00:00:37.290> textured<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.370> lot<00:00:39.079> you<00:00:40.079> may<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
you textured it a lot you may have to

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
you textured it a lot you may have to
anneal<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.579> again<00:00:42.000> before<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.840> get<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:44.510> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
anneal it again before you can get it to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.810 
anneal it again before you can get it to
bend<00:00:45.750> properly<00:00:46.350> I've<00:00:46.620> got<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.950> pretty<00:00:47.640> well

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
bend properly I've got this pretty well

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.110 
bend properly I've got this pretty well
work<00:00:48.120> harden<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.809> I'm<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.530> anneal<00:00:49.950> it

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
work harden so I'm going to anneal it

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.100 
work harden so I'm going to anneal it
but<00:00:51.120> once<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:52.140> get<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> right<00:00:52.949> size

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
but once you get it to the right size

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.279 
but once you get it to the right size
then<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.219> put<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.850> your<00:00:57.059> finger<00:00:57.289> put

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
then you can put it on your finger put

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.459 
then you can put it on your finger put
your<00:00:58.469> bead<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.859> place<00:00:58.969> mark<00:01:00.289> where<00:01:01.289> you're

your bead in place mark where you're
going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.770> need<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.070> drill<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.299> push<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.810> end

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
going to need to drill so I push the end

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.929 
going to need to drill so I push the end
slightly<00:01:07.590> closer<00:01:07.890> together<00:01:08.189> then<00:01:08.670> I'm<00:01:08.790> going

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
slightly closer together then I'm going

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.710

pliers and gently push that back to the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.899 
pliers and gently push that back to the
outside<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.740> has<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> nicer<00:01:29.880> shape

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
outside so that it has a nicer shape

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:39.020 
outside so that it has a nicer shape
make<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.090> symmetrical

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
this point you need to figure what

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.900 
this point you need to figure what
you're<00:02:08.560> going<00:02:08.829> to<00:02:08.950> put<00:02:09.130> inside<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.910> put

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
you're going to put inside so you put

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.020 
you're going to put inside so you put
this<00:02:13.060> on<00:02:13.299> your<00:02:13.450> ring<00:02:13.660> mandrel<00:02:14.459> get<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.670> area

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
this on your ring mandrel get the area

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.180 
this on your ring mandrel get the area
where<00:02:16.299> you're<00:02:16.480> going<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.780> drill<00:02:17.170> drill<00:02:17.920> your

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
where you're going to drill drill your

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.880 
where you're going to drill drill your
hole<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:19.180> match<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:20.530> size<00:02:20.829> of<00:02:21.069> your<00:02:21.250> tubing

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
hole to match the size of your tubing

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.960 
hole to match the size of your tubing
and<00:02:24.030> what<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.060> did<00:02:25.510> was<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:26.200> drilled<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.220> hole<00:02:27.250> in

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
and what I did was I drilled a hole in

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.949 
and what I did was I drilled a hole in
the<00:02:28.630> middle<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.170> match<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:31.180> diameter<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.750> the

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
the middle to match the diameter of the

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.240 
the middle to match the diameter of the
wire<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.500> then<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.400> punched<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:34.090> disks<00:02:34.480> out

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
wire and then I punched the disks out

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.250 
wire and then I punched the disks out
I've<00:02:36.250> used<00:02:36.549> brass<00:02:36.970> copper<00:02:37.450> silver<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:40.739> found<00:02:41.739> a

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
I've used brass copper silver I found a

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.470 
I've used brass copper silver I found a
turquoise<00:02:44.260> bead<00:02:44.739> that's<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.850> same<00:02:46.150> diameter

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
turquoise bead that's the same diameter

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.309 
turquoise bead that's the same diameter
so<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.319> thought<00:02:47.859> I<00:02:47.889> would<00:02:48.069> include<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.319> so

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
so I thought I would include that so

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.030 
so I thought I would include that so
just<00:02:50.590> make<00:02:50.799> sure<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:52.019> your<00:02:53.019> wire<00:02:53.350> your

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
just make sure that your wire your

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.569 
just make sure that your wire your
Cheniere<00:02:54.609> goes<00:02:55.329> through<00:02:55.750> all<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.170> pieces

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
Cheniere goes through all of the pieces

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.729 
Cheniere goes through all of the pieces
then<00:02:57.579> you<00:02:57.700> can<00:02:57.880> measure<00:02:58.090> your<00:02:58.510> width<00:02:58.780> to

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
then you can measure your width to

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.590 
then you can measure your width to
figure<00:03:00.040> out<00:03:00.220> how<00:03:00.549> much<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.150> stuff<00:03:01.420> you

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
figure out how much of this stuff you

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.240 
figure out how much of this stuff you
want<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.930> put<00:03:02.109> in<00:03:02.700> now<00:03:04.349> I've<00:03:05.349> drawn<00:03:05.769> this<00:03:05.980> wire

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
want to put in now I've drawn this wire

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.460 
want to put in now I've drawn this wire
down<00:03:06.549> so<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.090> it's<00:03:07.269> one<00:03:07.540> point<00:03:07.930> one<00:03:08.230> in

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
down so that it's one point one in

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.319 
down so that it's one point one in
diameter<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.190> can<00:03:09.430> see<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:10.060> there's

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
diameter and you can see that there's

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.890 
diameter and you can see that there's
still<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:12.040> little<00:03:12.340> hole<00:03:12.549> in<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:13.030> end<00:03:13.889> now

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
still the little hole in the end now

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.479 
still the little hole in the end now

the way you want it and kneel this
little<00:03:22.450> piece<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.900> Cheniere<00:03:24.480> before<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:27.370> do

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
little piece of Cheniere before you do

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.270 
little piece of Cheniere before you do
your<00:03:27.790> final<00:03:28.060> assembly<00:03:28.889> because<00:03:29.889> we're<00:03:30.099> going

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
your final assembly because we're going

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.309 
your final assembly because we're going
to<00:03:30.370> use<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:31.410> tapered<00:03:32.410> punch<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:34.239> spread<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.109> end

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
to use a tapered punch to spread the end

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.569 
to use a tapered punch to spread the end
a<00:03:35.500> little<00:03:35.620> bit<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.799> will<00:03:39.040> be<00:03:39.160> a<00:03:39.190> hollow

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
a little bit so this will be a hollow

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.000 
a little bit so this will be a hollow
rivet

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.140 

now<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.189> is<00:03:44.370> where<00:03:44.549> you<00:03:44.640> can<00:03:44.790> be<00:03:44.939> a<00:03:44.970> little

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
now this is where you can be a little

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.059 
now this is where you can be a little
bit<00:03:45.329> creative<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:46.049> can<00:03:46.200> use<00:03:46.470> different

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
bit creative you can use different

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.250 
bit creative you can use different
metals<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:49.470> can<00:03:49.500> texture<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.939> edges<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:52.170> your

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
metals you can texture the edges of your

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.190 
metals you can texture the edges of your
disc<00:03:53.689> you<00:03:54.689> can<00:03:54.720> put<00:03:55.079> saw<00:03:55.349> marks<00:03:55.769> in<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:57.200> the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
disc you can put saw marks in it the

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.449 
disc you can put saw marks in it the
sky's<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.560> limit<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:59.790> can<00:03:59.970> use<00:04:00.290> offset<00:04:01.459> disks

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
sky's the limit you can use offset disks

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.580 
sky's the limit you can use offset disks
or<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:02.849> drill<00:04:03.239> your<00:04:03.510> holes<00:04:03.780> at<00:04:04.109> a<00:04:04.230> different

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
or you drill your holes at a different

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.099 
or you drill your holes at a different
place<00:04:05.010> rather<00:04:05.609> than<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.269> middle<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:07.049> can

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
place rather than in the middle you can

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.990 
place rather than in the middle you can
drill<00:04:07.409> them<00:04:07.530> off<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.010> side<00:04:08.040> so<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:08.700> the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
drill them off to the side so that the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.179 
drill them off to the side so that the
disc<00:04:09.239> will<00:04:09.560> not<00:04:10.560> all<00:04:10.890> be<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.370> same<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:14.040> have

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
disc will not all be the same so I have

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:20.629 
disc will not all be the same so I have
fun<00:04:14.459> with<00:04:14.640> this<00:04:19.010> before<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.190> do<00:04:20.370> your<00:04:20.579> final

the way you want it to look when it's

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.879 
the way you want it to look when it's
finally<00:04:35.310> done<00:04:35.789> because<00:04:36.690> once<00:04:37.139> once<00:04:37.710> you

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
finally done because once once you

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.129 
finally done because once once you
assemble<00:04:38.250> this<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:39.389> won't<00:04:39.630> be<00:04:39.810> able<00:04:39.990> to

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
assemble this you won't be able to

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.710 
assemble this you won't be able to
polish<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.650> or<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.669> won't<00:04:41.820> be<00:04:41.940> able<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.270> polish

polish it or you won't be able to polish

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.060 
polish it or you won't be able to polish
it<00:04:42.900> as<00:04:43.099> effectively<00:04:44.099> so<00:04:44.759> do<00:04:44.940> it<00:04:45.090> now<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.860> this

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
it as effectively so do it now so this

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.540 
it as effectively so do it now so this
is<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.460> stack<00:04:47.729> I've<00:04:48.300> chosen<00:04:48.889> and<00:04:49.889> you<00:04:50.130> can<00:04:50.310> see

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
is the stack I've chosen and you can see

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.860 
is the stack I've chosen and you can see
there's<00:04:50.820> about<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.360> millimeter<00:04:53.210> of<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.750> tubing

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
there's about a millimeter of the tubing

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.800 
there's about a millimeter of the tubing
sticking<00:04:57.870> out<00:04:58.080> either<00:04:58.289> end<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:59.630> what<00:05:00.630> we're

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
sticking out either end and what we're

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.409 
sticking out either end and what we're
going<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.080> do<00:05:01.289> now<00:05:01.500> is<00:05:01.740> put<00:05:02.039> this<00:05:02.220> on<00:05:02.520> our

our nice sharpened punch put it in the
end<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:09.930> spread<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:10.800> in<00:05:13.430> so<00:05:14.430> you<00:05:14.490> can<00:05:14.729> see

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
end and spread that in so you can see

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.589 
end and spread that in so you can see
I've<00:05:15.180> got<00:05:15.389> my<00:05:16.110> punch<00:05:16.380> nice<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.039> sharp<00:05:17.570> so<00:05:18.570> that

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
I've got my punch nice and sharp so that

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:23.379 
I've got my punch nice and sharp so that
it<00:05:18.930> will<00:05:19.050> fit<00:05:19.320> right<00:05:19.949> in<00:05:20.190> the<00:05:20.520> end<00:05:20.930> of<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.800> hole

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
it will fit right in the end of the hole

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:28.490 
it will fit right in the end of the hole
yep<00:05:25.340> that<00:05:26.340> it<00:05:27.240> would<00:05:27.449> help<00:05:27.599> if<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:28.020> had<00:05:28.199> an

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
yep that it would help if you had an

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.689 
yep that it would help if you had an
extra<00:05:28.770> person<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:30.120> hold<00:05:30.360> this<00:05:30.949> but<00:05:31.949> you<00:05:32.220> can<00:05:32.490> do

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
extra person to hold this but you can do

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:42.159 
extra person to hold this but you can do
it<00:05:32.789> on<00:05:32.909> your<00:05:32.940> own<00:05:37.820> gently<00:05:38.820> tap<00:05:39.090> it<00:05:39.830> have<00:05:40.830> a<00:05:40.860> look

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
it on your own gently tap it have a look

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:49.409 
it on your own gently tap it have a look
you<00:05:43.169> can<00:05:43.349> see<00:05:45.020> that<00:05:46.020> it's<00:05:46.199> starting<00:05:46.650> to<00:05:46.680> spread

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.920 

turn<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.020> over<00:05:50.169> do<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.770> other<00:05:50.919> side<00:05:51.930> gently
