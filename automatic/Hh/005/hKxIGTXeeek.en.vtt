00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.730
 Hello everyone because we will see a video 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.550
 of written saves is called surrender and 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.540
 let's show what trumpets are 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.540
 and good endorsement in that way 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.380
 but 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.700
 or not 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.970
 ah 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.310
 well what we are going to do here is very 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.550
 simple and it's just a matter of 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:55.760
 practice the singing is the song is 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:59.000
 in D minor ' using 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.040
 uses a re again after it 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.400
 they changed the biggest 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.430
 and we go back to the minor ' 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.070
 good the liter base 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.080
 you can do it with both hands already 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.040
 when you have practice because here 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.330
 you use other notes of the trumpet and what 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.330
 let's make it slow 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.960
 to 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.119
 now 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.110
 If you want to do it with both hands, 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.110
 to be like that 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.549
 ace 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.080
 use the two 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.869
 okay 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.869
 and then the other part goes like this 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.470
 that of camel 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.170
 t 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.239
 again 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.780
 I wanted to start the song 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.019
 well let's go to the last slow part for 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.360
 that you do it but remember that 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.360
 goes fast by the rhythm of the song 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.400
 to 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.840
 sorry 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.620
 it is important that 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.260
 in this type of songs of this group 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:24.020
 the way those two on the keyboard is 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.300
 the way you're going to hear the 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.320
 originality 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.320
 for example yes 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.770
 and we start again 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.070
 well let's be teaching the other 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.900
 part of this song because it 's a string 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.670
 and then it's not the then we're going to see it 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.670
 then I hope you have served them 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.560
 all right
