00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.279
 in this video let's take a look 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.899
 the next tab of the explorer program 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.179
 which is called to share 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.710
 I will now select for example the data 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.430
 text documents and go to this 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.430
 tab 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.510
 here are the following items 1 this 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.060
 Email 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.579
 I have this opportunity is not active it 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.289
 most likely due to the fact that I have 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.509
 now still not email 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.480
 set up we set up later 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.730
 e-mail and we will be able to receive and 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.940
 email using programs 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.500
 which are already in windows 8 as soon as 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.350
 we have these programs set up then rather 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.690
 just this feature is activated 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.679
 the next item is squeeze when choosing 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.289
 of this item 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.730
 a so-called zip folder will be created 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.129
 that is, an archive will be created 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.620
 which inside will contain here 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.149
 here is a file or several files if we 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.170
 for example with you we will choose several 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.870
 of documents 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.969
 Next, go to the share tab and 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.329
 choose squeeze then you see what's here 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.879
 an archive is created its name is initially 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.030
 taken from the name of one of the files 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.090
 which we put in it as if I 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.730
 I will go to this folder then inside I will see 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.690
 same two objects ie folder 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.490
 business trip and document text 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.130
 respectively, the icon of this archive 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.670
 he looks like a daddy with a zipper 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.280
 This icon tells us that this 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.260
 the file is archived also that 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.810
 this archive can be understood from the glasses columns 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.720
 its type we have written that it is sandwiched 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.940
 zip folder let's select these two 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.980
 object and press the del key and to 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.080
 remove 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.940
 On the tab to share there and more 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.670
 few items enough 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.280
 convenient one of the elements of this entry on 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.130
 cd 1 most likely I have this 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.760
 the option is not activated because on this 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.050
 computer 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.140
 on the computer where I am now 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.300
 I write this video is not writing 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.430
 drive if this drive were 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.860
 most likely could have been highlighted 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.160
 files using this option 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.050
 cd 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.060
 item print and if u to your 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.330
 a computer is connected to the printer then you 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.620
 can print those documents 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.410
 which you select in the explorer window well 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.960
 and then there are some more points 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.920
 they belong to folders so i am now 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.990
 chose a folder 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.870
 this item is on the panel 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.260
 tools to share and this item 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.810
 responsible for setting up access to your 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.760
 files more precisely even to your folders by this 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.010
 points it makes sense to use in 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.320
 if you for example work on 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.120
 your computer is not one of you 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.690
 computer created several credentials 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.000
 records 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.940
 or maybe even your computer comes into 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.490
 home network respectively by 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.980
 this tool you can do 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.470
 specified folder or specified folders 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.360
 available to other bo users 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.830
 this computer or others 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.000
 users of your home network and 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.610
 last item of additional configuration 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.640
 I do not recommend this item for security 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.130
 generally touch novice users 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.140
 if you don't understand what's here at all 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.870
 written who are the administrators that 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.020
 What is the system so far? 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.260
 users 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.209
 what is resolution and so on then 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.400
 it's better here to change nothing at all and 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.170
 This setting does not use it. 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.540
 oriented to administrators 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.610
 computer and accordingly only 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.400
 a man who understands that there is 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.290
 You can change something here without 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.630
 knowledge deal here and produce some 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.030
 settings then problems may arise 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.340
 as with 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.560
 opening folders and launching files 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.660
 so it's best not to change anything here and 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.940
 just get out of here and conclude this 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.950
 I want to talk about one more lesson 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.250
 pleasant opportunities that appeared in 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.640
 windows 8 i to write this lesson 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.800
 prepared the file is the image file now 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.560
 briefly talk about what the image 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.709
 if installed on your computer 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.760
 drive to read 9 or sit drive then 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:11.760
 you can create an image from any disk 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.220
 the image is such a peculiar cast in 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.489
 which contains all the information that 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.820
 recorded on the disc you get everything 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.710
 disk contents as a single file but 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.990
 in order to work with the way you need 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.960
 previously had separate programs 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.240
 installed on a computer and 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.700
 created such virtual divide roms 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.479
 either sidiromy virtual 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.770
 drives in which such an image could be 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.280
 mount and he's computer 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.110
 perceived as a real drive 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.360
 CDs with real installed 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.940
 disk windows 8 opportunity 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.419
 which now allows you to mount 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.310
 such images and use images without 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.590
 help of any third-party programs 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.780
 this is done very simply in the first place 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.680
 you select the image file will appear 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.660
 additional 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.220
 A tab called a tool 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.500
 working with disk images 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.539
 if we go to him then there is 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.700
 two possibilities the first is to connect 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.950
 image and 2 burn to disc 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.140
 accordingly the first option to us 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.419
 allows you to mount an image of what it is 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.640
 does it mean if we go in with you now 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:22.260
 section this computer then you are here 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.910
 see 2 and 9 Roma first is private 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.160
 which is installed in this computer 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.620
 but this is not a writing drive this is normal 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.690
 private and the second is a virtual drive 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.430
 that is, it is a software drive that 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.910
 was just created operating 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.789
 system 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.630
 if I enter it I will get access 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.910
 content 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.590
 Here is the image that is an hour 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.620
 my computer seems to be like 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.380
 installed two drives for reading 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.110
 cd only one real a 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.460
 the second is such a virtual on that 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.800
 I can still do about 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.600
 yourself using windows 8 like on 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.449
 control tab have the ability 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.440
 write to the disk image that is currently 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.620
 if I have 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.150
 writing dvd rom i can click on 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.150
 write a button to disk 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.849
 select the disk in the drop-down list 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.849
 that is, a device for recording CDs 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:14.759
 install a blank disc in this drive 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.979
 and click on the button to write 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.530
 accordingly, I will have this image 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:22.620
 completely written to disk new recorded 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.080
 not the image file itself, but its contents 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.990
 there is what we see when we go to 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.240
 here this one is a virtual disk in order 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.729
 to remove this virtual disk 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.860
 enough do the following you can 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:36.990
 select it for example in this section 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.599
 computer call on it context 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.360
 right click menu and a 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.349
 select extract option accordingly 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.099
 this drive 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.099
 will disappear
