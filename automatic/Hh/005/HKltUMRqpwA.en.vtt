you also want to remember that when
tuning<00:02:36.420> with<00:02:36.540> machines<00:02:36.960> it's<00:02:37.470> important<00:02:38.040> that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
tuning with machines it's important that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.490 
tuning with machines it's important that
you<00:02:38.370> always<00:02:38.580> arrive<00:02:39.060> up<00:02:39.330> at<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.900> note<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:40.380> if

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
you always arrive up at the note so if

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.230 
you always arrive up at the note so if
you<00:02:40.620> tune<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.950> little<00:02:41.070> high<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.880> should<00:02:42.090> go

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
you tune a little high you should go

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:59.390 
you tune a little high you should go
down<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.810> then<00:02:42.990> back<00:02:43.230> up<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:58.010> confirm<00:02:59.010> that

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
down and then back up to confirm that

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.530 
down and then back up to confirm that
the<00:02:59.520> notes<00:02:59.730> matched<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.390> refer<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.380> Y<00:03:01.530> tune

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.940 

now<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> string<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.560> tune<00:03:07.590> I'm

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
now that the a string is in tune I'm

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.770 
now that the a string is in tune I'm
going<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.550> find<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.910> harmonic<00:03:09.390> under<00:03:09.660> my

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
going to find the harmonic under my

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.390 
going to find the harmonic under my
pinky<00:03:10.170> finger<00:03:10.200> which<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.680> an<00:03:10.920> e<00:03:13.010> I'm<00:03:14.010> gonna<00:03:14.220> use

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
pinky finger which is an e I'm gonna use

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.060 
pinky finger which is an e I'm gonna use
that<00:03:14.430> harmonic<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.780> match<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.380> harmonic

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
that harmonic to match the harmonic

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.650 
that harmonic to match the harmonic
under<00:03:17.370> my<00:03:17.489> first<00:03:17.760> finger<00:03:18.060> on<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.510> E<00:03:18.540> string

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
under my first finger on the E string

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:36.330 
under my first finger on the E string
which<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.380> also<00:03:19.560> an<00:03:19.860> E

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.070 

and<00:03:37.340> again<00:03:37.610> I<00:03:37.640> use<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:38.060> Y<00:03:38.180> tune<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.720> confirm

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
and again I use the Y tune to confirm

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.830 
and again I use the Y tune to confirm
that<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.410> note<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.710> in<00:03:39.860> tune<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:41.300> last<00:03:41.540> string

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
that the note is in tune the last string

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.140 
that the note is in tune the last string
to<00:03:41.960> tune<00:03:42.170> is<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.620> g<00:03:42.800> string<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.340> tune<00:03:43.970> the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
to tune is the g string to tune the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.970 
to tune is the g string to tune the
string<00:03:44.450> I'm<00:03:44.630> going<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.990> go<00:03:45.200> back<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.800> D

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
string I'm going to go back to the D

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.250 
string I'm going to go back to the D
string<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.430> find<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.270> harmonic<00:03:47.750> under<00:03:48.110> my

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
string and find the harmonic under my

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.800 
string and find the harmonic under my
first<00:03:48.620> finger<00:03:48.920> which<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.460> D<00:03:51.790> I'm<00:03:52.790> going<00:03:52.850> to

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
first finger which is a D I'm going to

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.320 
first finger which is a D I'm going to
use<00:03:53.960> this<00:03:54.170> harmonic<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:55.220> match<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.790> harmonic

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
use this harmonic to match the harmonic

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.880 
use this harmonic to match the harmonic
under<00:03:56.600> my<00:03:56.720> pinky<00:03:57.080> finger<00:03:57.110> on<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.680> g<00:03:57.860> string

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
under my pinky finger on the g string

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:19.990 
under my pinky finger on the g string
which<00:03:58.310> should<00:03:58.490> also<00:03:58.670> be<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:58.970> d

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.280 

finally<00:04:21.000> I<00:04:21.030> want<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.329> go<00:04:21.479> back<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:21.930> do<00:04:22.049> one

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
finally I want to go back and do one

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.780 
finally I want to go back and do one
last<00:04:22.560> check<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.860> make<00:04:23.100> sure<00:04:23.280> that<00:04:23.430> all<00:04:23.639> the

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
last check to make sure that all the

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:45.149 
last check to make sure that all the
strings<00:04:24.090> are<00:04:24.210> in<00:04:24.270> tune

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.639 

and<00:04:46.330> that's<00:04:47.330> tuning<00:04:47.809> the<00:04:47.899> bass<00:04:48.050> with<00:04:48.379> the<00:04:48.499> Y

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:48.649 
and that's tuning the bass with the Y

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:57.500 
and that's tuning the bass with the Y
tune<00:04:48.949> made<00:04:49.249> by<00:04:49.399> Korg

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.570
