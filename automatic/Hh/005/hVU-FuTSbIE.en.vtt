the best player on the floor he hasn't

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.809

always been that had a good game against

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.520 
always been that had a good game against
Iowa<00:02:36.120> State<00:02:36.359> we'll<00:02:36.689> see<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:36.989> carries

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
Iowa State we'll see if that carries

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.199 
Iowa State we'll see if that carries
over<00:02:37.739> but<00:02:38.159> I<00:02:38.189> think<00:02:38.459> they're<00:02:38.609> just<00:02:38.760> looking<00:02:38.909> to

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
over but I think they're just looking to

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.479 
over but I think they're just looking to
push<00:02:39.689> a<00:02:39.720> number<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.290> players<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:41.159> proper

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
push a number of players in a proper

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.610 
push a number of players in a proper
direction<00:02:41.640> not<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.299> Alexander<00:02:42.989> who<00:02:43.319> kind<00:02:43.560> of

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
direction not just Alexander who kind of

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.349 
direction not just Alexander who kind of
drew<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.129> brunt<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.519> against<00:02:44.760> iowa<00:02:45.120> state

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
drew the brunt of it against iowa state

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.940 
drew the brunt of it against iowa state
but<00:02:45.750> they're<00:02:45.870> looking<00:02:46.139> to<00:02:46.200> push<00:02:46.409> a<00:02:46.439> bunch<00:02:46.799> of

but they're looking to push a bunch of

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.830 
but they're looking to push a bunch of
guys<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.189> make<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:47.670> team<00:02:47.879> better<00:02:48.420> down<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
guys to make this team better down the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.599 
guys to make this team better down the
stretch<00:02:49.049> well<00:02:49.439> it's<00:02:49.560> not<00:02:49.709> quite<00:02:50.069> as<00:02:50.189> certain

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
stretch well it's not quite as certain

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.759 
stretch well it's not quite as certain
as<00:02:50.639> death<00:02:51.359> and<00:02:51.569> taxes<00:02:51.989> but<00:02:52.109> Kansas<00:02:52.379> winning

as death and taxes but Kansas winning
the<00:02:52.829> big<00:02:52.950> 12<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.400> certainly<00:02:53.879> pretty<00:02:54.150> close

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
the big 12 is certainly pretty close

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.089 
the big 12 is certainly pretty close
with<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.079> missing<00:02:55.620> something<00:02:55.950> though<00:02:55.980> you

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
with that missing something though you

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.610 
with that missing something though you
talked<00:02:56.459> about<00:02:56.609> Alexander<00:02:57.599> being<00:02:57.840> benched<00:02:58.109> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
talked about Alexander being benched the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.110 
talked about Alexander being benched the
streak<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.099> 10<00:02:59.280> straight<00:02:59.579> league<00:02:59.760> titles

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
streak of 10 straight league titles

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.520 
streak of 10 straight league titles
really<00:03:00.599> could<00:03:00.780> be<00:03:00.810> threatened<00:03:01.260> here<00:03:01.349> who

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
really could be threatened here who

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.199 
really could be threatened here who
stands<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.950> their<00:03:02.069> biggest<00:03:02.250> challenger<00:03:02.819> well

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.710 
certainly from the get-go people have
thought<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.609> team<00:03:05.760> might<00:03:06.150> be<00:03:06.359> a<00:03:06.389> little<00:03:06.540> bit

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
thought this team might be a little bit

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.839 
thought this team might be a little bit
vulnerable<00:03:06.900> also<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.709> league<00:03:07.919> is<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.459> better

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
vulnerable also the league is is better

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.159 
vulnerable also the league is is better
than<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.120> think<00:03:09.359> a<00:03:09.450> lot<00:03:09.599> of<00:03:09.629> people<00:03:09.720> thought

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
than I think a lot of people thought

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.770 
than I think a lot of people thought
with<00:03:10.470> seven<00:03:11.159> teams<00:03:11.430> kind<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.239> gracing<00:03:12.689> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
with seven teams kind of gracing the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.259 
with seven teams kind of gracing the
rankings<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.470> think<00:03:13.919> Oklahoma<00:03:14.250> certainly<00:03:15.150> will

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
rankings I think Oklahoma certainly will

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.000 
rankings I think Oklahoma certainly will
have<00:03:15.359> something<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.780> say<00:03:15.959> about<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.260> bill<00:03:16.709> self

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
have something to say about it bill self

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.740
