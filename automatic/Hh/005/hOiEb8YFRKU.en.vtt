the diaphragm up into the chest raise

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.780 
the diaphragm up into the chest raise
the<00:03:12.900> pressure<00:03:13.140> get<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:13.980> out<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
the pressure get it out so this is the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.430 
the pressure get it out so this is the
same<00:03:15.060> as<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.330> Heimlich<00:03:15.600> maneuver<00:03:15.690> except

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.690 
she's now now yes that's called
abdominal<00:03:19.170> stress<00:03:19.440> life<00:03:19.650> thrusts<00:03:20.550> the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
abdominal stress life thrusts the

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.310 
abdominal stress life thrusts the
abdomen<00:03:21.300> with<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.200> hands<00:03:23.870> there's<00:03:24.870> still<00:03:25.170> no

abdomen with the hands there's still no

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.509 
abdomen with the hands there's still no
breath<00:03:26.480> what<00:03:27.480> are<00:03:27.570> we<00:03:27.690> gonna<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:28.019> now<00:03:28.370> well<00:03:29.370> if

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
breath what are we gonna do now well if

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.250 
breath what are we gonna do now well if
we<00:03:29.640> don't<00:03:29.880> do<00:03:30.030> anything<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.660> three<00:03:30.900> or<00:03:31.080> four

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
we don't do anything in three or four

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.080 
we don't do anything in three or four
minutes<00:03:31.620> she<00:03:31.920> could<00:03:32.130> be<00:03:32.250> dead<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.760> need<00:03:32.940> to

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
minutes she could be dead you need to

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.880 
minutes she could be dead you need to
perhaps<00:03:33.900> consider<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.590> cricothyrotomy<00:03:35.090> a

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
perhaps consider a cricothyrotomy a

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.600 
perhaps consider a cricothyrotomy a
cricothyroidotomy<00:03:40.160> basically<00:03:41.160> making<00:03:41.400> a

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
cricothyroidotomy basically making a

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.090 
cricothyroidotomy basically making a
hole<00:03:41.820> into<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.330> windpipe<00:03:42.870> just<00:03:43.320> remember<00:03:43.830> the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
hole into the windpipe just remember the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.590 
hole into the windpipe just remember the
paramedics<00:03:44.700> are<00:03:44.850> on<00:03:44.880> their<00:03:45.180> way

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
paramedics are on their way

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.059 
paramedics are on their way
but<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.080> looks<00:03:46.260> like<00:03:46.350> they're<00:03:46.710> going<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:46.980> be

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
but it looks like they're going to be

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.440 
but it looks like they're going to be
more<00:03:47.280> than<00:03:47.400> four<00:03:47.640> minutes<00:03:47.819> before<00:03:48.300> they

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
more than four minutes before they

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.950 
more than four minutes before they
arrive

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
arrive

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.990 
arrive
so<00:03:49.050> this<00:03:49.200> has<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.740> be

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
so this has to be

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.030 
so this has to be
last<00:03:50.150> resort<00:03:50.480> it's<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:51.080> question<00:03:51.560> of<00:03:51.620> life<00:03:51.800> and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
last resort it's a question of life and

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.940 
last resort it's a question of life and
death<00:03:52.460> yeah<00:03:52.610> people<00:03:53.600> can<00:03:53.960> be<00:03:54.170> saved<00:03:54.470> with<00:03:54.830> this

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
death yeah people can be saved with this

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.250 
death yeah people can be saved with this
maneuver<00:03:55.520> and<00:03:56.090> I'll<00:03:56.420> show<00:03:56.660> you<00:03:56.720> how<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:56.990> do
