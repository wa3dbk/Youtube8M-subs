00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.049
 hi guys i'm out at home ne 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.590
 I came back here today on the canal 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.169
 clan 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.169
 with this new video today you 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:23.289
 we present believe because then I'll explain 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:28.650
 a moment as I am towards should 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:34.320
 be a 90 90 on confirmed killing 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.600
 map new town then mv black ops 2 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.720
 made by our jtf element in the 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.159
 class 1 scar h silenced then I think with 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.820
 the usual things with a pre-kick 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:48.640
 adjustable inflexible splinter guard 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:53.199
 steel jackal and c4 the rewards 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.930
 dogs and swarms are fixed so one 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.600
 fairly standard situation 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.080
 then I would like to divide the commit into 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.560
 two parts because in one I owe and want 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.860
 inform you of some things and in the second 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.380
 pieces instead I would like to ask you a question 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.109
 a rather strange question, however, then 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.079
 just wanted to tell you that if in these 

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:19.359
 days I missed my commentaries 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.869
 in the sense that yes I didn't skip it 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:24.820
 was it was organized that we did so 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.310
 but lately let's say that I don't have any 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.649
 asked for more to do because they are 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.329
 really really on the high seas with 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.450
 the last exam I will give in a dozen 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.549
 of days so I'm studying a lot 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.380
 hours a day and I can't do 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.780
 otherwise that is not what I want 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.799
 study to take 30 I can not 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.800
 just do otherwise 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.830
 then 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.990
 I cannot entertain you as I would like 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.370
 not even on the fan page and unfortunately also 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.150
 already said however this is and I cannot 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.530
 absolutely do otherwise 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.220
 so the week came you today 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.220
 will see today Monday you will see this video 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.110
 I think for almost ten days not 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.550
 you will hear more in the commentaries here why 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.580
 I really can't do any different 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.760
 all the desire to keep you company 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.020
 but before making comments 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.670
 not not precise, not involving 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.670
 I prefer to forget it is to give 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.350
 possibility for others to be heard at 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.100
 others with a clearer mind than mine 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.790
 and at least you can hear someone who 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.620
 really want and above all time 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.440
 to commit to do something for you 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.800
 unfortunately I'm not in the condition 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.840
 to do so in fact think more tomorrow 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.120
 I will also inform you about my channel though 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.959
 less videos than those I had 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.660
 predicted because because I can't 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.360
 do otherwise there is nothing to do me 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.640
 very sorry 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.100
 so this and I think if not 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.530
 the situation will change 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.110
 this will be for the next ten days 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.000
 then when I am away in the mountains I will try 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.590
 maybe to comment on his own 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.780
 tap 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.940
 I don't know how I'll do it but I'll try the same 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.080
 to be here at least once a 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.819
 week or so we will see later with 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.280
 with what cadence also with the others 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.620
 Clan members we will see what to decide 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.970
 all together looking also at 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.580
 needs of other members 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.830
 so this is an introductory part 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.620
 which, however, I also felt for 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:39.690
 correctness to let you know so 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.470
 for the second part I would like to give you one 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.560
 very particular question ie 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.940
 imagine we start from another 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.489
 presupposition each of us has within 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.850
 there is a set of values no 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:04.110
 a set of ideas that form the 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:06.890
 personality so I have a fair idea 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.989
 a concept of wrong also a concept 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.330
 we know or within us are 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.400
 imagine what is right for us 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.479
 is what is wrong for us 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:22.260
 and it is a set of beliefs that can 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:25.919
 to go to the religious if it is one is 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.650
 believer or otherwise adheres to certain 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:32.970
 dictates can be ethical can be 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:36.780
 even political or simply a 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.710
 personal speech so this is I think 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:45.030
 that is more or less the case for everyone though 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:49.350
 this where it comes from that is we imagine of 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:52.139
 not being alone on earth but not that 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.270
 at any moment for 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.729
 post apocalyptic a post event 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.819
 apocalyptic 1 who knows what else 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.310
 we remain only one person no who 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:05.569
 there is just one person that is 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.939
 in one environment there is only one person e 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.979
 should not necessarily have come into 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.279
 contact with anyone during his 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.499
 life 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:15.599
 the strange thing to think about chrome 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:18.240
 a speech a bit crowded out style no 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.419
 because he played something of this 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.419
 guy 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:28.439
 these concepts this context 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.090
 ethical the concepts of good and bad that 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:32.159
 that which sends ours forward 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:37.409
 character in our life would exist 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:40.590
 the same or not therefore what is in 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.449
 we will recognize good from evil 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.120
 what we have to do what not 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.889
 we must do 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.810
 exists because we are in contact with one 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:56.009
 society that in a sense makes us 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:59.370
 all the same ie with a body of laws 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.650
 with customs that is simply that 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.120
 certain things are inappropriate therefore not 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.120
 we do 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.639
 or precisely prohibited by law or by 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.310
 else or something that comes from 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.229
 inside us that is precisely if we 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.520
 we were alone on earth we will have it 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:19.490
 same these limitations if the 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.529
 we want to see this behavior 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:26.629
 or we'll do anything 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:28.459
 tell me in the comments if you want in every 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:31.569
 In case I didn't check this one myself 

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:36.499
 high level philosophical question 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:39.909
 I don't tell you what I think because why 

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:41.779
 nothing because you don't have to know 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:43.509
 would therefore affect the response 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:46.009
 nothing maybe sign up melons like 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:48.289
 gameplay will be over I hope there is 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:49.879
 liked despite this video in 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:50.269
 general is a bit so different from the 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:52.519
 usual 

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:53.809
 if so leave a like comment with 

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:55.249
 what I asked you with any 

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:56.299
 other thing to join the channel if not 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:58.429
 you still have done 

00:06:56.299 --> 00:07:01.479
 and we feel very soon I hope with 

00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:01.479
 the next hello video 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:11.849
 you don't like igt and kill you
