00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.800
 self and we understand that the Dutch 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:27.470
 you have already had good aces 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.630
 result already for us 1 0 at home I 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.800
 think it's a good result and at 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:42.649
 there they think they're going 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:44.390
 give but we will also try to and I 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.680
 think it will be as we call it 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.630
 one like that that too the tournament of 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.090
 of the match the bac the qualification I 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.330
 think we will give everything to 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.330
 to qualify 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.980
 I do not just have to take out three boxes 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.980
 yellows 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.980
 false 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.440
 in the columns of the team we have 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.180
 discussed this atmosphere around the 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.520
 match because we knew there was 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.369
 maybe provocations 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.409
 does it influence and your name has 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.200
 influenced the side the side that we 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.420
 still inspires power is not give 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.800
 reason at our test and we were trying to 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.800
 give everything we could 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:49.759
 flown to the australia stock market 6 is this 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.460
 that you understand those who were screaming 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.009
 platforms the supporters when from 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.810
 Moscow, but it's not me 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.649
 everything that everyone who passes me 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.470
 It's my fault 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.840
 neither one nor card or monastery mine who 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.170
 also made disappear - - or bring together 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.990
 is followed a new stop of 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.000
 believe but treat what we 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:19.989
 it shows me what all I have 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.370
 done here it's football and how do you 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.680
 rate your game level 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.450
 I think that eventually 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.780
 TÃ©cou jackie think the issue again 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.280
 find in 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:42.230
 a step because with time it goes 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:45.140
 as double anja of what was the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.330
 more important for angie not to 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.040
 cash or mark me it's 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.709
 not to cash it's not a pc 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.880
 mazamet bernier about this title because 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.930
 than at home when you're in the box and 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.930
 it's fatal
