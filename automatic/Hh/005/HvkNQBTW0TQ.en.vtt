I'm going to show you this replica and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.660 
I'm going to show you this replica and
let's<00:00:39.870> go<00:00:39.989> over<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> few<00:00:40.200> small<00:00:40.890> details<00:00:41.370> about

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
let's go over a few small details about

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.700 
let's go over a few small details about
the<00:00:41.790> map<00:00:41.940> itself<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.930> guys<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.530> see

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the map itself so guys as you can see

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.410 
the map itself so guys as you can see
the<00:00:43.920> building<00:00:44.309> itself<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.760> floating<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.390> water

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the building itself is floating in water

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
the building itself is floating in water
the<00:00:46.020> reason<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.829> because<00:00:47.309> it's

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the reason for that is because it's

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.610 
the reason for that is because it's
supposed<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> deal<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.239> overpopulation<00:00:48.780> as

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
supposed to deal with overpopulation as

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.160 
supposed to deal with overpopulation as
well<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.550> self<00:00:50.940> sustainable<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> has

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
well as it's self sustainable and has

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
well as it's self sustainable and has
solar<00:00:52.469> panels<00:00:52.590> kind<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.250> located<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.760> across

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
solar panels kind of located it across

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.150 
solar panels kind of located it across
the<00:00:54.210> entire<00:00:54.300> map<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.110> guys<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.770> basically

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the entire map so guys it's basically

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.950 
the entire map so guys it's basically
the<00:00:56.370> whole<00:00:56.399> concept<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> building<00:00:57.660> itself

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the whole concept of the building itself

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.689 
the whole concept of the building itself
now<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.680> thing<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:58.980> want<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.250> mention<00:00:59.399> is

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
now one thing I do want to mention is

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.610 
now one thing I do want to mention is
that<00:00:59.730> in<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> past<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.750> uploaded<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.260> video<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
that in the past I uploaded a video you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.810 
that in the past I uploaded a video you
should<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.100> your<00:01:02.190> screen<00:01:02.250> right<00:01:02.640> now

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
should see it on your screen right now

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.179 
should see it on your screen right now
and<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.480> thumbnail<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.229> video<00:01:04.500> uses

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and the thumbnail for that video uses

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.399 
and the thumbnail for that video uses
the<00:01:05.369> lily<00:01:05.610> pad<00:01:05.939> kind<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> picture<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the lily pad kind of picture and the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.630 
the lily pad kind of picture and the
reason<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.100> because<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
reason for that is because that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.789 
reason for that is because that
represented<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> building<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.500> actual

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
represented the building in the actual

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.219 
represented the building in the actual
video<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.850> did<00:01:11.970> not<00:01:12.090> replicate<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:13.020> and

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
video but it did not replicate it and

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.700

get to it we have the lily pad city
right<00:01:46.170> over<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.829> gonna<00:01:46.920> load<00:01:47.250> up<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
right over here it's gonna load up and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.450 
right over here it's gonna load up and
oh<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:47.939> gosh<00:01:48.210> look<00:01:48.930> how<00:01:49.110> huge<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.250> I

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
oh my gosh look how huge that is and I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.730 
oh my gosh look how huge that is and I
believe<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.270> Mercedes<00:01:51.840> sponsored

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
believe it's like a Mercedes sponsored

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.410 
believe it's like a Mercedes sponsored
building<00:01:53.159> I'm<00:01:53.399> pretty<00:01:53.880> sure<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.180> why<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
building I'm pretty sure that's why the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.480 
building I'm pretty sure that's why the
logo<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.530> located<00:01:55.890> around<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> map

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
logo is kind of located around the map

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.130 
logo is kind of located around the map
itself<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.090> I'm<00:01:57.390> still<00:01:57.810> pretty<00:01:58.020> cool

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
itself but I'm still pretty cool

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.010 
itself but I'm still pretty cool
nonetheless<00:01:58.380> now<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.280> structure<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.000> 500<00:02:00.899> by

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
nonetheless now this structure is 500 by

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.399 
nonetheless now this structure is 500 by
500<00:02:01.790> blocks<00:02:02.790> long<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.450> tall<00:02:03.659> or<00:02:03.960> width<00:02:04.200> and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
500 blocks long and tall or width and

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.230 
500 blocks long and tall or width and
length<00:02:04.439> I'm<00:02:04.920> not<00:02:05.189> really<00:02:05.310> sure<00:02:05.640> how<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> would

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
length I'm not really sure how I would

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
length I'm not really sure how I would
say<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.719> but<00:02:06.899> anyways<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.860> see<00:02:08.069> this

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
say that but anyways as you can see this

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.669 
say that but anyways as you can see this
is<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:08.819> one<00:02:09.239> small<00:02:09.899> section<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
is like one small section of the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.960 
is like one small section of the
building<00:02:10.950> itself<00:02:11.190> because<00:02:11.550> my<00:02:11.700> computer

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
building itself because my computer

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.990 
building itself because my computer
can't<00:02:12.360> even<00:02:12.510> load<00:02:12.720> up

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
can't even load up

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.360 
can't even load up
entire<00:02:13.240> thing<00:02:13.600> anyways<00:02:14.500> guys<00:02:14.680> let's<00:02:15.130> go<00:02:15.250> ahead

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
entire thing anyways guys let's go ahead

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.160 
entire thing anyways guys let's go ahead
and<00:02:15.610> fly<00:02:15.850> straight<00:02:15.910> through<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.720> middle<00:02:16.960> and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
and fly straight through the middle and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.470 
and fly straight through the middle and
take<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.560> look<00:02:17.830> at<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> map<00:02:18.190> itself<00:02:18.520> now<00:02:19.210> as<00:02:19.420> you

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
take a look at the map itself now as you

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.060 
take a look at the map itself now as you
can<00:02:19.570> see<00:02:19.630> we<00:02:19.960> do<00:02:20.080> have<00:02:20.110> our<00:02:20.380> solar<00:02:20.590> panels

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
can see we do have our solar panels

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.040 
can see we do have our solar panels
located<00:02:21.220> at<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.670> top<00:02:21.820> over<00:02:21.970> here<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.540> like<00:02:23.020> a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
located at the top over here I like a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.960 
located at the top over here I like a
small<00:02:23.470> model<00:02:23.920> instead<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.490> being<00:02:24.520> on<00:02:24.850> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
small model instead of it being on the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.970 
small model instead of it being on the
bottom<00:02:25.120> we<00:02:25.450> haven't<00:02:25.750> here<00:02:25.960> on<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.320> top<00:02:26.560> as

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
bottom we haven't here on the top as

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.350 
bottom we haven't here on the top as
well<00:02:27.220> as<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:27.760> these<00:02:27.880> large

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
well as we have like these large

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.630 
well as we have like these large
structures<00:02:29.140> have<00:02:29.620> like<00:02:29.860> mountains<00:02:30.280> on<00:02:30.430> each

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
structures have like mountains on each

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.550 
structures have like mountains on each
side<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.330> those<00:02:31.600> are<00:02:31.780> basically<00:02:32.200> kind<00:02:32.530> of

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
side and those are basically kind of

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.050 
side and those are basically kind of
storage<00:02:32.890> areas<00:02:33.340> where<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.610> would<00:02:33.730> obviously

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
storage areas where you would obviously

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.930 
storage areas where you would obviously
house<00:02:34.810> people<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:36.010> not<00:02:36.340> really<00:02:36.550> storage

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
house people and not really storage

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.330 
house people and not really storage
areas<00:02:37.209> but<00:02:37.390> housing<00:02:37.959> sections<00:02:38.530> now<00:02:39.070> in<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
areas but housing sections now in the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.699 
areas but housing sections now in the
middle<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.850> our<00:02:40.030> lilypad<00:02:40.720> city<00:02:41.050> we<00:02:41.260> do<00:02:41.440> have

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
middle of our lilypad city we do have

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.920 
middle of our lilypad city we do have
like<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.220> small<00:02:42.550> pond<00:02:42.910> or<00:02:43.240> I<00:02:43.300> guess<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.810> would

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
like a small pond or I guess you would

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.449 
like a small pond or I guess you would
say<00:02:44.020> pool<00:02:44.290> where<00:02:44.530> people<00:02:44.770> could<00:02:44.980> bathe<00:02:45.160> and

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
say pool where people could bathe and

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.490 
say pool where people could bathe and
whatnot<00:02:45.790> as<00:02:46.090> well<00:02:46.540> as<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.660> lot<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.870> trees<00:02:47.260> and

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
whatnot as well as a lot of trees and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.110 
whatnot as well as a lot of trees and
the<00:02:47.560> green<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.220> supposed<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.489> represent<00:02:49.000> other

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
the green is supposed to represent other

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.750 
the green is supposed to represent other
floral<00:02:49.930> decorations<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.800> course<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.550> wool

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
floral decorations of course it is wool

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.729 
floral decorations of course it is wool
blocks<00:02:52.090> but<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.570> theory<00:02:52.900> they're<00:02:53.260> supposed<00:02:53.590> to

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
blocks but in theory they're supposed to

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.729 
blocks but in theory they're supposed to
be<00:02:53.890> like<00:02:54.400> epic<00:02:54.940> types<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.989> plants<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.530> stuff

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
be like epic types of plants and stuff

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.560 
be like epic types of plants and stuff

supposed<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.430> be<00:04:48.490> filled<00:04:48.790> in<00:04:49.000> but<00:04:49.690> I'm<00:04:49.960> pretty

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
supposed to be filled in but I'm pretty

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.140 
supposed to be filled in but I'm pretty
cool<00:04:50.680> nonetheless<00:04:50.860> because<00:04:51.580> I<00:04:51.610> think<00:04:51.760> this<00:04:52.030> is

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
cool nonetheless because I think this is

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.570 
cool nonetheless because I think this is
just<00:04:52.240> one<00:04:52.480> layer<00:04:52.660> that's<00:04:52.900> making<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.350> mountain

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
just one layer that's making a mountain

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.550 
just one layer that's making a mountain

what you would do in this amazing city

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.760 
what you would do in this amazing city
but<00:05:04.180> um<00:05:04.450> I<00:05:04.660> would<00:05:05.050> love<00:05:05.200> to<00:05:05.320> see<00:05:05.470> a<00:05:05.500> fully

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
but um I would love to see a fully

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.920 
but um I would love to see a fully
decorated<00:05:06.010> area<00:05:06.640> or<00:05:06.850> maybe<00:05:06.970> this<00:05:07.330> on<00:05:07.510> a<00:05:07.540> server

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
decorated area or maybe this on a server

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.470 
decorated area or maybe this on a server
if<00:05:08.230> you<00:05:08.950> put<00:05:09.160> this<00:05:09.250> map<00:05:09.490> on<00:05:09.640> a<00:05:09.670> server<00:05:10.000> I<00:05:10.270> will

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
if you put this map on a server I will

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.200 
if you put this map on a server I will
definitely<00:05:11.230> play<00:05:11.410> on<00:05:11.680> it<00:05:11.860> of<00:05:12.010> course<00:05:12.220> I<00:05:12.520> want

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
definitely play on it of course I want

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.250 
definitely play on it of course I want
the<00:05:13.270> map<00:05:13.450> creator<00:05:13.720> to<00:05:13.840> do<00:05:13.960> that<00:05:14.110> himself

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
the map creator to do that himself

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.410 
the map creator to do that himself
because<00:05:14.830> it<00:05:15.220> wouldn't<00:05:15.430> be<00:05:15.520> fair<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:15.760> like<00:05:16.060> kind

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
because it wouldn't be fair to like kind

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.850 
because it wouldn't be fair to like kind
of<00:05:16.480> take<00:05:16.630> his<00:05:16.780> map<00:05:16.990> and<00:05:17.200> um<00:05:17.290> use<00:05:17.500> it<00:05:17.620> on<00:05:17.710> your

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
of take his map and um use it on your

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.440 
of take his map and um use it on your
server<00:05:18.010> or<00:05:18.310> whatever<00:05:18.430> but<00:05:19.060> anyways<00:05:19.300> as<00:05:19.420> you

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
server or whatever but anyways as you

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.000 
server or whatever but anyways as you
can<00:05:19.600> see<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:20.140> pool<00:05:20.320> itself<00:05:20.590> in<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.830> middle

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
can see the pool itself in the middle

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.950 
can see the pool itself in the middle
looks<00:05:21.310> really<00:05:21.700> cool<00:05:21.910> we<00:05:22.240> did<00:05:22.450> take<00:05:22.600> a<00:05:22.630> look<00:05:22.810> at

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
looks really cool we did take a look at

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.800 
looks really cool we did take a look at
this<00:05:23.020> but<00:05:23.170> not<00:05:23.320> so<00:05:23.680> close<00:05:23.830> to<00:05:23.950> the<00:05:24.160> water<00:05:24.340> and

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
this but not so close to the water and

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
this but not so close to the water and
essentially<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:25.930> entire<00:05:26.200> map<00:05:26.410> is<00:05:26.560> kind<00:05:26.770> of

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
essentially the entire map is kind of

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.980 
essentially the entire map is kind of
mirroring<00:05:27.250> on<00:05:27.550> each<00:05:27.880> edge<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.630> I'm<00:05:28.840> going<00:05:28.960> to

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
mirroring on each edge and I'm going to

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.570 
mirroring on each edge and I'm going to
go<00:05:29.110> ahead<00:05:29.230> and<00:05:29.530> fly<00:05:29.800> high<00:05:30.070> above<00:05:30.190> and

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
go ahead and fly high above and

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.310 
go ahead and fly high above and
hopefully<00:05:30.940> load<00:05:31.150> up<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.390> entire<00:05:31.630> map<00:05:31.900> so<00:05:32.290> you

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
hopefully load up the entire map so you

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.590 
hopefully load up the entire map so you
can<00:05:32.440> see<00:05:32.560> how<00:05:32.950> awesome<00:05:33.850> the<00:05:33.940> entire<00:05:34.150> map<00:05:34.360> looks

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
can see how awesome the entire map looks

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.720 
can see how awesome the entire map looks
like<00:05:34.660> altogether<00:05:35.530> so<00:05:36.130> as<00:05:36.190> you<00:05:36.280> can<00:05:36.400> see<00:05:36.550> I'm

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
like altogether so as you can see I'm

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.790 
like altogether so as you can see I'm
we're<00:05:37.060> gonna<00:05:37.240> go<00:05:37.570> ahead<00:05:37.690> and<00:05:37.870> fly<00:05:38.200> over<00:05:38.440> here

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
we're gonna go ahead and fly over here

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.450 
we're gonna go ahead and fly over here
and<00:05:38.980> this<00:05:39.280> side<00:05:39.520> is<00:05:39.700> even<00:05:39.940> taller<00:05:40.210> oh<00:05:40.630> my<00:05:40.990> god

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
and this side is even taller oh my god

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.940 
and this side is even taller oh my god
holy<00:05:42.460> crap<00:05:43.180> this<00:05:43.450> is<00:05:43.510> like<00:05:43.780> a<00:05:43.810> huge<00:05:44.290> section<00:05:44.890> of

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
holy crap this is like a huge section of

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.920 
holy crap this is like a huge section of
the<00:05:45.070> building<00:05:45.420> okay<00:05:46.420> so<00:05:46.480> let's<00:05:46.660> go<00:05:46.720> ahead<00:05:46.750> and

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
the building okay so let's go ahead and

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.300 
the building okay so let's go ahead and
fly<00:05:47.050> to<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.290> top<00:05:47.500> and<00:05:47.680> take<00:05:47.830> a<00:05:47.860> look<00:05:48.130> at<00:05:48.220> the

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
fly to the top and take a look at the

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.270 
fly to the top and take a look at the
view<00:05:48.610> from<00:05:48.850> over<00:05:49.300> here<00:05:49.630> oh<00:05:49.810> my<00:05:50.140> gosh<00:05:50.530> alright

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
view from over here oh my gosh alright

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.160 
view from over here oh my gosh alright
so<00:05:51.640> I'm<00:05:51.700> gonna<00:05:51.790> change<00:05:52.060> my<00:05:52.300> view<00:05:52.600> distance<00:05:52.780> to

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
so I'm gonna change my view distance to

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.270 
so I'm gonna change my view distance to
extreme<00:05:53.860> or<00:05:54.160> just<00:05:54.460> far<00:05:54.700> +18<00:05:55.660> and<00:05:56.160> hopefully<00:05:57.160> we

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
extreme or just far +18 and hopefully we

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.070 
extreme or just far +18 and hopefully we
load<00:05:57.520> up<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:57.820> rest<00:05:58.060> of<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.300> map<00:05:58.450> and<00:05:58.660> not<00:05:58.750> lag

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
load up the rest of the map and not lag

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.020 
load up the rest of the map and not lag
too<00:05:59.410> much<00:05:59.710> all<00:06:00.340> right<00:06:00.580> so<00:06:00.700> we're<00:06:00.850> slowly

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
too much all right so we're slowly

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.430 
too much all right so we're slowly
loading<00:06:01.540> it<00:06:01.630> over<00:06:01.840> here<00:06:01.990> let's<00:06:02.170> go<00:06:02.260> to<00:06:02.290> the

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
loading it over here let's go to the

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.010 
loading it over here let's go to the
other<00:06:02.650> side<00:06:02.920> and<00:06:03.420> check<00:06:04.420> out<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:04.780> view<00:06:04.990> from

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
other side and check out the view from

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.410 
other side and check out the view from
this<00:06:05.860> section<00:06:06.340> now<00:06:06.760> as<00:06:06.820> you<00:06:06.910> can<00:06:07.030> see<00:06:07.180> we<00:06:07.300> do
