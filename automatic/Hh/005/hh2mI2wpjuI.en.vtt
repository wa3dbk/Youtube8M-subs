00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.000

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.769
 singh as they are less 10 c the 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.400

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.120
 even a thing the burger is good 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.349

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.019
 even there it's me I like the sauce 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.739
 in fact I can not find out who 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.510
 it's a bit 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.980
 is it meat that a taste 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.080
 smoked or is there a source at 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.510
 smoked like carlos we are here 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.540
 because the ppte is the smoker cook 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:25.550

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.570
 it's not bad but no I like 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.419

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.110
 he is good but he is good the paws 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.420
