00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.650 

you

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.400 

I<00:02:58.720> think<00:02:59.200> so<00:02:59.470> i<00:02:59.500> think<00:02:59.650> i<00:03:00.190> think<00:03:00.580> i<00:03:00.820> will<00:03:00.880> or<00:03:01.660> it

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
I think so i think i think i will or it

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.470 
I think so i think i think i will or it
was<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:03.070> book<00:03:03.220> it's<00:03:03.580> just<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:03.970> thing<00:03:04.330> of

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
was that book it's just that thing of

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.040 
was that book it's just that thing of
knowing<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.140> there<00:03:05.830> was<00:03:06.720> especially<00:03:07.720> with

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
knowing that there was especially with

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.950 
knowing that there was especially with
this<00:03:08.520> we<00:03:09.520> weren't<00:03:09.790> absolutely<00:03:10.000> sure<00:03:10.690> or<00:03:10.930> we

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
this we weren't absolutely sure or we

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.600 
this we weren't absolutely sure or we
were<00:03:11.200> never<00:03:11.350> told<00:03:11.620> definitively<00:03:12.220> there<00:03:12.520> was

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
going to be a third I mean the options

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.160 
going to be a third I mean the options
on<00:03:18.100> us<00:03:18.250> ran<00:03:18.550> out<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.390> mean<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.870> know<00:03:19.990> what<00:03:20.050> I

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
on us ran out and I mean you know what I

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.200 
on us ran out and I mean you know what I

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
mean it was I think it was over two

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.570 
mean it was I think it was over two
years<00:03:22.420> or<00:03:22.660> whatever<00:03:22.780> it's<00:03:23.050> been<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:24.460> then

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
years or whatever it's been and and then

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.250 
years or whatever it's been and and then

suddenly called that they're going to
make<00:03:26.380> us<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:27.010> know<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.340> there<00:03:27.490> isn't<00:03:27.760> going

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
make us you know that there isn't going

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.940 
make us you know that there isn't going
to<00:03:27.910> be<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.060> third<00:03:28.360> one<00:03:28.570> but<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.290> was<00:03:29.410> always<00:03:29.560> sort

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
to be a third one but it was always sort

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
to be a third one but it was always sort
of<00:03:30.040> their<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.530> there<00:03:32.830> was<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.400> was<00:03:35.970> so

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
of their that that there was it was so

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:46.430 
of their that that there was it was so
it<00:03:37.090> will<00:03:37.300> be<00:03:37.440> it'll<00:03:38.440> be<00:03:38.470> kind<00:03:38.950> of<00:03:39.040> on

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.480 

you

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
you

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.210 
you
yeah<00:03:49.120> absolutely<00:03:49.360> when<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:50.170> when<00:03:50.860> I<00:03:50.890> really

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
yeah absolutely when I when I really

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.050 
yeah absolutely when I when I really
like<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:52.020> series<00:03:53.020> of<00:03:53.080> movies<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.820> just<00:03:54.820> hope

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
like a series of movies you just hope

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.730 
like a series of movies you just hope
that<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.360> has<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.510> real<00:03:55.810> ending<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.560> they've

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
that it has a real ending that they've

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.050 
that it has a real ending that they've
actually<00:03:56.920> thought<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.310> through<00:03:57.580> enough<00:03:57.850> to

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
actually thought it through enough to

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.900 
actually thought it through enough to
have<00:03:58.240> an<00:03:58.450> ending<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.050> not<00:03:59.290> just<00:03:59.640> you<00:04:00.640> know<00:04:00.730> not

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
have an ending and not just you know not

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.210 
have an ending and not just you know not
just<00:04:01.150> rolling<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.570> credits<00:04:01.690> but<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.770> real

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
just rolling the credits but a real

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.040 
just rolling the credits but a real
ending<00:04:03.700> you<00:04:04.240> know<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.360> story<00:04:04.750> that<00:04:04.900> has<00:04:04.930> a

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
ending you know a story that has a

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.680 
ending you know a story that has a
beginning<00:04:05.230> middle<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.830> end<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.370> does<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:06.940> I

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
beginning middle and end this does and I

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.970 
beginning middle and end this does and I
think<00:04:07.750> that's<00:04:07.930> really<00:04:08.320> satisfying<00:04:08.800> because

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
think that's really satisfying because

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.650 
think that's really satisfying because
some<00:04:09.280> trilogy's<00:04:09.790> you<00:04:09.970> know<00:04:10.090> they<00:04:10.210> call<00:04:10.420> them<00:04:10.600> a

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
some trilogy's you know they call them a

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.600 
some trilogy's you know they call them a
trilogy<00:04:10.990> but<00:04:11.680> it's<00:04:11.800> not<00:04:11.830> really<00:04:12.010> trilogy<00:04:12.460> it's

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
trilogy but it's not really trilogy it's

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.450 
trilogy but it's not really trilogy it's
just<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.820> sequel<00:04:13.210> to<00:04:13.360> make<00:04:13.570> more<00:04:13.690> money<00:04:14.190> this<00:04:15.190> I

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
just a sequel to make more money this I

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.140 
just a sequel to make more money this I
think<00:04:16.060> is<00:04:16.920> quite<00:04:17.920> conclusive<00:04:18.610> in<00:04:18.940> a

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
think is quite conclusive in a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:28.410 
think is quite conclusive in a
satisfying<00:04:19.660> way

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.470

mine yeah yeah yeah but uh amazing sort
of<00:04:49.910> I<00:04:50.210> just<00:04:51.200> think<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.650> physic<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.190> physical

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
of I just think the physic the physical

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.360 
of I just think the physic the physical
sheer<00:04:54.710> physical<00:04:55.310> transformation<00:04:56.120> of<00:04:56.240> it<00:04:56.389> is

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
sheer physical transformation of it is

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.370 
sheer physical transformation of it is
amazing
