here's where it all starts
for<00:00:13.240> my<00:00:13.389> vermiculture<00:00:13.960> project<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:16.540> is<00:00:16.869> the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
for my vermiculture project this is the

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.990 
for my vermiculture project this is the
extraction<00:00:17.800> of<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:19.110> poop<00:00:20.110> medium<00:00:20.650> down<00:00:21.640> in

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
extraction of the poop medium down in

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.499 
extraction of the poop medium down in
the<00:00:22.090> little<00:00:22.390> hole<00:00:23.400> filled<00:00:24.400> with<00:00:24.610> all<00:00:24.820> kinds<00:00:24.849> of

fun things but anyway I am taking it out
just<00:00:34.450> think<00:00:34.720> of<00:00:34.870> it<00:00:34.960> like<00:00:35.140> one<00:00:35.350> of<00:00:35.440> those<00:00:36.090> games

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
just think of it like one of those games

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.799 
just think of it like one of those games
that<00:00:37.270> set<00:00:38.460> chuck-e-cheeses<00:00:39.460> with<00:00:40.359> this<00:00:40.570> like

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
that set chuck-e-cheeses with this like

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.479 
that set chuck-e-cheeses with this like
the<00:00:41.019> little<00:00:41.289> gripper<00:00:41.559> you<00:00:41.890> go<00:00:42.039> and<00:00:42.190> find<00:00:42.399> a

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
the little gripper you go and find a

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.209 
the little gripper you go and find a
prize<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.079> prize<00:00:44.320> comes<00:00:44.649> out<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.010> poop

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
prize so the prize comes out of the poop

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.329 
prize so the prize comes out of the poop
hole<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.789> then<00:00:46.000> it<00:00:46.089> goes<00:00:46.239> into<00:00:46.480> here<00:00:46.899> and<00:00:47.339> then

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339

cutter ring that's how you do it the
coder<00:01:32.350> ring<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:34.659> ready<00:01:34.960> tattoo

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:54.230 

hey<00:01:48.150> that<00:01:48.330> oneself<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.750> aboard

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.530 

yeah

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.490 

how<00:02:02.540> about<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:02.930> how<00:02:03.829> about<00:02:03.860> that<00:02:05.170> next<00:02:06.170> step

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
how about that how about that next step

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.680 
how about that how about that next step
is<00:02:06.820> mixing<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:09.440> yuck<00:02:09.709> with<00:02:10.700> sawdust

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
is mixing the the yuck with sawdust

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.370 
is mixing the the yuck with sawdust
and<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.739> ratio<00:02:13.130> is<00:02:13.280> about<00:02:13.489> 1<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.940> 1<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:15.110> get<00:02:15.819> a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
and the ratio is about 1 to 1 to get a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.170 
and the ratio is about 1 to 1 to get a
ratio<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.980> 25<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.269> 1<00:02:20.450> carbon<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.110> nitrogen<00:02:21.140> so

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
ratio of 25 to 1 carbon to nitrogen so

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.250 
ratio of 25 to 1 carbon to nitrogen so
it<00:02:23.180> doesn't<00:02:23.420> look<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.569> bad

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
it doesn't look that bad

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.530 
it doesn't look that bad
this<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.090> about<00:02:26.330> halfway

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
this is the this is about halfway

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.410 
this is the this is about halfway
through<00:02:27.019> and<00:02:27.470> it's<00:02:27.910> starting<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.970> be<00:02:29.030> mixed

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
through and it's starting to be mixed

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.270 
through and it's starting to be mixed
but<00:02:29.599> that's<00:02:30.099> that's<00:02:31.099> going<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.340> be<00:02:33.280> 45

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
but that's that's going to be 45

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.059 
but that's that's going to be 45
kilograms<00:02:35.150> at<00:02:35.750> -<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:37.660> anyway<00:02:38.660> this<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.830> how<00:02:39.950> it

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
kilograms at - so anyway this is how it

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:59.850 
kilograms at - so anyway this is how it
goes<00:02:51.160> get<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.370> knife<00:02:54.310> thrown<00:02:55.310> mix

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.900 

this<00:03:00.860> is<00:03:01.010> some<00:03:01.160> pretty<00:03:01.340> gross<00:03:01.640> stuff<00:03:01.940> but<00:03:02.540> I

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
this is some pretty gross stuff but I

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.840 
this is some pretty gross stuff but I
think<00:03:04.910> after<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:06.730> after<00:03:07.730> I've<00:03:07.820> finished

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
think after this after I've finished

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.250 
think after this after I've finished
this<00:03:08.390> I'm<00:03:09.020> going<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.350> decide<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:11.260> accepting

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
this I'm going to decide it accepting

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.290 
this I'm going to decide it accepting
things<00:03:12.470> are<00:03:12.740> such<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:12.980> bad<00:03:13.490> idea<00:03:15.130> I<00:03:16.130> had<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.120> go

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
things are such a bad idea I had to go

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.760 
things are such a bad idea I had to go
to<00:03:17.360> my<00:03:17.510> neighbor's<00:03:17.870> house<00:03:18.050> to<00:03:18.080> get<00:03:18.410> some<00:03:18.680> of

mighty<00:03:29.570> neighborly<00:03:31.090> like<00:03:32.090> somebody<00:03:32.480> in<00:03:32.600> class

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
mighty neighborly like somebody in class

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.220 
mighty neighborly like somebody in class
said<00:03:34.150> different<00:03:35.150> than<00:03:35.270> asking<00:03:35.630> for<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.900> cup<00:03:36.080> of

said different than asking for a cup of
sugar<00:03:36.410> I<00:03:36.680> suppose<00:03:38.860> this<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:40.040> what<00:03:40.160> really

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
sugar I suppose this is what really

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.890 
sugar I suppose this is what really
builds<00:03:40.730> communities<00:03:41.239> right<00:03:42.340> okay<00:03:43.750> here's<00:03:44.750> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
builds communities right okay here's the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.479 
builds communities right okay here's the
next<00:03:45.080> step<00:03:45.170> so<00:03:46.420> all<00:03:47.420> of<00:03:47.630> my<00:03:47.750> boxes<00:03:47.989> are<00:03:48.680> laid

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
next step so all of my boxes are laid

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.360 
next step so all of my boxes are laid
out<00:03:49.730> these<00:03:50.000> are<00:03:50.209> the<00:03:50.980> density<00:03:51.980> of<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.160> amount

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
out these are the density of the amount

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.010 
out these are the density of the amount
of<00:03:52.430> worms<00:03:52.670> grams<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.420> worms<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:53.810> are<00:03:53.930> going

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
of worms grams of worms that are going

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.530 
of worms grams of worms that are going
to<00:03:54.080> be<00:03:54.230> in<00:03:54.350> each<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.680> them<00:03:54.770> so<00:03:55.390> there's<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
to be in each of them so there's the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.600 
to be in each of them so there's the
control<00:03:56.840> three<00:03:57.380> of<00:03:57.530> those<00:03:57.650> replicates<00:03:58.310> and

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
control three of those replicates and

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:06.009 
control three of those replicates and
there's<00:03:58.850> 100<00:03:59.420> 200<00:04:00.670> 300<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.170> 400<00:04:03.170> and<00:04:04.299> so<00:04:05.299> the

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
there's 100 200 300 and 400 and so the

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.660 
there's 100 200 300 and 400 and so the
next<00:04:06.200> step<00:04:06.440> is<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:07.540> here's<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.780> mixture<00:04:09.470> of

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
next step is to here's the mixture of

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.530 
next step is to here's the mixture of
poop<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:11.019> sawdust<00:04:12.019> and<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.700> next<00:04:13.970> step<00:04:14.150> is<00:04:14.299> to

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
poop and sawdust and the next step is to

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.930 
poop and sawdust and the next step is to
put<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:14.870> on<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.110> scale<00:04:15.350> and<00:04:15.590> then<00:04:15.739> place<00:04:16.640> it<00:04:16.820> in

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
put it on the scale and then place it in

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.670 
put it on the scale and then place it in
each<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.239> these<00:04:17.359> tubs<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:20.200> watch<00:04:21.200> out<00:04:21.380> for<00:04:21.500> that

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
each of these tubs so watch out for that

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.630 
each of these tubs so watch out for that
one<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:25.250> what<00:04:25.460> I<00:04:25.490> decided<00:04:25.970> was<00:04:26.210> that<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:28.430> this

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
one so what I decided was that so this

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:36.159 
one so what I decided was that so this
is<00:04:28.820> only<00:04:29.090> my<00:04:31.750> Master's<00:04:32.750> work<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.910> am<00:04:35.169> already

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
is only my Master's work I am already

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:46.360 
is only my Master's work I am already
working<00:04:37.160> on<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:38.680> that's<00:04:39.680> really<00:04:39.979> level<00:04:41.169> sorry

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.830 

I'm<00:04:47.370> working<00:04:47.729> on<00:04:47.820> my<00:04:47.880> PhD<00:04:48.050> a<00:04:49.490> posthole<00:04:50.490> digger

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
I'm working on my PhD a posthole digger

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.270 
I'm working on my PhD a posthole digger
get<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:53.419> so<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.780> next<00:04:54.990> thing<00:04:55.229> is<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.860> weigh<00:04:56.039> out

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
get it so the next thing is to weigh out

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:07.040 
get it so the next thing is to weigh out
three<00:04:59.280> kilograms<00:04:59.960> of<00:05:00.960> mixture<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:04.620> so<00:05:06.050> so

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
three kilograms of mixture and so so

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.159 
three kilograms of mixture and so so
that's<00:05:07.229> a<00:05:07.470> little<00:05:07.800> extra<00:05:08.810> that's<00:05:09.810> looking

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
that's a little extra that's looking

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.219 
that's a little extra that's looking
like<00:05:10.199> five<00:05:10.889> and<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:11.310> half

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
like five and a half

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.540 
like five and a half
so<00:05:13.229> I'll<00:05:13.410> short<00:05:15.199> shorten<00:05:16.199> it<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:16.800> three

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
so I'll short shorten it to three

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.730 
so I'll short shorten it to three
kilograms<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.210> piece<00:05:18.419> and<00:05:18.660> then<00:05:18.840> put<00:05:19.500> in<00:05:19.620> the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
kilograms of piece and then put in the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.379 
kilograms of piece and then put in the
bins<00:05:19.949> and<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:20.250> next<00:05:20.520> step<00:05:20.699> is<00:05:20.850> to<00:05:21.000> put<00:05:21.150> worms

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
bins and the next step is to put worms

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:28.279 
bins and the next step is to put worms
in<00:05:21.660> okay<00:05:23.630> okay<00:05:24.630> here's<00:05:25.380> everything<00:05:26.030> um<00:05:27.289> three

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
in okay okay here's everything um three

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.250 
in okay okay here's everything um three
replicates<00:05:28.530> of<00:05:29.039> each<00:05:29.510> so<00:05:30.510> now<00:05:30.870> all<00:05:31.110> that's

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
replicates of each so now all that's

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.100 
replicates of each so now all that's
left<00:05:31.440> is<00:05:31.860> just<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.479> put<00:05:33.479> the<00:05:33.680> worms<00:05:34.680> in<00:05:34.889> there
