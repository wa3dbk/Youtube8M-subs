00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.240 
what we're actually betting on here yeah
you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.230> only<00:00:58.379> do<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.739> when<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.129> this

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you can only do that when you see this

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.970 
you can only do that when you see this
side<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.519> this<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.390> another<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.809> where<00:01:00.980> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
side so this is another one where you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.369 
side so this is another one where you
know<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.309> Bolton<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:02.969> week<00:01:03.269> which<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.260> we

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
thought they might at the start you go

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.790 
thought they might at the start you go
for<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.210> draw<00:01:06.480> if<00:01:06.960> Bolton<00:01:07.320> go<00:01:07.470> stronger

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
for the draw if Bolton go stronger

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.250

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
think you've got to give the benefit of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.690

competition that they will play their

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.720 
competition that they will play their
strongest<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.770> much<00:01:16.920> safer<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.640> as

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
strongest it's much safer to do that as

you know as though can't take liberties
here<00:02:22.849> yeah<00:02:23.209> we<00:02:23.360> hope<00:02:23.510> they'll<00:02:23.870> go<00:02:24.020> stall<00:02:24.260> we

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
think it's a good bit if they go

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.210 
think it's a good bit if they go
straight<00:02:26.569> or<00:02:26.810> nine<00:02:27.080> or<00:02:27.319> ten<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.709> their<00:02:27.830> usual

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
straight or nine or ten of their usual

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.339 
straight or nine or ten of their usual
11<00:02:28.550> then<00:02:28.700> that's<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.120> good<00:02:29.270> bet<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.840> second<00:02:30.230> bet

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
11 then that's a good bet the second bet

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.490 
11 then that's a good bet the second bet
is<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.680> both<00:02:31.430> teams<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.970> score<00:02:32.110> which<00:02:33.110> is<00:02:33.290> based
