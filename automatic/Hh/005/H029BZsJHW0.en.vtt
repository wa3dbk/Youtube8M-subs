00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
pictures so that it's irrelevant the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.510 
pictures so that it's irrelevant the
other<00:00:47.340> stuff<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.000> look<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:48.600> is

other stuff you have to look at then is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.490 
other stuff you have to look at then is
all<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.969> other<00:00:51.000> stuff<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.510> applies<00:00:51.989> here

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
all the other stuff that applies here

always<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:49.020> only<00:01:49.170> not<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.530> every<00:01:49.799> picture

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
always on it's only not in every picture

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.370 
always on it's only not in every picture
but<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.369> one<00:01:50.520> has<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:50.880> both<00:01:51.119> eyes<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:52.110> it's

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
but this one has it on both eyes so it's

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.649 
but this one has it on both eyes so it's
not<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.430> fully<00:01:54.060> thing<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.540> that

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
not the the fully thing but that

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.859 
not the the fully thing but that
definitely<00:01:55.079> matches<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.829> well<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.280> blue

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
definitely matches as well the blue

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.990 
definitely matches as well the blue
strip<00:01:57.869> underneath<00:01:58.290> her<00:01:58.409> eye<00:01:58.439> matches<00:01:59.159> like

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
strip underneath her eye matches like

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.730 
strip underneath her eye matches like
it's<00:02:00.270> very<00:02:00.450> similar<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> other<00:02:01.259> concepts

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
it's very similar to the other concepts

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.690 
it's very similar to the other concepts
of<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> other<00:02:02.219> skins

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
of the other skins

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.999 
of the other skins
