00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
still not the best idea but that's

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.289 
still not the best idea but that's
that's<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.480> best<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:30.900> do<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.760> when<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.120> get

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
pretty good at it it's going to look

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.759 
pretty good at it it's going to look
something<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.570> of<00:03:37.200> course<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.620> can
