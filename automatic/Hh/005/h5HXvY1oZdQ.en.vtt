00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello everyone, today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.420
 change our departure mode in my 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.250
 level of survival to creative of 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.540
 creative survival and all that what 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.920
 let's do with this hard file of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.509
 here that I am going to leave you in the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.719
 description so you can download it 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.920
 it's very simple alright we have a game 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.670
 in the mini craft for example is here 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.670
 I do not remember 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.210
 they are weird names that I usually put and 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.009
 it's a game like you see totally 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.470
 survival I have hearts the 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.520
 food is hard for me to apply things and 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.520
 I spend the materials 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.850
 then we want to spend this creative 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.500
 because because we want to have her in 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.760
 creative what we have known something 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.930
 cool whatever it is because it will cost us 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.270
 much build one thing and what 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.720
 we need in creative then we open 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.950
 this with two very simple clicks and we get 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.990
 this is all that the 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.750
 program this 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.400
 then this is likely we can choose 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.780
 the game of grams in this case world 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.520
 OK 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.159
 we must make sure that he will show 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.810
 the other as I have done here is worth if 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.420
 no changes are not visible to the naked eye 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.799
 you have to wait to restart then 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.130
 here puts us in creative mode 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.850
 what we will do if we explain and 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.850
 let's change 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.600
 and accept and until now if we enter here 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.190
 we go in single pair we have creative 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.970
 we enter we will see that the same game of 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.970
 before only 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.880
 and creative 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.460
 we can fly 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.770
 and all development that has the creative 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.690
 we can put things like that here many 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.100
 times in which we like 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.049
 you will ask, well, what I want 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.430
 to do is the opposite happen from creative 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.740
 to survival 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.920
 well let's leave the game mono other 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.759
 time in this case and we take you creative 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.680
 we are going to save changes yes and accept 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.990
 and now it will re-enter the rope 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.430
 you have to get the start menu 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.430
 let's go here I shoot again in survival 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.630
 Well, here we are everything that was 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.630
 before and us in the survival
