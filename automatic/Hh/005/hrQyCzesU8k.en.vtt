smoke bomb and they kill the two guys

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:09.790 
smoke bomb and they kill the two guys
were<00:04:01.550> like<00:04:01.730> no<00:04:01.760> hassle<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:08.230> it's<00:04:09.230> pretty<00:04:09.560> good

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
were like no hassle so it's pretty good

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.520 
were like no hassle so it's pretty good
to<00:04:10.010> just<00:04:10.190> kind<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.580> like<00:04:11.170> grind<00:04:12.170> through

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
to just kind of like grind through

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.680 
to just kind of like grind through
leveling<00:04:13.400> up<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:14.060> your<00:04:15.340> assassin<00:04:16.340> so<00:04:16.690> for

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
leveling up and your assassin so for

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.300 
leveling up and your assassin so for
these<00:04:17.840> areas<00:04:18.170> where<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:19.130> need<00:04:19.340> to<00:04:21.100> take<00:04:22.100> out

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
these areas where you need to take out

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.520 
these areas where you need to take out
by<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:22.550> group<00:04:23.000> of<00:04:23.260> guards<00:04:25.990> it<00:04:26.990> will<00:04:27.140> make<00:04:27.320> it<00:04:27.500> a

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
by a group of guards it will make it a

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.180 
by a group of guards it will make it a
lot<00:04:27.740> easier<00:04:27.770> and<00:04:31.690> so<00:04:32.690> once<00:04:33.140> again<00:04:33.320> after<00:04:34.130> you

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
lot easier and so once again after you

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.970 
lot easier and so once again after you
take<00:04:34.430> out<00:04:34.580> that<00:04:34.760> guy<00:04:35.200> it<00:04:36.200> seems<00:04:36.440> like<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:36.740> have

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
take out that guy it seems like you have

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.470 
take out that guy it seems like you have
to<00:04:37.130> move<00:04:37.370> up<00:04:37.700> to<00:04:38.270> make<00:04:39.020> him<00:04:39.200> jump<00:04:39.500> on<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.860> horse

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
to move up to make him jump on the horse

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.820 
to move up to make him jump on the horse
because<00:04:41.480> he<00:04:41.570> just<00:04:41.780> wasn't<00:04:41.990> doing<00:04:42.410> that<00:04:42.560> until

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
because he just wasn't doing that until

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.360 
because he just wasn't doing that until
I<00:04:42.890> moved<00:04:43.250> up<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:45.250> got<00:04:46.250> close<00:04:46.610> to<00:04:46.640> him<00:04:47.200> for<00:04:48.370> this

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
I moved up and got close to him for this

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.909 
I moved up and got close to him for this
section<00:04:49.760> you<00:04:50.360> kind<00:04:50.600> of<00:04:50.630> have<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.780> like<00:04:51.110> gallop

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
section you kind of have to like gallop

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.830 
section you kind of have to like gallop
a<00:04:52.220> little<00:04:52.700> more<00:04:52.910> because<00:04:53.240> he's<00:04:53.419> kind<00:04:53.690> of<00:04:53.720> like

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
a little more because he's kind of like

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.820 
a little more because he's kind of like
more<00:04:54.110> like<00:04:54.470> a<00:04:55.300> faster<00:04:56.300> fighting<00:04:56.810> speed<00:04:57.230> than

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
more like a faster fighting speed than

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.180 
more like a faster fighting speed than
the<00:04:58.340> previous<00:04:58.820> times<00:05:01.900> so<00:05:02.900> when<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.140> get<00:05:04.040> to

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
the previous times so when you get to

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:13.129 
the previous times so when you get to
this<00:05:04.310> area<00:05:06.460> climbing<00:05:07.460> up<00:05:07.930> this

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:29.040 

left<00:05:13.800> side<00:05:14.699> area<00:05:15.599> I<00:05:15.629> found<00:05:16.020> easiest

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.689 

and<00:05:30.509> so<00:05:31.509> I<00:05:31.870> almost<00:05:32.770> got<00:05:33.069> screwed<00:05:33.460> there

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
and so I almost got screwed there

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.939 
and so I almost got screwed there
because<00:05:34.120> oh<00:05:34.539> no<00:05:34.930> I<00:05:34.960> actually<00:05:35.169> did<00:05:35.530> get<00:05:35.680> screwed

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
because oh no I actually did get screwed

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.830 
because oh no I actually did get screwed
there<00:05:36.160> because<00:05:37.169> I<00:05:38.169> didn't<00:05:39.300> hang<00:05:40.300> down<00:05:40.569> here

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
there because I didn't hang down here

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.469 
there because I didn't hang down here
quick<00:05:41.169> enough<00:05:41.199> before<00:05:41.830> and<00:05:42.069> they<00:05:42.819> noticed<00:05:43.270> me

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
quick enough before and they noticed me

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.100 
quick enough before and they noticed me
and<00:05:43.659> had<00:05:44.319> go<00:05:45.009> back<00:05:45.190> to<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.460> last<00:05:45.669> checkpoint

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
and had go back to the last checkpoint

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.759 
and had go back to the last checkpoint
but<00:05:47.110> actually<00:05:47.440> I<00:05:47.470> will<00:05:47.680> use<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:48.129> smoke<00:05:48.430> bombs
