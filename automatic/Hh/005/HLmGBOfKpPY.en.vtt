 in that year 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.740
 then we have the income that the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.140
 company shares the company annually 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.390

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.720
 Next I will mention how much it is 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.600
 what we earn for selling three products 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.630
 daily if we sell three of 30 soles 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.180
 monthly we earn two thousand 700 soles 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.970
 it depends on the currency then yes 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.460
 we sell 10 daily we earn 300 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.410
 soles and in a month nine thousand soles two is 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.750
 through purchases or sales in our 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.030
 I will explain to you at level 1 we have 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.140
 100 people registered under our 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.480

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.870
 zones sells a product we win 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.290
 5 soles only if they sell one of 125 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.270
 soles since it is 4% we only have that 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.150
 gain if you have the discount of 40 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.240
 percent on your sales if they are 5 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.580
 products per person we have 125 soles 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.620
 just for that person and if they are 100 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.430
 people and each person sells 5 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.890
 products of 125 soles we have 2 thousand 500 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.380
 soles per 100 but it can be said if one 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.780
 account with 40% in our sales 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.300
 now I explain to you how is the 2nd level 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.880

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.160
 100 that you enrolled first you have 1100 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.040
