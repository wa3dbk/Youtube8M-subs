she had something wrong with her heart

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.999 
she had something wrong with her heart
they<00:00:30.179> didn't<00:00:30.449> know<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.410> would<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.650> fixable

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
they didn't know if it would be fixable

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.270 
they didn't know if it would be fixable
if<00:00:32.460> she<00:00:32.850> would<00:00:33.000> survive<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:34.079> was<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:34.469> as<00:00:34.710> you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
can imagine just terrifying we did this

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.990 
can imagine just terrifying we did this
fetal<00:00:39.270> procedure<00:00:39.690> when<00:00:40.230> Mira<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.430> about<00:00:41.640> 30

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
fetal procedure when Mira was about 30

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.220 
fetal procedure when Mira was about 30
weeks<00:00:42.649> gestation<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.850> was<00:00:45.239> technically

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
weeks gestation and it was technically

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.130 
weeks gestation and it was technically
successful<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.820> did<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:48.360> concerns

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
successful but we did have some concerns

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.040 
successful but we did have some concerns
later<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.100> gestation<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.360> whole<00:00:51.510> wasn't

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
later in gestation that the whole wasn't

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.240 
later in gestation that the whole wasn't
going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.410> big<00:00:52.559> enough<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.070> she

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
going to be big enough and that she

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.819 
going to be big enough and that she
wasn't<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.059> well<00:00:54.360> after<00:00:55.079> birth<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
wasn't going to do well after birth and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.520 
wasn't going to do well after birth and
we<00:00:56.579> were<00:00:56.760> concerned<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.239> she<00:00:57.480> might<00:00:57.660> need<00:00:58.020> an

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
we were concerned that she might need an

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.639 
we were concerned that she might need an
emergency<00:00:59.100> procedure<00:00:59.690> immediately<00:01:00.690> after

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
emergency procedure immediately after

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.299 
emergency procedure immediately after
birth<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.910> had<00:01:03.210> about<00:01:03.660> probably<00:01:04.409> 20<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.010> 30

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
birth so we had about probably 20 to 30

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.149 
birth so we had about probably 20 to 30
people<00:01:05.900> waiting<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.229> her<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.409> various

locations of the hospital set up for
emergency<00:01:11.100> procedures<00:01:11.790> when<00:01:12.060> she<00:01:12.299> was<00:01:12.510> born

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
running into the delivery room to tell

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.219

the obstetrician and the mom how well
she<00:01:40.500> was<00:01:40.650> doing<00:01:41.159> because<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.549> were<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:41.970> pleased

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
she was doing because we were so pleased

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.899 
she was doing because we were so pleased
I<00:01:42.930> don't<00:01:43.710> think<00:01:43.799> she<00:01:44.130> could<00:01:44.310> believe<00:01:44.670> it

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
I don't think she could believe it

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.730 
I don't think she could believe it
either<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.570> her<00:01:45.689> stats<00:01:45.990> were<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> 90s

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
either that her stats were in the 90s

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
either that her stats were in the 90s
and<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:46.979> why<00:01:47.159> she<00:01:47.430> probably<00:01:47.670> yelled<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and that's why she probably yelled it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.810 
and that's why she probably yelled it
like<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.930> first<00:01:49.140> answer<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> 90s<00:01:50.460> no

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
like that first answer in the 90s no

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.969 
like that first answer in the 90s no
just<00:01:51.119> crying<00:01:51.450> these<00:01:52.140> doctors<00:01:52.619> they're
