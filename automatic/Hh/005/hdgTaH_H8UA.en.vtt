00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
be playing without a capo you would play

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.700 
be playing without a capo you would play
that<00:01:21.590> down<00:01:21.770> here<00:01:22.070> ok<00:01:23.030> obviously<00:01:23.380> those<00:01:24.380> are<00:01:24.410> in

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
that down here ok obviously those are in

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.950 
that down here ok obviously those are in
different<00:01:24.890> keys<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:25.880> even<00:01:26.120> though<00:01:26.150> it's<00:01:26.360> s.e

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
different keys so even though it's s.e

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.160 
different keys so even though it's s.e
minor<00:01:27.410> 7<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.940> says<00:01:29.210> kapil<00:01:29.510> second<00:01:29.960> fret

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
minor 7 and it says kapil second fret

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.600 
minor 7 and it says kapil second fret
the<00:01:30.710> key<00:01:30.980> is<00:01:31.160> not<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.580> minor<00:01:31.820> ok<00:01:32.690> I<00:01:33.220> know<00:01:34.220> it's<00:01:34.490> a

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
the key is not a minor ok I know it's a

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.310 
the key is not a minor ok I know it's a
little<00:01:34.850> bit<00:01:34.970> confusing<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.540> appending<00:01:35.900> but

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
little bit confusing and appending but

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.260 
little bit confusing and appending but
because<00:01:37.130> you're<00:01:37.280> putting<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.580> capital<00:01:37.940> here

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
because you're putting the capital here

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.390 
because you're putting the capital here
you're<00:01:38.630> changing<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.170> key<00:01:39.410> so<00:01:39.890> you're<00:01:40.100> you're

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
you're changing the key so you're you're

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.870 
you're changing the key so you're you're
moving<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:40.880> key<00:01:41.090> up<00:01:41.300> to<00:01:42.260> semi<00:01:42.800> tones<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.080> 12<00:01:45.880> ok

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
moving the key up to semi tones so 12 ok

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.820 
moving the key up to semi tones so 12 ok
so<00:01:47.210> which<00:01:47.690> means<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:47.990> this<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.350> actually<00:01:48.500> an

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
so which means that this is actually an

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.620 
so which means that this is actually an
f-sharp<00:01:49.360> minor<00:01:50.360> 7<00:01:50.870> or<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.710> G<00:01:52.370> flat<00:01:52.940> minor<00:01:53.330> so

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
f-sharp minor 7 or a G flat minor so

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.290 
f-sharp minor 7 or a G flat minor so
those<00:01:54.050> are<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.230> same<00:01:54.470> thing<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.370> what<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:55.909> capo

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
those are the same thing so what a capo

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.260 
those are the same thing so what a capo
does<00:01:56.480> is<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.620> it<00:01:57.680> takes<00:01:58.100> open<00:01:58.610> chords<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.180> it

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
does is that it takes open chords and it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.270 
does is that it takes open chords and it
shifts<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.750> key<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:00.260> it<00:02:00.380> works<00:02:00.830> kind<00:02:01.159> of<00:02:01.220> like

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
shifts the key so it works kind of like

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.790 
shifts the key so it works kind of like
Barre<00:02:01.640> chords<00:02:02.030> but<00:02:02.420> instead<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.380> writing<00:02:03.590> out

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800
