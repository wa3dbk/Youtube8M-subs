the gentlemen had actually sent the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.050 
the gentlemen had actually sent the
starter<00:00:23.779> back<00:00:24.279> said<00:00:25.279> that<00:00:25.430> it<00:00:25.580> came<00:00:25.880> out

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
starter back said that it came out

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.480 
starter back said that it came out
engaged<00:00:26.720> but<00:00:27.109> then<00:00:27.320> after<00:00:27.949> a<00:00:27.980> couple<00:00:28.279> tries

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
engaged but then after a couple tries

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.550 
engaged but then after a couple tries
that<00:00:28.670> would<00:00:28.850> engage<00:00:29.150> anymore<00:00:29.599> I<00:00:29.840> got<00:00:30.289> it<00:00:30.410> back

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
that would engage anymore I got it back

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.589 
that would engage anymore I got it back
I<00:00:30.590> did<00:00:30.949> some<00:00:31.130> checking<00:00:31.430> on<00:00:31.699> it<00:00:31.730> and<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.480> way

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
I did some checking on it and the way

I did some checking on it and the way
these<00:00:32.840> starters<00:00:33.650> work<00:00:33.890> is<00:00:34.309> when<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:35.300> starter

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
these starters work is when the starter

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.610 
these starters work is when the starter
engages<00:00:36.410> it's<00:00:37.399> got<00:00:37.610> a<00:00:37.640> spline<00:00:38.210> or<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.540> a<00:00:38.840> tapered

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
engages it's got a spline or a a tapered

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.610 
engages it's got a spline or a a tapered
spline<00:00:39.920> here<00:00:40.250> that<00:00:40.489> it<00:00:41.329> kicks<00:00:41.750> this<00:00:41.960> drive<00:00:42.350> out

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
spline here that it kicks this drive out

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.260 
spline here that it kicks this drive out
but<00:00:43.100> apparently<00:00:43.430> brand-new<00:00:44.059> into

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
but apparently brand-new into

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.119 
but apparently brand-new into
manufacturing<00:00:44.510> is<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.200> little<00:00:45.379> bit<00:00:45.469> of<00:00:45.590> burning

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
manufacturing is a little bit of burning

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.639 
manufacturing is a little bit of burning
that<00:00:46.309> happened<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.719> he<00:00:47.840> said<00:00:48.020> it<00:00:48.170> kicked<00:00:48.469> out<00:00:48.620> a

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
that happened so he said it kicked out a

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.380 
that happened so he said it kicked out a
couple<00:00:48.950> times<00:00:49.250> but<00:00:49.520> then<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:49.879> would<00:00:50.030> stick

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
couple times but then it would stick

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.060 
couple times but then it would stick
down<00:00:50.600> in<00:00:50.809> it<00:00:50.899> wouldn't<00:00:51.140> want<00:00:51.289> to<00:00:51.350> come<00:00:51.559> out<00:00:51.739> and

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
down in it wouldn't want to come out and

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.150 
down in it wouldn't want to come out and
all<00:00:52.879> I<00:00:52.910> did<00:00:53.090> was<00:00:53.270> just<00:00:53.690> kind<00:00:54.559> of<00:00:54.620> worked<00:00:54.890> up<00:00:55.070> a

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
all I did was just kind of worked up a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.979 
all I did was just kind of worked up a
little<00:00:55.190> bit<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:55.699> got<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.360> burr<00:00:56.600> out<00:00:56.809> of

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
little bit and got that burr out of

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.990 
little bit and got that burr out of
there<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:57.379> then<00:00:58.039> I<00:00:58.070> put<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.399> bit<00:00:58.550> a<00:00:58.579> little<00:00:58.850> bit

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
there and then I put a bit a little bit

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.580 
there and then I put a bit a little bit
of<00:00:59.090> grease<00:00:59.360> in<00:00:59.390> here<00:00:59.600> now<00:00:59.899> this<00:01:00.079> will<00:01:00.230> work<00:01:00.379> on

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
of grease in here now this will work on

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.709 
of grease in here now this will work on
even<00:01:01.550> if<00:01:01.640> you're<00:01:01.730> not<00:01:01.879> working<00:01:02.149> with<00:01:02.480> a<00:01:02.510> brand

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
even if you're not working with a brand

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.320 
even if you're not working with a brand
new<00:01:02.960> unit<00:01:03.199> if<00:01:03.410> you<00:01:03.530> have<00:01:03.620> an<00:01:03.739> old<00:01:04.009> unit<00:01:04.580> now

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
new unit if you have an old unit now

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.050 
new unit if you have an old unit now
these<00:01:05.539> types<00:01:05.810> of<00:01:06.050> setups<00:01:06.619> they<00:01:07.610> can<00:01:07.850> get<00:01:08.030> a

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
these types of setups they can get a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.460 
these types of setups they can get a
little<00:01:08.210> corrosion<00:01:08.570> they<00:01:08.930> can<00:01:09.080> lose<00:01:09.290> our

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
little corrosion they can lose our

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.179 
little corrosion they can lose our
grease<00:01:09.740> in<00:01:09.950> here

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
grease in here

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.340 
grease in here
and<00:01:10.310> they'll<00:01:10.760> get<00:01:11.119> sticky<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:11.930> if<00:01:12.049> you've<00:01:12.170> got

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
and they'll get sticky so if you've got

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.469 
and they'll get sticky so if you've got
one<00:01:12.409> of<00:01:12.680> these<00:01:12.860> type<00:01:13.159> units<00:01:13.580> where<00:01:14.240> they've

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
one of these type units where they've

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.990 
one of these type units where they've
got<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.930> drive<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.500> spins<00:01:16.400> out<00:01:16.640> when<00:01:16.880> it

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
got the drive that spins out when it

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.550 
got the drive that spins out when it
when<00:01:17.270> it<00:01:17.420> starts<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.020> then<00:01:18.110> when<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.380> motor

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
when it starts and then when the motor

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.340 
when it starts and then when the motor
starts<00:01:18.979> it<00:01:19.100> kicks<00:01:19.369> it<00:01:19.549> back<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:20.259> causes<00:01:21.259> it<00:01:21.290> to

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
starts it kicks it back and causes it to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.749 
starts it kicks it back and causes it to
go<00:01:21.500> back<00:01:21.680> in<00:01:21.890> if<00:01:22.009> you're<00:01:22.130> having<00:01:22.280> trouble<00:01:22.700> with

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
go back in if you're having trouble with

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.760 
go back in if you're having trouble with
that<00:01:22.820> be<00:01:23.630> sure<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.840> get<00:01:24.080> in<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.380> check<00:01:24.619> that

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
that be sure to get in and check that

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.010 
that be sure to get in and check that
out<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.009> if<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:25.610> have<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:26.030> put<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.659> little<00:01:26.869> bit

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
out and if you have to put a little bit

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.570 
out and if you have to put a little bit
of<00:01:27.110> grease<00:01:27.320> in<00:01:27.350> here<00:01:27.740> now<00:01:27.920> this<00:01:28.040> got<00:01:28.340> some

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
of grease in here now this got some

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.999 
of grease in here now this got some
milling<00:01:28.939> grade<00:01:29.299> water<00:01:30.110> proof<00:01:30.439> grease<00:01:30.740> that<00:01:30.979> I

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
milling grade water proof grease that I

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.280 
milling grade water proof grease that I
put<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.460> here<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:31.850> now<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:32.570> works<00:01:32.990> totally

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
put in here and now it works totally

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.039 
put in here and now it works totally
freely<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.220> that<00:01:35.030> was<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.479> only<00:01:35.659> problem

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
freely and that was the only problem

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.510 
freely and that was the only problem
with<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:36.290> unit<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:36.860> it's<00:01:37.100> something<00:01:37.369> to

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
with this unit so it's something to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.120 
with this unit so it's something to
check<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:37.939> out<00:01:38.060> we<00:01:38.960> have<00:01:39.140> all<00:01:39.350> types<00:01:39.590> of<00:01:39.799> units

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
check it out we have all types of units

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.810 
check it out we have all types of units
