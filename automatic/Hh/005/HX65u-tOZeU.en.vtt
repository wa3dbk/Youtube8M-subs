00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.080
 hello i am kathleen i declare i 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.030
 now the second male rule about it 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.480
 One should rule the first male 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.710
 know 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.320
 I have you in this video 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.039
 I will summarize but briefly again 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.960
 together 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.760
 the first male rule says that 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.289
 I will plant two rows 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.539
 cross each other like here 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.760
 purple wonder flowers and the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.070
 white wonder flower that their descendants 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.140
 all look the same in this case 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.579
 all pink's features are so 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.910
 mixed one speaks of one 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.730
 intermediate inheritance was different at 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.680
 the polar bear if I here the white ones 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.780
 ice begonias and the red ice begonias 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.390
 then they all crossed each other 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.120
 after all, although all were equal 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.070
 red and that was because that threatens the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.600
 Dominant inherited property was one 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.960
 spoke here of a dominant 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.180
 recessive drowned the second male 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.070
 usually deals with what happens 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.180
 if I have these children with each other 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.880
 cross 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.210
 as I said they all look the same and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.560
 nevertheless, their descendants are 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.570
 different and that occur 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.450
 characteristics of the grandparents 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.340
 namely purple flowers and white ones 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.770
 flowers but some plants are still seeding 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.509
 like their parents namely pink and 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.700
 the hereditary information also differs 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.400
 The purple-colored plants are pure 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.950
 agrees purple as well as her grandparents and the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.380
 white plants are pure I know that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.600
 how her grandparents plant the pink 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.460
 have the genetic information of theirs 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.220
 Parents namely the information for 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.229
 purple and for white and in the mix 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.000
 are they pink again this 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.869
 properties do not happen by chance as well 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.579
 but in a very specific 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.439
 ratio, one to two to one 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.750
 and that's the second male rule 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.180
 namely the splitting rule that if 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.450
 you fall the same one after another 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.430
 Crosses your children in the characteristics 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.360
 splitting in the ratio one to 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.530
 looks two to one at the ice starts 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.950
 but the whole thing a bit 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.629
 different if I have the red ones here 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.970
 children who all look the same 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.500
 cross each other then turn up 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.540
 once again plant white 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.130
 It's the same here, too 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.200
 genetically plant a few 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.170
 characteristics of their grandparents 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.240
 namely pure white and Erich rheine have 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.430
 I have red and the others plant 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.070
 So the qualities of your parents are white 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.920
 and red is red but dominant inheritance 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.000
 you only see the red flowers it has 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.690
 genetically we have that again 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.150
 ratio one to two to one what you do 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.150
 but is a ratio of 31
