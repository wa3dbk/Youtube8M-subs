 hi carmen youtuber good we have 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.330
 the samsung galaxy s3 mini 80 and 90 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.110
 in that short violence of how to use the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.490
 gps in my samsung galaxy s3 mini is very 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.170
 simple but before I invite you to 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.210
 subscribe here on my channel who says 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.770
 subscribe is way you can be at 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.039
 so much the whole video leave us questions 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.330
 comments suggestions for using the gps 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.090
 basically me what we have still 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.949
 activated all more than gps is left 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.039
 here does this second option that 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.710
 I made gps here it was already activated and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.469
 they have activated the gps we can suddenly 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.809
 use the mouse the google maps to modes 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.210
 Every time the Google Maps application is 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.969
 this one that is here we just graduated 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.390
 to google maps and he quickly 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.390
 will locate 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.820
 we just have to give it here in this 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.800
 option that says here with a little circle and 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.719
 that way the suddenly they are not located 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.239
 in a more perfect more accurate way 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.559
 where we are basically in 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.320
 this moment is how I was now in 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.199
 cali let's say I'm moving 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.309
 on the map I'm looking at other 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.939
 parts 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.140
 children that are caused to cause when channel yes 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.960
 I want to get quickly to the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.009
 indication and I simply give it but there 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.140
 to keep in mind that you have to have 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.909
 wifi or data for it to work 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.729
 because many times he can not be 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.649
 downloaded we give here in the circuit 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.310
 and one brings me to my current case 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.110
 another way to use the gps in this 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.479
 case with the maps is not very important 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.860
 we want to have wifi or data to 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.780
 locate lest you download the maps 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.319
 in the case that when we are 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.619
 opera hunting camping already in the forest 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.869
 and do not have the data but we do have a 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.390
 map at hand what we can do is 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.100
 before going to the rides download this 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.430
 application 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.590
 where it was called GPS text 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.810
 I said you can see it well it's a 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.940
 application that weighs 300 maximum that no 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.210
 reaches the 300k megas only and what 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:08.760
 what it does is give us a gps location 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.760
 give our our longitude latitude 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.150
 here is what it does is first perform 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.319
 a search of what the satellites are 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.209
 closest and just have a while and 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.580
 accurately shows us our 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.250
 location also shows us that 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.920
 altitude for example let's hope to see here 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.170
 to just finish making the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.900
 sampling of all satellites that 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.349
 have your hand 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.349
 at that time I was watching 12 but 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.110
 is taking data from 7 on this side 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.620
 I think there's speed here 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.329
 application is ours the altitude starts 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.689
 I can change that to even meters 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.000
 gross do by configuration not here 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.290
 there has to be an option do not allow 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.950
 change format 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.459
 the altitude 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.290
 metric system let's see here he says 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.140
 that I'm at 1000 meters basically the 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.019
 height of quality or less and if I give it the 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.030
 world option here up look what 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.000
 I'm more interested in knowing what my 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.099
 latitude and longitude and with this know in 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.230
 what part am I suddenly using a 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.980
 hand map in case you do not have 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.690
 data and mostly basically for this 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.549
 video thank you very much for watching the videos 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.880
 and I invite you to subscribe again to 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.880
