in<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:57.920> air<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:58.940> this<00:00:59.930> is<00:01:00.110> not<00:01:00.290> super<00:01:00.620> useful

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
in the air so this is not super useful

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.170 
in the air so this is not super useful
first<00:01:02.540> of<00:01:02.660> all<00:01:02.719> in<00:01:03.020> PvE<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:04.670> doesn't<00:01:05.000> do<00:01:05.059> enough

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
first of all in PvE it doesn't do enough

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.810 
first of all in PvE it doesn't do enough
extra<00:01:06.020> damage<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:06.680> kill<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:06.950> lot<00:01:07.369> of<00:01:07.399> things

charge if you get lucky and maybe
brawler<00:01:13.490> is<00:01:13.729> active<00:01:14.149> then<00:01:14.329> it'll<00:01:14.509> do<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.659> little

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:14.959 
brawler is active then it'll do a little

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:17.199 
brawler is active then it'll do a little
more<00:01:15.170> damage<00:01:15.649> if<00:01:15.799> arteburn<00:01:16.280> is<00:01:16.490> active<00:01:16.939> then

more damage if arteburn is active then

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.840 
more damage if arteburn is active then
it'll<00:01:17.450> do<00:01:17.539> a<00:01:17.569> little<00:01:17.810> more<00:01:18.079> but<00:01:19.039> really<00:01:19.579> it's

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
it'll do a little more but really it's

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.719 
it'll do a little more but really it's
not<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.119> super<00:01:20.780> useful<00:01:21.130> set<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:22.159> abilities

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
not a super useful set of abilities

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.440 
not a super useful set of abilities
inside<00:01:23.450> PvE<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.679> PvP<00:01:24.999> same<00:01:25.999> thing<00:01:26.240> goes

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
inside PvE and PvP same thing goes

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.929 
inside PvE and PvP same thing goes
really<00:01:26.899> most<00:01:27.889> things<00:01:28.159> are<00:01:28.310> going<00:01:28.429> to<00:01:28.490> die<00:01:28.670> in

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
really most things are going to die in

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.059 
really most things are going to die in
PvP<00:01:29.539> from<00:01:29.810> your<00:01:29.929> shoulder<00:01:30.289> charge<00:01:30.469> anyway

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
PvP from your shoulder charge anyway

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:33.160 
PvP from your shoulder charge anyway
there's<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.729> few<00:01:31.969> things<00:01:32.179> that<00:01:32.420> won't<00:01:32.569> like<00:01:32.959> a

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
there's a few things that won't like a

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.440 
there's a few things that won't like a
warlock<00:01:34.039> that<00:01:34.249> has<00:01:34.369> radiance<00:01:34.909> or<00:01:35.119> a<00:01:35.149> Blade

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
warlock that has radiance or a Blade

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.139 
warlock that has radiance or a Blade
Dancer<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:36.950> will<00:01:37.279> give<00:01:37.579> you<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.880> extra

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
Dancer and this will give you the extra

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.719 
Dancer and this will give you the extra
damage<00:01:38.389> to<00:01:38.719> kill<00:01:38.929> those<00:01:39.109> guys<00:01:39.399> but<00:01:40.399> is<00:01:40.670> that

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
damage to kill those guys but is that

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.730 
damage to kill those guys but is that
going<00:01:40.999> to<00:01:41.090> come<00:01:41.240> up<00:01:41.359> once<00:01:41.719> or<00:01:41.959> twice<00:01:42.170> during<00:01:42.319> a

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
going to come up once or twice during a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.160 
going to come up once or twice during a
crucible<00:01:43.159> match<00:01:43.429> probably<00:01:44.299> not<00:01:44.569> even<00:01:44.990> that

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
crucible match probably not even that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.039 
crucible match probably not even that
frequently<00:01:45.679> so<00:01:46.279> it's<00:01:46.429> hard<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.939> justify<00:01:47.450> using

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
frequently so it's hard to justify using

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.419 
frequently so it's hard to justify using
these<00:01:48.380> as<00:01:48.679> your<00:01:49.429> exotic<00:01:50.020> armor<00:01:51.340> even<00:01:52.340> though

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
these as your exotic armor even though

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.069 
these as your exotic armor even though
they<00:01:52.579> look<00:01:52.729> super<00:01:52.999> cool<00:01:53.270> I'm<00:01:53.509> gonna<00:01:53.689> buy<00:01:53.869> them

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
they look super cool I'm gonna buy them

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.899 
they look super cool I'm gonna buy them
because<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.439> collect<00:01:54.859> all<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.310> exotics<00:01:55.789> and

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
because I collect all the exotics and

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.159 
because I collect all the exotics and
this<00:01:55.999> is<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.149> first<00:01:56.359> chance<00:01:56.450> I've<00:01:56.719> had<00:01:56.779> at

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:57.169 
this is the first chance I've had at

00:01:57.169 --> 00:02:00.519 
this is the first chance I've had at
them<00:01:57.609> but<00:01:58.609> I<00:01:59.060> can't<00:01:59.749> really<00:01:59.959> recommend<00:02:00.139> them

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:00.529 
them but I can't really recommend them

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:02.980 
them but I can't really recommend them
too<00:02:00.679> highly<00:02:01.060> all<00:02:02.060> right<00:02:02.209> next<00:02:02.359> up<00:02:02.599> for<00:02:02.929> the

Death each kill heals you and speeds up
reload<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.290> when<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.280> get<00:03:49.460> a<00:03:49.490> kill<00:03:49.760> with<00:03:49.910> this

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
reload so when you get a kill with this

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.790 
reload so when you get a kill with this
it<00:03:50.360> starts<00:03:50.810> your<00:03:51.140> healing<00:03:51.770> process

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
it starts your healing process

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.420 
it starts your healing process
immediately<00:03:52.670> which<00:03:53.660> counters<00:03:54.320> the<00:03:55.040> damage

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
immediately which counters the damage

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.910 
immediately which counters the damage
over<00:03:55.640> time<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.870> thorn<00:03:57.140> is<00:03:57.290> doing<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.770> you

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
over time that the thorn is doing to you

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.530 
over time that the thorn is doing to you
so<00:03:58.190> if<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.370> get<00:03:58.490> in<00:03:58.580> a<00:03:58.670> gunfight<00:03:58.880> with<00:03:59.120> a<00:03:59.210> thorn

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
so if you get in a gunfight with a thorn

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.440 
so if you get in a gunfight with a thorn
and<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:00.590> win<00:04:00.860> that<00:04:00.890> gunfight<00:04:01.580> you<00:04:01.790> won't<00:04:02.120> die

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
and you win that gunfight you won't die

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.290 
and you win that gunfight you won't die
from<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.950> damage<00:04:04.490> over<00:04:04.730> time<00:04:04.760> which<00:04:05.270> is

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
from the damage over time which is

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.500 
from the damage over time which is
frankly<00:04:05.840> very<00:04:06.230> useful<00:04:07.160> right<00:04:07.340> now<00:04:07.550> it's<00:04:08.390> also

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
frankly very useful right now it's also

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.940 
frankly very useful right now it's also
got<00:04:08.660> unflinching<00:04:09.290> so<00:04:09.440> it's<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.590> little<00:04:09.710> easier

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
got unflinching so it's a little easier

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.570 
got unflinching so it's a little easier
to<00:04:10.190> win<00:04:10.580> that<00:04:10.790> gunfight<00:04:11.330> I<00:04:11.890> don't<00:04:12.890> love<00:04:13.160> these

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
to win that gunfight I don't love these

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.010 
to win that gunfight I don't love these

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
weapon all the time because of its

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.270 
weapon all the time because of its
counter<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.900> thorn<00:04:21.260> I<00:04:21.500> highly<00:04:22.130> recommend

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060
