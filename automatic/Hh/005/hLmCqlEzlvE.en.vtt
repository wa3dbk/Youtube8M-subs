00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:04.480
 yes I want to show you today how to set the showcase I have 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:06.650
 Percent also a bit prepared 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.119
 convinced of it 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.469
 so that the animals in the sports bars he calls that the statue 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.619
 initially pressed on output above 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.720
 I have also chosen to Coop and over at the moment already at 1 to 4 everything 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.640
 from oil 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.740
 be careful it factually debts so for me it is very much in it 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.839
 Sender as for several stations like you see 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.919
 So from 1 to 4 is occupied by me Romanesque score five and taken 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.280
 Sven Stream Lehmann percent sets the job force 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.440
 and that comes first in Andreas Tilp address 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.000
 the EKR determines with your e-mail from rental radio you got so much 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.090
 because something praise something 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.820
 Bender at 8 80 point 80 percent 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.680
 Funk possible Association of different roles 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.370
 First of all, the port board mostly comes to Pink with 8000 most of the time 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.410
 usually does not have to be yes but I would have the "eight thousand" port 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.730
 sometimes Tommaso 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.730
 Secret password and remains secret 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.940
 Zach as we already have all percent as I said 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.470
 Here we come down the draft with the times of the encoder 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.090
 the MEMA was an encoder 5 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.700
 and percent places market Martinovic and arouses and collective mistakes 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.939
 also put a next topic in Yellow Pages screaming 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.140
 that is it already 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.790
 I want that was Flop Zorc here 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.810
 here comes that Logan of a radio fall so that means if you want 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.130
 can you write 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.100
 How much does your domain dee the best radio in the world? 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.189
 that's the percent, so to speak, the headline looks at the guest 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.090
 in URL as I said Euro to Pilcher four stand as neither a domain de 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.670
 and here in York time 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.020
 by ten animals registered rock pop or miscellaneous but mostly who have to 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.820
 these are called here 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.540
 So to menu I for example the idea super blockbuster Goller 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.830
 Liedersänger 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.100
 calls it then write it in here or just just those over 3 million 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.750
 yes in Ehingen is clear as Dr 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.179
 Reem lamb or even the Roli arms 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:12.699
 Percent at 70 euros 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.139
 also says the measure 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.939
 Percent the ICQ address 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.969
 Percent Erk gives it to 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.709
 strangle radio they have their own person is in quali they have a turkey 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.190
 percent 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.190
 I took treasures of Natans on the mountain here 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:29.709
 so what is very important in the fog title from Dec yes 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.420
 Percent usually the pillow in gray hair is two three times on it 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.569
 click then you see their slogan here are these check marks off the power greed 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.179
 yes 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.179
 a write in here 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.849
 Aden became the marquee 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.019
 out 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.529
 Bob ddp 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.259
 18 years 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:00.489
 Percent he offers to write as soon as you are on air since that is called percent 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.439
 Aegon Grant he squeezed on comebacks 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.760
 yes and then the broadcasts Gersters then go in there before writing 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.179
 not because otherwise it will not be displayed that's what 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.299
 Dynamo in the amp later 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.010
 I think I demonstrate that I've advised you to Winamp dapd 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.040
 if you see UIC determined yes 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.010
 that's exactly the same thing that what UNAM percent what people at Wyndham 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.250
 see later year or even the media player now, of course 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.639
 Good to the Roma on and that 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:26.979
 for in Kohler 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.430
 we have just here in the output 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.919
 a taken in convection encoder five 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.180
 Of course we now also Asus the compensation principle misses 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.829
 Encoder 1 to 4 already naturally exposed my brother 1 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:39.409
 do 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.830
 I know this is a show Kaarst version gives to before in the Kodak 1 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.829
 is broken and repeatedly jumps to the controller a Gruner 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.239
 two if you do not have so many radio stations 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.129
 Percent have where he sends year 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.519
 so I suppose it was a coup or five the principle is always the same 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.409
 in order to cool guy is very clear he only has the choice between nine and mp3 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.409
 with the mp3 encoder 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.569
 so i would recommend you between 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.620
 80 kW PS and one hundred 12 kWp to send it or if they are light 428 so in the future 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.309
 so much could also send with radio 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:13.040
 to be recommended for 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.049
 so that you also follow »you must also have given reservations» Kleist never StN User 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.840
 or people who do not have the Neuhold ESL flatrate 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.400
 6 90 kW hp or 80 kWp would be enough to get around 690 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.449
 kWp it with 44 000 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:28.840
 100 kilohertz 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.840
 Percent of course not monotone to stereo 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.360
 we all have no stereo exactly 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.579
 the wars already Lenco or configuration now the wine in q3 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.379
 so it was standard coming in with Merkel 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:47.379
 No, he has two and Kate in the bread 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:51.129
 and this on 44 000 100 hertz stereo 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.129
 you can already see my voice next to percent so it is optimal 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.249
 I do not want to miss that 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:01.309
 I do not jump so hard on him and that means percent is female above 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.580
 stapled stand so million 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.300
 I can not say I can not talk that loud that it is stuck 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.569
 is she so should 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:08.999
 the 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:12.879
 Microphones of the wild is here so far down rules that not like above 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:16.369
 stapled stands and the same goes for the music it tests out Lappert 

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:18.729
 Invites neurons Winamp 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:19.590
 with around 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.689
 and the loudest rummages he has, so to speak, and 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.639
 a here could then stop 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.889
 the music that is definitely not too loud it is about zero 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:28.800
 so come 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.449
 it can quietly toast the only praise as I do now with me too 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.419
 In between, yes, but not to be festgetackert us one is 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.990
 overdrive there and the listener Eurozone clock can not hear anything anymore 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.300
 a good four weeks later 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.039
 Microphone death 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.740
 please put on percent microphone 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.900
 Open mic Saarbrücken 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.430
 so the hammer now raised some Christmas to the right to see with her 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.330
 two windows which are also «Gimme behind one another sometimes one sees the 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.919
 Not 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.080
 the one is percent volume account 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.900
 Iced control to the right because there he has only one setting and though micro 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.030
 Frohn percent at macy's a bit high so you can see but 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.409
 Normally this is down there but it happens automatically year too 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.869
 there goes the extended synonymous then this window goes on advanced 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:12.650
 Setting for microphone 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.289
 There it just puts the microphone 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.620
 2 percent of Niko from 2d with boost and then unlock 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.809
 that was 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:22.219
 as total volume announces 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.090
 then the other window sounds 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.090
 that's more important with Colin Control 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.810
 m then Mono Mixe or Stereo Mix I'm always the Mono Macs 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.620
 and that's an advantage per cent that does not bounce why 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.569
 Steel Mills sometimes jumps that over and people still listen to us in stereo 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:43.569
 I want to let it be tilted at the moment 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.610
 if he does jump away, look for it myself before you send it to me 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.089
 important 

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.919
 so 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:53.789
 and then on microphone 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.149
 expanded 

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.800
 and do the Micro Boost 1 there 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.879
 also very important 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:02.879
 what it can hear very badly by the people 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.030
 then you already have the microphone level you have here the BG music label 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.289
 means if you pressed up per piece Abt 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:15.149
 Brega, the music is so quiet below 

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:17.590
 as the animal has set four with it 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.590
 That means your speech is louder than the microphone 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:22.340
 as the music 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.599
 all the microphone so loud as music schools so weapon 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:29.550
 yes and Red numbers that is already what is actually work that is percent 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.460
 the time she has the microphone on Rome under satisfied respectively the 

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:36.389
 Newspaper Make music quietly or loudly 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.550
 and we are set 500 milliseconds and wants Eon so far very much 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.339
 drove well 

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:43.949
 Well then he goes back to Output 

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:47.979
 if all set you have music invited the musicians always and 

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:50.830
 then you can on Konvektomaten that is of course not me now with me 

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.099
 've not noticed anything right direction anyway 

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:57.610
 such a compromise is the visit to the North Pole Connecting 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.330
 yes percent automatic with the head coach the water will try again and again 

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.259
 Percent but so then the setting would have votes 

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:09.300
 More I have nothing to say to it much fun with Kaarst and looks 

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.809
 I hope I have you 

00:08:10.809 --> 00:08:11.629
 Kulterer will
