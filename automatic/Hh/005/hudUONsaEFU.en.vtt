00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
simple job in SAS data integration

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.690 
simple job in SAS data integration
studio<00:00:06.950> in<00:00:07.310> the<00:00:08.120> process<00:00:08.630> I<00:00:08.900> will<00:00:09.500> add<00:00:09.559> a

I'll<00:00:33.989> select<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.560> sort<00:00:34.860> transformation<00:00:35.820> from

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
I'll select the sort transformation from

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.180 
I'll select the sort transformation from
the<00:00:36.480> data<00:00:36.720> folder<00:00:37.080> in<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.680> transformation

the data folder in the transformation

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.240 
the data folder in the transformation
tree<00:00:39.020> then<00:00:40.020> I'll<00:00:40.260> drag<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.830> drop<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250

using the replace option by the way the

using the replace option by the way the
replacing<00:02:39.800> register<00:02:40.280> table<00:02:40.730> options<00:02:41.270> are

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
replacing register table options are

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.410 
replacing register table options are
generally<00:02:42.590> better<00:02:42.860> than<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.850> leting<00:02:44.239> the

generally better than the leting the

existing permanent table this is because

the existing mappings are preserved when

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.070 
the existing mappings are preserved when

you use these options finally I want to

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.800 
you use these options finally I want to

clean up the foot first I'll straighten
