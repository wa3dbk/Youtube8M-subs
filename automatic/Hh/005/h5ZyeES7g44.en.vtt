I would I know it would be a little
difficult<00:02:01.219> but<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.280> would<00:02:02.790> go<00:02:03.540> back<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:05.659> 1999

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
difficult but I would go back to 1999

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.669 
difficult but I would go back to 1999
and<00:02:07.670> assassinate<00:02:08.670> President<00:02:09.239> Bush<00:02:09.500> who<00:02:10.500> was

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
and that's one thing I change about

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.380 
and that's one thing I change about
myself<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.730> missed<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.209> opportunity

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
myself that I missed that opportunity

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.250 
myself that I missed that opportunity
when<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.200> clearly<00:02:17.650> presented<00:02:18.040> itself<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.670> me

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
when it clearly presented itself to me
