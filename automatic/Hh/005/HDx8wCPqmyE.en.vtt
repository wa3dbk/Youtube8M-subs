00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 today there is no envy at the tuca 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.750
 ferretti of some players because he has 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.940
 lasted some because ex-players 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.309
 technicians because it has lasted because it has 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.350
 a good résumé because he has made a 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.100
 template because he has been a good technician 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:25.880
 and because he has his things in america 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:33.329
 I play with 12 and the future said though that 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:36.540
 portrait does not also have your camera now 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.550
 and vice of the final grand final that famous 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.000
 of pumas 80 and 40 and 52 of famous 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.390
 keep you must want to live from 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.940
 present and from the past you have to see the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.190
 present and the future not for that but for 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.930
 what because america I played 13 years and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.730
 they never helped me to be love me 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.350
 I lived in my own flesh and continue their 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.270
 instinct I was not in this game the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.760
 famous queretano between america cougars 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.900
 after uribe 4 part of four 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.590
 arbitration decisions 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.590
 and final 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.230
 america, you said you said 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.790
 you know it depends on where you get mad about 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.790
 the americas and america 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.560
 the capacity of any doubt the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.700
 number of targeted matches that's a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.800
 impressive record 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.750
 20 years and I'm excited I do not understand 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.320
 how you do or how it has taken us your 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.060
 rest 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.619
 I think it contains already sold out the formula 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.900
 and I think the same ferretti that after 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.330
 rectified those statements is 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.910
 conscious and they were given that evil 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.619
 step of tigers the bad step of the free 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.760
 it has nothing to do with the referees have 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.340
 what to do with the operation of the equipment 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.380
 it knows himself knows that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.360
 team must play much better and that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.220
 arbitration decisions in those 20 years 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.140
 who has twenty-something as technicians the 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.060
 who had as a player you favor and you 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.700
 they hurt yes I think as a player 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.440
 he lived in a time when he may be 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.670
 helped in america we are talking about 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.670
 30 years ago when playing 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.900
 which is something that roberto highlighted 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:23.250
 Luis habitat remembering that match 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.250
 that match 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:37.560
 but it was a lot because work 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.189
 consists of the transmission that nobody 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.870
 it seemed to you pressures you to say the 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.870
 things nobody who nobody 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.970
 let's go though it bothers you
