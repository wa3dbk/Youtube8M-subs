00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.990 
for me is probably not a must bottle yet
probably<00:02:26.680> because<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.520> whole<00:02:27.730> vanilla

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
probably because of the whole vanilla

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.990 
probably because of the whole vanilla
factor<00:02:28.720> there<00:02:28.930> is<00:02:28.959> another<00:02:29.470> fan<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.100> that<00:02:30.340> so

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
factor there is another fan of that so

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.699 
factor there is another fan of that so
that's<00:02:31.209> probably<00:02:31.540> what's<00:02:31.930> turning<00:02:32.260> me<00:02:32.320> off<00:02:32.350> of

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
that's probably what's turning me off of

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.160 
that's probably what's turning me off of
this<00:02:32.800> but<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.100> can<00:02:33.310> see<00:02:33.580> why<00:02:33.910> people<00:02:34.240> would<00:02:34.870> love

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
can see but this one is so is so like

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.400 
can see but this one is so is so like
light<00:04:38.860> and<00:04:39.040> playful<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.630> have<00:04:41.020> enjoyed

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
light and playful that I have enjoyed

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.010 
light and playful that I have enjoyed
this<00:04:41.620> actually<00:04:42.370> on<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:43.090> summer<00:04:43.360> days<00:04:43.660> it

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
this actually on the summer days it

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.140 
this actually on the summer days it
hasn't<00:04:44.320> become<00:04:44.740> flowing<00:04:45.100> at<00:04:45.430> all

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
hasn't become flowing at all

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.719 
hasn't become flowing at all
so<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:46.630> one<00:04:46.810> in<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.320> summer<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:47.889> think<00:04:48.520> works

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
so this one in the summer I think works

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:49.260 
so this one in the summer I think works
too

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
too

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.409 
too
now<00:04:49.990> another<00:04:50.740> parallel<00:04:51.190> this<00:04:51.639> fun<00:04:51.970> was<00:04:52.180> pretty

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
now another parallel this fun was pretty

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.310 
now another parallel this fun was pretty
funny<00:04:52.750> she<00:04:53.470> said<00:04:53.830> that<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:54.940> smelled<00:04:55.360> boy<00:04:55.930> toy

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320
