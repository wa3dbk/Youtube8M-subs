00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.759
 then immediately take it there an analyst also said

 yes in the weekend newspaper of this weekend that is the and see and I am 23 lease 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.100
 got 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.130
 but not out 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.880
 stands for inclusive symbol for and sound a breakdown that succeeds anp 58 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.120
 centimeters 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.210
 and the normal price of this lifetime comes to the continent for a beautiful career 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.689
 that 369 euros and it all comes nicely 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.450
 229 desk 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.480
 we now also have in many of these pay attention to pv monitor of 10 each he has one 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.399
 piano lacquer 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.000
 the black flooded the market to see permanent attention 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.080
 in a non-plexiglass that you can look at very carefully 4 on and on 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.280
 power button as a design 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.990
 at the bottom it seems like there is a design yes kind of big 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.630
 threshold is only 9 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.450
 the sound in the basement of the speakers including the chip remains 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.540
 top sound and of course outside the included 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.859
 remote control has the super beautiful 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.780
 thanks operation through and because the turn 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.850
 television is you look so nice and thin but it is just as thin as my finger 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.850
 so basically discount such a boy to hang on the wall 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.210
 just the specifications of this boy it is a palette the tv he is i feel hd 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.300
 hdmi connection and scart connection he finds psb connection of course 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.720
 Do not photograph four video files or your music files directly on the television 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.140
 and he has a dvb t tuner what content if you watch image via kpn 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.460
 digitenne I no longer have a digital candle and if there are two 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.100
 remote controls 9 everything on this distance inside of belgium tv monitor 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.220
 He also has VG connection so you can use it as a computer monitor 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.620
 at the TV and computer market hours 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.810
 and the midpoint of the subwoofer 400 characters are extra dimension of sound 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.960
 I say I this is the ideal sharp for the climbers 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:40.609
 the internet television in addition to a certain technique that is used 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:41.989
 but we are going a bit anyway 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.189
 we believe that abuses stand for a vivid image 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.640
 meaning a black is too deep black and she sees in white is really that 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.549
 duty 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.420
 well with p before that energy efficient eco but that prevents the fencers 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.820
 use a lot less energy than 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.510
 are fellow doctors who use the plasma velserbeek feet 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.039
 and the d 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:07.150
 say what you want i myself say before 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.969
 the design you could say but also for 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.969
 thin because it is as thick as my finger 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.930
 also this screen in counter daily which is here that in intelligent either 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.170
 measure the light intensity of the environment so the moment you go during the day 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:27.379
 nice watching tv team vic 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.110
 but they watch television in the evening and you are in the dark environment or not 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.590
 of course playing very good games for those creemers then you already get 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.779
 that by burning sensation in your eyes 9 to make sure there is not any one that sniffs 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:39.910
 danny blindly roars 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.689
 and then it just looks a bit calmer and moreover 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.689
 naturally also saves energy 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.249
 No 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:55.599
 all screens come with a foot old actually too big on the wall 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:56.120
 to hang 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.689
 give an example about a solution for or completely flat on the wall 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.210
 by virtue of the sinking he was for the small sizes 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.439
 the great extent say it 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.439
 a lot you want two ways 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.819
