the trials I managed to get my hands on
an<00:00:43.880> adaptive<00:00:44.360> version<00:00:44.720> that<00:00:44.840> does<00:00:45.020> solar

an adaptive version that does solar
damage<00:00:45.770> and<00:00:45.980> I<00:00:46.520> have<00:00:46.700> to<00:00:46.850> say<00:00:46.879> that<00:00:47.059> I'm<00:00:47.300> really

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
damage and I have to say that I'm really

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.540 
damage and I have to say that I'm really
enjoying<00:00:47.870> using<00:00:48.290> this<00:00:48.530> hand<00:00:48.800> can<00:00:49.010> for<00:00:49.280> a<00:00:49.340> lot

enjoying using this hand can for a lot
of<00:00:49.580> different<00:00:49.760> reasons<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:50.989> let's<00:00:51.230> start

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
of different reasons so let's start

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.590 
of different reasons so let's start
breaking<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:52.250> weapon<00:00:52.520> down<00:00:52.550> look<00:00:53.239> at<00:00:53.360> some<00:00:53.510> of

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
breaking the weapon down look at some of

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.140 
breaking the weapon down look at some of
its<00:00:53.750> base<00:00:53.960> stats<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:54.620> skills<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:55.640> go<00:00:56.000> from

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
its base stats and skills and go from

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.530 
its base stats and skills and go from
there<00:00:56.470> so<00:00:57.470> here's<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:57.830> hand<00:00:58.040> cannon<00:00:58.430> as<00:00:58.550> far

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
there so here's the hand cannon as far

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.600 
there so here's the hand cannon as far
as<00:00:59.570> sites<00:00:59.930> are<00:01:00.110> concerned<00:01:00.500> you've<00:01:01.129> got<00:01:01.280> steady

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
as sites are concerned you've got steady

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.960 
as sites are concerned you've got steady
hand<00:01:02.000> you've<00:01:02.570> got<00:01:02.600> quick<00:01:03.020> draw<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:03.699> sure<00:01:04.699> shot

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
hand you've got quick draw and sure shot

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.460 
hand you've got quick draw and sure shot
which<00:01:05.300> is<00:01:05.449> really<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.930> only<00:01:05.960> one<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:06.350> can

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
which is really the only one I can

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.870 
which is really the only one I can
recommend<00:01:06.860> using<00:01:07.280> because<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:07.820> the

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
recommend using because of the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.570 
recommend using because of the
additional<00:01:08.590> target<00:01:09.590> acquisition<00:01:09.710> then<00:01:10.490> you

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
additional target acquisition then you

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.170 
additional target acquisition then you
have<00:01:10.729> Icarus<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.390> some<00:01:11.780> people<00:01:12.080> aren't<00:01:12.410> too

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
have Icarus and some people aren't too

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.380 
have Icarus and some people aren't too
sold<00:01:14.180> on<00:01:14.450> Icarus<00:01:14.660> I<00:01:15.050> definitely<00:01:15.530> am<00:01:16.390> having

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
sold on Icarus I definitely am having

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.889 
sold on Icarus I definitely am having
the<00:01:17.780> additional<00:01:18.619> accuracy<00:01:19.340> while<00:01:20.030> jumping<00:01:20.479> is

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
the additional accuracy while jumping is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.520 
the additional accuracy while jumping is
is<00:01:21.560> invaluable<00:01:22.490> sometimes<00:01:23.360> it's<00:01:23.690> a<00:01:24.020> look<00:01:24.440> at

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
is invaluable sometimes it's a look at

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.650 
is invaluable sometimes it's a look at
this<00:01:24.619> just<00:01:24.890> getting<00:01:25.550> a<00:01:25.610> head<00:01:25.640> shot<00:01:26.210> out<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.479> the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
this just getting a head shot out of the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.230 
this just getting a head shot out of the
air<00:01:26.990> for<00:01:27.320> that<00:01:27.410> 86<00:01:27.740> precision<00:01:28.460> damage<00:01:28.759> that's

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
air for that 86 precision damage that's

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.300 
air for that 86 precision damage that's
fantastic<00:01:30.050> then<00:01:30.560> moving<00:01:30.740> on<00:01:30.979> to<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.130> middle

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
fantastic then moving on to the middle

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.190 
fantastic then moving on to the middle
tree<00:01:31.610> you've<00:01:31.759> got<00:01:31.910> snapshot<00:01:32.509> flared<00:01:33.110> magwell

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
tree you've got snapshot flared magwell

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.130 
tree you've got snapshot flared magwell
and<00:01:33.830> perfect<00:01:34.520> balance<00:01:34.700> I<00:01:35.090> recommend<00:01:35.959> highly

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
and perfect balance I recommend highly

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.320 
and perfect balance I recommend highly
rolling<00:01:36.649> with<00:01:36.800> perfect<00:01:37.160> balance<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.119> you

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
rolling with perfect balance so that you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.350 
rolling with perfect balance so that you
can<00:01:38.479> get<00:01:38.630> successive<00:01:39.440> shots<00:01:39.830> in<00:01:40.360> without

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
can get successive shots in without

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.690 
can get successive shots in without
worrying<00:01:41.690> too<00:01:41.869> much<00:01:41.899> about<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.470> recoil<00:01:42.979> it

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
worrying too much about the recoil it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.160 
worrying too much about the recoil it
pulls<00:01:43.940> slightly<00:01:44.179> up<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.690> right<00:01:44.869> but<00:01:45.020> it's

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
pulls slightly up to the right but it's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.440 
pulls slightly up to the right but it's
really<00:01:45.410> not<00:01:45.619> too<00:01:45.860> bad<00:01:46.100> once<00:01:47.090> you've<00:01:47.270> upgraded

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
really not too bad once you've upgraded

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.300 
really not too bad once you've upgraded
the<00:01:47.869> weapon<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:50.170> then<00:01:51.170> finally<00:01:51.440> in<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:51.890> last

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
the weapon and then finally in the last

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.630 
the weapon and then finally in the last
skill<00:01:52.940> slot<00:01:53.300> you<00:01:53.750> have<00:01:53.990> thirdeye<00:01:54.619> which<00:01:55.459> has

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
skill slot you have thirdeye which has

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.880 
skill slot you have thirdeye which has
always<00:01:55.970> been<00:01:56.330> one<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.630> my<00:01:56.750> favorite<00:01:57.350> skills

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
always been one of my favorite skills

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.949 
always been one of my favorite skills
for<00:01:58.130> any<00:01:58.340> weapon<00:01:58.700> really<00:01:59.000> being<00:01:59.450> able<00:01:59.599> to<00:01:59.780> have

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
for any weapon really being able to have

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.600 
for any weapon really being able to have
that<00:01:59.990> additional<00:02:00.500> situational<00:02:01.490> awareness

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
that additional situational awareness

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.600 
that additional situational awareness
can<00:02:02.539> certainly<00:02:02.899> come<00:02:03.140> in<00:02:03.170> handy<00:02:03.289> all<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.369> time

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
can certainly come in handy all the time

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.089 
can certainly come in handy all the time
being<00:02:05.390> able<00:02:05.599> to<00:02:05.690> 80s<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.560> train<00:02:06.800> on<00:02:06.979> the

being able to 80s and train on the

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.550 
being able to 80s and train on the
target<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.640> then<00:02:08.209> also<00:02:08.420> being<00:02:08.929> aware<00:02:09.229> of<00:02:09.289> when

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
target and then also being aware of when

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.199 
target and then also being aware of when
someone's<00:02:09.950> flanking<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.520> without<00:02:10.789> having<00:02:11.120> to

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
someone's flanking you without having to

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.420 
someone's flanking you without having to
pull<00:02:11.390> out<00:02:11.569> of<00:02:11.599> your<00:02:11.840> sites<00:02:12.140> can<00:02:12.980> save<00:02:13.250> your

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
pull out of your sites can save your

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.370 
pull out of your sites can save your
life<00:02:13.580> on<00:02:13.819> more<00:02:14.030> than<00:02:14.180> one<00:02:14.240> occasion<00:02:14.390> in<00:02:15.080> a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
life on more than one occasion in a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.070 
life on more than one occasion in a
match<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.790> find<00:02:17.030> myself<00:02:17.180> relying<00:02:17.690> on<00:02:17.840> third

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
match so I find myself relying on third

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.010 
match so I find myself relying on third
I<00:02:18.260> pretty<00:02:18.920> consistently<00:02:19.540> now<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:20.660> weapon

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
I pretty consistently now this weapon

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.010 
I pretty consistently now this weapon
will<00:02:21.050> do<00:02:21.319> 86<00:02:21.920> damage<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.610> head<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:23.060> it

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
will do 86 damage to the head and it

throwing knives at work out best I think

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.930 
throwing knives at work out best I think
on<00:02:32.239> my<00:02:32.840> hunter<00:02:33.190> although<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.220> did<00:02:34.459> spend<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.790> lot

start breaking this down let's talk

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.440 
start breaking this down let's talk
first<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.830> foremost<00:03:17.220> about<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.850> combination

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
first and foremost about the combination

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.570 
first and foremost about the combination
of<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.600> rate<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.780> fire<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.530> impact<00:03:19.920> now

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
of the rate of fire and the impact now

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.880 
of the rate of fire and the impact now
this<00:03:20.760> hand<00:03:21.030> cannon<00:03:21.360> hits<00:03:21.570> hard<00:03:21.870> 86<00:03:22.440> precision

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
this hand cannon hits hard 86 precision

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.010 
this hand cannon hits hard 86 precision
damages<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.340> lot<00:03:23.640> now<00:03:24.209> it's<00:03:24.390> not<00:03:24.510> up<00:03:24.750> there<00:03:24.780> were

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
damages a lot now it's not up there were

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.500 
damages a lot now it's not up there were
some<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.440> hardest<00:03:25.950> hitting<00:03:26.310> hand<00:03:27.030> cannons

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
some of the hardest hitting hand cannons

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.900 
some of the hardest hitting hand cannons
in<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.720> game<00:03:27.959> but<00:03:28.709> it's<00:03:28.830> more<00:03:29.130> than<00:03:29.190> adequate

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
in the game but it's more than adequate

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.530 
in the game but it's more than adequate
so<00:03:30.540> coupling<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.230> high<00:03:31.800> damage<00:03:32.130> output

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
so coupling the high damage output

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.300 
so coupling the high damage output
relatively<00:03:33.540> speaking<00:03:34.010> coupling<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.040> with

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
relatively speaking coupling that with

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.060 
relatively speaking coupling that with
the<00:03:35.670> rate<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.850> fire<00:03:36.380> this<00:03:37.380> this<00:03:37.739> weapon

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
the rate of fire this this weapon

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.250 
the rate of fire this this weapon
performs<00:03:38.489> extremely<00:03:39.360> well<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.840> rate<00:03:40.020> of<00:03:40.050> fire

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
performs extremely well the rate of fire

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.740 
performs extremely well the rate of fire
is<00:03:40.290> decently<00:03:40.830> hi<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.790> being<00:03:42.030> able<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.360> put<00:03:42.570> out

is decently hi so being able to put out

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.120 
is decently hi so being able to put out
you<00:03:43.560> know<00:03:43.650> 86<00:03:44.250> precision<00:03:44.790> damage<00:03:45.150> shots

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
you know 86 precision damage shots

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.380 
you know 86 precision damage shots
consecutively<00:03:47.130> in<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.640> short<00:03:48.000> amount<00:03:48.150> of

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
consecutively in that short amount of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.949 
consecutively in that short amount of
time<00:03:48.500> can<00:03:49.500> make<00:03:49.650> for<00:03:49.799> some<00:03:49.980> pretty<00:03:50.010> short

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
time can make for some pretty short

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.320 
time can make for some pretty short
times<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.170> kill<00:03:52.440> all<00:03:52.799> this<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.940> say<00:03:54.120> if

really high even when it's vanilla the

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.840 
really high even when it's vanilla the
aim<00:04:19.440> assist<00:04:19.739> is<00:04:19.919> pretty<00:04:20.280> high<00:04:20.489> for<00:04:20.549> this

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
aim assist is pretty high for this

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.000 
aim assist is pretty high for this
weapon<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:21.750> coupling<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.320> sure<00:04:22.500> shot<00:04:22.530> with<00:04:22.860> it

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
weapon so coupling the sure shot with it

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.380 
weapon so coupling the sure shot with it
means<00:04:23.220> you're<00:04:23.610> going<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.820> be<00:04:23.910> even<00:04:24.210> more

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
means you're going to be even more

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.930 
means you're going to be even more
accurate<00:04:24.870> coupling<00:04:25.620> Icarus<00:04:26.130> with<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.520> these

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
accurate coupling Icarus with that these

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.520 
accurate coupling Icarus with that these
are<00:04:27.060> going<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.210> be<00:04:27.300> even<00:04:27.570> more<00:04:27.840> accurate<00:04:28.380> as

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
are going to be even more accurate as

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.320 
are going to be even more accurate as
you're<00:04:28.770> going<00:04:28.950> through<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.310> air<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.729> then

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
you're going through the air and then

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.530 
you're going through the air and then
coupling<00:04:31.280> perfect<00:04:32.280> balance<00:04:32.520> with<00:04:32.850> that<00:04:33.030> means

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
coupling perfect balance with that means

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.200 
coupling perfect balance with that means
that<00:04:33.780> there's<00:04:33.960> even<00:04:34.080> less<00:04:34.380> recoil<00:04:34.770> so<00:04:35.580> you

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
that there's even less recoil so you

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.020 
that there's even less recoil so you
Landing<00:04:37.050> your<00:04:37.289> shots<00:04:37.650> and<00:04:37.919> very<00:04:38.160> consistently

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
Landing your shots and very consistently

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.029 
Landing your shots and very consistently
because<00:04:39.720> all<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.199> different<00:04:40.470> skills<00:04:40.800> on<00:04:40.949> this

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
because all the different skills on this

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.189 
because all the different skills on this
webinar<00:04:41.280> working<00:04:42.000> towards<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.419> one<00:04:42.690> goal<00:04:42.990> of

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
webinar working towards that one goal of

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.909 
webinar working towards that one goal of
making<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:44.039> accurate<00:04:44.759> and<00:04:44.990> fast<00:04:45.990> in<00:04:46.349> terms<00:04:46.800> of

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
making it accurate and fast in terms of

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.550 
making it accurate and fast in terms of
killing<00:04:47.340> things<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:48.660> I<00:04:48.690> found<00:04:49.139> that<00:04:49.410> this

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
killing things so I found that this

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.920 
killing things so I found that this
weapon<00:04:49.979> was<00:04:50.160> more<00:04:50.669> than<00:04:50.940> adequate<00:04:51.120> in<00:04:51.690> the

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
weapon was more than adequate in the

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.570 
weapon was more than adequate in the
control<00:04:52.289> playlist<00:04:52.740> it<00:04:52.919> kept<00:04:53.220> up<00:04:53.400> with<00:04:53.430> the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
control playlist it kept up with the

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.850 
control playlist it kept up with the
high<00:04:53.849> mob<00:04:54.180> sizes<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:55.110> reload<00:04:55.440> speed<00:04:55.710> is

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
high mob sizes the reload speed is

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.249 
high mob sizes the reload speed is
pretty<00:04:56.130> good<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:57.270> time<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:57.660> kill<00:04:57.870> is<00:04:57.900> really

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
pretty good the time the kill is really

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.129 
pretty good the time the kill is really
high<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.860> has<00:04:59.069> nine<00:04:59.370> rounds<00:04:59.550> in<00:04:59.819> the<00:04:59.849> magazine

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
high it has nine rounds in the magazine

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.140 
high it has nine rounds in the magazine
so<00:05:01.139> I<00:05:01.349> was<00:05:01.470> able<00:05:01.680> to<00:05:01.830> keep<00:05:02.130> up<00:05:02.370> with<00:05:02.940> all<00:05:02.970> the

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
so I was able to keep up with all the

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.390 
so I was able to keep up with all the
numbers<00:05:03.630> of<00:05:03.660> enemies<00:05:04.199> that<00:05:04.680> were<00:05:04.830> around<00:05:05.190> me

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
numbers of enemies that were around me

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.930 
numbers of enemies that were around me
so<00:05:06.300> how<00:05:06.840> is<00:05:07.050> this<00:05:07.080> hand<00:05:07.680> cannon<00:05:08.039> rain<00:05:08.280> well<00:05:08.910> I

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
so how is this hand cannon rain well I

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.450 
so how is this hand cannon rain well I
suppose<00:05:09.300> on<00:05:09.330> a<00:05:09.479> scale<00:05:09.780> of<00:05:09.810> 1<00:05:10.110> to<00:05:10.229> 10<00:05:10.259> I<00:05:10.680> would

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
suppose on a scale of 1 to 10 I would

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.279 
suppose on a scale of 1 to 10 I would
say<00:05:11.880> that<00:05:11.910> this<00:05:12.150> hand<00:05:12.419> cannon<00:05:12.750> comes<00:05:13.020> in<00:05:13.169> about

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
say that this hand cannon comes in about

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.700 
say that this hand cannon comes in about
for<00:05:13.979> my<00:05:14.130> taste<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.639> 8.5<00:05:15.509> if<00:05:15.900> we're<00:05:16.380> reserving

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
for my taste and 8.5 if we're reserving

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.939 
for my taste and 8.5 if we're reserving
10<00:05:17.220> for<00:05:17.669> thorn<00:05:18.570> in<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.870> last<00:05:19.110> word<00:05:19.440> and<00:05:19.680> then

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
10 for thorn in the last word and then

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.189 
10 for thorn in the last word and then
we're<00:05:20.160> reserving<00:05:20.699> nine<00:05:21.120> for<00:05:21.389> a<00:05:21.419> hawk<00:05:21.690> moon<00:05:21.990> I

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
we're reserving nine for a hawk moon I

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.529 
we're reserving nine for a hawk moon I
would<00:05:22.680> say<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:22.860> this<00:05:23.099> is<00:05:23.310> just<00:05:23.759> outside<00:05:24.330> the

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
would say that this is just outside the

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.749 
would say that this is just outside the
realm<00:05:24.750> of<00:05:24.930> exotic<00:05:25.500> so<00:05:26.039> I<00:05:26.070> highly<00:05:26.520> recommend

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
realm of exotic so I highly recommend

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.399 
realm of exotic so I highly recommend
getting<00:05:27.120> your<00:05:27.240> hands<00:05:27.570> on<00:05:27.720> this<00:05:27.840> weapon<00:05:28.050> and
