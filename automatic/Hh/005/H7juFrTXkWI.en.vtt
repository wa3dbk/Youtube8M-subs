00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
like to do that cuz mutants are friggin

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.350 
like to do that cuz mutants are friggin
fast<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.980> climb<00:00:41.219> crap<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.120> you're

think it's just like it is this
literally<00:01:06.990> an<00:01:07.170> endless<00:01:07.409> wave<00:01:09.110> screw<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.520> maybe

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
literally an endless wave screw it maybe

literally an endless wave screw it maybe
soon<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:12.090> something<00:01:12.390> where<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.600> just

getting stuck and yeah come on
ow<00:01:21.619> I<00:01:26.150> was<00:01:27.150> thinking<00:01:27.210> maybe<00:01:27.420> was<00:01:27.690> doing<00:01:27.869> that

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
ow I was thinking maybe was doing that

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.090 
ow I was thinking maybe was doing that
thing<00:01:28.140> where<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.619> sometimes<00:01:28.950> like

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
thing where you know sometimes like

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.690 
thing where you know sometimes like
every<00:01:29.670> time<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.880> go<00:01:29.970> past<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.299> point<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:32.040> it'll

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
every time you go past a point the it'll

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.920 
every time you go past a point the it'll
become<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.909> spawn<00:01:33.180> again<00:01:33.330> even<00:01:33.780> though<00:01:33.869> it

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
become a spawn again even though it

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.020 
become a spawn again even though it
wasn't<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.200> spot<00:01:34.380> before<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.490> know<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.820> I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
wasn't a spot before you know like I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.300 
wasn't a spot before you know like I
don't<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.509> what<00:01:36.630> I'm<00:01:36.690> trying<00:01:36.899> to<00:01:36.930> say<00:01:36.990> but

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
don't know what I'm trying to say but

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.469 
don't know what I'm trying to say but
seemed<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.490> something's<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.330> my<00:01:39.450> own

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
seemed like something's going my own

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.080 
seemed like something's going my own
there<00:01:40.100> but<00:01:41.100> now<00:01:41.190> they<00:01:41.340> stopped<00:01:41.610> once<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.940> right

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
there but now they stopped once I right

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
there but now they stopped once I right
over<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.600> i<00:01:42.780> think<00:01:43.049> triggering<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.340> got

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
over here so i think triggering you got

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.980 
over here so i think triggering you got
walking<00:01:44.820> around<00:01:44.970> their<00:01:45.180> triggers<00:01:45.690> them<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
walking around their triggers them to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.109 
walking around their triggers them to
just<00:01:46.140> keep<00:01:46.229> spawning<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.799> running<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:47.909> them

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
just keep spawning so running at them

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.350 
just keep spawning so running at them
feels<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.630> pretty<00:01:48.780> good<00:01:48.930> idea<00:01:50.210> pick<00:01:51.210> up

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
feels like a pretty good idea pick up

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.810 
feels like a pretty good idea pick up
everything<00:01:51.630> here<00:01:51.899> crabs<00:01:52.649> worth<00:01:52.830> lots<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.399> ice

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
everything here crabs worth lots of ice

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.139 
everything here crabs worth lots of ice
picking<00:01:54.060> up<00:01:55.130> this<00:01:56.130> see<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.610> isn't<00:01:56.789> so<00:01:56.910> good

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
picking up this see this isn't so good

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.380 
picking up this see this isn't so good
no<00:01:57.990> funnel<00:01:58.259> means<00:01:58.679> they<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.070> they<00:01:59.940> can<00:01:59.970> climb

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
no funnel means they can they can climb

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.700 
no funnel means they can they can climb
crab<00:02:00.750> they<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.080> just<00:02:01.200> kind<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.350> get<00:02:01.500> around

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
crab they can just kind of get around

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.350 
crab they can just kind of get around
