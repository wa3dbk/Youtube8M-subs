00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:10.070 

I<00:00:02.030> have<00:00:03.030> here<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.360> heavy<00:00:04.759> battery<00:00:05.839> isolator<00:00:09.080> and

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
I have here a heavy battery isolator and

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.430 
I have here a heavy battery isolator and
what<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.469> does<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:11.269> charge<00:00:12.269> two<00:00:12.599> batteries

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:40.540 

to<00:00:16.440> plug<00:00:16.680> for<00:00:16.920> all<00:00:17.070> mirror-like<00:00:25.279> mission<00:00:39.379> 128

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
to plug for all mirror-like mission 128

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.880 
to plug for all mirror-like mission 128
max<00:00:41.840> it's<00:00:42.840> later<00:00:45.829> ground-<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.969> is

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
max it's later ground- so what you do is

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.650 
max it's later ground- so what you do is
battery<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.070> goes<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:51.770> this<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:53.660> mission

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
battery one goes here this is mission

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.170 
battery one goes here this is mission
wire<00:00:59.570> this<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.199> alternator<00:01:02.100> your<00:01:03.059> own

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
wire this is the alternator your own

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.509 
wire this is the alternator your own
later<00:01:03.359> water<00:01:03.600> come<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.369> your

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
later water come here and this is your

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.330 
later water come here and this is your
battery<00:01:05.760> number<00:01:06.090> two<00:01:07.549> higher<00:01:08.549> number<00:01:08.850> one

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
battery number two higher number one

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.929 
battery number two higher number one
mission<00:01:11.340> wire<00:01:11.729> alternator<00:01:14.270> battery<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:16.939> this

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
mission wire alternator battery to this

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.980 
mission wire alternator battery to this
is<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.420> your<00:01:18.869> battery<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.920> vehicle<00:01:20.990> one

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
is so your battery in your vehicle one

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.030 
is so your battery in your vehicle one
inch<00:01:22.140> running<00:01:23.900> mission<00:01:24.900> tells<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.380> this

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
inch running mission tells it that this

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.620 
inch running mission tells it that this
vehicle<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.520> running<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.240> pulling<00:01:27.479> in

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
vehicle is running and it's pulling in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.590 
vehicle is running and it's pulling in
power<00:01:27.900> from<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.200> alternator<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.640> what<00:01:30.360> that

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
power from the alternator and what that

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.800 
power from the alternator and what that
does<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.259> distribute<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.670> power<00:01:33.360> from<00:01:33.750> your

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
does is distribute the power from your

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.450 
does is distribute the power from your
alternator<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.890> both<00:01:35.759> batteries<00:01:36.450> okay

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
alternator to both batteries okay

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.620 
alternator to both batteries okay
obviously<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.150> charge<00:01:39.360> number

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
obviously it's going to charge number

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.770 
obviously it's going to charge number
one<00:01:39.900> first<00:01:40.670> then<00:01:41.670> once<00:01:41.909> that's<00:01:42.090> charged

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
one first then once that's charged

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.649 
one first then once that's charged
that's<00:01:42.990> your<00:01:43.170> prime<00:01:43.920> start<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.850> battery<00:01:45.240> once

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that's your prime start and battery once

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.929 
that's your prime start and battery once
that's<00:01:45.899> charged<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.130> turn<00:01:47.399> around<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
that's charged it will turn around and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.490 
that's charged it will turn around and
charge<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:48.840> second<00:01:49.380> battery<00:01:50.540> okay<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.259> when

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
charge your second battery okay so when

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
charge your second battery okay so when
your<00:01:52.649> vehicle<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.189> off<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:55.439> tells<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.070> battery

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
your vehicle is off it tells the battery

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.350 
your vehicle is off it tells the battery
number<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:58.079> right<00:01:58.320> you're<00:01:58.500> done<00:01:59.240> then<00:02:00.240> it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
number one all right you're done then it

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.810 
number one all right you're done then it
runs<00:02:00.479> off<00:02:00.750> number<00:02:01.140> two<00:02:01.399> okay<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.610> keeps

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
runs off number two okay so that keeps

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.289 
runs off number two okay so that keeps
you<00:02:06.090> from<00:02:06.740> turning<00:02:07.740> down<00:02:08.069> your<00:02:08.520> main<00:02:08.729> battery

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:18.030 

an<00:02:13.299> isolator<00:02:16.290> pretty<00:02:17.290> good<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.590> have<00:02:17.769> this

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
an isolator pretty good to have this

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.960 
an isolator pretty good to have this
cost<00:02:18.400> me<00:02:18.810> 40<00:02:19.810> bucks<00:02:19.840> on<00:02:20.260> eBay<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.849> will

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
cost me 40 bucks on eBay and it will

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.240 
cost me 40 bucks on eBay and it will
ship<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.330> me<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:25.680> obviously<00:02:26.680> we<00:02:27.069> all<00:02:27.220> know

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.220 
ship to me and obviously we all know
that<00:02:27.790> you're<00:02:28.060> not<00:02:28.180> going<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.450> be<00:02:28.569> an<00:02:28.690> isolator

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
that you're not going to be an isolator

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.089 
that you're not going to be an isolator
with<00:02:29.530> solar

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
with solar

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.479 
with solar
I<00:02:30.129> mean<00:02:30.790> solar<00:02:31.150> takes<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.569> while<00:02:32.310> isolator<00:02:33.310> you

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
I mean solar takes a while isolator you

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.369 
I mean solar takes a while isolator you
charge<00:02:33.760> about<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.150> up<00:02:34.269> in<00:02:34.360> 15-20<00:02:35.079> minutes

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
charge about it up in 15-20 minutes

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.020 
charge about it up in 15-20 minutes
being<00:02:36.069> over<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.370> lot<00:02:36.549> later
