00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.580 
bit extra so it's really quite well
and<00:03:34.450> otherwise<00:03:34.810> let's<00:03:35.080> just<00:03:35.260> check<00:03:35.350> out<00:03:35.500> the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
and otherwise let's just check out the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.530 
and otherwise let's just check out the
camera<00:03:35.940> starting<00:03:36.940> with<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.150> front<00:03:37.330> camera

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
camera starting with the front camera

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.360 
camera starting with the front camera
which<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:37.990> with<00:03:38.170> VGA<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:38.770> course<00:03:38.980> not<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.190> best

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
which is with VGA of course not the best

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.610 
which is with VGA of course not the best
quality<00:03:39.490> also<00:03:40.300> a<00:03:40.330> little<00:03:40.570> bit<00:03:40.660> slow<00:03:40.990> but<00:03:41.200> only

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
quality also a little bit slow but only

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.160 
quality also a little bit slow but only
because<00:03:41.980> it's<00:03:42.220> track<00:03:42.520> tracking<00:03:43.030> my<00:03:43.150> face<00:03:43.420> so

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
because it's track tracking my face so

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.380 
because it's track tracking my face so
you<00:03:44.920> can<00:03:45.130> see<00:03:45.310> when<00:03:45.430> I'm<00:03:45.520> smiling<00:03:45.820> or<00:03:46.120> when<00:03:46.270> I'm

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
you can see when I'm smiling or when I'm

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.010 
you can see when I'm smiling or when I'm
not<00:03:46.480> smiling

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
not smiling

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.520 
not smiling
and<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:47.590> we<00:03:47.680> can<00:03:47.860> shoot<00:03:48.150> easier<00:03:49.150> pictures<00:03:49.630> but

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
and so we can shoot easier pictures but

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.660 
and so we can shoot easier pictures but
when<00:03:50.680> we<00:03:50.770> look<00:03:50.890> at<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.070> back<00:03:51.220> camera<00:03:51.430> that's

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
when we look at the back camera that's

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.750 
when we look at the back camera that's
actually<00:03:51.820> quite<00:03:52.270> good<00:03:53.040> terms<00:03:54.040> of<00:03:54.190> wide-angle

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
actually quite good terms of wide-angle

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.740 
actually quite good terms of wide-angle
and<00:03:55.140> quality<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.440> speed<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.550> also<00:03:57.750> totally

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
and quality and speed is also totally

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.230 
and quality and speed is also totally
acceptable<00:03:59.460> so<00:04:00.460> this<00:04:00.610> was<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:00.760> really<00:04:00.970> short

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
acceptable so this was a really short

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.410 
acceptable so this was a really short
hands-on<00:04:01.630> with<00:04:01.780> about<00:04:02.380> 150<00:04:02.830> a<00:04:03.220> US<00:04:03.820> dollar<00:04:04.120> a

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.860 
is called a waterphone smart or torille
torille<00:04:08.680> because<00:04:09.610> we<00:04:09.760> have<00:04:09.940> forge<00:04:10.360> inside

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
torille because we have forge inside

torille because we have forge inside
with<00:04:11.110> notable<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:12.100> would<00:04:12.310> be<00:04:12.430> probably<00:04:12.700> only

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
with notable it would be probably only
