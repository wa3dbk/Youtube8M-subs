00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
spray pressure and we're hoping that

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.910 
spray pressure and we're hoping that

noticed<00:02:09.709> about<00:02:09.829> the<00:02:10.070> install<00:02:10.459> this<00:02:11.329> bolt

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
noticed about the install this bolt

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.920 
noticed about the install this bolt
located<00:02:12.290> here<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.459> bit<00:02:13.940> temperamental<00:02:14.239> when

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
located here is a bit temperamental when

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.410 
located here is a bit temperamental when
I<00:02:14.959> first<00:02:15.410> installed<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:16.280> has<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:17.030> really<00:02:17.329> be

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
I first installed it has to really be

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.180 
I first installed it has to really be
screwed<00:02:17.720> down<00:02:17.900> tight<00:02:17.959> so<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.530> may<00:02:18.739> not<00:02:18.769> be<00:02:18.950> as

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
screwed down tight so it may not be as

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.340 
screwed down tight so it may not be as
mobile<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:20.269> adjust<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:21.769> way<00:02:21.980> as<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:24.230> may

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
mobile to adjust this way as you may

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.970 
mobile to adjust this way as you may
think<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:25.570> originally<00:02:26.570> fell<00:02:26.840> down<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.470> slammed

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
think I originally fell down and slammed

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.069 
think I originally fell down and slammed
into<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.459> wall<00:02:28.640> after<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.299> first<00:02:29.570> use<00:02:29.810> when<00:02:30.049> I

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
into the wall after the first use when I

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.720 
into the wall after the first use when I
turned<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:30.650> just<00:02:31.070> something<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.489> note

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
turned it on so just something to note

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.490 
turned it on so just something to note
that<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:32.060> puppy's<00:02:32.600> got<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.870> be<00:02:32.930> pretty<00:02:33.170> tight

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
that that puppy's got to be pretty tight

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.979 
that that puppy's got to be pretty tight
in<00:02:34.070> order<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.340> function<00:02:34.610> properly<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.720> does

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
in order to function properly it does

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.020 
in order to function properly it does
rotate<00:02:36.410> even<00:02:36.890> when<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.130> have<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.489> locked<00:02:37.820> in

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
rotate even when you have this locked in

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.580 
rotate even when you have this locked in
place<00:02:38.329> there's<00:02:38.570> another<00:02:38.810> pull<00:02:39.110> behind<00:02:39.260> here

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
place there's another pull behind here

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.530 
place there's another pull behind here
that<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.769> saw<00:02:39.950> earlier<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.850> does<00:02:41.090> still<00:02:41.360> do

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
that you saw earlier it does still do

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.240 
that you saw earlier it does still do
this<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.110> that's<00:02:42.230> pretty<00:02:42.530> fun<00:02:42.829> so<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.100> can

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
this so that's pretty fun so you can

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.039 
this so that's pretty fun so you can
just<00:02:43.489> like<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.700> normal<00:02:44.120> head<00:02:44.329> to<00:02:44.900> your

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
just like a normal head to your

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.190 
just like a normal head to your
convenience<00:02:45.709> in<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:46.040> manner<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.000> that's<00:02:47.959> the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
convenience in that manner so that's the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.140 
convenience in that manner so that's the
install<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.859> actually<00:02:49.070> really<00:02:49.459> like<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.970> can

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
install I actually really like it I can

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.210 
install I actually really like it I can
tell<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:50.420> for<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.690> fact<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:51.049> it<00:02:51.260> especially

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
tell you for a fact that it especially

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.130 
tell you for a fact that it especially
the<00:02:52.430> one<00:02:52.579> that's<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.910> center<00:02:53.329> jet<00:02:53.600> here<00:02:53.930> that

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
the one that's the center jet here that

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.199 
the one that's the center jet here that
setting<00:02:54.500> really<00:02:55.280> improves<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.980> pressure<00:02:58.209> the

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
setting really improves the pressure the

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.550 
setting really improves the pressure the
other<00:02:59.239> settings<00:02:59.630> are<00:02:59.720> great<00:02:59.900> too<00:03:00.109> if<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.320> if

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
other settings are great too if you if

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.900 
other settings are great too if you if
you<00:03:00.680> kind<00:03:00.859> of<00:03:00.890> like<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.160> rain<00:03:01.340> thing<00:03:01.670> there's

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910

a one

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.890 
a one
just<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.370> puffer<00:03:03.849> of<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.270> holes<00:03:04.480> around<00:03:04.810> the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
just a puffer of the holes around the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.030 
just a puffer of the holes around the
edge<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.440> really<00:03:05.620> kind<00:03:05.770> of<00:03:05.830> gives

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
edge and that it really kind of gives

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.880 
edge and that it really kind of gives
you<00:03:06.099> a<00:03:06.489> nice<00:03:07.120> wide<00:03:07.540> effect<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.440> that's<00:03:08.590> good
