hey<00:00:05.520> guys<00:00:05.759> today<00:00:06.630> on<00:00:06.690> 1159<00:00:07.440> videos<00:00:07.830> I'm<00:00:08.219> going

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
hey guys today on 1159 videos I'm going

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.160 
hey guys today on 1159 videos I'm going
to<00:00:08.580> show<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.790> how<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.000> check<00:00:09.269> your<00:00:09.330> coils<00:00:09.900> this

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
to show you how to check your coils this

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.530 
to show you how to check your coils this
work<00:00:10.440> on<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.650> Chevy's<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.400> Fords<00:00:11.820> this

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
work on the Chevy's and the Fords this

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.339 
work on the Chevy's and the Fords this
is<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.929> 1995<00:00:13.889> Chevy<00:00:14.370> with<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.790> 4.3<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:16.170> that

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
is a 1995 Chevy with the 4.3 but that

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.560 
is a 1995 Chevy with the 4.3 but that
coil<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.890> used<00:00:17.130> on<00:00:17.340> all<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.760> other<00:00:17.910> Chevy's<00:00:18.360> as

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
coil is used on all the other Chevy's as

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.070 
coil is used on all the other Chevy's as
well

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
well

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.260 
well
so<00:00:19.440> what<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.770> did<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.250> made<00:00:20.550> two<00:00:20.820> little<00:00:20.850> pieces

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
so what I did I made two little pieces

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.060 
so what I did I made two little pieces
of<00:00:21.480> wire<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.990> they<00:00:22.109> go<00:00:22.260> down<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.680> there's<00:00:22.890> for

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
of wire so they go down and there's for

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.670 
of wire so they go down and there's for
my<00:00:23.240> ohmmeter<00:00:24.240> will<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:25.020> gauge<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
my ohmmeter will the gauge are the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.759 
my ohmmeter will the gauge are the
meters<00:00:25.980> will<00:00:26.760> fit<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.090> there<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.560> you<00:00:28.560> pretty

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
meters will fit in there and you pretty

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.950 
meters will fit in there and you pretty
much<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.010> touch<00:00:29.340> them<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.910> come<00:00:30.810> up

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
much just touch them like that come up

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.959 
much just touch them like that come up
here<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.230> read<00:00:31.349> your<00:00:31.590> got<00:00:31.769> engaged<00:00:31.969> this

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
here and read your got engaged this

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.439 
here and read your got engaged this
one's<00:00:33.269> about<00:00:33.449> 1.3<00:00:34.199> your<00:00:35.069> ideal<00:00:35.579> readings<00:00:36.149> on

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
one's about 1.3 your ideal readings on

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.399 
one's about 1.3 your ideal readings on
these<00:00:36.749> is<00:00:37.159> pretty<00:00:38.159> much<00:00:38.399> point<00:00:38.760> three<00:00:39.299> to<00:00:40.139> one

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:40.409 
these is pretty much point three to one

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.950 
these is pretty much point three to one
Ohm's<00:00:40.710> now<00:00:41.639> if<00:00:42.299> it's<00:00:42.479> a<00:00:42.539> little<00:00:42.719> bit<00:00:42.839> on<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
Ohm's now if it's a little bit on the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.559 
Ohm's now if it's a little bit on the
high<00:00:43.079> side<00:00:43.109> that's<00:00:43.679> okay<00:00:44.339> but<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.389> don't

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:45.569 
high side that's okay but what you don't

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:47.779 
high side that's okay but what you don't
want<00:00:45.749> it<00:00:45.839> to<00:00:45.959> be<00:00:46.109> is<00:00:46.319> on<00:00:46.679> the<00:00:46.829> low<00:00:46.979> side<00:00:47.339> if<00:00:47.639> it's

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
want it to be is on the low side if it's

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.020 
want it to be is on the low side if it's
under<00:00:47.999> 0.3<00:00:48.839> then<00:00:49.440> what<00:00:49.769> you<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.339> bad<00:00:50.579> open

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
under 0.3 then what you have a bad open

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.079 
under 0.3 then what you have a bad open
coil<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.809> no<00:00:51.959> good<00:00:52.760> go<00:00:53.760> ahead<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.999> unplug

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
coil it's no good go ahead and unplug

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.169 
coil it's no good go ahead and unplug
where<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> spark<00:00:54.899> plug<00:00:55.139> goes<00:00:55.760> or<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.819> cap

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
where the spark plug goes or the cap

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.750 
where the spark plug goes or the cap
right<00:00:57.479> there<00:00:57.739> undo<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.219> goes<00:00:59.369> up<00:00:59.579> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
right there undo that that goes up to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.389 
right there undo that that goes up to
your<00:00:59.789> your<00:01:00.629> cap<00:01:00.899> sometimes<00:01:01.889> you<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.190> also

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
your your cap sometimes you can also

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.520 
your your cap sometimes you can also
come<00:01:02.729> up<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:02.999> to<00:01:03.179> your<00:01:03.269> cap<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.379> can

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
come up here to your cap and you can

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.130 
come up here to your cap and you can
undo<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.219> that<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.939> hold<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> about

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
undo it like that and hold it about

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
undo it like that and hold it about
now-no<00:01:07.649> inch<00:01:07.979> inch<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.460> half<00:01:08.490> away<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
now-no inch inch and a half away and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.789 
now-no inch inch and a half away and
make<00:01:09.570> sure<00:01:09.719> I<00:01:09.750> think<00:01:10.049> those<00:01:10.259> are<00:01:10.289> pretty<00:01:10.560> good

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
make sure I think those are pretty good

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.160 
make sure I think those are pretty good
zap<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.430> careful<00:01:11.789> because<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.020> if<00:01:13.020> you're

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
zap just be careful because I if you're

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.069 
zap just be careful because I if you're
touching<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.649> metal<00:01:14.549> somewhere<00:01:15.060> you'll<00:01:15.869> get

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
touching the metal somewhere you'll get

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.749 
touching the metal somewhere you'll get
zapped<00:01:16.350> yourself<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.189> don't<00:01:17.399> want<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> do

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
zapped yourself so you don't want to do

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.980 
zapped yourself so you don't want to do
that<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.090> don't<00:01:18.149> want<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.359> become<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.719> ground

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
that you don't want to become the ground

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.109 
that you don't want to become the ground
I<00:01:19.259> usually<00:01:20.039> use<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> pair<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.490> pliers<00:01:20.579> that's

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
I usually use a pair of pliers that's

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.760 
I usually use a pair of pliers that's
got<00:01:21.299> rubber<00:01:21.570> handles<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.469> that<00:01:22.649> way<00:01:22.740> I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
got rubber handles on it so that way I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.130 
got rubber handles on it so that way I
don't<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.219> zapped<00:01:23.520> other<00:01:24.179> than<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.810> that's

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
don't get zapped other than that that's

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.370 
don't get zapped other than that that's
your<00:01:25.439> coil<00:01:25.740> explained<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.579> the<00:01:26.609> Ford<00:01:27.090> now<00:01:27.450> your

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
your coil explained on the Ford now your

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.120 
your coil explained on the Ford now your
Ford<00:01:28.770> coil<00:01:29.670> ohms<00:01:29.969> should<00:01:30.659> be

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
Ford coil ohms should be

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.510 
Ford coil ohms should be
0.4<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.159> above<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.299> okay<00:01:33.749> if<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.679> under<00:01:35.100> 0.4

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
0.4 or above is okay if it's under 0.4

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.989 
0.4 or above is okay if it's under 0.4
you<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> bad<00:01:36.689> coil<00:01:37.219> so<00:01:38.219> that's<00:01:38.429> the<00:01:38.700> Ford

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
you have a bad coil so that's the Ford

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.630 
you have a bad coil so that's the Ford
side<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.539> it<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.810> anyways<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.979> your<00:01:41.159> coulombs

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
side of it so anyways that your coulombs

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.530 
side of it so anyways that your coulombs
explained<00:01:42.450> hope<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.079> enjoyed<00:01:43.350> it
