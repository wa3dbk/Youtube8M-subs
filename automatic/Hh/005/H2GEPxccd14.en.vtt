Tuesday so almost a week ago and yeah it
was<00:00:22.510> an<00:00:22.869> experience<00:00:23.260> as<00:00:23.500> I<00:00:23.530> say

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
was an experience as I say

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.970 
was an experience as I say
nonetheless<00:00:25.090> really<00:00:25.840> was<00:00:25.990> interesting<00:00:26.740> and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
nonetheless really was interesting and

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.260 
nonetheless really was interesting and
so<00:00:27.760> basically<00:00:28.240> what<00:00:28.480> it's<00:00:28.660> like<00:00:28.840> it's<00:00:30.270> strange

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
so basically what it's like it's strange

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.470 
so basically what it's like it's strange
it's<00:00:31.600> basically<00:00:32.169> a<00:00:32.699> filling<00:00:33.699> but<00:00:33.910> more<00:00:34.210> than<00:00:34.420> a

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
it's basically a filling but more than a

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.149 
it's basically a filling but more than a
feeling<00:00:34.840> that<00:00:35.079> makes<00:00:35.319> sense<00:00:35.530> like<00:00:35.800> they<00:00:35.979> put

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:36.159 
feeling that makes sense like they put

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.309 
feeling that makes sense like they put
them<00:00:36.370> it's<00:00:37.210> really<00:00:37.479> weird<00:00:37.719> they<00:00:37.929> put<00:00:38.109> like<00:00:38.260> a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:38.319 
them it's really weird they put like a

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:41.250 
them it's really weird they put like a
mask<00:00:39.059> over<00:00:40.059> your<00:00:40.510> mouth

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
mask over your mouth

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.369 
mask over your mouth
it's<00:00:41.440> like<00:00:42.149> elasticated<00:00:43.149> masking<00:00:43.989> over<00:00:44.170> your

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
it's like elasticated masking over your

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.590 
it's like elasticated masking over your
mouth<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:45.249> that<00:00:45.280> none<00:00:45.550> on<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.760> bleach<00:00:45.969> gets<00:00:46.359> in

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
mouth so that none on the bleach gets in

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.539 
mouth so that none on the bleach gets in
because<00:00:47.019> they've<00:00:47.170> put<00:00:47.379> bleach<00:00:47.589> in<00:00:47.620> to<00:00:48.249> kill

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:48.549 
because they've put bleach in to kill

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:51.090 
because they've put bleach in to kill
the<00:00:48.699> nerve<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:50.170> Keynote<00:00:50.649> eyes<00:00:50.859> and

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
something more sensitive than it was

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.560 
something more sensitive than it was
before<00:01:20.230> when<00:01:20.890> I<00:01:21.280> realized<00:01:21.820> I<00:01:22.120> needed<00:01:22.150> to<00:01:22.390> get

night that was the decay got in between

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.680 
night that was the decay got in between
two<00:01:34.810> foot<00:01:35.140> old<00:01:35.410> fillings<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:37.210> didn't<00:01:37.540> feel

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
two foot old fillings and I didn't feel

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.780 
two foot old fillings and I didn't feel
anything<00:01:38.230> except<00:01:38.920> when<00:01:39.070> I<00:01:39.130> used<00:01:39.310> might<00:01:39.550> wash

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
anything except when I used might wash

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.450 
anything except when I used might wash
and<00:01:40.120> that<00:01:40.780> was<00:01:40.930> only<00:01:41.080> like<00:01:41.350> tree<00:01:41.650> tree<00:01:42.190> four

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
and that was only like tree tree four

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.750 
and that was only like tree tree four
weeks<00:01:42.670> ago<00:01:42.940> now<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:44.190> yeah<00:01:45.190> I<00:01:45.220> thought<00:01:45.700> that

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
weeks ago now and yeah I thought that

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.700 
weeks ago now and yeah I thought that
was<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.150> bit<00:01:46.360> strange<00:01:46.570> I<00:01:46.750> just<00:01:46.960> didn't<00:01:47.170> feel<00:01:47.350> any

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
was a bit strange I just didn't feel any

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.380 
was a bit strange I just didn't feel any
pain<00:01:47.860> or<00:01:48.490> anything<00:01:48.670> or<00:01:48.820> that<00:01:49.000> worries<00:01:49.240> now

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
pain or anything or that worries now

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.750 
pain or anything or that worries now
it's<00:01:49.600> quite<00:01:49.930> sensitive<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.830> I'm<00:01:51.280> definitely

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
it's quite sensitive and I'm definitely

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.899 
it's quite sensitive and I'm definitely
aware<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:53.440> so<00:01:54.220> it's<00:01:54.340> obvious<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.730> right

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
aware of it so it's obvious to you right

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.770 
aware of it so it's obvious to you right
here<00:01:55.180> um<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:57.159> yeah<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:57.909> now<00:01:58.270> it's<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.600> bit<00:01:58.750> more

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
here um but yeah so now it's a bit more

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.630 
here um but yeah so now it's a bit more
painful<00:01:59.440> it's<00:01:59.560> nothing<00:01:59.860> too<00:02:00.070> bad<00:02:00.340> or<00:02:00.550> anything

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
painful it's nothing too bad or anything

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.080 
painful it's nothing too bad or anything
like<00:02:00.970> that<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.650> probably<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:03.040> worst<00:02:03.280> part<00:02:03.729> is

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
like that and probably the worst part is

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.080 
like that and probably the worst part is
sitting<00:02:04.600> there<00:02:04.750> guiding<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.500> injections<00:02:06.100> for

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
sitting there guiding the injections for

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.630 
sitting there guiding the injections for
me<00:02:07.390> they<00:02:07.720> don't<00:02:07.870> hurt<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.619> much<00:02:08.860> for<00:02:09.399> some

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
me they don't hurt that much for some

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.910 
me they don't hurt that much for some
