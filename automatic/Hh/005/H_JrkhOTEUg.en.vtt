definite better way to take penalties I

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.130 
definite better way to take penalties I
think<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.180> keep<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.540> calm<00:02:51.780> head

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
think you have to keep that calm head

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.470 
think you have to keep that calm head
and<00:02:52.440> then<00:02:52.560> it's<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.800> mental<00:02:53.100> game<00:02:53.210> hi<00:02:54.210> there

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
and then it's a mental game hi there

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.940 
and then it's a mental game hi there
there<00:02:54.720> are<00:02:54.750> some<00:02:55.230> opportunities<00:02:55.470> where<00:02:55.860> you

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
there are some opportunities where you

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.110 
there are some opportunities where you
can<00:02:56.190> put<00:02:56.400> yourself<00:02:56.700> in<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.820> better<00:02:56.970> situation

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
can put yourself in a better situation

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.030 
can put yourself in a better situation
to<00:02:57.570> block<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.110> penalty<00:02:58.440> kick<00:02:58.590> but<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:58.830> still

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
to block the penalty kick but you still

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.830 
to block the penalty kick but you still
got<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.220> guess<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.730> right<00:02:59.760> way<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.420> that's

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
got to guess the right way and that's

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.240 
got to guess the right way and that's
always<00:03:01.080> going<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.410> be<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.530> portion<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.100> it's

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
always going to be a portion of it it's

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.280 
always going to be a portion of it it's
like<00:03:02.370> playing<00:03:02.640> rock<00:03:03.000> paper<00:03:03.030> scissors<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.170> go
