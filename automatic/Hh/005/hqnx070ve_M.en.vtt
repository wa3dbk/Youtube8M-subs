people ask what's the best way to paint
a<00:00:06.299> foamy<00:00:06.540> well<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.440> best<00:00:07.649> way<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.040> found<00:00:08.400> a

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
a foamy well the best way that I found a

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.870 
a foamy well the best way that I found a
pane<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.849> foamy<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.929> use<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> product<00:00:10.740> by<00:00:11.550> mid

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
pane of foamy is to use a product by mid

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.209 
pane of foamy is to use a product by mid
wax<00:00:12.179> called<00:00:12.599> polycrylic<00:00:13.259> it's<00:00:13.740> pretty<00:00:14.009> well

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
wax called polycrylic it's pretty well

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.550 
wax called polycrylic it's pretty well
known<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.849> think<00:00:15.120> about<00:00:15.630> their<00:00:15.809> RC<00:00:16.109> community

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
known I think about their RC community

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.830 
known I think about their RC community
but<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:17.550> works<00:00:17.760> great<00:00:18.060> what<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.359> does<00:00:18.510> as<00:00:18.690> we

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
but it works great what it does as we

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.300 
but it works great what it does as we
know<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> propellants<00:00:19.710> or<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:19.949> eat<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
know the propellants or what eat the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.529 
know the propellants or what eat the
foam<00:00:20.660> in<00:00:22.010> on<00:00:23.010> planes<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.240> don't<00:00:24.330> want

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
foam in on planes and so you don't want

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.870 
foam in on planes and so you don't want
to<00:00:24.600> use<00:00:24.689> anything<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:25.460> unless<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.640> foam

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
to use anything with unless it's foam

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.580 
to use anything with unless it's foam
safe<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.660> propellant<00:00:28.230> unless<00:00:28.380> it's

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
safe and have propellant unless it's

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.099 
safe and have propellant unless it's
foam<00:00:28.830> safe<00:00:29.160> unless<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.240> put<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.510> polycrylic

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109

do<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.710> did<00:00:32.189> two<00:00:32.399> coats<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:32.969> painted<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.390> on

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
do I did two coats just painted it on

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.420 
do I did two coats just painted it on
it's<00:00:33.840> clear<00:00:34.020> what<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.469> does<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.829> strengthens

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it's clear what it does it strengthens

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.080 
it's clear what it does it strengthens
the<00:00:36.210> foam<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:37.500> get<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> lot<00:00:37.920> less<00:00:37.950> bending<00:00:38.940> out

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the foam you get a lot less bending out

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.180 
the foam you get a lot less bending out
of<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> wings<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:40.050> gives<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.440> nice<00:00:40.649> clean

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
of the wings it gives it a nice clean

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.060 
of the wings it gives it a nice clean
shiny<00:00:41.670> gloss<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.629> see<00:00:42.809> there<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.290> it

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
shiny gloss as you can see there and it

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.069 
shiny gloss as you can see there and it
fills<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.550> any<00:00:44.789> imperfections<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.750> your<00:00:45.870> phone

fills in any imperfections in your phone
that<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.670> naturally<00:00:47.670> will<00:00:48.000> probably<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.710> he

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
powerful engine than what the specs call

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.160 
powerful engine than what the specs call
for<00:01:13.830> want<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.460> strengthen<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> cowl<00:01:15.299> what

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
for want to strengthen up the cowl what

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.969 
for want to strengthen up the cowl what
I<00:01:16.200> did<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.610> inside<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.270> put<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.979> some

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
I did on the inside was put in some

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.640 
I did on the inside was put in some
fiberglass<00:01:20.750> fabric<00:01:21.750> around<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.110> edges<00:01:22.439> and

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
fiberglass fabric around the edges and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.609 
fiberglass fabric around the edges and
then<00:01:23.280> put<00:01:23.580> some<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> dead<00:01:24.689> epoxy<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.380> top

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
then put some of the dead epoxy up top

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.920 
then put some of the dead epoxy up top
here<00:01:25.950> fifteen<00:01:26.729> minute<00:01:26.970> epoxy<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.689> then<00:01:27.840> on

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
here fifteen minute epoxy and then on

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.109 
here fifteen minute epoxy and then on
the<00:01:28.020> bottom<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.530> did<00:01:28.740> some<00:01:29.700> more<00:01:29.820> fiberglass

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the bottom I did some more fiberglass

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.410 
the bottom I did some more fiberglass
tape<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.170> instead<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.650> epoxy<00:01:31.979> which<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.329> know

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
tape and instead of epoxy which you know

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
tape and instead of epoxy which you know
you<00:01:33.479> only<00:01:33.630> got<00:01:33.810> 10<00:01:34.140> minutes<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.829> 12<00:01:35.100> minutes<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
you only got 10 minutes of 12 minutes to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.679 
you only got 10 minutes of 12 minutes to
work<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.850> it

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
work with it

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.830 
work with it
it<00:01:37.079> dries<00:01:37.350> quick<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.040> heavy<00:01:38.479> what<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> found

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it dries quick it's heavy what I found

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.370 
it dries quick it's heavy what I found
what<00:01:40.020> works<00:01:40.229> excellent<00:01:40.799> instead<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.340> epoxy<00:01:41.670> is

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
what works excellent instead of epoxy is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.020 
what works excellent instead of epoxy is
once<00:01:43.380> again<00:01:43.680> that's<00:01:43.829> polycrylic<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.880> could

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
once again that's polycrylic you could

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.280 
once again that's polycrylic you could
paint<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.479> there<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:45.930> more<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.259> a

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
paint it on there it's more like a

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.920 
paint it on there it's more like a
watery<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.579> water<00:01:47.759> base<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.630> you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
watery it's a water base so it's you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
watery it's a water base so it's you
know<00:01:49.049> more<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.380> liquid<00:01:49.770> form<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.399> work<00:01:50.549> with

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
know more of a liquid form to work with

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.920 
know more of a liquid form to work with
and<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.270> down<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.659> there<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and you get down and there on the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.420 
and you get down and there on the
crevices<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.680> paint<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.130> with<00:01:53.310> your

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
crevices we can paint it on with your

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.300 
crevices we can paint it on with your
brush<00:01:53.720> paint<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.229> fiberglass<00:01:55.649> put<00:01:56.189> it

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
brush paint it on the fiberglass put it

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.730 
brush paint it on the fiberglass put it
in<00:01:56.430> there<00:01:56.640> slop<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.750> all<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.079> there<00:01:58.200> let<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.500> dry

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
in there slop it all in there let it dry

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.889 
in there slop it all in there let it dry
and<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.189> just<00:01:59.460> stiffens<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> heck<00:02:00.450> out<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> it

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
and it just stiffens the heck out of it

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.039 
and it just stiffens the heck out of it
so<00:02:01.079> that's<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.860> good<00:02:01.890> tip<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.689> which<00:02:03.689> will

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
so that's a good tip for that which will

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.959 
so that's a good tip for that which will
cause<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.920> not<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.219> vibration<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.790> lot<00:02:05.909> of

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
cause you to not have vibration a lot of

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.029 
cause you to not have vibration a lot of
people<00:02:06.180> get<00:02:06.329> vibration<00:02:07.049> up<00:02:07.170> here<00:02:07.350> over<00:02:07.860> time

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
people get vibration up here over time

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.440 
people get vibration up here over time
so<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.369> did<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> couple<00:02:08.789> even<00:02:09.149> small

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
so they did a couple even small

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.999 
so they did a couple even small
nosedives<00:02:09.929> or<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:10.619> they<00:02:10.709> have<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.860> really

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
nosedives or if they have a really

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.990 
nosedives or if they have a really
powerful<00:02:11.250> engine<00:02:11.760> up<00:02:11.879> front<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:13.110> stiff

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
powerful engine up front so stiff

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.630 
powerful engine up front so stiff
anyways<00:02:14.780> what<00:02:14.990> I'm<00:02:15.080> using<00:02:15.260> is<00:02:15.470> paint<00:02:15.740> is<00:02:16.580> uh

okay for 12 ounces as opposed to that
expensive<00:02:41.570> foam<00:02:41.990> safe<00:02:42.260> stuff<00:02:42.560> that's<00:02:42.830> very

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
expensive foam safe stuff that's very

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.430 
expensive foam safe stuff that's very
expensive<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.270> in<00:02:44.390> my<00:02:44.510> opinion<00:02:44.870> not<00:02:44.990> quite<00:02:45.290> as

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
expensive and in my opinion not quite as

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.500 
expensive and in my opinion not quite as
good<00:02:45.620> as<00:02:45.800> it's<00:02:46.640> doing<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.120> way<00:02:47.300> because

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
good as it's doing it this way because

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
good as it's doing it this way because
you're<00:02:47.960> having<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.490> extra<00:02:49.490> shell<00:02:50.090> here<00:02:50.530> when

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
you're having that extra shell here when

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.140 
you're having that extra shell here when
you<00:02:51.650> do<00:02:51.800> foam<00:02:52.070> safe<00:02:52.310> paint<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:52.730> naturally

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
you do foam safe paint you naturally

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.400 
you do foam safe paint you naturally
won't<00:02:53.360> have<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.510> extra<00:02:53.930> shell<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.260> won't

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
won't have that extra shell you won't

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.020 
won't have that extra shell you won't
need<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.590> do<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:55.040> because<00:02:55.250> your<00:02:55.580> paint<00:02:55.910> is

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
need to do that because your paint is

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.670 
need to do that because your paint is
foam<00:02:56.240> safe<00:02:56.570> but<00:02:56.870> doing<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.320> really

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
foam safe but doing that really

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.240 
foam safe but doing that really
strengthens<00:02:58.610> up<00:02:59.000> your<00:02:59.180> phone<00:02:59.920> anyways<00:03:00.920> but

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
strengthens up your phone anyways but

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.250 
strengthens up your phone anyways but
what<00:03:01.400> I'm<00:03:01.520> first<00:03:01.730> going<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:01.970> do<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.660> whole

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
what I'm first going to do is a whole

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.760 
what I'm first going to do is a whole
base<00:03:03.560> coat<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:04.100> gloss<00:03:04.730> white<00:03:05.120> that<00:03:05.930> will<00:03:06.140> fill

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
base coat of gloss white that will fill

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.280 
base coat of gloss white that will fill
in<00:03:06.950> any<00:03:07.130> imperfections<00:03:07.460> once<00:03:08.150> again<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.750> give

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
in any imperfections once again and give

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.920 
in any imperfections once again and give
you<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.440> nice<00:03:09.680> base<00:03:10.010> for<00:03:10.310> your<00:03:10.910> colors<00:03:11.210> to<00:03:11.240> go<00:03:11.540> on

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
you a nice base for your colors to go on

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.010 
you a nice base for your colors to go on
what<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.350> recommend<00:03:12.590> also<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.580> do<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.720> bottom

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
what I recommend also is do the bottom

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.350 
what I recommend also is do the bottom
of<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.170> wing<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:16.010> completely<00:03:16.760> different<00:03:16.970> color

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
of the wing a completely different color

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.510 
of the wing a completely different color
or<00:03:17.780> something<00:03:18.050> that<00:03:18.140> stands<00:03:18.440> out<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.220> bottom

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
or something that stands out the bottom

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.930 
or something that stands out the bottom
of<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.670> plane<00:03:19.940> as<00:03:20.150> well<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:21.860> that<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.100> can<00:03:22.280> for

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
of the plane as well so that you can for

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.600 
of the plane as well so that you can for
orientation<00:03:23.420> reasons<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:25.370> know<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.489> lot

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
orientation reasons and you know a lot

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.120 
orientation reasons and you know a lot
of<00:03:25.670> people<00:03:26.530> especially<00:03:27.530> if<00:03:27.830> you're<00:03:27.950> new<00:03:28.100> to

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
of people especially if you're new to

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.090 
of people especially if you're new to
the<00:03:28.310> sport<00:03:28.630> will<00:03:29.630> do<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.500> top<00:03:30.680> of<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:30.890> plane

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
the sport will do the top of the plane

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.130 
the sport will do the top of the plane
one<00:03:31.370> color<00:03:31.610> maybe<00:03:31.970> with<00:03:32.209> different<00:03:32.750> colors<00:03:32.959> on

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
one color maybe with different colors on

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.330 
one color maybe with different colors on
the<00:03:33.230> edge<00:03:33.320> of<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.560> wings<00:03:33.739> for<00:03:33.950> orientation

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
the edge of the wings for orientation

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.250 
the edge of the wings for orientation
and<00:03:34.700> then<00:03:35.270> a<00:03:35.300> different<00:03:35.510> color<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.080> bottom

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
and then a different color on the bottom

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.990 
and then a different color on the bottom
of<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.530> plane<00:03:36.739> but<00:03:37.250> what<00:03:37.400> they<00:03:37.550> forget<00:03:37.940> is

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
of the plane but what they forget is

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.140 
of the plane but what they forget is
that's<00:03:38.780> just<00:03:38.930> top<00:03:39.800> orientation<00:03:40.670> bottom

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
that's just top orientation bottom

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.020 
that's just top orientation bottom
orientation<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:42.320> gotta<00:03:42.920> remember<00:03:43.190> also<00:03:43.519> left

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
orientation you gotta remember also left

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.940 
orientation you gotta remember also left
or<00:03:44.239> right<00:03:44.420> orientation<00:03:44.660> so<00:03:45.620> what<00:03:45.739> I'm<00:03:45.830> gonna

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
or right orientation so what I'm gonna

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.440 
or right orientation so what I'm gonna
do<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:47.320> stripes<00:03:48.320> just<00:03:48.800> on<00:03:49.010> one<00:03:49.310> edge<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.330> the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
do is stripes just on one edge of the

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.570 
do is stripes just on one edge of the
wing<00:03:50.630> so<00:03:51.380> it's<00:03:51.560> gonna<00:03:51.680> be<00:03:51.920> floor<00:03:52.370> all

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
wing so it's gonna be floor all

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.340 
wing so it's gonna be floor all
fluorescent<00:03:53.209> bottom<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:53.840> I'll<00:03:53.930> know<00:03:54.080> it's<00:03:54.230> the

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
fluorescent bottom so I'll know it's the

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.259 
fluorescent bottom so I'll know it's the
bottom<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:54.890> then<00:03:55.340> I'm<00:03:55.430> just<00:03:55.459> gonna<00:03:55.700> do<00:03:55.940> black

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
bottom and then I'm just gonna do black

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.380 
bottom and then I'm just gonna do black
stripes<00:03:57.080> on<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:58.010> right<00:03:58.190> side<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:58.489> I'll<00:03:59.209> know

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
stripes on the right side so I'll know

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.850 
stripes on the right side so I'll know
okay<00:03:59.720> I'm<00:03:59.810> looking<00:03:59.900> at<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.260> bottom<00:04:00.590> right

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
okay I'm looking at the bottom right

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.580 
okay I'm looking at the bottom right
side<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.610> that<00:04:02.480> works<00:04:02.720> really<00:04:02.900> well<00:04:03.170> in<00:04:03.380> my

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
side and that works really well in my

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.140 
side and that works really well in my
opinion<00:04:03.890> this<00:04:04.070> is<00:04:04.130> my<00:04:04.310> first<00:04:04.580> build<00:04:04.880> learning

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
opinion this is my first build learning

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.729 
opinion this is my first build learning
a<00:04:05.390> lot<00:04:05.570> so<00:04:05.810> we'll<00:04:05.900> see<00:04:06.110> what<00:04:06.200> happens
