00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.670
 abandoned to stay with her 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.850

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.019

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.120
 Hello, you are new here, true 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.460
 I was walking for a while and in the distance I saw 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.519
 a mansion and I went to see it and 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.469
 here I find you and by the way I'm 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.570
 looking for a person to take care of my 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.820
 mansion for a day in what I'm about 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.580
 trip if you want you can take care of it and 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.670
 reward I will give you 64 diamonds 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.330

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.190

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.190
 I'll be back tomorrow is fine 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.500
 now I will enter the mansion to check 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.490
 how is it inside the safest thing is that 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.490
 be very luxurious 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.619
 and check everything below now let's 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.399
 see the top part to see what it is 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.399
 That we meet 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.510
 a portal that will make that portal in this 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.790
 mansion this portal is kind of weird but 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.960
 I'll still go in to see where it takes me 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.960
 I hope it works 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.540
 that where I am because it's night 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.460
 and who are you, we were waiting for you 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.470
 cj where I am you are in another dimension 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.600
 the portal where you came in brought you up 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.850
 here and since a year ago we were waiting for your 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.460
 arrival my arrival 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.340
 perhaps they knew that he would come but as 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.490
 it is possible that hahaha is that you are the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.040
 unique that can save our dimension 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.260
 save its dimension if I look I explain 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.209
 a year ago there was a curse in this 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.700
 dimension which is that all the time 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.040
 It's night and you can only break if you 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.980
 meet the following kill 50 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.860
 clippers 25 skeletons and 10 zombies 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.290
 only with a stick and because another 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.420
 person does not do all that is that many 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.520
 they have tried but they all end 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.070
 dying and you are the only one who can 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.980
 do all this because of that we trust in you 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.600
 it's okay I will help you break this 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.950
 curse very well 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.950
 come with me please 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.980
 look in this box is your equipment 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.590
 which used to kill everyone 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.090
 those mods but only one thing if you get to 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.379
 fail in this mission 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.139
 you will stay forever in this 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.719
 dimension and you as you know that if it came to 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:48.209
 fail I stay in this dimension because 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:50.189
 I just like you enter through the portal 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.650
 that carries this dimension accept the 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.629
 mission but I failed and that's why 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.750
 I'm stuck in this dimension to 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.879
 always very good thanks for telling me that 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.769
 now I am more than motivated to 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.560
 fulfill this mission because I do not want 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.510
 get stuck in this dimension 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.969
 Good luck and I hope you will fulfill this 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.680
 mission because if you get to fulfill it I 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:13.980
 you will save and I will return to my dimension 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.599
 original but if you fail I will die and you 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.019
 you will be trapped in this dimension 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.269
 until another arrives and fulfills the mission 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.280
 it's fine I will not fail you and I will fulfill this 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.060
 mission to save you and to return to your 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.060
 original dimension 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.759
 now it will look for those mods to break the 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.830
 curse and save the warrior who is 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.740
 stuck in this dimension so that 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.770
 go back to its original dimension now what 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.620
 that I have to kill are 50 clippers 25 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.990
 skeletons and 10 zombies but how difficult 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.889
 is to find them because you can not see any 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.889
 trace of them
