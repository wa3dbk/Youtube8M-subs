00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 Hello everyone, Valery Minkin and you 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.900
 Today I decided to make a video about how 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:16.949
 collect the most popular patterns on 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:20.240
 Rubik's cube so let's get the first pattern 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.369
 will be called in our compartment 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.470
 what are we doing for this well any 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.109
 by the side it doesn't matter much 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.590
 but let's be the standard green for yourself 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.610
 white top and so what we do twice 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.610
 turn up 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:08.930
 and here we can see so beautiful 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:13.380
 the pattern that appeared on our peak 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.990
 pretty easy to do if u 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.100
 you will have this desire again this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.220
 formula can be memorized a 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.850
 you can just remember the movement 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:34.770
 or watch the video so now we 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:39.990
 we will collect a cube and so everything will be with us 5 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.320
 patterns and I will say again that this is one of 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.670
 the most popular pattern well, although few 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.979
 who likes to play them into cubes but 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.460
 anyway for beautiful pictures or 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.970
 just to make your eyes happy 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.930
 let's say so they can be done and so 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.910
 the next pattern will be called rub in 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.070
 cube which again is cube 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:10.070
 Well now all this will understand why 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.070
 so called and so what we do 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:38.510
 and see what we got pretty 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.180
 yet a beautiful pattern unusual which 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:49.050
 easy enough to do and it looks like 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:52.800
 so here is beautiful and so what we will do 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:56.010
 further well further pattern someone he 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.769
 will like someone not called 6 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.440
 as much as it is in all six countries 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.140
 we will be written as was such a little letter 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.560
 h well, I'll show it. This is one of the most 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.000
 light patterns all we do is 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.470
 double twist and each sides ie 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.310
 right 2 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:27.140
 his two up right torello 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:33.120
 them front and up down for the right 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:35.670
 front back to the right and here on the cubes 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.850
 appear so to speak letters as well or 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.190
 Russian letters n pretty beautiful 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.370
 little pattern 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.200
 Well, another pattern if we are still 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:55.250
 once we repeat all the movements that is 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:04:01.160
 right and left up right left down 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:05.880
 front with up and down back side 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:09.000
 right side front rear and 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.280
 right then we succeed at all 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.370
 here are the crosses here well or 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.760
 diagonal who as they call so well 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.100
 now 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.750
 let's collect one more pattern 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.870
 plain 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:30.160
 all you need to do for him is right 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.919
 twice left twice to turn it in 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:38.650
 and so on itself once more the same 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:41.380
 do and again on ourselves and we get 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.710
 exactly the same pattern but spending on it 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.880
 much less time but now all 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.130
 let's put it back the next pattern 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.419
 called eyes 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.180
 which is done by only four 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:05:02.199
 movements that we do omit 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:05.020
 middle side down and return and here 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.960
 on the cubes we like the center themselves 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.720
 swapped a in order for all 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.570
 bring back we just look here it is 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.000
 orange combine us orange and to 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.090
 it was a strip further omitted here it is 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.639
 green is combined with green but white 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.639
 combined with white well and then just 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.560
 raise middle layer 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:30.810
 so what else would you like to show you 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:36.280
 pattern I do not know whether you like it or not 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:46.380
 let's do it so frontal up neither 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:47.740
 down up up down up down up 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:54.449
 way down 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:57.330
 front so here so i am sorry 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.939
 Well , something turned out pretty 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.199
 beautiful but the pattern is not all ug a 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:05.699
 only on one side 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:08.999
 but no less a nice pattern on my 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:13.249
 a look but on this all huge 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:13.249
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
