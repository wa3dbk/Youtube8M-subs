thread and beads of your choice let's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.080 
thread and beads of your choice let's
get<00:00:22.800> started

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.670 

here<00:00:27.090> are<00:00:27.240> two<00:00:27.420> examples<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> Daisy

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
here are two examples of the Daisy

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.139 
here are two examples of the Daisy
stitch<00:00:29.240> one<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.599> using<00:00:31.019> larger<00:00:31.859> beads<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.759> one

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
stitch one is using larger beads and one

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.510 
stitch one is using larger beads and one
is<00:00:33.420> using<00:00:33.870> smaller<00:00:34.469> beads<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> same

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
is using smaller beads it's the same

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.610 
is using smaller beads it's the same
technique<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> wanted<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.020> show<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
technique but I wanted to show you the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.529 
technique but I wanted to show you the
difference<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.989> choosing<00:00:39.989> your<00:00:40.140> bead<00:00:40.440> size<00:00:44.539> so

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
difference in choosing your bead size so

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.270 
difference in choosing your bead size so
to<00:00:45.570> begin<00:00:45.870> our<00:00:46.110> Daisy<00:00:46.350> stitch<00:00:46.739> I'm<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
to begin our Daisy stitch I'm going to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310 
to begin our Daisy stitch I'm going to
be<00:00:47.399> using<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.850> stopper<00:00:48.360> bead<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.930> I'm<00:00:49.079> just

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
be using a stopper bead and I'm just

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.139 
be using a stopper bead and I'm just
going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.680> using<00:00:50.039> yellow<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.910> tell

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
going to be using yellow so you can tell

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.950 
going to be using yellow so you can tell
the<00:00:51.300> difference

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the difference

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.310 
the difference
so<00:00:52.559> we<00:00:52.710> want<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.949> thread<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:54.289> bring<00:00:55.289> it

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
so we want to thread that on bring it

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.660 
so we want to thread that on bring it
towards<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.949> bottom<00:00:56.510> then<00:00:57.510> go<00:00:57.719> right<00:00:57.960> back<00:00:57.989> up

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.380 

through<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> bead<00:01:02.940> again<00:01:04.189> which<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.850> loops

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
through the bead again which this loops

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.820 
through the bead again which this loops
your<00:01:07.020> bead<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.780> just<00:01:09.780> acts<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> stopper

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
your bead and just acts as a stopper

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.990 
your bead and just acts as a stopper
bead<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.490> temporary<00:01:11.909> bead<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.640> first

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
bead it's a temporary bead and the first

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.859 
bead it's a temporary bead and the first
we're<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.820> thread<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.570> three

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
we're going to thread on the three

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.020 
we're going to thread on the three
spacer<00:01:19.590> beads<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:20.250> are<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.759> this

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
spacer beads which are in this

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.969 
spacer beads which are in this
demonstration<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.350> green
