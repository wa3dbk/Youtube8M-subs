00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello girls in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.309
 teach how to make a look for 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.610
 beginners perfect to get out of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.610
 party 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.260
 I previously made a video for 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.510
 beginners and teach me how to apply 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.230
 the basis of the correctors and all that 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.230
 so this will be an eye makeup 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.230
 we start 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.420
 when we are going to do a make-up a 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.250
 little bit full of shadows we have to 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.590
 apply a base so everything looks 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.720
 better 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.000
 we will apply a shadow of a color 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.320
 neutral to make everything easier to 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.320
 blur in a little while 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.220
 then let's give it a little bit of 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.590
 depth to our eye with a shadow 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.250
 how is this coffee and we are going to apply it 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.370
 in what is the mobile eyelid but in the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.930
 end of our eyes we continue with a 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.300
 shadow that will be our color 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.850
 predominant in this look and we 're going to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.850
 put all our eyelid mobile 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.000
 then I'm going to grab this one that's a 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.490
 little bit darker and I'm going to start 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.950
 blur already what we put so that what 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.710
 let's transfer and there is that color 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.869
 of transition so all beautiful and not left 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.759
 a line so marked in color until 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.700
 where we ended up putting it but from 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.560
 all as well as a single color one 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.689
 degradation that I feel that looks very 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.780
 nice and that's the trick of the shadows 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.340
 girls blur now with this brown 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.890
 which is a little bit darker, we're going to 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.600
 grab and we will give more dimension in 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.209
 the end of our eyes and that's going to 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.610
 make it look a little bit taken 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.470
 but this is not a smoky eye if it is not 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.789
 an eye like that with a little more color 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.220
 so that we can learn the 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.770
 techniques we grab and we're going to apply the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.959
 eyeliner in our eyes and always 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.479
 I feel it is easier to make the tail 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.159
 of cat with gel eyeliner so 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.959
 I will do using the gel liner 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.959
 for the tail of cat 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.140
 Y 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.030
 once we finish this step we are going to 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.400
 apply the mascara because the mascara is going 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.400
 to give a super feminine look 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.700
 if you want to learn how to put tabs 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.800
 I will leave you below in the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.130
 information box a link step to 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.870
 I like to pass and blur again 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.050
 the shadows a little to make sure 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.810
 that everything is well blurred and then not 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.030
 you can forget to put cream on 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.040
 lower lashes so that they open 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.140
 the eyes and see the look so more 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.100
 pretty on the lips I'm going to wear a 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.320
 skin color lipstick for mom to give it to you 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.870
 the eyes and I like two favorites of 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.640
 gerard cosmetics that down I'm going to 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.550
 leaving a code is always important 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.020
 put bronzer because it clarifies that you 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.320
 face looks like a little more 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.690
 skinniest tanned and prettiest 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.340
 so I'm a fan of the sunscreen and 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.739
 that's all girls saw that it's not so 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.110
 difficult I hope you liked this 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.880
