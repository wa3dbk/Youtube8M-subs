scar yeah basically I myth games where

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
scar yeah basically I myth games where
like<00:01:43.500> everybody<00:01:44.070> talks<00:01:44.310> about<00:01:44.430> newer<00:01:44.850> games

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
like everybody talks about newer games

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.760 
like everybody talks about newer games
well<00:01:45.510> some<00:01:45.840> people<00:01:46.080> talk<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.229> newer<00:01:46.590> games

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
well some people talk about newer games

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.969 
well some people talk about newer games
being<00:01:47.040> more<00:01:47.250> random<00:01:47.640> mm-hmm<00:01:48.510> um<00:01:48.979> not

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
being more random mm-hmm um not

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.770 
being more random mm-hmm um not
necessarily<00:01:50.159> because<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.119> game<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.600> actually

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
necessarily because the game is actually

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.630 
necessarily because the game is actually
random<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.130> thing<00:01:53.340> then

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
random right if you do the thing then

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.210 
random right if you do the thing then
it'll<00:01:53.850> happen<00:01:54.000> differently<00:01:54.420> sometimes<00:01:55.260> but

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
it'll happen differently sometimes but

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.969 
it'll happen differently sometimes but
the<00:01:56.820> fact<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.900> unpredictable<00:01:58.500> what

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
the fact that it's unpredictable what

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.770 
the fact that it's unpredictable what
can<00:01:59.189> happen<00:01:59.369> because<00:01:59.700> one<00:02:00.000> touch<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.540> change

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
can happen because one touch can change

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.600 
can happen because one touch can change
so<00:02:01.020> much<00:02:01.229> whereas<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.950> older<00:02:02.220> games<00:02:02.400> that

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
so much whereas in older games that

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.420 
so much whereas in older games that
wasn't<00:02:02.880> necessarily<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.600> case<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.220> was

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
wasn't necessarily the case so I was

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.730 
wasn't necessarily the case so I was
trying<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> make<00:02:06.060> something<00:02:06.299> where<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:07.500> if

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
trying to make something where like if

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.990 
trying to make something where like if
I've<00:02:07.860> been<00:02:08.040> planning<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.369> for<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.580> year<00:02:08.820> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
I've been planning it for a year and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.310 
I've been planning it for a year and
you've<00:02:09.149> been<00:02:09.299> playing<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.600> for<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.810> week<00:02:09.959> it

you've been playing it for a week it

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.410 
you've been playing it for a week it
should<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.679> apparent<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.730> i<00:02:11.880> can<00:02:12.030> win<00:02:12.209> most

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
should be apparent that i can win most

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.970 
should be apparent that i can win most
of<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.780> time<00:02:12.989> because<00:02:13.230> i<00:02:13.410> know<00:02:13.530> more<00:02:13.829> about

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
of the time because i know more about

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.729 
of the time because i know more about
what's<00:02:14.250> going<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.579> you<00:02:15.030> sure<00:02:15.930> sure<00:02:16.350> sure<00:02:16.500> um

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
what's going on you sure sure sure um

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.800 
what's going on you sure sure sure um
yeah<00:02:17.100> i<00:02:17.400> started<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.970> get<00:02:18.090> pretty<00:02:18.269> depressed

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
yeah i started to get pretty depressed

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.280 
yeah i started to get pretty depressed
when<00:02:19.760> saw<00:02:20.760> championship<00:02:21.570> fighters<00:02:22.019> who<00:02:22.200> know

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
when saw championship fighters who know

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.500 
when saw championship fighters who know
the<00:02:22.470> best<00:02:22.709> in<00:02:22.920> their<00:02:23.100> class<00:02:23.400> were<00:02:23.970> saying<00:02:24.239> oh

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
the best in their class were saying oh

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.420 
the best in their class were saying oh
yeah<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:24.989> stopped<00:02:25.440> thinking<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.099> started

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
yeah I stopped thinking and you started

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.040 
yeah I stopped thinking and you started
throwing<00:02:26.790> out<00:02:26.880> random<00:02:27.060> mood<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.810> wouldn't

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
throwing out random mood so we wouldn't

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.780 
throwing out random mood so we wouldn't
know<00:02:28.110> what<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.290> do<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.830> that's<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.370> what<00:02:29.580> I

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
know what to do and that's like what I

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.000 
know what to do and that's like what I
for<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.060> entire<00:02:30.329> match<00:02:30.599> oh<00:02:30.870> no<00:02:31.439> what's<00:02:31.709> what's

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
for the entire match oh no what's what's

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.679 
for the entire match oh no what's what's
happened<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.489> this<00:02:32.640> what<00:02:33.180> used<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.420> be<00:02:33.480> like

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
happened to this what used to be like

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.149 
happened to this what used to be like
chess<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.409> can't<00:02:34.590> imagine<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.950> chess

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
chess and you can't imagine a chess

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.649 
chess and you can't imagine a chess
player<00:02:35.310> being<00:02:35.640> like<00:02:35.849> oh<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.030> just<00:02:36.239> started

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
player being like oh I just started

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.630 
player being like oh I just started
throwing<00:02:37.290> all<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> pieces<00:02:37.890> around<00:02:38.159> and<00:02:38.549> open

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
throwing all the pieces around and open

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.959 
throwing all the pieces around and open
and<00:02:38.939> confuse<00:02:39.329> them<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:40.439> know<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.969> somebody

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
and confuse them you know that somebody

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.209 
and confuse them you know that somebody
started<00:02:42.480> yeah<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.769> you're<00:02:43.859> trying<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.099> bring

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
started yeah so you're trying to bring

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.819 
started yeah so you're trying to bring
back<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.489> science<00:02:44.900> yeah<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:46.439> I<00:02:46.620> usually

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
back to science yeah like I usually

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.580 
back to science yeah like I usually
mentioned<00:02:47.609> when<00:02:48.150> people<00:02:48.450> ask<00:02:48.629> why<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.260> play

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
mentioned when people ask why I play

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.309 
mentioned when people ask why I play
fighting<00:02:49.890> games<00:02:50.099> it's<00:02:50.340> usually<00:02:50.670> because<00:02:50.819> I<00:02:51.329> I

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
fighting games it's usually because I I

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.170 
fighting games it's usually because I I
answer<00:02:52.799> because<00:02:53.400> fighting<00:02:53.609> games<00:02:53.879> at<00:02:54.150> a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
answer because fighting games at a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.819 
answer because fighting games at a
higher<00:02:54.390> level<00:02:54.420> are<00:02:54.870> basically<00:02:55.319> like<00:02:55.560> chess

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
higher level are basically like chess

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.580 
higher level are basically like chess
with<00:02:56.040> manual<00:02:56.370> dexterity<00:02:56.689> right<00:02:57.689> people<00:02:58.349> on<00:02:58.439> an

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
with manual dexterity right people on an

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.899 
with manual dexterity right people on an
equal<00:02:58.829> playing<00:02:58.889> field<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.519> doesn't<00:02:59.760> matter

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
equal playing field it doesn't matter

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.429 
equal playing field it doesn't matter
whether<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.299> have<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.689> sword<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.079> thousand

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
whether you have the sword of a thousand

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.839 
whether you have the sword of a thousand
damage<00:03:01.709> or<00:03:01.829> not<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.989> um<00:03:04.430> seeing<00:03:05.430> whether<00:03:05.639> you

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
damage or not and um seeing whether you

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.250 
damage or not and um seeing whether you
can<00:03:06.000> out<00:03:06.209> think<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.629> how<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.750> play<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.139> other

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
can out think and how to play the other

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.949 
can out think and how to play the other
person<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.609> fighting<00:03:09.510> games<00:03:09.659> have<00:03:09.840> to

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
person like you fighting games have to

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.000 
person like you fighting games have to
do<00:03:10.079> more<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.409> get<00:03:10.739> people<00:03:11.329> into<00:03:12.329> that<00:03:12.840> mode<00:03:13.769> of

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
do more to get people into that mode of

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.740 
do more to get people into that mode of
thinking<00:03:14.159> right<00:03:14.819> rather<00:03:15.090> than<00:03:15.239> just<00:03:15.540> hit

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
thinking right rather than just hit

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.800 
thinking right rather than just hit
buttons<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.290> see<00:03:16.650> flashy<00:03:16.950> stuff<00:03:17.299> I<00:03:18.299> did<00:03:18.599> want

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
buttons and see flashy stuff I did want

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.479 
buttons and see flashy stuff I did want
to<00:03:18.900> say<00:03:18.989> though<00:03:19.200> as<00:03:19.409> always<00:03:20.159> come<00:03:20.370> back

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
to say though as always come back

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.170 
to say though as always come back
mechanics<00:03:20.970> go<00:03:21.150> uh-huh<00:03:21.989> factor<00:03:22.560> um<00:03:22.970> level<00:03:23.970> 3

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
mechanics go uh-huh factor um level 3

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.970 
mechanics go uh-huh factor um level 3
might<00:03:24.329> be<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.480> little<00:03:24.659> much<00:03:24.750> but<00:03:25.200> as<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.620> choice

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
might be a little much but as a choice

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.589 
might be a little much but as a choice
for<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.310> comeback<00:03:26.639> mechanic<00:03:27.120> it's<00:03:27.269> actually

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
for a comeback mechanic it's actually

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.509 
for a comeback mechanic it's actually
really<00:03:27.780> interesting<00:03:27.900> one<00:03:28.590> because<00:03:28.799> like<00:03:29.340> I

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
really interesting one because like I

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.479 
really interesting one because like I
expected<00:03:30.139> yeah<00:03:31.139> if<00:03:31.439> you<00:03:31.680> like<00:03:31.709> it's<00:03:32.310> better

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
expected yeah if you like it's better

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.210 
expected yeah if you like it's better
than<00:03:32.700> many<00:03:33.150> other<00:03:33.359> sounds<00:03:33.870> are<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.199> okay<00:03:35.040> if

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
than many other sounds are you okay if

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.710 
than many other sounds are you okay if
you<00:03:35.400> look<00:03:35.579> at<00:03:35.729> most<00:03:36.030> other<00:03:36.329> comeback

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
you look at most other comeback

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.229 
you look at most other comeback
mechanics<00:03:37.229> they<00:03:37.440> are<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.829> form<00:03:38.239> when

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
mechanics they are of the form when

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.849 
mechanics they are of the form when
you're<00:03:39.389> getting<00:03:39.510> killed<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:40.229> do<00:03:40.379> something

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
you're getting killed you do something

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.039 
you're getting killed you do something
and<00:03:41.099> then<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.669> do<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.239> massive<00:03:42.780> amount<00:03:42.989> of

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
and then you do a massive amount of

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.379 
and then you do a massive amount of
damage<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:43.470> other<00:03:43.650> person<00:03:43.979> and<00:03:44.129> can<00:03:44.250> win<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.699> my

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
damage the other person and can win a my

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:46.789

doesn't do that for you you still have
to<00:03:53.879> land<00:03:54.150> hits<00:03:54.479> you<00:03:54.750> still<00:03:54.989> have<00:03:55.169> to<00:03:55.379> play<00:03:55.769> the

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
to land hits you still have to play the

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.199 
to land hits you still have to play the
character<00:03:56.340> right<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.669> still<00:03:56.849> have<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.060> do

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
character right you still have to do

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.059 
character right you still have to do
combos<00:03:57.629> I<00:03:57.870> mean<00:03:58.019> occasionally<00:03:58.409> you<00:03:58.799> can<00:03:58.919> just

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
combos I mean occasionally you can just

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.409 
combos I mean occasionally you can just
throw<00:03:59.099> out<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.310> super<00:03:59.669> end<00:03:59.819> it<00:04:00.030> doesn't<00:04:00.329> get

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
throw out a super end it doesn't get

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.469 
throw out a super end it doesn't get
scaled<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:00.989> that's<00:04:01.169> it<00:04:01.349> but<00:04:01.949> like<00:04:02.129> x<00:04:03.000> factor

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
scaled and that's it but like x factor

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.539 
scaled and that's it but like x factor
means<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:03.870> still<00:04:04.019> have<00:04:04.199> to<00:04:04.319> play<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.680> game<00:04:04.889> so

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
means you still have to play the game so

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.550 
means you still have to play the game so
although<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:06.659> better<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:07.079> get<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.440> more

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
although the better you get the more

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.430 
although the better you get the more
effective<00:04:07.949> it<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.669> like<00:04:08.940> at<00:04:09.510> high<00:04:10.049> levels

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
effective it is and like at high levels

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.960 
effective it is and like at high levels
it<00:04:10.680> pretty<00:04:10.919> much<00:04:11.069> will<00:04:11.280> just<00:04:11.459> kill<00:04:11.609> you<00:04:11.699> anyway

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
it pretty much will just kill you anyway

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.170 
it pretty much will just kill you anyway
like<00:04:12.870> it's<00:04:13.169> a<00:04:13.439> lot<00:04:13.769> more<00:04:13.979> difficult<00:04:14.849> to<00:04:15.030> use

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
like it's a lot more difficult to use

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.210 
like it's a lot more difficult to use
for<00:04:15.540> new<00:04:15.659> players<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.409> as<00:04:16.620> far<00:04:16.889> as<00:04:17.039> an

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
for new players and it as far as an

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.830 
for new players and it as far as an
actual<00:04:17.549> comeback<00:04:18.000> mechanicals<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.690> was<00:04:18.810> a

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
actual comeback mechanicals it was a

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.020 
actual comeback mechanicals it was a
really<00:04:19.049> interesting<00:04:19.169> choice<00:04:19.739> yeah<00:04:20.549> yeah<00:04:21.000> I

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
really interesting choice yeah yeah I

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.670 
really interesting choice yeah yeah I
like<00:04:21.599> that<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.930> does<00:04:22.079> level<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.470> playing

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
like that it does level the playing

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.250 
like that it does level the playing
field<00:04:22.800> somewhat<00:04:23.430> in<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:24.360> every<00:04:24.750> character

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
field somewhat in that every character

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.159 
field somewhat in that every character
has<00:04:25.560> some<00:04:26.340> hope<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:26.729> actually<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.360> think<00:04:27.419> Okla

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
has some hope and actually I think Okla

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.200 
has some hope and actually I think Okla

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.070 
it what do you think of games where one
hit<00:04:45.090> leads<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.390> a<00:04:45.420> combo<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.810> kill<00:04:45.990> the

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
hit leads to a combo to kill the
