00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
to have a little more maturity maybe a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.560 
to have a little more maturity maybe a
little<00:00:31.500> more<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> Medford<00:00:32.700> leadership<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
little more a Medford leadership on the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.250 
little more a Medford leadership on the
team<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.820> we<00:00:35.820> assess<00:00:36.180> things<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.840> felt<00:00:37.170> that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
team and we assess things and felt that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.250 
team and we assess things and felt that
wasn't<00:00:37.710> necessarily<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> direction<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.260> so

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
wasn't necessarily the direction and so

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.440 
wasn't necessarily the direction and so
then<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.620> decided<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> media<00:00:41.910> tryout

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
then we decided we have a media tryout

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.020 
then we decided we have a media tryout
as<00:00:42.690> well<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.500> had<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> number<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.730> from<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
as well and had a number of you from the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.990 
as well and had a number of you from the
media<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.800> definitely<00:00:47.070> found<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.820> that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
media and we definitely found that that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.470 
media and we definitely found that that
was<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> solution<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:51.059> decided

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
was not the solution and so we decided

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.830 
was not the solution and so we decided
we're<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> young<00:00:52.620> team<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:54.030> decided<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.629> win
