00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.470
 not 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:34.280
 there is the agreement finalizing a 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:38.210
 heating and led lighting 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.090
 now I have two rulers of 48 leds 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.339
 blue access 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.339
 the other one's going to stay connected tonight 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.130
 win is the finale 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.400
 and then with all the leds on 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.470
 I'm very much going to have to give a 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:13.369
 call now with everyone on 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:23.320
 four rulers 48 white leds more 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:23.320
 four defendants with 48 blue leds and there 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.240
 all cdu leaving at the same time 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.350
 trying to raise the temperature but 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:53.310
 big an aquarium so it takes time and bread 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.880
 all day at 29 degrees Celsius and 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.189
 shown on the display if this 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.090
 heater 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:10.289
 she is very unreliable because I put 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:14.010
 one making the light here so I can take it 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:18.420
 I put a thermometer here 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.840
 at the other end of the aquarium and also 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.760
 the temperature even at the other end 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.920
 of the aquarium I have the same temperature is 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.920
 shown on the heater's display 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.440
 then that measure is quite reliable 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:39.359
 I thought he was going to measure peripherally 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:43.049
 there is apparently producing the 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:48.599
 Aquarium temperature even a 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:52.459
 generally is not it folks in 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:56.340
 your aquarium is now missing only the residents 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:00.090
 In three days' time, the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:04.250
 First, I'll post it there. 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:09.109
 you there to the first inhabitants here 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.109
 A big hug and until next time
