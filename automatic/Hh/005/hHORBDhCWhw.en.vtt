00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
this and then it was normally just like

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.410 
this and then it was normally just like
this<00:01:09.900> without<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> button<00:01:10.799> or<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.360> or<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
this without the button or the or the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.820 
this without the button or the or the
hood<00:01:12.900> at<00:01:13.080> all<00:01:13.460> but<00:01:14.460> um<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.479> decided<00:01:15.930> because<00:01:16.439> my

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
hood at all but um I decided because my

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.810 
hood at all but um I decided because my
iphone<00:01:17.280> stuck<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.390> top<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.990> little<00:01:19.409> bit

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
iphone stuck out of the top a little bit

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.690 
iphone stuck out of the top a little bit
um<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> made<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> hood<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.009> what<00:01:23.340> happens

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
um so I made the hood and what happens

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.800 
um so I made the hood and what happens
is<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:25.009> this<00:01:26.009> hot<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:30.360> pull<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
is you go like this hot you pull the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.960 
is you go like this hot you pull the
hood<00:01:31.110> over<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:33.079> you<00:01:34.079> wrap<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:35.780> string<00:01:36.780> or

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
hood over it and you wrap this string or

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.200 
hood over it and you wrap this string or
this<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.180> hard<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.909> you<00:01:41.909> wrap

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
this is hard to do it on that you wrap

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.899 
this is hard to do it on that you wrap
this<00:01:42.979> anyways<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.189> get<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.340> point<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.700> wrap

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
this anyways you get the point you wrap

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.179 
this anyways you get the point you wrap
the<00:01:45.030> string<00:01:45.210> around<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> locks<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.619> and

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the string around it and it locks it and

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.730 
the string around it and it locks it and
it's<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.700> hood<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.270> you're<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.380> top<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.649> your
