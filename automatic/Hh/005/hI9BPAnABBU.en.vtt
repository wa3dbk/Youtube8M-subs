00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:06.560
 Today, we will have one of the most remandado videos, we will talk about sllines. 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.749
 To know which saddle is the best for us, we first need to understand 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:12.369
 how does it work 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.509
 a human pelvis, 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.619
 I have here a model to show you all the bones that make it up 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.489
 and so you will understand all perfectly. Fix yourself 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.949
 which is formed mainly by two coxal bones, one right and one left 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.380
 the sacrum and coccyx, 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.730
 the coxal bones 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.679
 in its beginning 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.129
 are three differentiated bones, the ilium that is the upper part, the ischium 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.670
 which is the bottom, 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.450
 and the pubis that is the front 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.499
 and then they are soldered and they form a single bone 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:44.410
 also out of curiosity I tell you that it is 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.840
 the widest bone of the body. 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.660
 Well, what parts of the hip, the anatomy of the hip are going to interest us? 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.070
 Well, we are going to be interested in the ischial tuberosities that is the most 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.120
 prominent 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.140
 lower, 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.680
 note that it is also 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.850
 the bone that when we sit down supports our weight 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.839
 and it will also interest us a lot 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.009
 the part of the union of the two coxal bones, which is this 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.470
 union here called pubic symphysis, 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.080
 Why are we going to be interested in this part? Well because from the bottom 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.490
 of the pubic symphysis 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.479
 they pass from the arteries and nerves that irrigate the genitals and fix what 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:21.960
 pass 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.940
 when 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.730
 we rotate the hip forward by putting a position on the bike, 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.010
 we have brought two tubes here so that what happens is very graphically 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.350
 one could be the artery pudenda that is the one that waters all that area and another one 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.950
 nerve that also goes to that area 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.530
 and see what happens. 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.000
 As soon as we rotate the hip forward 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.560
 the bone itself clamp 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 the artery and the nerve 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.640
 With which 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.200
 we lose blood circulation 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.530
 in the genital area 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.549
 and this can cause us numbness and good, discomfort and if 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.790
 we take to the extreme then major problems, 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.040
 Does it look true? As the bone itself clamps, this is the most important thing that we are going to 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.380
 teach today. 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.050
 What happen 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.820
 if we do it on a saddle? 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.929
 If we do it on a traditional saddle that has this uniform shape 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:15.779
 well clear the possibilities as soon as we rotate the hip to before 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:16.519
 pincen 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.790
 because they are very large, does not mean that these saddles are not worth and are bad 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.289
 according to anatomy and the position of each one they can be comfortable 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:26.349
 but we have 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.669
 two solutions 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:33.489
 Which are the following; saddles with a hollow designed in the center 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.680
 to get over 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.109
 this problem or a complete hole. 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.539
 If you look 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.649
 if the saddle is well made 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:41.849
 the hollow 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:42.860
 help 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.639
 that although we go to the front 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.859
 the impingement is much less or directly or does not exist and the same happens 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.589
 if we have a complete hole, 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.439
 we get that the impingement 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.109
 alleviate enormously or directly that does not exist. 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.120
 Both the hollow and the hollow 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.659
 they are two solutions 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:04.889
 very interesting 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.719
 to avoid this problem. 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.169
 Something important that we want to tell you is that everything we are telling you about 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.589
 the anatomy of the hip and the impingement 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:13.939
 of arteries 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.789
 and nerves that irrigate the genitals serves both boys and girls 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:21.309
 because the female hip has a slightly different shape and is a 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:25.609
 little bit wider, but the arteries and nerves pass exactly through the 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.759
 same place so the same problem is in guys or girls and the same 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.499
 way to solve it also. All right, 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.499
 let's go back now to the ischial tuberosity 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:39.729
 the measurement between the isquial turosities is a very important measure to be able 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.669
 choose a saddle that suits us, why? 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.219
 Well, because there are measures in the saddles 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.389
 that will adapt to the extent 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.559
 of our ischial tuberosities, the distance between our 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:52.049
 isquial tubeosities 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.110
 Specealized was the first company 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.300
 who thought about this and who started developing the same saddle but in 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.459
 different measures 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.249
 and a way to measure 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.479
 this instance that we will now teach you 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.719
 later more brands, uh ... 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.689
 they joined this system for example Trek 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.769
 with its range of Bontrager accessories 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.929
 He also developed saddles with 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:17.949
 different measures. The measurements in Specialized are 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.129
 130, 143 and 155 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:27.419
 and in Bontrager they are very similar but a little bit different 128, 138 and 148 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.469
 when I speak 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:32.409
 of these measures I'm talking about the width of the saddle this is a 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:33.260
 saddle 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.949
 measure 155 so if we measure from here here we will have a 155 saddle 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:44.419
 and notice that this is the same saddle but in size 143 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.139
 With which, do you see the difference? One is wider than another and one will be fine 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.499
 one person and badly another according to the distance between 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:55.020
 your support of the ischial tuberosities. 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.620
 Well, how do we measure the ischial tuberosities? We do not have to remove 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.210
 the hip, 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.490
 we have something very simple that is this piece 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.279
 what we call an asometer 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:11.479
 It is a gel with this shape where we are going to sit, now we will see 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.110
 and we are going to sink our 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.270
 Ischia 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.960
 and the measurement of our ischia 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.200
 we will see then in a table that seat is the one that corresponds to us. All right, 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.680
 before I start with the measurement I want to tell you that our distance from the 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.150
 ischial tuberosities 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.860
 it does not depend on weight, height, or pelvic thickness, 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.199
 It depends on each person so you have to measure it in each person it is not worth a 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.439
 weight and height, a thin pelvis 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.550
 can have 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.909
 a wide measurement between ischiones and vice versa 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.499
 that is, it is a characteristic of each one, so let's measure it. 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:45.110
 We sit 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.550
 on 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.159
 in the center of the gel 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.810
 and we raise 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.289
 the ankles so that we 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.369
 record well 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:57.839
 the footprint 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.490
 of our ischia, 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.770
 we got up 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.309
 and we measure 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:07.249
 with the measure the way I do not know if 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:09.039
 you see it there because it is 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.039
 hard to see 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.330
 with the video, in my measurement they are 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.050
 125 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.419
 Well now with this measure 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.389
 I go to the table and I say to see if I have 125 I am between 100 and 130 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:28.339
 and I insist a lot depending on the position that you are going to take on the bike 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:31.369
 I will need a wider or less wide saddle 

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:33.289
 because the support is going to be different 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:38.619
 as I am in 125 I am in the middle measure and my position is either road or 

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:43.659
 mountain not of walk with which the measure of my correct saddle would be 143 that 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:47.300
 It is also the one that I normally use 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.819
 with this table 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:50.139
 and this measure 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.009
 you will know which is the saddle that best suits you 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:56.460
 as for the size of the saddle and to be able to choose it correctly. Then which one 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.169
 Is the best saddle? Well, there is no concrete or simple answer, because it depends 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.789
 of the type of cycling we do, the position we take on the bike and 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.050
 our own anatomy as we have taught you 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.539
 in the next video 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:10.589
 we will show you different types of saddles so that you know the 

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.669
 different characteristics of each 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:17.189
 and you can choose which is the one that best suits your needs and 

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:18.809
 characteristics. 

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:20.139
 And nothing more 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.849
 do not forget to give the "I like" if it has been interesting and subcribe to 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:27.259
 always be the last. See you in the next video and thanks for 

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:27.629
 listen to us
