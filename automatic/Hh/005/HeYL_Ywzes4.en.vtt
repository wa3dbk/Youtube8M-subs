00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
I think Hunger Games we could do hunger

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.839 
I think Hunger Games we could do hunger
games<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.959> this<00:01:58.049> map<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.009> pretty<00:01:59.189> awesome<00:01:59.520> so

00:01:59.839 --> 00:01:59.849 
games on this map to a pretty awesome so

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:02.359 
games on this map to a pretty awesome so
anybody<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.689> any<00:02:00.840> ideas<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.409> know<00:02:01.439> make

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
anybody have any ideas you know make

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.770 
anybody have any ideas you know make
hunger<00:02:02.700> games<00:02:02.849> on<00:02:02.970> this<00:02:03.030> map<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.330> got<00:02:03.509> start<00:02:03.720> in

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
hunger games on this map we got start in

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.389 
hunger games on this map we got start in
the<00:02:03.840> middle<00:02:03.929> which<00:02:04.200> will<00:02:04.380> head<00:02:04.979> into<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.340> a

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
the middle which will head into in a

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.039 
the middle which will head into in a
second<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.390> think<00:02:06.569> this<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.689> where<00:02:06.899> we

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
second but I think this is where we

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.910 
second but I think this is where we
began<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.880> let's<00:02:09.090> go<00:02:09.209> head<00:02:09.479> towards<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.590> town

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
began so let's go head towards this town

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.130 
began so let's go head towards this town
center<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.670> once<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.450> cross<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> bridge<00:02:12.810> on

center so once you cross the bridge on

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.729 
center so once you cross the bridge on
all<00:02:13.349> four<00:02:13.769> sides<00:02:13.799> north<00:02:14.489> south<00:02:14.730> east<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.209> west

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
all four sides north south east and west

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.080 
all four sides north south east and west
