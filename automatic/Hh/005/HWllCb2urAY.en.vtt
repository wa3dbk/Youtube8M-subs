00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
everything and then to make it into a

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.580 
everything and then to make it into a

an<00:04:01.709> instant<00:04:02.010> hit<00:04:02.160> so<00:04:02.370> they<00:04:02.459> said<00:04:02.670> they<00:04:02.790> had<00:04:02.880> a

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
an instant hit so they said they had a

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.699 
an instant hit so they said they had a

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
they spend it wisely bigger budget means

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.160 
they spend it wisely bigger budget means
