cards this is kriti insane it's just
amazing<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.680> one<00:01:20.399> bullet<00:01:20.670> shot

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
amazing to think that one bullet shot

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.760 
amazing to think that one bullet shot
not<00:01:21.240> only<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> head<00:01:21.780> shot<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.079> regular<00:01:22.409> head<00:01:22.560> shot

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770

not only a head shot a regular head shot
but<00:01:23.399> also<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.329> you<00:01:24.810> know<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.110> final<00:01:25.619> round<00:01:25.770> shot

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
but also a you know a final round shot

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.590 
but also a you know a final round shot
to<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> body<00:01:26.520> could<00:01:26.820> take<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:27.240> five

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600

to the body could take out five
guardians<00:01:27.899> multiple<00:01:28.649> Guardians<00:01:28.979> at<00:01:29.159> once<00:01:29.610> so

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
guardians multiple Guardians at once so

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.969 
guardians multiple Guardians at once so
definitely<00:01:30.990> something<00:01:31.380> interesting<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.860> see

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
definitely something interesting to see

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.010 
definitely something interesting to see
if<00:01:32.159> someone's<00:01:32.880> actually<00:01:33.030> able<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.719> get<00:01:33.869> this

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
if someone's actually able to get this

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.020 
if someone's actually able to get this
within<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.680> Game<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.700> don't<00:01:35.939> know

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
within in Game one you know I don't know

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.219 
within in Game one you know I don't know
if<00:01:36.090> there's<00:01:36.270> gonna<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.539> ever<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.810> moment<00:01:36.960> where

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
if there's gonna be ever a moment where

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.749 
if there's gonna be ever a moment where
everybody's<00:01:37.560> lined<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.640> would<00:01:38.729> be
