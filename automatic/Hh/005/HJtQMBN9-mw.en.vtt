we decided to do a quite a large remodel
of<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.239> house<00:02:49.360> because<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.319> doctor<00:02:50.650> said

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
of the house because the doctor said

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.399 
of the house because the doctor said
that<00:02:50.950> she<00:02:51.549> needed<00:02:51.730> no<00:02:52.209> carpet<00:02:52.659> and<00:02:52.900> only<00:02:53.200> hard

the<00:04:39.460> doctors<00:04:39.820> told<00:04:40.030> us<00:04:40.210> that<00:04:40.930> we<00:04:41.110> needed<00:04:41.320> to

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
the doctors told us that we needed to

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.409 
the doctors told us that we needed to
concentrate<00:04:42.130> on<00:04:42.520> keeping<00:04:42.790> her<00:04:42.880> skin<00:04:43.120> moist

concentrate on keeping her skin moist

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.500 
concentrate on keeping her skin moist
which<00:04:44.020> is<00:04:44.169> almost<00:04:44.350> impossible<00:04:44.650> with<00:04:45.510> eczema

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
which is almost impossible with eczema

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.720 
which is almost impossible with eczema
patients<00:04:46.990> because<00:04:47.290> they<00:04:47.530> don't<00:04:47.800> they<00:04:48.130> don't

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
patients because they don't they don't

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.300 
patients because they don't they don't
make<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.690> ceramide<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:50.830> so<00:04:51.070> their<00:04:51.220> skin

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
make the ceramide and so their skin

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.270 
make the ceramide and so their skin
doesn't<00:04:51.700> naturally<00:04:52.450> hold<00:04:52.660> its<00:04:52.960> own<00:04:53.110> water<00:04:53.320> so

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
doesn't naturally hold its own water so

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.280 
doesn't naturally hold its own water so
it's<00:04:54.430> very<00:04:54.700> difficult<00:04:55.090> if<00:04:55.480> you<00:04:55.570> put<00:04:55.750> lotion<00:04:55.930> on

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.440 
it's very difficult if you put lotion on
a<00:04:56.620> child<00:04:56.919> team<00:04:57.250> that<00:04:57.520> has<00:04:57.639> eczema<00:04:57.850> it's<00:04:58.180> gone
