00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.500
 welcome to the channel today we are going to talk 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.139
 about something that is very fashionable something 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.030
 that is practically spreading 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.490
 like a virus on social networks like 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.670
 for example facebook and tuenti 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.029
 we talk about taking pictures with a camera 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.800
 digital or mobile today as 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.490
 the mobiles are more powerful because with a 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.640
 mobile are the so-called selfish or 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.090
 self-portraits 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.120
 modern day are not only 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.480
 the selfish have emerged a current 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.140
 parallel very dangerous known as 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.149
 Ruffing or sky walking is about 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.940
 take self-portraits photos in 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.969
 very dangerous situations even 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.309
 sometimes in threatening situations 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.980
 there are many people who have died for 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.309
 try to become a ruffin thing that already 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.590
 in itself it seems pathetic but good 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.870
 are fads and fashions as one hundred 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.239
 a hundred times they do not have any 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.610
 explanation people follow and neither 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.620
 he does not even question what he does 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.840
 today we are going to talk about the ten 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.660
 ruffin cases that is to say of 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.060
 extreme self portraits in situations 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.930
 dangerous of the ten most cases 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.080
 amazing that there are to this day 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.590
 let's start first you can see 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.240
 a person climbing a skyscraper 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.540
 you can see the impressive height that 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.500
 It has one of the tallest buildings 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.720
 You can also see another ruffing of a 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.810
 person who is running away from a bull and 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.710
 get a picture taken in that 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.159
 life was being played 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.630
 then we have a very ruffing 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.140
 surprising of what a person is 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.690
 climbing 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.020
 as you can see the redeeming Christ of 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.060
 Rio de Janeiro is practically up 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.460
 altogether 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.890
 Awesome 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.780
 we have another woman pulling herself 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.690
 by a cliff many meters from 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.400
 height a man who is on plane 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.970
 after they have given the status of 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.970
 emergency 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.530
 another person who is in the middle of a 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.660
 fire if you notice only they are 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.060
 the firefighters turning it off and the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.710
 half doing the silly situation 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.370
 quite dangerous we also have 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.560
 an image a pretty curious image 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.200
 of a person who jumps into the field of 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.640
 football to spoil the game for 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.430
 take a picture 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.010
 then we have a picture that is maybe 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.020
 some of the most impressive of a 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.440
 man monkey of a kid better said 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.420
 known as kiril for skype is a 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.140
 young man who is engaged in ruffin has a 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.660
 lots of pictures and maybe this is maybe 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.260
 this photo is one of the most amazing 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.290
 it's a picture of him uploaded to the old 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:09.060
 radio tower such as nothing else 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.780
 and no less 215 meters imagine the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:17.580
 at that height 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:22.060
 impressive but more impressive is 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:25.030
 a man who decided to make himself 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.390
 a self-portrait while passing a train 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.390
 he got as close as he could to the train and 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.360
 the machinist decided 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.380
 just pass by as you can see let go 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.840
 a kick in the head 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.140
 amazing hallucinatory see as the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.360
 machinist as he gave a host a 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.310
 kick in the head at that speed without 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.770
 Doubt could have left him more foolish than 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.950
 what was this ruffin already 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.930
 it's simply amazing these are 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.760
 the most amazing cases of ruffin 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.320
 there are also others that are made by 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.320
 example on top of the new bridge 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.890
 york mainly ruffing that are 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.650
 dangerous ruffing that are deadly 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.560
 this is let's say what it takes to day of 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.660
 today and more and more people are 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.270
 encourage to follow this dangerous fashion that 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.390
 it can cost the lives of many 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.390
 people
