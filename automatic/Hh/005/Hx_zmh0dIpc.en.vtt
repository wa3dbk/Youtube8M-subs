00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.390
 al attiyah we have now arrived in 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.309
 our hotel room and it starts 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.010
 that smaller before me and I will yes 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.399
 always on vacation so a few small 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.579
 from which we put our mini on and off 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.320
 from that 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.510
 several and now it will be like that 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.410
 arrival is the hotel room 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.870
 so far hotel explorations so and indeed 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.300
 The whole thing looks like that here 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.860
 Prospect of works so we are now 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.149
 In Switzerland, if a few have never been 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.059
 should have noticed and looks like that 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.010
 inserts now out there I can do because 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.510
 my brother is simple 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.100
 Here is the cupboard I already have 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.640
 again not been granted yet so I 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.619
 I have here now the things here and 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.040
 because I have just such a few dresses and 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.759
 when I have her in there 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.740
 and I have already occurred to him 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.689
 granted and I'll show you now 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.740
 it's gonna be a bit like that 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.740
 now knows to be louder 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.710
 here is the other bedroom 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:51.810
 bathroom with shower and toilet and 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.290
 There is also a disabled person 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.020
 bathroom better actually around 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.610
 hindered a room is like usual 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.930
 would not have gotten so big 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.180
 Here I am already 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.260
 so if we are here now 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.250
 times look that is good everything we now 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.780
 Just swim a bit because 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.100
 i just awkward when i am myself 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.810
 6 this morning does not necessarily taste good 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.830
 We wanted to have a slope here 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.000
 and one worth it 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.000
 we have a big mirror 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.470
 everything is still taken here because 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:34.620
 we just complete then we have one 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.210
 Walk-in closet 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.210
 So theoretically you could attack 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.760
 then we have a church here so we 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.260
 have already half board but there 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.260
 you can drop something and so on and 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:03:02.319
 so and then we have a balcony there 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:09.849
 and two again in view of 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:11.499
 here on the cake and back on the cake 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.639
 so is our whole part for example 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:14.560
 really nice because it is 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.780
 really big and here we will 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.659
 show so I think now how 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.280
 say make-up again and so on 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.590
 A few small things when I regret 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.109
 and asked a little bit more 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.480
 and yes we may be after 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.159
 go again nice and because 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.299
 pool afterwards I will also 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.060
 otherwise explore everything virtually 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.560
 probably with a camera then and me 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.209
 Just hope that through the follow me 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.669
 round and I hope that 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.719
 I can upload this 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:43.379
 and yes, I just want to completely 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.379
 have fun watching 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.440
 I would have it on the 10th 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:14.480
 finally i'm going to be a little bit 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.299
 internet browsing and probably on 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.480
 instagram first say modest and we 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.480
 see 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.230
 m 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.720
 I know that we have to go under 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:03.799
 We are now on the way down 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:10.179
 and we could get away with a baggage car 

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:11.869
 bit the hotel so loud and 

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:14.019
 lovely wants then a little bit 

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:14.019
 With 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.830
 now we go back, I think 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:54.030

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:54.030

 to cut or now and if we do 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.150

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.230

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:58.440
