that<00:00:10.139> question<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.889> yes<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:12.120> can<00:00:12.679> you<00:00:13.679> can

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
that question is yes you can you can

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.970 
that question is yes you can you can
cause<00:00:14.160> yourself<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:15.000> whole<00:00:15.900> host<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.710> problems

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
cause yourself a whole host of problems

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.660 
cause yourself a whole host of problems
if<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:18.180> back<00:00:18.390> wash<00:00:18.690> your<00:00:19.080> de<00:00:19.529> filter<00:00:19.980> too<00:00:20.369> much

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
if you back wash your de filter too much

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.870 
if you back wash your de filter too much
such<00:00:21.270> as<00:00:21.510> loss<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.529> de<00:00:22.769> which<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.400> number<00:00:23.580> one

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
such as loss of de which is number one

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.080 
such as loss of de which is number one
each<00:00:24.480> time<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.050> backwash<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.830> lose<00:00:26.130> de<00:00:26.640> which

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
each time you backwash you lose de which

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.390 
each time you backwash you lose de which
means<00:00:27.330> you're<00:00:27.810> going<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.800> add<00:00:28.949> more

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
means you're going to have to add more

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.620 
means you're going to have to add more
de<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.199> system<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.550> compensate<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
de to the system to compensate for the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.139 
de to the system to compensate for the
loss<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:34.020> de<00:00:34.200> also<00:00:34.860> when<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.219> backwash<00:00:35.670> number

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
loss of de also when you backwash number

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.380 
loss of de also when you backwash number
two<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:37.219> you<00:00:38.219> lose<00:00:38.430> around<00:00:38.730> two<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> three

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
two is you lose around two to three

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.510 
two is you lose around two to three
hundred<00:00:39.420> gallons<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.200> water<00:00:40.410> each<00:00:40.739> time<00:00:40.860> with

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
hundred gallons of water each time with

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.660 
hundred gallons of water each time with
you<00:00:41.670> back<00:00:41.910> wash<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.200> wasting<00:00:44.100> water<00:00:44.340> now

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
you back wash which is wasting water now

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.750 
you back wash which is wasting water now
that<00:00:45.329> water<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.960> leading<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> system<00:00:47.430> which

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that water is leading the system which

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.430 
that water is leading the system which
means<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.750> top<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
means you're going to have to top the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.639 
means you're going to have to top the
system<00:00:49.829> off<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.969> clean<00:00:51.449> water<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:52.410> means

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
system off with clean water which means

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.639 
system off with clean water which means
that<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:53.010> water<00:00:53.520> bill<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.090> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.140> go<00:00:55.320> up

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
that your water bill is going to go up

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.380 
that your water bill is going to go up
and<00:00:56.250> up<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:57.000> something<00:00:57.210> that

and up and up and that's something that

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.229 
and up and up and that's something that
you<00:00:57.780> don't<00:00:57.989> want<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.739> do<00:00:59.090> you're<00:01:00.090> gonna<00:01:00.149> be

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
you don't want to do you're gonna be

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.049 
you don't want to do you're gonna be
spending<00:01:00.390> more<00:01:00.809> money<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.320> water<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:02.609> that

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
spending more money on water now as that

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.380

back<00:01:55.560> washed<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:56.360> if<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.570> put<00:01:57.780> too<00:01:57.810> much<00:01:58.170> in

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
back washed out if you put too much in

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.260 
back washed out if you put too much in
you're<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.610> take<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> system

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
you're going to have to take the system

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.020 
you're going to have to take the system
apart<00:02:00.659> clean<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> grids<00:02:01.740> put<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> system

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
apart clean the grids put the system

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.389 
apart clean the grids put the system
about<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.780> get<00:02:03.930> back<00:02:04.500> together<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.310> then

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
about to get back together in and then
