pipe then just a fraction of a second

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.560 
pipe then just a fraction of a second
later<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.860> piston<00:01:11.310> uncovers<00:01:11.790> another<00:01:11.820> port

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
later the piston uncovers another port

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.170 
later the piston uncovers another port
that<00:01:13.200> port<00:01:13.680> lets<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.070> new<00:01:14.250> charge<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.850> air<00:01:15.000> and

that port lets a new charge of air and
gasoline<00:01:15.630> into<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> cylinder<00:01:16.740> now<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
gasoline into the cylinder now the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.340 
gasoline into the cylinder now the
piston<00:01:17.610> starts<00:01:18.090> moving<00:01:18.479> back<00:01:18.720> toward<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
piston starts moving back toward the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.410 
piston starts moving back toward the
spark<00:01:19.710> plug<00:01:20.040> compressing<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> air<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
spark plug compressing the air and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.570 
spark plug compressing the air and
gasoline<00:01:21.840> mixture<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.770> spark<00:01:23.100> plug<00:01:23.369> can

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
gasoline mixture so the spark plug can

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.719 
gasoline mixture so the spark plug can
fire<00:01:23.820> again<00:01:24.020> this<00:01:25.020> cycle<00:01:25.470> repeats<00:01:25.950> thousands

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
fire again this cycle repeats thousands

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
fire again this cycle repeats thousands
of<00:01:26.820> times<00:01:27.060> per<00:01:27.240> minute<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
of times per minute you can see that the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.620 
of times per minute you can see that the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
piston is doing three things besides

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.260 
piston is doing three things besides
being<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.170> piston<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:32.130> an<00:01:32.310> intake<00:01:32.640> valve<00:01:32.970> an

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
being a piston it's an intake valve an

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.020 
being a piston it's an intake valve an
exhaust<00:01:33.659> valve<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.470> compressor<00:01:35.100> because

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
exhaust valve and a compressor because

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.760 
exhaust valve and a compressor because
the<00:01:36.180> piston<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.659> doing<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.200> many<00:01:37.380> different

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the piston is doing so many different

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.770 
the piston is doing so many different
things<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.400> makes<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.759> engine<00:01:38.939> incredibly

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
things it makes the engine incredibly

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.840 
things it makes the engine incredibly
light<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> also<00:01:40.829> see<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> spark

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
light you can also see that the spark

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.539 
light you can also see that the spark
plug<00:01:42.119> fires<00:01:42.420> once<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.439> every<00:01:43.619> rotation<00:01:44.250> of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
plug fires once for every rotation of

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.210 
plug fires once for every rotation of
the<00:01:44.610> crankshaft<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.960> twice<00:01:46.409> as<00:01:46.470> often<00:01:47.070> as

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the crankshaft that's twice as often as

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.039 
the crankshaft that's twice as often as
the<00:01:47.369> spark<00:01:47.670> plug<00:01:47.909> fires<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.479> four-stroke

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the spark plug fires in a four-stroke

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.260 
the spark plug fires in a four-stroke
engine<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.220> only<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.820> two-stroke

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
engine so not only is the two-stroke

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
engine so not only is the two-stroke
engine<00:01:51.600> intrinsically<00:01:52.229> lighter<00:01:52.649> than<00:01:52.950> a

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
engine intrinsically lighter than a

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.100 
engine intrinsically lighter than a
four-stroke<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.180> also<00:01:54.329> has<00:01:54.659> twice<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
four-stroke but it also has twice the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.959 
four-stroke but it also has twice the
power<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.070> other<00:01:56.219> advantage<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.880> a

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
power the other advantage of a

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.149 
power the other advantage of a
two-stroke<00:01:57.540> engine<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.710> work<00:01:58.920> in

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
two-stroke engine is that it can work in

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.999 
two-stroke engine is that it can work in
any<00:01:59.369> orientation<00:01:59.670> as<00:02:00.570> long<00:02:01.380> as<00:02:01.560> fuel<00:02:01.829> is

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
any orientation as long as fuel is

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.709 
any orientation as long as fuel is
flowing<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> carb<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.270> engine<00:02:03.600> is

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
flowing to the carb this engine is

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.990 
flowing to the carb this engine is
completely<00:02:04.110> happy<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.890> work<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.490> side<00:02:05.790> up

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
completely happy to work right side up

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.059 
completely happy to work right side up
or<00:02:06.180> upside<00:02:06.240> down<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:07.920> how<00:02:08.039> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
or upside down so that's how a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.400 
or upside down so that's how a
two-stroke<00:02:08.670> engine<00:02:09.060> works<00:02:09.330> I'm<00:02:09.690> Marshall

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
two-stroke engine works I'm Marshall

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.910 
two-stroke engine works I'm Marshall
brain<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.950> that's<00:02:11.190> how<00:02:11.700> stuff<00:02:12.060> works

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
brain and that's how stuff works

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.950 
brain and that's how stuff works
ah
