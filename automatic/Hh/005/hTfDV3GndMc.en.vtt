takes<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.020> animate<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> one-minute<00:02:35.160> video<00:02:35.459> and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
takes to animate a one-minute video and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.449 
takes to animate a one-minute video and
vary<00:02:36.690> depends<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.290> what<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.560> video<00:02:37.920> contains

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
vary depends on what the video contains

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
lot of movement then it could take ages

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.199 
lot of movement then it could take ages
but<00:02:43.680> if<00:02:43.830> it's<00:02:44.010> pretty<00:02:44.520> much<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:45.090> know
