00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:13.969
 bee heaters 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.969
 as they are being cut out doses. 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:31.579
 about 10 millimeters thick you don't 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:34.790
 the better in this case, this is about 30 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:40.290
 about 30 centimeters 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:42.590
 pass is done small simply 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:50.460
 for fixing 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:53.969
 spiral heating spiral here 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.449
 part of the kilowatt helix in this 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:03.780
 case in this case here are the spirals 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.900
 any spiral sold but most importantly 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.210
 so that it has some kind of rigidity 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.299
 so as not to stretch freely happens 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.060
 stretch and not go back part here 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.100
 spirals then there is a half kilowatt 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.740
 my experience is enough spiral 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.490
 we found the best option with friends 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.930
 and created 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.790
 why a bleached doze car should be 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.000
 because it must be paraded under 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.530
 the socket on the pallet is shown early 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.200
 film and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.579
 its part to cling to those framework shifts 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:47.040
 which stand behind the diaphragm here 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:50.390
 Two tails of a bow a spiral get off 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.710
 winds up and also winds up 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:59.880
 telephone try 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.600
 braid edge stripped connects to 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.360
 highways 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:12.980
 they all connect in parallel each 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:16.709
 family and per 25 families 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.890
 twenty five volts to give too 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:35.900
 transformer group example 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:44.160
 transformer which is input 220 and output 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:46.980
 25 power is more than 20 power from 400 and 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:55.410
 above some guys even use 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:56.209
 250 watts me 400 increase 25 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.519
 families 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.820
 hang on one transformer does not make sense 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.450
 heats up less if we pick something up 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.799
 the helix will heat up more but in 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.200
 anyway safe 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.440
 heats the heat goes minimal 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.120
 almost hand in the street does not feel 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.750
 warmly and indoors 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.959
 minimal heat is given 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.150
 You can put temperature sensors but experience 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.140
 suggests that is enough 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.140
 such heat 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:44.950
 It works heating heating connected 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:47.680
 only at night it makes no sense to include 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.459
 preheating so as heater from 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:57.730
 dried nest open spiral and 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:59.340
 provokes the bees to fly for water under 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:08.739
 walnut is being fed 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:13.140
 each hive where to connect so 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.140
 so that they do not close that is 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.169
 the main line is brought in this way 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:24.310
 to one end and wire cable 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:28.770
 was a little bit shorter than the other a little bit 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.770
 longer and then 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:39.560
 never been locked you can of course 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:44.300
 wrap with tape but under tape 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.930
 Do not wind up tight after rain contact 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.930
 oxidizes 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.810
 the other side of the pack is two 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.789
 transformer when we connected 25 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.039
 in this case to the right 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:03.669
 ok left more powerless and less closed 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.669
 only 15
