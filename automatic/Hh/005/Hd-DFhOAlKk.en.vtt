your vehicle there's going to be a

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.680 
your vehicle there's going to be a
couple<00:00:13.320> options<00:00:13.620> one<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.580> which<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:15.089> rain<00:00:15.330> from

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
couple options one of which is rain from

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.900 
couple options one of which is rain from
let's<00:00:16.260> say<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> rusty<00:00:16.859> floorboard<00:00:17.400> coming<00:00:17.789> up

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
let's say a rusty floorboard coming up

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.540 
let's say a rusty floorboard coming up
from<00:00:18.060> underneath<00:00:18.710> another<00:00:19.710> option<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.310> maybe

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
from underneath another option is maybe

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.870 
from underneath another option is maybe
the<00:00:20.789> a/c<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:22.039> condensing<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.220> leaking<00:00:23.730> inside

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the a/c is condensing and leaking inside

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.950 
the a/c is condensing and leaking inside
normally<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> a/c<00:00:25.189> condenses<00:00:26.189> water<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.730> it

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
normally the a/c condenses water and it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.480 
normally the a/c condenses water and it
drains<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.199> outside<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.010> some<00:00:29.250> cases

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
drains to the outside but in some cases

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.069 
drains to the outside but in some cases
it<00:00:29.880> backs<00:00:30.269> up<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.810> will<00:00:31.140> drain<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> inside

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
it backs up and will drain to the inside

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.240 
it backs up and will drain to the inside
another<00:00:34.079> option<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.710> your<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.190> your

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
another option is your is your

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
antifreeze is leaking to the inside from

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.010 
antifreeze is leaking to the inside from
your<00:00:37.559> heater<00:00:37.739> core<00:00:38.149> so<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.329> an<00:00:39.480> option<00:00:39.629> and
