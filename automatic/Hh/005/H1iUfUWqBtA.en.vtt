00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
casually casually sitting around I don't

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.230 
casually casually sitting around I don't
know<00:01:40.090> if<00:01:40.270> he's<00:01:40.479> I<00:01:41.580> can't<00:01:42.580> tell<00:01:42.789> where<00:01:42.970> he<00:01:43.060> is<00:01:43.119> on

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
know if he's I can't tell where he is on

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.090 
know if he's I can't tell where he is on
the<00:01:43.330> map<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:43.780> it's<00:01:43.930> kind<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.229> hard<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.530> see<00:01:44.800> if

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
the map so it's kind of hard to see if

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.520 
the map so it's kind of hard to see if
he's<00:01:45.580> anywhere<00:01:46.210> near<00:01:46.540> me<00:01:46.690> or<00:01:46.810> not<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:47.200> saw<00:01:47.380> him

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
he's anywhere near me or not I saw him

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.180 
he's anywhere near me or not I saw him
drive<00:01:47.770> away<00:01:47.920> but<00:01:49.650> if<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:50.770> guys<00:01:50.890> don't<00:01:51.010> play

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
drive away but if you guys don't play

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.219 
drive away but if you guys don't play
watchdogs<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:52.030> area<00:01:52.450> actually<00:01:52.750> keeps

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
watchdogs the area actually keeps

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.840 
watchdogs the area actually keeps
shrinking<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:54.010> it<00:01:54.100> becomes<00:01:54.340> more<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:54.790> more

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
shrinking so it becomes more and more

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.510 
shrinking so it becomes more and more
obvious<00:01:55.299> where<00:01:55.510> I<00:01:55.540> am<00:01:55.720> so<00:01:56.049> I<00:01:56.080> know<00:01:56.920> if<00:01:57.189> he<00:01:57.280> comes

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
obvious where I am so I know if he comes

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.390 
obvious where I am so I know if he comes
over<00:01:57.760> and<00:01:58.060> profiles<00:01:58.600> me<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.229> tries<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:00.040> kill

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
over and profiles me and tries to kill

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.609 
over and profiles me and tries to kill
me<00:02:00.580> i'm<00:02:00.820> going<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.150> hopefully<00:02:01.630> drive<00:02:02.260> away

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
me i'm going to hopefully drive away

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.429 
me i'm going to hopefully drive away
since<00:02:02.890> i'm<00:02:03.010> already<00:02:03.220> in<00:02:03.369> a<00:02:03.490> car<00:02:03.729> so<00:02:04.240> oh<00:02:04.540> he's

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
since i'm already in a car so oh he's

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.259 
since i'm already in a car so oh he's
coming<00:02:05.590> he's<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.430> purple<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.670> see<00:02:09.880> him<00:02:10.060> like

coming he's the purple and see him like

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.240 
coming he's the purple and see him like
in<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.540> distance<00:02:11.610> deepest<00:02:12.610> fever<00:02:14.250> there's

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
in the distance deepest fever there's

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.550 
in the distance deepest fever there's
nothing<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.910> see<00:02:16.090> here<00:02:16.230> annie<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.260> kind<00:02:17.500> of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
nothing to see here annie is kind of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.500 
nothing to see here annie is kind of
obvious<00:02:17.709> that<00:02:18.340> like<00:02:18.549> I'm<00:02:18.790> around<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.239> area

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
obvious that like I'm around this area

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.310 
obvious that like I'm around this area
but<00:02:21.360> maybe<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.630> like<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:24.840> know<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:26.170> when

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
but maybe this like a I know that when
