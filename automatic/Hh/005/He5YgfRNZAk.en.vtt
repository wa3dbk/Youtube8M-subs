regularly and all parts are checked when

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.740 
regularly and all parts are checked when
centrifuging<00:01:05.290> samples<00:01:05.950> you<00:01:06.550> have<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:07.119> balance

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
centrifuging samples you have to balance

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.109 
centrifuging samples you have to balance
the<00:01:08.380> buckets<00:01:08.799> opposite<00:01:09.369> each<00:01:09.549> other<00:01:09.759> and

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
the buckets opposite each other and

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.730 
the buckets opposite each other and
there<00:01:10.420> are<00:01:10.509> two<00:01:10.630> ways<00:01:10.899> you<00:01:11.079> can<00:01:11.259> do<00:01:11.380> this<00:01:11.560> you

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
there are two ways you can do this you

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.910 
there are two ways you can do this you
can<00:01:11.920> weigh<00:01:12.130> your<00:01:12.340> bucket<00:01:12.729> on<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.000> scales<00:01:13.390> or

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
can weigh your bucket on the scales or

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.819 
can weigh your bucket on the scales or
you<00:01:14.920> can<00:01:15.100> run<00:01:15.460> samples<00:01:16.270> equal<00:01:16.869> volume<00:01:17.290> here

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
you can run samples equal volume here

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.800 
you can run samples equal volume here
I've<00:01:18.040> got<00:01:18.219> as<00:01:18.399> I've<00:01:18.670> got<00:01:18.790> only<00:01:19.030> two<00:01:19.240> samples

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
I've got as I've got only two samples

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.200 
I've got as I've got only two samples
I'm<00:01:20.020> going<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.439> stick<00:01:20.680> them<00:01:20.890> into<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.700> buckets

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
I'm going to stick them into the buckets

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.459 
I'm going to stick them into the buckets
here<00:01:22.570> placing<00:01:23.140> them<00:01:23.259> in<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.469> center<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:26.259> then

TTB<00:05:19.870> and<00:05:20.200> it<00:05:20.680> also<00:05:20.830> has<00:05:21.070> a<00:05:21.100> surfactant<00:05:21.490> in

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
TTB and it also has a surfactant in

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.540 
TTB and it also has a surfactant in
there<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:22.510> it's<00:05:22.780> quite<00:05:23.020> good<00:05:23.350> for<00:05:23.830> cleaning

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
there so it's quite good for cleaning

there so it's quite good for cleaning
out<00:05:24.700> things<00:05:25.060> like<00:05:25.240> centrifuges<00:05:26.020> because<00:05:26.320> it

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
out things like centrifuges because it

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.680 
out things like centrifuges because it
doesn't<00:05:27.070> damage<00:05:27.400> the<00:05:27.700> metals<00:05:28.090> if<00:05:28.360> you<00:05:28.540> use

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
doesn't damage the metals if you use

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.719 
doesn't damage the metals if you use
something<00:05:29.110> with<00:05:29.290> hypochlorite<00:05:30.070> in<00:05:30.250> you've

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
something with hypochlorite in you've

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.550 
something with hypochlorite in you've
got<00:05:30.880> a<00:05:30.910> risk<00:05:31.180> of<00:05:31.360> actually<00:05:31.720> damaging<00:05:32.260> the

got a risk of actually damaging the

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.409 
got a risk of actually damaging the
bucket<00:05:33.220> so<00:05:33.490> it's<00:05:33.640> good<00:05:33.850> to<00:05:33.880> use<00:05:34.030> something

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
bucket so it's good to use something

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.690 
bucket so it's good to use something
that<00:05:34.840> one<00:05:35.350> will<00:05:35.560> kill<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.919> germs<00:05:36.160> with<00:05:36.430> too

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
that one will kill the germs with too

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.650 
that one will kill the germs with too
won't<00:05:37.270> actually<00:05:37.570> wreck<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.140> equipment
