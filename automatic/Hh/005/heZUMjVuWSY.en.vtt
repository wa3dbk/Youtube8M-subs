00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
these days it also has a little

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.069 
these days it also has a little
quarter-twenty<00:00:45.239> thread<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:45.960> that

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
quarter-twenty thread on the one that

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.810 
quarter-twenty thread on the one that
i've<00:00:46.230> got<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.280> will<00:00:47.370> support<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
i've got here and that will support the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.459 
i've got here and that will support the
lens<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.210> really<00:00:48.600> lightweight<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:49.230> you

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
lens but it's really lightweight as you

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.260 
lens but it's really lightweight as you
can<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.700> wouldn't<00:00:51.059> worry<00:00:51.210> about

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
can see so I wouldn't worry about

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.700 
can see so I wouldn't worry about
putting<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> bayonet<00:00:52.289> mount<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
putting it on the bayonet mount on a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.310 
putting it on the bayonet mount on a
canon<00:00:53.010> camera<00:00:53.340> too<00:00:53.760> much<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.870> lens<00:00:55.140> will

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
canon camera too much this lens will

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.110 
canon camera too much this lens will
cost<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> little<00:00:55.890> bit<00:00:56.010> over<00:00:56.280> 3500<00:00:57.030> bucks

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
cost you a little bit over 3500 bucks

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.729 
cost you a little bit over 3500 bucks
but<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.050> well<00:00:58.230> worth<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.620> if

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
but we think it's well worth it if

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.020 
but we think it's well worth it if
you're<00:00:58.890> using<00:00:59.039> these<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> professional

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you're using these in a professional

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:22.539 
you're using these in a professional
cinema<00:01:00.510> application

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.730 

what<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.670> did<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.740> basically

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
what we did with this one is basically

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.130 
what we did with this one is basically
to<00:01:26.159> control<00:01:26.340> image<00:01:26.970> quality<00:01:27.180> at<00:01:27.479> wide-open

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to control image quality at wide-open

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.770 
to control image quality at wide-open
we<00:01:28.590> now<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.920> limited<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.610> maximum<00:01:30.330> aperture

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
we now have limited the maximum aperture

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.249 
we now have limited the maximum aperture
on<00:01:31.110> both<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> 15<00:01:31.740> 85<00:01:32.009> millimeters<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.820> t21<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
on both the 15 85 millimeters to t21 and

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.190 
on both the 15 85 millimeters to t21 and
we've<00:01:34.530> done<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.860> through<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.280> use<00:01:35.399> of<00:01:35.430> a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
we've done that through the use of a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.320 
we've done that through the use of a
baffle<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.289> you<00:01:37.380> will<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:38.789> be<00:01:38.880> limited

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
baffle if you will so we will be limited

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.649 
baffle if you will so we will be limited
maximum<00:01:39.750> opening<00:01:39.899> two<00:01:40.289> to<00:01:40.759> t21<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.210> what

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
maximum opening two to t21 and what

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.330 
maximum opening two to t21 and what
that's<00:01:42.840> done<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.530> give<00:01:43.679> us<00:01:43.799> better

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that's done is to give us better

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520 
that's done is to give us better
sharpness<00:01:45.149> better<00:01:45.539> image<00:01:45.929> resolution<00:01:46.080> from

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
sharpness better image resolution from

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.289 
sharpness better image resolution from
the<00:01:46.590> center<00:01:46.890> out<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:47.189> edges<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.670> little

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the center out to the edges a little

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.380 
the center out to the edges a little
less<00:01:48.420> vignetting<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.080> corners<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:50.390> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
less vignetting at the corners and a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.570 
less vignetting at the corners and a
little<00:01:51.959> better<00:01:52.110> flare<00:01:52.530> control<00:01:52.950> than<00:01:53.399> what

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
little better flare control than what

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.669 
little better flare control than what
you'll<00:01:53.700> see<00:01:53.909> compared<00:01:54.539> to<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.869> previous

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
you'll see compared to the previous

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.460 
you'll see compared to the previous

generation compact Prime at t15 it also

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.520 
generation compact Prime at t15 it also
gives<00:01:58.770> us<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.009> benefit<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.789> marketing<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.569> set

which will all bt 2.1 you tell us a
little<00:02:09.179> about<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.660> hundred<00:02:09.929> millimeter<00:02:10.229> lens

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
little about the hundred millimeter lens

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.600 
little about the hundred millimeter lens
that<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.619> guys<00:02:10.799> just<00:02:11.039> announced<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.489> a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that you guys just announced is that a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.000 
that you guys just announced is that a
macro<00:02:12.030> no<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.720> won't<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> macro<00:02:13.350> it'll<00:02:13.860> be<00:02:13.980> a

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
macro no it won't be a macro it'll be a

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.990 
macro no it won't be a macro it'll be a
closed<00:02:14.370> focus<00:02:14.730> lens<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:16.400> we<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> 100

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
closed focus lens so the we have a 100

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.259 
closed focus lens so the we have a 100
macro<00:02:18.120> when<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.630> ze<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.290> ZF<00:02:20.010> 2<00:02:20.190> line<00:02:20.549> which

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
macro when the ze and a ZF 2 line which

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.509 
macro when the ze and a ZF 2 line which
is<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> close<00:02:21.750> focus<00:02:22.280> basically<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:23.400> half

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
is a close focus basically it's half

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.849 
is a close focus basically it's half
left<00:02:23.760> side<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.269> a<00:02:24.359> 1<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.540> 2<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.680> same

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
left side so it's a 1 to 2 and the same

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.550 
left side so it's a 1 to 2 and the same
thing<00:02:26.010> with<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.190> 50<00:02:26.430> macro<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.930> we<00:02:28.079> announced

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
thing with the 50 macro so we announced

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.380 
thing with the 50 macro so we announced
both<00:02:28.799> of<00:02:29.010> these<00:02:29.100> both<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.760> those<00:02:29.850> lenses<00:02:30.030> at

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
both of these both of those lenses at

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
both lenses will be T to 150 macro will

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.059 
both lenses will be T to 150 macro will
be<00:02:43.890> close<00:02:44.280> focus<00:02:44.780> 1<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.900> 2<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.170> then<00:02:46.680> 100

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
be close focus 1 to 2 and then 100

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.130 
be close focus 1 to 2 and then 100
millimetre<00:02:47.370> will<00:02:47.489> be<00:02:47.609> what<00:02:47.910> we<00:02:48.000> consider<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.359> a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
millimetre will be what we consider a a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.920 
millimetre will be what we consider a a
closed<00:02:49.980> focus<00:02:50.310> lens<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.819> what<00:02:51.299> it<00:02:51.390> focuses<00:02:51.510> to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
closed focus lens and what it focuses to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.330 
closed focus lens and what it focuses to
we<00:02:52.049> I<00:02:52.079> don't<00:02:52.560> know<00:02:52.650> at<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:52.829> point<00:02:52.890> I'm<00:02:53.160> still

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
we I don't know at this point I'm still

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.150 
we I don't know at this point I'm still
waiting<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.609> see<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.819> spectrum
