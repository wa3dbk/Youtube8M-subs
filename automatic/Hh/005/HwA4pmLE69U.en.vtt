there's also one horrible thing about

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.719 
there's also one horrible thing about
this<00:01:41.420> game<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.780> can't<00:01:41.990> use<00:01:42.290> this<00:01:42.560> stick<00:01:42.950> well

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
this game you can't use this stick well

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.580 
this game you can't use this stick well
you<00:01:43.880> can<00:01:44.119> for<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.390> walking<00:01:44.750> but<00:01:44.930> for<00:01:45.110> driving

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
you can for the walking but for driving

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.100 
you can for the walking but for driving
when<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:45.830> use<00:01:46.040> this<00:01:46.190> it<00:01:46.340> gets<00:01:46.490> out<00:01:46.670> of<00:01:46.700> control

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
when you use this it gets out of control

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.450 
when you use this it gets out of control
so<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.140> gotta<00:01:48.320> use<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.590> d-pad<00:01:48.740> for<00:01:49.070> driving

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
so you gotta use the d-pad for driving

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.359 
so you gotta use the d-pad for driving
and<00:01:49.550> that<00:01:49.640> really<00:01:50.240> sucks

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
all right so you can walk with it it

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.320 
all right so you can walk with it it
actually<00:01:59.780> supports<00:02:00.550> 303<00:02:01.550> motion<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.570> yeah<00:02:04.330> so

actually supports 303 motion so yeah so

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.060 
actually supports 303 motion so yeah so
it's<00:02:05.360> like<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:05.780> was<00:02:05.899> intended<00:02:06.290> for<00:02:06.649> an<00:02:06.770> analog

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
it's like it was intended for an analog

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.740 
it's like it was intended for an analog
stick<00:02:07.460> but<00:02:08.709> if<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:09.830> hit<00:02:09.979> this<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:11.330> can<00:02:11.480> shoot

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
stick but if you hit this you can shoot

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.030 
stick but if you hit this you can shoot
but<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.049> can<00:02:12.200> actually<00:02:12.320> kill<00:02:12.560> people<00:02:12.860> so

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
but you can actually kill people so

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.220 
but you can actually kill people so
there's<00:02:13.250> no<00:02:13.370> really<00:02:13.820> no<00:02:13.940> point<00:02:14.209> let's<00:02:15.080> drop

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
there's no really no point let's drop

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.670 
there's no really no point let's drop
this<00:02:15.380> light<00:02:15.590> so<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:15.950> didn't<00:02:16.280> see<00:02:16.459> this<00:02:16.519> better

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.789 

our<00:02:22.340> first<00:02:22.670> problem<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.329> the<00:02:23.390> map<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.470> can't

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
our first problem is the map you can't

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.110 
our first problem is the map you can't
pinpoint<00:02:26.170> anything<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.829> map<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.849> can't

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
pinpoint anything on the map you can't

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.429

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.630 
city from GTA Vice City so he had the
view<00:04:33.060> distances<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:34.040> say<00:04:35.040> earlier<00:04:35.460> was

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
view distances I say earlier was

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.190 
view distances I say earlier was
horrible<00:04:35.970> but<00:04:36.150> it's<00:04:36.420> not<00:04:36.600> as<00:04:36.780> bad<00:04:36.960> as<00:04:37.020> I

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
horrible but it's not as bad as I

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.670
