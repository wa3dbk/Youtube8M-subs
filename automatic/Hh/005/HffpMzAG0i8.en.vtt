00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
just kind of can open doors that just

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890 
just kind of can open doors that just
aren't<00:01:14.400> accessible<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:15.090> an<00:01:15.360> artist<00:01:15.660> that<00:01:15.750> has

some talent some product the art market
is<00:01:18.420> much<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.960> other<00:01:19.170> cultural<00:01:19.920> industries

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
is much like other cultural industries

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.609 
is much like other cultural industries
it's<00:01:20.670> based<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:21.000> star<00:01:21.240> system<00:01:21.510> and<00:01:21.930> there's

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
it's based on a star system and there's

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.920 
it's based on a star system and there's
there's<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.420> big<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
there's really not that big of a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.290 
there's really not that big of a
difference<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.440> talent<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.160> example<00:01:26.640> it's

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
difference in talent for example it's

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.440 
difference in talent for example it's
just<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.470> know<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:29.670> might<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.880> who<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.240> know

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
just you know it might be who you know

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
just you know it might be who you know
you<00:01:30.780> know<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> system<00:01:31.950> that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you know it's it's not a system that

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.630 
you know it's it's not a system that
like<00:01:32.640> favors<00:01:33.540> people<00:01:34.110> who<00:01:34.430> don't<00:01:35.430> have

connections to society you know trying

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.880

to<00:01:41.880> achieve<00:01:42.300> some<00:01:42.630> level<00:01:42.900> of<00:01:43.020> success<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
to achieve some level of success in the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.700 
to achieve some level of success in the
art<00:01:44.040> world<00:01:44.190> it<00:01:44.550> just<00:01:44.820> seems<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.420> always

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
art world it just seems like it's always

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.350 
art world it just seems like it's always
right<00:01:46.710> there<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.640> know<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.270> it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
right there you know it's just but it

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.600 
right there you know it's just but it
just<00:01:48.600> keeps<00:01:48.780> moving<00:01:49.020> away<00:01:49.259> from<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:50.220> think

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
just keeps moving away from you I think

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.100 
just keeps moving away from you I think
I<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.179> hardest<00:01:51.539> thing<00:01:51.660> about<00:01:51.720> being<00:01:51.869> an

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
I think the hardest thing about being an

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.139 
I think the hardest thing about being an
artist<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.830> keeping<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.550> trying

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
artist is just keeping it going trying

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.600 
artist is just keeping it going trying
