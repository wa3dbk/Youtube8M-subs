00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.840
 hello, if you have that kind of weather 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.970
 Servus tv this time with a salsa of 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.680
 plus here the barn of the ds in summer 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.840
 a true paradise for all athletes 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.700
 I'm looking forward to canyoning of fire 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.650
 drive or even on rafting 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.540
 That can be dangerous, though 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.980
 On the other hand, if the athlete turns 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.780
 even overestimate if they are without 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.460
 professional guidance are on the way 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.440
 but even if the weather is not 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.539
 play along 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.460
 if it is a few miles further up 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.649
 thunderstorm rains then it can 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.180
 the river down here in a raging 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.739
 monster bike and thank god 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.390
 That's why I today with the water rescue 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.620
 go and leave me alone 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.420
 save for once 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.309
 who knows how good you are 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.140
 for many years to be part of what 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.479
 we have planned for an accident today 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.570
 today in front of a rescue fund in the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.550
 sun they only want to get out of the dead 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.820
 fall and from the colleagues 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.680
 with 1000 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.280
 then how should I follow myself 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.690
 look behave 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.300
 The compass around water means you look 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.530
 that you have the pension too 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.890
 and I write you to secure it 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.890
 very well 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.790
 Of course, this is traveling 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.320
 a law spoke that 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.020
 Glacier water from the traffic below 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.220
 currently brings about 12 13 years and a 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.440
 very different flow 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.760
 subsets quick questions and a 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.340
 wide, quieter threshold 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.930
 the particular frequencies which bills 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.280
 compared to others wins 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.020
 water savers that are special 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.370
 trained lifeguards the same 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.260
 have learned specifically 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.020
 to live the water and the 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.400
 to calculate flow conditions in 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.660
 Everyone can do well in a calm water 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.940
 I am always very educated 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.649
 act or his brother likes to be here 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.940
 you also have a lot of knowledge 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.720
 Do not bring yourself around 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.810
 to bring danger 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.040
 ok one last correct question i would have 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.450
 not yet with us is always the on 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.550
 Most can talk for now still on 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.000
 best and we have to do that the longest 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.260
 waiting 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.260
 ok then ask now 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.150
 and while the professionals are doing that 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.470
 boat still look out of the water 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.690
 Let's look at where we actually are 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.030
 are the salzach springs here in the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.190
 kitzbÃ¼heler alpen then flows direction 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.530
 east and does with black the congo 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.200
 Where we are right now is a turning point and how it is 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.540
 then further north and empties in 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.890
 how much water does the salt cause? 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.870
 does not matter how it is here now 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.730
 weather is local but also about 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.950
 what weather conditions in the high 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.870
 tauern prevail here originate many 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.830
 small source rivers then in the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.510
 salzach open 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.459
 that means when sport rains a lot then 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.080
 can produce enormous amounts of water here 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.030
 be guided and the water level 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.630
 It's growing so fast that it's special 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.790
 dangerous 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.920
 These situations occur mainly in the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.340
 june to september so please 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.230
 watch out 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.230
 apropos we have but in the missing 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.470
 our reader why some more 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.000
 upriver happened where he knows what 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.040
 area who now have to search exactly 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.299
 so for us in the three factors relevant 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.579
 once the accident place where the whole 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.230
 happened then the accident time and 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.299
 Based on the flow rate you can 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.549
 then rather calm as in this 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.769
 which can be aborted 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.970
 he already reaches the maximum limit 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.349
 has lagged that one times the 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.760
 can narrow down the area 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.859
 how many times a year have to move out 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.720
 higher in that the trends advise in 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.579
 the last time to take more and more 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.400
 you can safely say Austria 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.500
 well over the summer season every second 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.319
 day an alarm with partly also 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.790
 Fehlalarmierungen where you just because 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.350
 a boat that drifts only in the water 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.510
 be alerted but that persons 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.590
 sat 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.750
 what do I have to look out for? 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.160
 number of persons so basically once 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.490
 behind the rock, if you are here 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.190
 looks 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.410
 or when first trees are in the hang 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.940
 the person caught inside or in 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.010
 a cluster that this area where the 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.590
 flow back up the river and 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.770
 the person then held in there 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.770
 becomes 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.340
 maas and look over there I hope 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:46.230
 that not on a helmet actually yes 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.660
 salzburger 1 come for wilders 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.970
 we have a missing person water 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.900
 behind the tunnel bypass behind one 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.900
 stone on the left bank of the river 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.550
 is fortunately everything went well the 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.900
 quote you know what you do you see 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.770
 how fast can the water level 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.200
 change at all and which ones 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.370
 this can happen relatively quickly 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.620
 if it comes to the conclusion and 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.970
 are a strong thunderstorm in the mountains 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.410
 meter goes then suddenly came the 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.910
 water level rises significantly 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.890
 flow rate increase 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.020
 it comes on friday in the tree trunks 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.640
 Wood represents obstacles in the water 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.230
 the flow in the water can be so 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.910
 prevent you from putting it otherwise 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.650
 were pulled down safely 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.060
 or obstacles come so fast 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.410
 on a train that you can not anymore 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.940
 can dodge in time 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.010
 that sounds pretty dramatic 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.310
 it means exactly if it is not the 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.630
 power of water so much 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.950
 I want to know that in one 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.450
 small experiment 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.010
 what does it actually mean for the 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.140
 Water rescue if it is really much 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.190
 the water level is rising and rising 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.350
 hence the flow speed 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.280
 increased because we just look in 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.560
 to a model 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.300
 we have prepared such influences here 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.180
 already tied up with it 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.590
 Sure, two little kayakers are like that 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.370
 and now let it rain 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.170
 Here we have a normal one 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.630
 Flow rate is always nice 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.300
 the grave water advice and you 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.190
 poured on and you can see that too 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.510
 hide quietly plagues that 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.510
 he still represents the driver at all 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.439
 what does that mean in practice for now 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.969
 you the flow speeds as well as 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:33.550
 The salzach are about two to three 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:35.620
 meters per second in this area 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.030
 affect about 40 kilograms on one 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.930
 body salvaged from the water 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.060
 if it should be 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.520
 flow velocity doubles before 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.020
 54 already this force is additional 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.000
 even the surface is a factor of 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.189
 the surface played a bigger role 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.569
 the greater the power of the house 

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:51.539
 the body thus acts when the 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.530
 sporting in the torrential river was 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.030
 unhappy lot more very 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.340
 exciting a lot in the tank, I've 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.180
 first felt it is important for 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.159
 I'm looking forward to the next one 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.870
 times on servus the weather on servustv 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:04.180
 I hope you are back when 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:08.669
 We show you where the weather is like 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.669
 I think you have to abkannen 

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.700
 apa 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.759
 I do not believe anyone in good
