00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.440
 well guys are atomic pick ups 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.559
 today I came back with episode 8 of 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.090
 I read how to create good weapons and to these 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.309
 episodes onwards 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.160
 the ipod and the hands will remain fixed are 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.800
 free you see well then we remove 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.560
 this guy who says hello and let's get started 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.519
 immediately with blood the weapons of today 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.439
 today I will create a minigun then 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.420
 an expansion of this rifle therefore 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.570
 I don't know the various accessories 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.790
 the things that I put into it is usually a 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.910
 bazooka who was not showing you 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.149
 because it is disassembled we immediately start with the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.649
 minigun the equipment is a cube from one 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.940
 with four attacks on the sides you see e 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:54.000
 attach the sides 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:58.640
 then four binoculars like these with the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.020
 kosovo attacks the t4000 coli precisely 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.620
 this I'm building the barrel of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.710
 miniskirt 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.960
 you have to put the binoculars to the side of the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.189
 that is cubes of the cube 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.610
 It is clear that the four attacks already 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.049
 put the four minopolis on the side there 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.630
 a hole here 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.430
 see round is the attacker inside like that 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.350
 well and this is essentially the mini 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.070
 then you can attach it to several 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.420
 things a car type canes so varied and me 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.159
 the attack usually this is a 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.920
 piece of the pump in the liter pump 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.490
 you know how you know how to say the thing 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.810
 the 9 does not come to me like episode 2 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.310
 usually I put it that way and I put a 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.540
 piece below to make him stay still look 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.770
 you 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.470
 this is the kind of attack from a station 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.079
 something so good this is the minigun 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.990
 I'm hurrying to the video because 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.990
 I don't have much time and it takes so long to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.719
 carlo now let's go to the bazooka 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.570
 need this gun when we say it 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.729
 found in the lake of power rangers 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.190
 he had created a good little memory 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.920
 anyway this gun here 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.910
 this empty round piece you see 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.040
 they were successful in these pieces and honest 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.940
 I don't get to clubs growing inside 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.950
 these pieces here 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.440
 see round in for two and then two 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.180
 cylinders all or of the same color that 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.530
 usually is black is attacked 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.870
 cylinder behind you see that there is a 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:40.709
 hole here attached behind then attacked 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.130
 second cylinder with the attack we say 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.430
 the circle where it sticks in out south 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:52.440
 nothing for the barrel and finally attacked 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:57.120
 the round piece is hollow above 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:00.750
 above the cylinder with the attack yes 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.739
 perfectly fits the attack with the 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.510
 cilento empty and here is a bazooka done 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.209
 there's a bazooka I don't know I ca n't 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.150
 to classify it that is, they say it looks like 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.150
 none of the rocket launchers present on 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.250
 a video war game 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.739
 and here is the expansion this rifle from 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.120
 sniper that you find in every non in every 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.040
 we say in your wars and this is the 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.049
 sniper rifle 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.150
 I usually put the charger in that 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.579
 a simple hand attached to the tube 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.519
 below you see there are two tubes if you see 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.980
 here is the meat in a tube under the attack 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.209
 to a pipe underneath which you crush against 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.150
 the trigger 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.459
 this mobile phone bottom of the bed then 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.900
 I put the piece over I slide for 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.459
 the barrel until it can touch the 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.160
 tube below and then the silencers ca1 a 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.590
 classic silencer and this is not me 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.810
 I forgot to say is football is 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.450
 made from the hand you know that of the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.530
 other videos if you have seen go to 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.720
 see them and the classic silencer 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.750
 until it is fined until it goes 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.560
 to crush in football this was the 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.750
 rifle 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.560
 now let's put it all for example 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.020
 so also a nice effect let's say dai 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.240
 then you saw the mini legs from 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.980
 that is, therefore, we put one 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.890
 quadra inspires me and the person like that 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.700
 you see the clinic type the post e 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:41.540
 leira pg does not find a person is found 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.670
 the person who is this so we put 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.300
 well here were these three weapons of today 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.810
