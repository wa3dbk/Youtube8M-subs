00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:14.600
 with everyone from the Ezeiza area and 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.270
 today we bring a special something video 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.760
 a subscriber of ours offered us the 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.970
 possibility of making a circuit that 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.060
 had designed what had a modified 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.140
 little bit 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.080
 and good here we bring it 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.480
 is a fan basically works for a 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.760
 button and will make a light that is giving 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.129
 Laps is done with a subscriber who 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.989
 it's called a live with gamers we're going to 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.300
 let the english rise today of your word 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.740
 in the description and tell us the video 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.690
 it is explained very well done 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.860
 we just leave or be 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.980
 how to build but how do they work 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.920
 in the basic circuit start here with 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.810
 the central part that is where there are the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.620
 pistons that will open and close 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.000
 like going around to show the blog 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.740
 they are electro 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.059
 let's start from below we see 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.090
 studied how it works 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.250
 here we have a repsol watch is 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.030
 similar to a fire 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.810
 I do not know if it's just that with a couple more 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.479
 of repeaters 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.090
 there are many repeaters about 4 tips and 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.340
 other water and some others and acquires 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.990
 a signal that goes around and open 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.789
 of laps makes you antonio tx 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.649
 turn on and off at intervals 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:34.030
 regular and more or less always before 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:37.380
 on and two off 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.380
 but if we go inside 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.420
 and we go inside the authors come by 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.300
 here and they light these repeaters of 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.550
 here that they're going to make the pistons of 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.240
 diets extend to as you can see 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.340
 they're set to 23 334 so it's 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.610
 come around and this will be taken care of 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.090
 egg in this order from here and to give 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.090
 the whole round 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.770
 above is basically the same to them 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.129
 then of a signal 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.410
 more and more repeaters that turn on the 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.770
 crystals from somewhere 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.840
 as well 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:18.390
 we have to point out that here down there 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:21.319
 there are the corners 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.870
 up here there's something similar too 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.000
 brings the current to the pistons 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.319
 crystals from above if not only goes to the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.870
 repeaters of diets but also 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.800
 rise and 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.450
 in the corners 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.640
 and basically to make this 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.500
 work there's this little circuit of 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.500
 someone when we press the button 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.860
 again 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.850
 the senad sees me here gives a boost to 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.340
 clock to start spinning and 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.960
 on the other side over here is going to make 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:01.000
 light up 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:03.740
 this pistolÃ³n a piston course that 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.250
 it has brought me to be prudent 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.980
 that circling the circuit and 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.500
 to pay what we should do that was 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.190
 let the piston take the booking and do it 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.190
 go down and that's how it is 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.250
 we turn it off 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.620
 and perfectly to what we can do 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.780
 is to make it at night and do it by 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.000
 the other face 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.840
 on the other side we have put a little bit of 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.840
 walls in quotes so that now 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.260
 the hotels 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.570
 since it can not be that it has been thought 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.280
 start your server 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.770
 we had returned from the strange worlds 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.360
 of the torch and now we have settled the 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.980
 piston we have achieved this closure 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.410
 when it is normally done that has 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.250
 closed our our undiscovered and 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.250
 now we only understand 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.129
 as you see 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.100
 and you can also see the lighting that 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:21.040
 because now we have this wiring 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.490
 with torches of repsol 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.880
 I said a little but you see 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.710
 yes yes note let's pass all the elements 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.460
 what would be in our giving 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.669
 turns are very good 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.020
 and well now I'm like limit yes as 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.650
 part of what it would be to do a problem 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.650
 solo runner 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.689
 but those present a little away from 

00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:42.689
 our house 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.530
 of thousands of pistons but hey this is 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.930
 the lighthouse made by the we will leave 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.600
 bring them obstruction a subscription 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.070
 wake up in the description equal 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.780
 hopefully you liked the video 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.610
 in that law if from your channel there 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.310
 you will find a tutorial this step by 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.630
 step how to do a ball very well and 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.880
 good if you have any idea how 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.120
 apply to this apart from making a great 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.590
 beacon to any other system that 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.510
 can do with this or any other 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.250
 ingenious system that you make facts and 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.500
 networks with this you know you do not come back for 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.810
 facebook with the forum and we are 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.510
 We are delighted itself will ship 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.510
 well, everyone
