00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello gamer and welcome a few and mehr 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.410
 today we go to see the battle of 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.019
 simone who is informed bbc 2015 so it is 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.450
 a double with the rules just bbc that 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.850
 the official pokémon rules would be king 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.680
 for the world championship he sends us two 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.470
 battles I actually chose the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.080
 battle where it is protagonist because 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.880
 also having me but samp for the team of 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.570
 gissi i really wanna see how you do it 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.380
 cables 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.380
 let's see it immediately 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.190
 ok simone's battle begins 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.680
 against frank bono I did not read correctly 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.260
 then gridos was his is a good one 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.660
 opening for a visit is a team 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.550
 particular I must say against zolt e.on is 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.920
 it was the antonio I imagine that in this 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:57.840
 moment he'll be drooling over why 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:01:03.290
 there is a john then mega set tile ok but 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:06.000
 sparkling shiny and very fine it is very cool ok 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.659
 so we have a special attacker 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.600
 very very fast 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:19.259
 it's a mega gary dos so we keep on 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:22.259
 plexuses break form ok point blank will say the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.979
 its ok this is pretty standard e 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.590
 so john doesn't do anything energy ball from 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.869
 shell part 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.840
 wow it hurts a lot however garrido 6 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.359
 quite tanky and a frost comes dentis 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.390
 style that unfortunately will not survive e 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:43.020
 will go that I then was the go down 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.640
 garzon 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:52.890
 ok cartridge really is not me 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.020
 like it so much because it is faded but not 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.619
 samp ok let's see what ours will do 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.469
 mason sometimes unprotected protection on 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.689
 faces or so far we have not seen 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:11.150
 what rai does on ok protection let's see 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:14.069
 what earthquake ok it was was enough 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.859
 predictable ok because time was not 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.650
 thus protecting but suffering a nasty 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.540
 blow however it is enough times for how much 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.090
 it's about defenses and it's quite enough 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:30.840
 powerful with regards to the attack 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:33.060
 so ok bodyguard ok bodyguard not me 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:40.160
 I remember precisely what he was doing 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.160
 download that doesn't work very well ok 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.989
 repeat ok they are protected by bodyguard 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.450
 bodyguard I don't know what it is like or 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.790
 we repeat wow 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.430
 practically it was a very move 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.099
 pussy bodyguard that now I don't know what 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.610
 strongly means an annotation 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:06.290
 right for body guard that protects the 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.540
 team and then repeat by wright up 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.459
 which causes garzon per earthquake to repeat 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.459
 he sends me and his face was 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.000
 hats off 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:23.069
 ok but samp will suffer a lot we have 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.099
 lightning has maybe if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.950
 bodyguard protects at 16 I think it could 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:32.599
 protect against the moves they strike 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.599
 more than a pokémon but I'm not sure 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.890
 ok same mistake as before then that 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.590
 ninja gets an earthquake in his face but 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.780
 if he continues to do bodyguard 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:47.569
 probably doesn't want rai to go 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:53.250
 down the Charterhouse and then the mantova I have 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:56.819
 a samp support wow i usually use 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.810
 with band choice and nami punch not 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.420
 they go apologetically 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.329
 I'm the choice and punch names with 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.609
 the ability zero defense so ships 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.510
 punch always works a lot 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:11.400
 damage and confuse the opponent 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.000
 repeat ok, repeat, then not determined 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.849
 can no longer do earthquake for a plus 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.459
 it was all standard and we have a two 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:23.690
 against one so it's not that it's the thing 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.690
 best right now 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:31.789
 then protection a double protection 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:37.500
 okay just to make him waste a shift 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:42.270
 rai su comes back and will be exps on 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.520
 ok it's a very balanced team to be 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.240
 a team of 4 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.240
 earthquake because of two supporters and 2 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.949
 suite potentially even if I don't have 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:59.639
 seen very rai on doing ie I do not have 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:03.629
 seen rais far very point blank 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:07.370
 ok felis age the technician directly 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:13.069
 so go of attack does enough have 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:20.099
 in reality it is bad for the opponent 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:25.560
 by simone I wanted to say the battle 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:28.470
 was provided was someone of two 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.659
 he fled but I don't know who why 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.090
 now the battle is over so be it 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.860
 looking at a blank screen however in 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.539
 theory 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.930
 I think the opponent would have won 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:43.800
 because paper a little faster and siae 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.669
 spy who laughs about would not be 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.669
 survivors 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:55.920
 ok this was the battle of simone eh 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:57.690
 eh eh it's a little strange thing 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.910
 tell me what you think about why 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.670
 I think the opponent would have won 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:06.630
 but I don't know which of the two is gone 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:08.400
 anyway I must say that simone is me 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.520
 loved the strategy 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.640
 bodyguard repeat to throw down the 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.080
 enemy game is a pretty team 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:22.530
 balanced even though I couldn't see 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:25.260
 all six pokémon advice perhaps the 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.780
 I throw on maybe because I'm not 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.160
 sure if it works well in duplicate though 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.960
 I know it works pretty well in 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.290
 single trial instead of raizo 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.230
 admit pikachu with the electro sphere 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:42.150
 what it was but in reality it is a bit is a 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:44.280
 however, the team is half palermo 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.920
 seems to be fine ex pillon does not have 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.580
 done a lot though probably it was 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.140
 simple was for magic bounce like that 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.120
 is beautiful Italian name shines skills 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.130
 which causes all indirect damage to reflect 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.610
 all the things that come at him 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.440
 which are not however damages of mini however 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.240
 comments as you think it went to 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.400
 finish that is how you think it would be 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.690
 ended up if one of them didn't 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.060
 was surrendered 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.190
 if you want to send us a battle there is a 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.350
 button here that is beautiful you can 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.770
 click sends you to the video of antonio 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:19.290
 where he tells you how to send us the 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.400
 your battle works both on horas and 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:25.380
 on xy 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:27.480
 so even if I have to say xy they are 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.030
 coming a little less battles because it 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:33.270
 storage, however, both are fine 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:35.040
 you don't need any weird ds enough for you 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.630
 follow what antonio says in the 

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.950
 video therefore for this video is everything and 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.610
 and I'd say see you next time 

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.610
 savena 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.270
 to
