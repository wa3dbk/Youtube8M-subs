which is taking place April fourth 26 in
New<00:00:26.070> York<00:00:26.220> City<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:26.849> pier<00:00:27.210> 94<00:00:27.500> it's<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
New York City at pier 94 it's one of the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.950 
New York City at pier 94 it's one of the
bigger<00:00:29.160> art<00:00:29.460> shows<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> country<00:00:30.330> our

bigger art shows in the country our
expose<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.030> thought<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.540> might<00:00:33.570> be

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
expose and so I thought it might be

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.340 
expose and so I thought it might be
interesting<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.380> create<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.130> vlog<00:00:35.730> or<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.870> series

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
interesting to create a vlog or a series

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.040 
interesting to create a vlog or a series
of<00:00:37.380> vlogs<00:00:38.120> explaining<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.360> process<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
there's a lot of different decisions you

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.229

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
of funds fun things so I thought maybe

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.029 
of funds fun things so I thought maybe
it'd<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.120> interesting<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.649> kind<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.770> show<00:00:52.920> the

this<00:01:17.159> frame<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.869> renaissance<00:01:19.710> style

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950

this frame this is a renaissance style
frame<00:01:20.340> has<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> lot<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> ornate<00:01:21.509> design<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.320> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
has a gold inlay and its really really

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.300 
has a gold inlay and its really really
stands<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.650> dresses<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:29.040> your

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
stands out so it really dresses up your

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.340 
stands out so it really dresses up your
painting<00:01:29.670> nicely<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.930> there's<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> few

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
painting nicely but there's a few

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.770 
painting nicely but there's a few
drawbacks<00:01:31.650> with<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> too<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:33.479> never<00:01:33.689> know

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
drawbacks with it too you never know

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.319 
drawbacks with it too you never know
what<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> person's<00:01:34.740> space<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.490> home<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.060> going

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
what a person's space or home is going

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.230 
what a person's space or home is going
to<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.530> you're<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.189> sure<00:01:38.430> will<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
to be like so you're not sure will it

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.999 
to be like so you're not sure will it
fit<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.450> or<00:01:39.869> will<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.290> well<00:01:40.740> they<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:40.950> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
fit in or will it not well they have to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.340 
fit in or will it not well they have to
reframe<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.549> these<00:01:42.210> are<00:01:42.390> kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.079> expensive

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
reframe it these are kind of expensive

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.249 
reframe it these are kind of expensive
frames<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.659> you<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:45.750> are<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.049> going<00:01:46.200> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
frames so you know are they going to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
frames so you know are they going to
just<00:01:46.500> take<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.310> home<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.759> not<00:01:47.909> use<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> frame

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
just take it home and not use the frame

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.080 
just take it home and not use the frame
or<00:01:48.720> they<00:01:49.710> could<00:01:49.770> always<00:01:49.950> sell<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.460> guess<00:01:50.670> so

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
or they could always sell it I guess so

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.030 
or they could always sell it I guess so
there's<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.780> few<00:01:51.869> things<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.530> about<00:01:52.649> when

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
there's a few things to think about when

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.460 
there's a few things to think about when
you're<00:01:53.220> picking<00:01:54.030> out<00:01:54.299> your<00:01:54.329> frames<00:01:54.780> another

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
you're picking out your frames another

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.980 
you're picking out your frames another
thing<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.399> fits<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.880> artwork<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.570> was

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
thing is if it fits the artwork I was

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.240 
thing is if it fits the artwork I was
kind<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.259> worried<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.649> first<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:59.159> it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
kind of worried at first that it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.100 
kind of worried at first that it
wouldn't<00:01:59.610> really<00:01:59.850> fit<00:02:00.210> my<00:02:00.390> artwork<00:02:00.750> because

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
wouldn't really fit my artwork because

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.440 
wouldn't really fit my artwork because
mine<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.710> kind<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.460> contemporary<00:02:03.119> style

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
mine is kind of contemporary style

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.260 
mine is kind of contemporary style
painting<00:02:04.430> but<00:02:05.430> I'm<00:02:05.700> actually<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.119> happy

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
painting but I'm actually really happy

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.990 
painting but I'm actually really happy
with<00:02:06.780> how<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.619> looks<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:08.190> think<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.700> really<00:02:08.729> fits

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
with how it looks I think it really fits

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.750 
with how it looks I think it really fits
this<00:02:09.479> painting<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.959> particular<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:10.760> this

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
this painting in particular because this

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.680 
this painting in particular because this
is<00:02:11.849> kind<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.209> mood

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
is kind of like a mood

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.000 
is kind of like a mood
the<00:02:12.780> painting<00:02:13.910> has<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.390> darker<00:02:16.170> look<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.770> and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
the painting has a darker look to it and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.920 
the painting has a darker look to it and
there's<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.730> message<00:02:18.300> behind<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.870> it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
there's a message behind it and it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.050 
there's a message behind it and it
really<00:02:19.260> kind<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.920> makes<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.250> stand<00:02:20.430> out<00:02:20.730> and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
really kind of makes it stand out and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.080 
really kind of makes it stand out and
that's<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.990> thing<00:02:22.320> with<00:02:22.500> doing<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.130> big<00:02:23.520> Expo

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
that's the thing with doing a big Expo

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.230 
that's the thing with doing a big Expo
like<00:02:24.870> New<00:02:25.200> York<00:02:25.380> art<00:02:25.620> expo<00:02:26.040> there's<00:02:26.640> over<00:02:26.940> 200

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
like New York art expo there's over 200

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.600 
like New York art expo there's over 200
artists<00:02:27.930> there<00:02:28.110> they're<00:02:28.860> all<00:02:28.980> really<00:02:29.370> great

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
artists there they're all really great

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.730 
artists there they're all really great
artists<00:02:30.180> they<00:02:30.720> all<00:02:30.870> have<00:02:31.080> different<00:02:31.110> types<00:02:31.620> of

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
artists they all have different types of

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.980 
artists they all have different types of
frames<00:02:32.010> they<00:02:32.820> all<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.120> different<00:02:33.300> ways<00:02:33.780> of

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
frames they all have different ways of

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.500 
frames they all have different ways of
standing<00:02:34.470> out<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.190> sometimes<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.820> need<00:02:36.090> to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
standing out so sometimes you need to

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.390 
standing out so sometimes you need to
make<00:02:36.720> your<00:02:36.930> painting<00:02:37.380> really<00:02:37.770> stand<00:02:38.040> out<00:02:38.190> off

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
make your painting really stand out off

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.140 
make your painting really stand out off
wall<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.330> people<00:02:39.600> will<00:02:40.140> go<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.440> look<00:02:40.530> at<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:41.150> so

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
wall so people will go and look at it so

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.630 
wall so people will go and look at it so
that<00:02:42.360> was<00:02:42.480> my<00:02:42.540> thinking<00:02:42.930> behind<00:02:43.380> using<00:02:44.310> these

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
that was my thinking behind using these

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.420 
that was my thinking behind using these
types<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.120> frames<00:02:46.010> sometimes<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.190> frame

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
types of frames sometimes the frame

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.770 
types of frames sometimes the frame
might<00:02:47.670> catch<00:02:47.850> somebody's<00:02:48.240> eye<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.600> then<00:02:48.660> they

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
might catch somebody's eye and then they

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.270 
might catch somebody's eye and then they
like<00:02:48.930> oh<00:02:49.080> look<00:02:49.410> at<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.590> painting<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.160> then

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
like oh look at the painting and then

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.030 
like oh look at the painting and then
kind<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.970> think<00:02:51.150> about<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.590> there's<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:52.680> so

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
kind of think about it there's just so

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.280 
kind of think about it there's just so
much<00:02:53.220> going<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.670> at<00:02:53.850> an<00:02:53.970> expo<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.870> that

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
much going on at an expo like this that

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.110 
much going on at an expo like this that
you<00:02:55.710> really<00:02:56.040> need<00:02:56.220> something<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.880> draw<00:02:57.090> people

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
you really need something to draw people

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.540 
you really need something to draw people
in<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.810> hopefully<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:58.740> just<00:02:59.010> your<00:02:59.190> artwork

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
in and hopefully it's just your artwork

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.510 
in and hopefully it's just your artwork
which<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.510> what<00:03:00.660> I'm<00:03:00.750> hoping<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.410> will<00:03:01.560> be<00:03:01.800> but

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
which is what I'm hoping it will be but

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.580 
which is what I'm hoping it will be but
sometimes<00:03:03.180> giving<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:04.080> little<00:03:04.410> extra

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
sometimes giving that that little extra

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.680 
sometimes giving that that little extra
edge<00:03:05.180> really<00:03:06.180> helps<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:08.180> have<00:03:09.180> these<00:03:09.390> types

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
edge really helps so I have these types

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.950 
edge really helps so I have these types
of<00:03:09.810> frames<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:11.850> another<00:03:12.360> thing<00:03:12.450> with<00:03:12.780> the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
of frames and another thing with the

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.620 
of frames and another thing with the
with<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:13.830> framing<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.850> have<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.480> worry

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
with the framing that I have to worry

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.840 
with the framing that I have to worry
about<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.890> use<00:03:18.350> thicker<00:03:19.350> canvas<00:03:20.220> on

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
about is I use thicker canvas on

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.460 
about is I use thicker canvas on
stretchers<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:21.720> really<00:03:21.989> don't<00:03:22.170> want<00:03:22.350> to

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
stretchers and I really don't want to

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.050 
stretchers and I really don't want to
take<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.239> painting<00:03:24.680> off<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.280> stretcher<00:03:26.850> bars

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
take the painting off the stretcher bars

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.590 
take the painting off the stretcher bars
and<00:03:27.390> re<00:03:27.540> stretch<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:27.989> into<00:03:28.080> thinner<00:03:29.600> stretcher

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
and re stretch it into thinner stretcher

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.810 
and re stretch it into thinner stretcher
bars<00:03:30.810> right<00:03:31.530> now<00:03:31.590> use<00:03:31.920> one<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> half<00:03:32.370> inch

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
bars right now use one and a half inch

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.690 
bars right now use one and a half inch
canvas<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:34.440> lot<00:03:34.800> of<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.010> standard<00:03:35.400> frames

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
canvas and a lot of the standard frames

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.460 
canvas and a lot of the standard frames
are<00:03:35.940> either<00:03:36.060> three-fourths<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:36.959> an<00:03:37.080> inch<00:03:37.260> or

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
are either three-fourths of an inch or

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.120 
are either three-fourths of an inch or
seven<00:03:37.800> eight<00:03:38.270> so<00:03:39.290> it's<00:03:40.290> really<00:03:40.530> hard<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.920> find

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
seven eight so it's really hard to find

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.460 
seven eight so it's really hard to find
really<00:03:41.580> nice<00:03:41.730> frames<00:03:42.209> at<00:03:42.870> one<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.440> half

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
really nice frames at one and a half

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.680 
really nice frames at one and a half
inches<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.519> width<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.269> here's<00:03:45.480> another

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
inches and width so here's another

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.500 
inches and width so here's another
painting<00:03:46.170> in<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.800> frame<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.370> I'm<00:03:48.060> actually

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
painting in the frame and I'm actually

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.650 
painting in the frame and I'm actually
really<00:03:48.870> happy<00:03:49.019> with<00:03:49.560> how<00:03:49.590> these<00:03:50.220> look<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:51.570> I

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
really happy with how these look and I

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.720 
really happy with how these look and I
think<00:03:51.840> I'll<00:03:51.959> probably<00:03:52.140> go<00:03:52.620> with<00:03:52.830> these<00:03:53.070> types

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
think I'll probably go with these types

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.300 
think I'll probably go with these types
of<00:03:53.850> frames<00:03:54.060> especially<00:03:54.810> for<00:03:54.989> my<00:03:55.110> tall<00:03:55.440> thin

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
of frames especially for my tall thin

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.270 
of frames especially for my tall thin
paintings<00:03:56.850> like<00:03:57.030> this<00:03:57.110> I<00:03:58.110> might<00:03:58.709> do<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.920> mixture

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
paintings like this I might do a mixture

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.380 
paintings like this I might do a mixture
of<00:03:59.370> frames<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:01.459> have<00:04:02.459> maybe<00:04:02.910> some<00:04:03.180> really

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
of frames and have maybe some really

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.870 
of frames and have maybe some really
ornate<00:04:03.540> ones<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.170> then<00:04:04.260> maybe<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.560> little<00:04:04.860> less

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.390 

fancy<00:04:08.880> i<00:04:09.090> will<00:04:09.510> say<00:04:09.720> fancy<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:11.220> word<00:04:11.370> for

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
fancy i will say fancy is the word for
