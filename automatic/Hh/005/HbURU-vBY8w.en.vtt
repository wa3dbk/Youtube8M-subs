00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
potential corrosion but it's actually

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.970 
potential corrosion but it's actually
not<00:00:55.980> bad<00:00:56.039> condition<00:00:56.960> there<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.109> some<00:00:58.530> surface

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
not bad condition there is some surface

rust on the rear shorts you can see I've

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.650 
rust on the rear shorts you can see I've
cured<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> little<00:01:03.030> bit<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.270> AC<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
cured that with a little bit of AC and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.050 
cured that with a little bit of AC and
50<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.110> rag<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.739> they<00:01:05.729> should<00:01:05.880> prevent

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
50 on the rag and they should prevent

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.340 
50 on the rag and they should prevent
their<00:01:06.240> getting<00:01:06.479> any<00:01:06.600> worse<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.080> I'll<00:01:07.170> keep

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
their getting any worse but I'll keep

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.140 
their getting any worse but I'll keep
monitor<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.220> again<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:08.850> not

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
monitor on it but again there was not

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:24.070 

I<00:01:15.760> reckon<00:01:16.760> included<00:01:17.300> and<00:01:17.480> standard<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:23.080> it's

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
I reckon included and standard and it's

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.140 
I reckon included and standard and it's
all<00:01:24.260> any<00:01:24.440> bit<00:01:24.680> of<00:01:24.710> surface<00:01:25.010> rust<00:01:25.310> in<00:01:25.760> here

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
all any bit of surface rust in here

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.420 
all any bit of surface rust in here
again<00:01:26.540> easily<00:01:27.380> enough<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.710> get<00:01:27.830> rid<00:01:27.979> of<00:01:28.010> and

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
again easily enough to get rid of and

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:44.260 
again easily enough to get rid of and
prevent<00:01:28.820> it<00:01:28.940> in<00:01:29.000> any<00:01:29.120> worse

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.340 

so<00:01:45.270> any<00:01:45.420> bit<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.630> surface<00:01:45.990> rust<00:01:46.289> on<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:48.000> kick

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
so any bit of surface rust on the kick

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.919 
so any bit of surface rust on the kick
not<00:01:49.350> enough<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.829> affect<00:01:50.039> it<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.450> there

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
not enough to affect it and and there

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.099 
not enough to affect it and and there
