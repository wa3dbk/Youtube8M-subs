00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello, you surely know what we are 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.690
 mammals or as they say mom does 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.080
 and scientifically we are overwhelming 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.770
 most of us are viviparous here 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.859
 several of you are laying eggs 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.230
 primitive century feeding yes there type 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:26.010
 the platypus of snide what is and so we all 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.099
 here we are all viviparous ie you 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.070
 we have a child inside us 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.059
 we can say that live birth 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.829
 spread occurs 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.219
 spread it's cool said 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.710
 and among other animal species among 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.800
 other as it is called animal types 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.289
 Well, for example 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.329
 Already have striking fish they are delayed 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.309
 wait for your spawn 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:57.500
 there will not appear from them will not appear 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:01.260
 fry her viviparous is viviparous 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.439
 reptiles I'm really ready for me 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.030
 signpost now living viviparous we 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.170
 reptiles but in my beloved 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.210
 a museum called 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.040
 paleontological there is mean 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.439
 such a print of a marine dinosaur 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.119
 it means that inside is 4 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.640
 jars yes here he is pregnant dinosaur 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.229
 viviparous what they, too, were here now 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.020
 please who else do we have 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.320
 viviparous here is no one coming out 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.640
 exactly this bird is already wandering birds no neither 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.430
 one they are all eggs and lay soup and you know 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.020
 why is this very simple 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.600
 explanation I will now explain how it means 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.340
 you boiled eggs sometime yes but 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.670
 you can boil it dad science take 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.810
 so many 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.909
 handle water and there egg salt still can not 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.340
 do not forget to even so I learned salt 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.380
 be wrong cracks then peel 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.899
 I do not know the truth or not, but I always go there 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.030
 add salt like this 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.860
 boil it is not necessary to boil 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.250
 you can heat them some 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.620
 temperatures are not particularly high for example 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.390
 hot sand say the whole 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.400
 him bury an egg in the sun 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.760
 which she will fall down but will be long 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.310
 stew why because the temperature 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.019
 high enough to get started 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.450
 protein molecules began to deform 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.159
 before the denatured protein is obtained 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.349
 this denatured protein 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:35.239
 sewed citizens get boiled 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:38.849
 Egg temperature is not particularly high and 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:42.780
 here birds have body temperature they all have 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.610
 very tall why not the bird 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.319
 would be a bird bird 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.010
 this is an organism that was created to fly 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.000
 it's big 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.640
 energy release is more energy 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.290
 highlighting it so to speak forced 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.930
 body forced him 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.799
 musculature these how nice to eat bird 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.739
 meat ladies fat is almost no one meat what 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.890
 there lived there muscles here this 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.230
 diet chicken meat but culture 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.810
 flightless birds but im too 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.150
 I got here they have written off from the flights 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.940
 drank on the ground go chicken coop sit in 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.430
 cells here but still temperature 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.260
 bodies from them high powerful goes exchange 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.049
 substances they are all the time heated 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.239
 condition this is how the engine is 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.690
 it costs diesel, for example, or a carburetor 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.209
 doesn't work up oh cold well if you 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.650
 turn it had to go out the opposite 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.959
 it's already alive alive 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.359
 engine yes he must support 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.069
 certain temperature we have power 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.410
 low our engine so 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.599
 temperature of 36 and 6 we have enough 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.019
 some people cooling systems are still 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.239
 works better than with us not very 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.569
 they are unidos just below the temperature 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:05.129
 Normal body and is such here and at 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:08.760
 birds they have forced engines he 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:11.190
 so it works which is impossible to say and 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.160
 pen describe and therefore the temperature 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.829
 more than 41 degrees easily for us 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.970
 for mere mortals for humans and read 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.949
 temperature forty two degrees 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.950
 practically fatal but it is generally 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.230
 he took over 4140 it is already 43 this 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.140
 no longer a tenant 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.840
 that is why they do not have viviparous 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.790
 bird because here it is thin protein 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.470
 he is particularly sensitive to high 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.090
 temperature so the eggs do not fall 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.090
 all the best to you good luck on a date
