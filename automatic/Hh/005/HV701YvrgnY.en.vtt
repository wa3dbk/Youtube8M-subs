00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
super super thick rubber cable that goes

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.710 
super super thick rubber cable that goes
from<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.869> headband<00:02:07.350> over<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.910> as<00:02:09.539> you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
from the headband over to the can as you

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.570 
from the headband over to the can as you
can<00:02:09.869> see<00:02:10.020> here<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.890> maybe<00:02:11.640> two

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
can see here it's it's maybe two

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.040 
can see here it's it's maybe two
a<00:02:12.610> meter<00:02:12.880> stick<00:02:13.180> or<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.390> centimeter<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.020> half

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
a meter stick or a centimeter and a half

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.920 
a meter stick or a centimeter and a half
thick<00:02:14.590> obviously<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.550> wires<00:02:15.760> inside<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.840> it

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
thick obviously the wires inside of it

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.360 
thick obviously the wires inside of it
aren't<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.260> thick<00:02:17.320> but<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.070> thing<00:02:18.220> that

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
aren't that thick but the thing that

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.770 
aren't that thick but the thing that
that<00:02:18.400> does<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.120> sort<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:19.420> keeps<00:02:19.540> everything

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
that does is it sort of keeps everything

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.680 
that does is it sort of keeps everything
nice<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.410> protected<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.100> also<00:02:21.820> it<00:02:22.090> is

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
nice and protected and also it is

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.290 
nice and protected and also it is
extendable<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:23.620> there's<00:02:23.800> some<00:02:24.130> some<00:02:24.790> slack<00:02:25.060> in

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
extendable so there's some some slack in

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.540 
extendable so there's some some slack in
there<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.050> also<00:02:26.280> seems<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.370> be

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
there but it also seems to be

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.160 
there but it also seems to be
spring-loaded<00:02:28.150> or<00:02:28.390> something<00:02:28.780> because<00:02:28.960> it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
spring-loaded or something because it

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.770 
spring-loaded or something because it
pulls<00:02:29.620> itself<00:02:30.040> right<00:02:30.370> back<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.880> see<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:31.660> it's

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
pulls itself right back in see so it's

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.960 
pulls itself right back in see so it's
like<00:02:31.960> what<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.740> so<00:02:33.190> what<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.370> does<00:02:33.520> is<00:02:33.730> it

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
like what and so what that does is it

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.360 
like what and so what that does is it
allows<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:35.620> know<00:02:35.740> adjust<00:02:36.130> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
allows you to you know adjust the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.450 
allows you to you know adjust the
headphones<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.330> have<00:02:37.830> nothing<00:02:38.830> hanging<00:02:39.340> out

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
headphones and have nothing hanging out

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.180 
headphones and have nothing hanging out
around<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.450> that's<00:02:41.020> really<00:02:41.380> cool<00:02:41.590> as<00:02:41.830> I<00:02:41.980> said

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
around so that's really cool as I said

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.720 
around so that's really cool as I said
they<00:02:42.340> adjust<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:42.940> they<00:02:43.090> slide<00:02:43.390> here<00:02:44.700> not<00:02:45.700> a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
they adjust so they slide here not a

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.510 
they adjust so they slide here not a
huge<00:02:46.210> range<00:02:46.510> but<00:02:46.990> I<00:02:47.020> think<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:47.920> can't

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
huge range but I think that I can't

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.860 
huge range but I think that I can't
really<00:02:48.700> imagine<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:49.120> situation<00:02:49.300> in<00:02:49.840> which

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
really imagine a situation in which

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.630 
really imagine a situation in which
these<00:02:50.140> wouldn't<00:02:50.620> fit<00:02:50.920> your<00:02:51.130> head<00:02:51.510> just<00:02:52.510> fine

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
these wouldn't fit your head just fine

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.860 
these wouldn't fit your head just fine
okay<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:54.700> aside<00:02:55.150> from<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.510> fully<00:02:55.720> adjustable

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
okay so aside from the fully adjustable

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.230 
okay so aside from the fully adjustable
ear<00:02:56.560> cups<00:02:56.830> which<00:02:57.070> you'd<00:02:57.310> probably<00:02:57.820> expect

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
ear cups which you'd probably expect

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.130 
ear cups which you'd probably expect
from<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.720> headphone<00:02:59.020> like<00:02:59.260> this<00:03:00.930> one<00:03:01.930> thing

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
from a headphone like this one thing

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.810 
from a headphone like this one thing
that<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.350> maybe<00:03:02.500> wouldn't<00:03:02.620> expect<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.459> that

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
that you maybe wouldn't expect is that

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.090 
that you maybe wouldn't expect is that
they've<00:03:04.330> sort<00:03:04.690> of<00:03:04.840> maybe<00:03:05.050> taken<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.530> page<00:03:05.830> out

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
they've sort of maybe taken a page out

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.190 
they've sort of maybe taken a page out
of<00:03:06.130> solar<00:03:06.670> public's<00:03:07.090> book<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.510> now<00:03:07.930> have<00:03:08.170> a

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
that durability is definitely gonna come

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.699 
that durability is definitely gonna come
in<00:03:36.489> handy<00:03:36.670> when<00:03:37.030> you're<00:03:37.450> only<00:03:37.600> using<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.230> soft

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
in handy when you're only using a soft

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.699 
in handy when you're only using a soft
case<00:03:38.920> but<00:03:39.420> that's<00:03:40.420> probably<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:41.170> best<00:03:41.410> thing

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
case but that's probably the best thing

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.400 
case but that's probably the best thing
for<00:03:42.190> portability<00:03:42.910> in<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.239> first<00:03:43.480> place<00:03:43.750> that

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
way you can sort of fit it in wherever

way you can sort of fit it in wherever
it<00:03:46.510> can<00:03:46.660> fit<00:03:46.959> versus<00:03:47.680> being<00:03:47.920> constricted<00:03:48.340> by

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
it can fit versus being constricted by
