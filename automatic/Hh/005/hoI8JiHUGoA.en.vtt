in<00:00:33.300> rushing<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.809> was<00:00:34.050> pointless<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.739> guess

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.430 

which<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.100> pretty<00:00:38.610> depressing<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.570> nothing

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
which is pretty depressing but nothing

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.290 
which is pretty depressing but nothing
that<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.620> could<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.890> really<00:00:41.129> controlled<00:00:41.579> that

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that I could have really controlled that

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.549 
that I could have really controlled that
is<00:00:42.510> because<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.780> could<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:42.989> done<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.170> sooner

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
is because I could have done this sooner

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:52.250 
is because I could have done this sooner
before<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.430> crap<00:00:44.789> came<00:00:45.059> up<00:00:45.239> oh<00:00:48.739> well<00:00:51.260> at

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
should record it anyway because I'm a

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.690 
should record it anyway because I'm a
huge<00:03:16.080> fan<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.350> Pokemon<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.130> I'd<00:03:17.220> never<00:03:17.400> really

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
games because i played through them way

games because i played through them way
too<00:03:22.650> slowly<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.430> just<00:03:23.640> saw<00:03:23.790> my<00:03:23.970> playtime<00:03:24.420> 81

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
too slowly you just saw my playtime 81

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.470 
too slowly you just saw my playtime 81
hours<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.820> don't<00:03:29.820> know<00:03:29.910> that's<00:03:30.120> pretty<00:03:30.300> much

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
hours so I don't know that's pretty much

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.979 
hours so I don't know that's pretty much
all<00:03:30.660> I've<00:03:30.810> got<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.019> say<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:35.300> now<00:03:36.300> we<00:03:36.360> get<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.810> see

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
all I've got to say so now we get to see

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:46.350 
all I've got to say so now we get to see
pictures<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.470> things

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:54.130 

as<00:03:47.360> I<00:03:47.510> hold<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.080> DS<00:03:48.290> very<00:03:48.830> unsteadily<00:03:53.140> yeah

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
as I hold the DS very unsteadily yeah

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.510 
as I hold the DS very unsteadily yeah
there's<00:03:54.410> a<00:03:54.470> looker<00:03:54.860> if<00:03:54.980> you<00:03:55.100> didn't<00:03:55.310> really

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
there's a looker if you didn't really

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.160 
there's a looker if you didn't really
have<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:55.700> much<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.180> do<00:03:56.300> with<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:56.569> story<00:03:56.870> I

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
have that much to do with this story I

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.220 
have that much to do with this story I
was<00:03:57.380> kind<00:03:57.620> of<00:03:57.680> weird<00:03:57.890> i<00:03:58.010> don't<00:03:58.040> know<00:03:59.050> what<00:04:00.050> his

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
was kind of weird i don't know what his

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.720 
was kind of weird i don't know what his
point<00:04:00.560> was<00:04:00.620> but<00:04:01.100> whenever<00:04:01.310> he<00:04:01.550> was

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
point was but whenever he was

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.880 
point was but whenever he was
introducing<00:04:02.180> character<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:03.470> real<00:04:03.680> question

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
introducing character the real question

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.229 
introducing character the real question
was<00:04:05.200> jarring<00:04:06.489> because<00:04:07.489> he<00:04:07.670> didn't<00:04:07.910> really<00:04:08.000> do

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
was jarring because he didn't really do

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.140 
was jarring because he didn't really do
anything<00:04:08.480> at<00:04:08.720> all<00:04:12.760> couldn't<00:04:13.760> tell<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:14.000> what

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
anything at all couldn't tell you what

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.560 
anything at all couldn't tell you what
his<00:04:14.300> purpose<00:04:14.510> was<00:04:15.340> he<00:04:16.340> had<00:04:16.609> like<00:04:16.790> maybe<00:04:16.940> three

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
his purpose was he had like maybe three

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.140 
his purpose was he had like maybe three
lines<00:04:17.840> in<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.109> whole<00:04:18.380> game<00:04:22.030> there's<00:04:23.030> that

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
lines in the whole game there's that

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:32.640 
lines in the whole game there's that
funky<00:04:23.600> statute<00:04:24.230> it's<00:04:24.380> like<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.560> hybrid<00:04:25.270> bang

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.999 

but<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.370> contest<00:04:33.880> hall<00:04:34.320> yeah<00:04:35.320> I<00:04:35.380> think<00:04:35.530> I<00:04:35.770> went

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
but the contest hall yeah I think I went

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.060 
but the contest hall yeah I think I went
in<00:04:36.160> there<00:04:36.340> once<00:04:37.530> never<00:04:38.530> been<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.770> fan<00:04:39.009> of

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
in there once never been a fan of

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.560 
in there once never been a fan of
contest<00:04:39.840> it's<00:04:40.840> an<00:04:41.020> interesting<00:04:41.320> concept<00:04:42.570> but

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
contest it's an interesting concept but

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.760 
contest it's an interesting concept but
I<00:04:43.900> just<00:04:44.199> never<00:04:44.620> really<00:04:45.039> liked<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:46.770> probably

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
I just never really liked it probably

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.260 
I just never really liked it probably
for<00:04:47.889> the<00:04:47.919> same<00:04:48.009> reason<00:04:48.220> why<00:04:48.639> I've<00:04:48.759> never<00:04:48.910> cared

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
for the same reason why I've never cared

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.150 
for the same reason why I've never cared
for<00:04:49.479> the<00:04:49.539> battle<00:04:49.870> frontier<00:04:50.350> a<00:04:50.590> little<00:04:50.979> better

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
for the battle frontier a little better

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.310 
for the battle frontier a little better
than<00:04:51.340> other<00:04:51.520> people<00:04:51.720> did<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.840> have<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.139> wait

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
than other people did you have to wait

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.779 
than other people did you have to wait
oh<00:04:53.560> c'mon<00:04:53.800> specifically<00:04:54.430> for<00:04:54.639> that<00:04:54.669> purpose

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
oh c'mon specifically for that purpose

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.219 
oh c'mon specifically for that purpose
and<00:04:55.860> I<00:04:57.120> raised<00:04:58.120> them<00:04:58.389> to<00:04:58.660> get<00:04:58.810> through<00:04:59.110> the

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
and I raised them to get through the

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.930 
and I raised them to get through the
main<00:04:59.410> game<00:04:59.680> to<00:04:59.919> go<00:05:00.009> through<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.280> gyms<00:05:00.520> in<00:05:00.729> the

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940

main game to go through the gyms in the
loop<00:05:01.090> or<00:05:01.389> and<00:05:01.630> that's<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.199> don't<00:05:02.350> want<00:05:02.410> to

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
loop or and that's it I don't want to

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.830 
loop or and that's it I don't want to
have<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:03.030> do<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.060> separate<00:05:04.509> him<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.020> also<00:05:06.840> but

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
have to do a separate him and also but

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.279 
have to do a separate him and also but
like<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.380> frontier<00:05:08.949> or<00:05:09.190> what<00:05:09.340> map<00:05:10.289> you

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.740 
I don't know why I'm still rambling us I
didn't<00:05:46.949> cut<00:05:47.070> this<00:05:47.220> up<00:05:47.430> but<00:05:47.729> now<00:05:48.270> I'm<00:05:48.449> fairly

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
didn't cut this up but now I'm fairly

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:55.930 
didn't cut this up but now I'm fairly
convinced<00:05:49.009> that<00:05:50.009> i'm<00:05:50.130> not<00:05:50.310> going<00:05:50.550> to<00:05:50.639> do<00:05:50.759> that

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.110 

I<00:05:56.440> don't<00:05:57.440> think<00:05:57.740> I'll<00:05:58.160> be<00:05:58.310> recording<00:05:58.730> anything

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
I don't think I'll be recording anything

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.050 
I don't think I'll be recording anything
from<00:05:59.480> this<00:05:59.660> game<00:05:59.870> after<00:06:00.410> this<00:06:00.940> because<00:06:01.940> I'm

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
from this game after this because I'm

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.680

not<00:06:02.240> going<00:06:02.450> to<00:06:02.540> be<00:06:02.600> doing<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.930> front<00:06:03.200> here

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
not going to be doing the front here

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.900 
not going to be doing the front here
unless<00:06:05.690> I<00:06:06.080> change<00:06:06.560> my<00:06:06.830> mind<00:06:06.860> for<00:06:07.400> some<00:06:07.550> really

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
unless I change my mind for some really

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.180 
unless I change my mind for some really
big<00:06:08.150> reason<00:06:08.780> I<00:06:11.470> don't<00:06:12.470> know<00:06:12.800> if<00:06:12.890> there's<00:06:13.070> any

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
big reason I don't know if there's any

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.010 
big reason I don't know if there's any
other<00:06:13.250> major<00:06:13.730> battles<00:06:14.330> I<00:06:14.540> mean<00:06:14.690> there's<00:06:14.900> a

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
other major battles I mean there's a

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.100 
other major battles I mean there's a
rival<00:06:15.470> again<00:06:15.770> but<00:06:16.040> I'd<00:06:16.160> use<00:06:16.970> it<00:06:17.000> like<00:06:17.270> the<00:06:17.600> 80s

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
rival again but I'd use it like the 80s

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.220 
rival again but I'd use it like the 80s
and<00:06:18.140> I'd<00:06:18.350> never<00:06:18.740> been<00:06:19.000> updating<00:06:20.000> that<00:06:20.030> I

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.460 

that's<00:06:24.230> about<00:06:25.100> it<00:06:25.130> really<00:06:26.260> the<00:06:27.260> only<00:06:27.440> other

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
that's about it really the only other

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.000 
that's about it really the only other
thing<00:06:27.650> I<00:06:27.920> planned<00:06:28.220> on<00:06:28.340> recording<00:06:28.940> was<00:06:29.210> my

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
thing I planned on recording was my

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.500 
thing I planned on recording was my
completed<00:06:31.010> pokedex<00:06:31.310> and<00:06:31.760> pearl<00:06:31.970> which<00:06:32.240> is<00:06:32.390> now

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
completed pokedex and pearl which is now

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:42.410 
completed pokedex and pearl which is now
going<00:06:32.660> to<00:06:32.750> have<00:06:32.870> to<00:06:32.960> be<00:06:33.110> delayed<00:06:33.890> even<00:06:34.100> further

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.940 

I<00:06:43.350> think<00:06:44.070> nobody<00:06:44.280> has<00:06:44.640> ever<00:06:44.850> asked<00:06:45.740> what's<00:06:46.740> not

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
I think nobody has ever asked what's not

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.620 
I think nobody has ever asked what's not
why<00:06:47.130> I<00:06:47.160> picked<00:06:47.460> the<00:06:47.610> female<00:06:47.940> character<00:06:48.360> named

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630

battle<00:07:47.680> frontier<00:07:49.020> yeah<00:07:50.020> I'm<00:07:50.169> not<00:07:50.320> going<00:07:50.500> to<00:07:50.590> do

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:50.710 
battle frontier yeah I'm not going to do

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.550 
battle frontier yeah I'm not going to do
that<00:07:50.740> I<00:07:51.660> thought<00:07:52.660> that<00:07:52.720> and<00:07:52.960> I<00:07:53.020> picked<00:07:53.290> up<00:07:53.380> with

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 
that I thought that and I picked up with

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.260 
that I thought that and I picked up with
the<00:07:53.710> national<00:07:54.130> dex<00:07:54.340> or<00:07:54.520> something<00:07:54.970> but<00:07:55.150> that's

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:55.270 
the national dex or something but that's

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.780 
the national dex or something but that's
probably<00:07:55.600> kind<00:07:55.990> of<00:07:56.110> far<00:07:56.320> out<00:07:56.470> of<00:07:56.500> the<00:07:56.680> way<00:07:56.710> so<00:07:58.620> i

00:07:59.780 --> 00:07:59.790 
probably kind of far out of the way so i

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.220 
probably kind of far out of the way so i
guess<00:08:00.790> that's<00:08:01.030> it<00:08:01.240> i<00:08:01.419> already<00:08:01.750> had<00:08:01.930> a<00:08:01.960> lot<00:08:02.200> of

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.230 
guess that's it i already had a lot of

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.590 
guess that's it i already had a lot of
