00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
this camera picks it up which I highly

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.119 
this camera picks it up which I highly
doubt<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:01.800> we'll<00:01:01.980> try<00:01:02.129> anyway<00:01:03.650> it's<00:01:04.650> called<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
doubt but we'll try anyway it's called a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.850 
doubt but we'll try anyway it's called a
woofer<00:01:05.850> excursion<00:01:06.479> test<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:08.030> this<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.860> this

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
woofer excursion test and this is this

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.000 
woofer excursion test and this is this
is<00:01:10.920> their<00:01:11.250> x4<00:01:12.240> excursion<00:01:12.720> test<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.710> track

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
is their x4 excursion test this track

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.350 
is their x4 excursion test this track
will<00:01:14.159> test<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> woofers<00:01:14.790> ability<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
will test the woofers ability to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.539 
will test the woofers ability to
reproduce<00:01:15.600> sub<00:01:16.020> bass<00:01:16.200> frequencies<00:01:16.799> without

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
reproduce sub bass frequencies without

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.249 
reproduce sub bass frequencies without
reaching<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> limits<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.390> its<00:01:18.509> voice<00:01:18.659> coil<00:01:19.049> or

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
suspension in other words to drop bottom

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.440 
suspension in other words to drop bottom
without<00:01:22.320> bottoming<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.330> ensure<00:01:24.330> to
