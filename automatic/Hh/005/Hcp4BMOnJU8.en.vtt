people<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.880> 7.2<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.380> selfish<00:02:40.830> thing

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
people to the 7.2 it's a selfish thing

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.180

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
you know most people don't know this but

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.510 
you know most people don't know this but
I<00:02:46.200> give<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.530> information<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.250> know

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
it's like a symphony you start chopping

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.699 
it's like a symphony you start chopping
down<00:03:32.489> violins<00:03:33.150> what<00:03:33.780> Strauss<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.320> symphony

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
down violins what Strauss is symphony

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.259 
down violins what Strauss is symphony
going<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:34.920> sound<00:03:35.100> like<00:03:35.310> it's<00:03:35.610> not<00:03:35.760> symphony

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
going to sound like it's not symphony

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.520 
going to sound like it's not symphony
anymore<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.959> won't<00:03:37.110> take<00:03:37.260> very<00:03:37.290> long

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
anymore and it won't take very long

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.259 
anymore and it won't take very long
before<00:03:37.860> that<00:03:38.100> Symphony<00:03:38.519> collapses<00:03:39.120> and

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
before that Symphony collapses and

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.509 
before that Symphony collapses and
that's<00:03:39.690> what<00:03:39.870> I'm<00:03:39.959> trying<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.290> say<00:03:43.430> thank<00:03:44.430> you
