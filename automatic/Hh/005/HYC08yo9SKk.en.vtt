00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
else up YouTube this is Dan today I want

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.390 
else up YouTube this is Dan today I want
to<00:00:12.420> talk<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.780> about<00:00:12.870> how<00:00:13.650> energy<00:00:14.160> shield

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
to talk to you about how energy shield

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.310 
to talk to you about how energy shield
works<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.030> how<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.570> should<00:00:15.839> set<00:00:16.020> up<00:00:16.170> an

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
works and how you should set up an

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.370 
works and how you should set up an
energy<00:00:16.470> shield<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:17.400> source<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.960> will<00:00:19.140> start

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
energy shield on source so we will start

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.759 
energy shield on source so we will start
with<00:00:19.560> let's<00:00:20.220> say<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> source<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.820> has<00:00:20.970> 2009

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
with let's say a source that has 2009

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.939 
with let's say a source that has 2009
4500<00:00:22.769> mana<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.880> 75%<00:00:24.449> energy<00:00:25.080> shield<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
4500 mana with 75% energy shield the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.920 
4500 mana with 75% energy shield the
source<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.460> hit<00:00:26.670> gets<00:00:26.970> hit<00:00:27.150> by<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> bone<00:00:27.630> spear

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
source get hit gets hit by a bone spear

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.880 
source get hit gets hit by a bone spear
and<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:29.369> take<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.789> damage<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.890> 4,800

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
and you take this damage this 4,800

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.060 
and you take this damage this 4,800
magic<00:00:32.759> damage<00:00:32.910> /<00:00:33.420> 6<00:00:33.930> beauty<00:00:34.290> penalty<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
magic damage / 6 beauty penalty so you

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.630 
magic damage / 6 beauty penalty so you
get<00:00:35.309> 800<00:00:36.270> raw<00:00:36.510> magic<00:00:36.930> damage<00:00:37.219> this<00:00:38.219> damage<00:00:38.610> is

get 800 raw magic damage this damage is

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.500 
get 800 raw magic damage this damage is
split<00:00:39.030> into<00:00:39.270> 200<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.079> 600<00:00:40.350> which<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.950> 25<00:00:41.399> 75<00:00:41.820> on

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
split into 200 and 600 which is 25 75 on

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.020 
split into 200 and 600 which is 25 75 on
the<00:00:42.809> health<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> mana

the health and on the mana
now<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.690> two<00:00:45.870> hot<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.410> easy<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.010> do

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
now the two hot this is easy you just do

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.569 
now the two hot this is easy you just do
2000<00:00:47.969> -<00:00:48.239> 200<00:00:48.809> you're<00:00:48.989> left<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.469> 2800<00:00:50.399> life

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
2000 - 200 you're left with 2800 life

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.060 
2000 - 200 you're left with 2800 life
how<00:00:51.390> does<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.750> work<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> mana<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
how does it work with the mana it's a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.000 
how does it work with the mana it's a
bit<00:00:53.250> different<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.410> not<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.800> amount

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
bit different you do the not the amount

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.580 
bit different you do the not the amount
of<00:00:56.100> mana<00:00:56.340> -<00:00:56.789> 600<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> damage<00:00:58.050> observed<00:00:58.379> by<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
of mana - 600 the damage observed by the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.060 
of mana - 600 the damage observed by the
mana<00:00:58.829> times<00:00:59.430> -<00:00:59.670> with<00:01:00.660> zero<00:01:01.350> points<00:01:01.770> in

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
mana times - with zero points in

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.210 
mana times - with zero points in
telekinesis<00:01:03.019> it's<00:01:04.019> always<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.710> each

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
telekinesis it's always like this each

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.550 
telekinesis it's always like this each
damage<00:01:05.850> point<00:01:06.119> absorbed<00:01:06.510> by<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.659> mana<00:01:06.900> will

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
damage point absorbed by the mana will

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.510 
damage point absorbed by the mana will
take<00:01:07.830> off<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.280> mana<00:01:08.580> okay<00:01:09.740> now<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.280> max

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
take off to mana okay now if you max

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.810 
take off to mana okay now if you max
telekinesis<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.590> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.979> change<00:01:14.250> each

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
telekinesis this is going to change each

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.940 
telekinesis this is going to change each
point<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.509> add<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.170> telekinesis

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
point that you add in to telekinesis

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.760 
point that you add in to telekinesis
will<00:01:17.600> subtract<00:01:18.600> six<00:01:19.200> point<00:01:19.409> twenty<00:01:19.470> five

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
will subtract six point twenty five

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.039 
will subtract six point twenty five
percent<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.880> coefficient<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.840> way

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
percent of the coefficient this way

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.590 
percent of the coefficient this way
finishing<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> -<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.000> actually<00:01:24.180> for

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
finishing here the - so you actually for

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.010 
finishing here the - so you actually for
a<00:01:24.630> level<00:01:24.930> 23<00:01:25.380> Kinesis<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.369> will<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:27.020> to

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
a level 23 Kinesis you will have to

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.109 
a level 23 Kinesis you will have to
which<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.650> previous<00:01:29.220> coefficient<00:01:29.759> minus

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
which is your previous coefficient minus

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.690 
which is your previous coefficient minus
0.06<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.350> five<00:01:31.619> times<00:01:31.950> twenty<00:01:32.100> you're<00:01:32.490> left

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
0.06 to five times twenty you're left

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.319 
0.06 to five times twenty you're left
with<00:01:32.939> 0.75<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.860> now<00:01:35.100> instead<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.850> subtracting

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
with 0.75 so now instead of subtracting

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.109 
with 0.75 so now instead of subtracting
six<00:01:36.780> hundred<00:01:37.439> multiplied<00:01:38.400> by<00:01:38.549> two<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:39.090> just

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
six hundred multiplied by two you just

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.340 
six hundred multiplied by two you just
subtract<00:01:40.820> six<00:01:41.820> hundred<00:01:42.119> multiplied<00:01:42.450> by<00:01:42.630> 0.75

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
subtract six hundred multiplied by 0.75

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.609 
subtract six hundred multiplied by 0.75
which<00:01:44.299> makes<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.750> she<00:01:46.110> left<00:01:46.320> with

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
which makes it that she left with

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.880 
which makes it that she left with
thousand<00:01:47.509> 50<00:01:48.560> manner<00:01:49.560> alright<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:51.890> now

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
thousand 50 manner alright so on now

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.399 
thousand 50 manner alright so on now
people<00:01:53.430> ask<00:01:53.729> should<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.210> max<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.659> Kinesis<00:01:55.200> or

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
people ask should I max the Kinesis or

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.880 
people ask should I max the Kinesis or
is<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.009> wasted<00:01:56.340> point<00:01:57.259> an<00:01:58.259> energy<00:01:58.710> shield

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
is it wasted point an energy shield

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.800 
is it wasted point an energy shield
source<00:01:59.219> without<00:01:59.460> telekinesis<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
source without telekinesis is like a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.569 
source without telekinesis is like a
hammered<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.259> without<00:02:01.500> concentration<00:02:02.250> it

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
hammered in without concentration it

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.040 
hammered in without concentration it
does<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.119> work

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
does not work

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.830 
does not work
right<00:02:05.530> now<00:02:06.190> people<00:02:06.550> ask<00:02:06.640> what<00:02:07.300> if<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.510> put<00:02:07.690> ten

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
right now people ask what if I put ten

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.870 
right now people ask what if I put ten
points<00:02:08.140> into<00:02:08.350> three<00:02:08.500> cases<00:02:08.979> it's<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.670> same

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
points into three cases it's the same

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.380 
points into three cases it's the same
thing

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
thing

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.630 
thing
would<00:02:11.020> you<00:02:11.170> duel<00:02:11.440> with<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.680> hammer<00:02:12.250> thing<00:02:12.520> that

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
would you duel with a hammer thing that

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.820 
would you duel with a hammer thing that
has<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.820> 10-point<00:02:13.360> c2<00:02:13.600> concentration<00:02:14.350> no<00:02:14.770> you

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
has a 10-point c2 concentration no you

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.740 
has a 10-point c2 concentration no you
wouldn't<00:02:15.280> because<00:02:15.460> you<00:02:15.730> will<00:02:15.880> do<00:02:16.000> any<00:02:16.180> harm<00:02:16.660> or

split into twenty five seventy five so

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.750 
split into twenty five seventy five so
I'm<00:03:14.020> gonna<00:03:14.170> start<00:03:14.440> with<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.620> mana<00:03:14.830> this

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
I'm gonna start with the mana this

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.170 
I'm gonna start with the mana this

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
amount of damage right here will be

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.050 
amount of damage right here will be
subtracted<00:03:19.780> from<00:03:19.810> your<00:03:20.160> total<00:03:21.160> mana<00:03:21.520> and

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
subtracted from your total mana and

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.120 
subtracted from your total mana and
would<00:03:23.020> be<00:03:23.170> multiplied<00:03:23.590> by<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:23.830> coefficient

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
would be multiplied by the coefficient

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.710 
would be multiplied by the coefficient
which<00:03:24.670> will<00:03:25.060> leave<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.840> with<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.290> negative<00:03:27.720> 93

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
which will leave you with a negative 93

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.330 
which will leave you with a negative 93
this<00:03:29.020> nine<00:03:29.260> three<00:03:29.530> will<00:03:29.709> be<00:03:29.830> added<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.190> your

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
this nine three will be added to your

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.590 
this nine three will be added to your
health<00:03:30.580> right<00:03:30.880> because<00:03:31.150> he<00:03:31.270> has<00:03:31.360> to<00:03:31.510> be

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
health right because he has to be

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.930 
health right because he has to be
accounted<00:03:31.989> for<00:03:32.020> so<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.190> way<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.400> do<00:03:33.580> is<00:03:33.730> you

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
accounted for so the way you do is you

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.810 
accounted for so the way you do is you
do<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.870> calculate<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.380> health<00:03:35.560> mm<00:03:36.160> -<00:03:36.520> there's

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
do you calculate the health mm - there's

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.460 
do you calculate the health mm - there's
damage<00:03:37.030> over<00:03:37.390> here<00:03:37.690> multiplied<00:03:38.260> by<00:03:38.410> two

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
damage over here multiplied by two

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.440 
damage over here multiplied by two
because<00:03:38.739> you<00:03:39.010> have<00:03:39.160> -<00:03:39.520> a<00:03:39.640> hundred<00:03:40.000> resistor

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
because you have - a hundred resistor

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.260 
because you have - a hundred resistor
cold<00:03:41.010> plus<00:03:42.010> ninety<00:03:42.430> three<00:03:42.610> point<00:03:42.820> seven<00:03:43.000> five

cold plus ninety three point seven five

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.910 
cold plus ninety three point seven five
divided<00:03:43.750> by<00:03:43.989> this<00:03:44.050> equation<00:03:44.350> right<00:03:44.860> here

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
divided by this equation right here

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.830 
divided by this equation right here
because<00:03:45.430> you're<00:03:45.580> under<00:03:45.820> health<00:03:46.030> around<00:03:46.360> mana

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
because you're under health around mana

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.050 
because you're under health around mana
so<00:03:47.050> you<00:03:47.170> need<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.500> remove<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.130> proficient<00:03:48.880> and

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
so you need to remove the proficient and

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.540 
so you need to remove the proficient and
also<00:03:49.450> times<00:03:49.690> 2<00:03:49.900> because<00:03:50.050> it's<00:03:50.410> also<00:03:50.590> minus<00:03:51.010> 100

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
ho how do I know the way you do this is

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.170 
ho how do I know the way you do this is
you<00:04:50.910> must<00:04:51.150> set<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:51.889> common<00:04:52.889> denominator<00:04:53.090> in<00:04:54.090> a

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
you must set a common denominator in a

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.320 
you must set a common denominator in a
sort<00:04:54.450> of<00:04:54.510> way<00:04:54.660> so<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:55.410> have<00:04:55.760> 2200<00:04:56.760> this<00:04:57.090> man<00:04:57.300> I

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
sort of way so you have 2200 this man I

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.850 
sort of way so you have 2200 this man I
need<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:57.660> transform<00:04:58.080> it<00:04:58.229> into<00:04:58.380> half<00:04:58.620> by

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
need to transform it into half by

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.000 
need to transform it into half by
dividing<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.520> by<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.700> mana<00:05:00.000> coefficient<00:05:00.690> so

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
dividing it by the mana coefficient so

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.100 
dividing it by the mana coefficient so
4000<00:05:02.010> mana<00:05:02.190> is<00:05:02.340> like<00:05:02.610> five<00:05:03.479> thousand<00:05:04.020> three

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
4000 mana is like five thousand three

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.980 
4000 mana is like five thousand three
three<00:05:04.350> three<00:05:04.380> half<00:05:04.770> okay<00:05:05.210> now<00:05:06.210> what<00:05:06.720> you<00:05:06.750> do

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
three three half okay now what you do

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.810 
three three half okay now what you do
you<00:05:07.020> add<00:05:07.289> these<00:05:07.440> numbers<00:05:07.650> together<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.639> you

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
you add these numbers together and you

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.490 
you add these numbers together and you
obtain<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.150> percentages<00:05:09.750> for<00:05:09.810> each<00:05:10.020> of<00:05:10.289> them

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
obtain the percentages for each of them

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.250 
obtain the percentages for each of them
so<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:10.979> health<00:05:11.220> is<00:05:11.630> 29%<00:05:12.630> of<00:05:12.720> your<00:05:12.870> thanking

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
so the health is 29% of your thanking

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.100 
so the health is 29% of your thanking
ability<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:14.220> you<00:05:14.610> managed<00:05:15.000> only<00:05:15.360> 1%<00:05:15.720> of<00:05:16.020> the

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
ability and you managed only 1% of the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.050 
ability and you managed only 1% of the
tanking<00:05:16.530> ability<00:05:17.450> now<00:05:18.450> how<00:05:18.630> do<00:05:18.690> you<00:05:18.840> do<00:05:19.020> this

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
tanking ability now how do you do this

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.469 
tanking ability now how do you do this
the<00:05:21.060> energy<00:05:21.450> shield<00:05:21.660> is<00:05:21.900> calculated<00:05:23.300> this<00:05:24.300> is

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
the energy shield is calculated this is

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.469 
the energy shield is calculated this is
the<00:05:24.960> way<00:05:25.110> I<00:05:25.139> do<00:05:25.380> it<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:25.889> can<00:05:26.099> do<00:05:26.220> it<00:05:26.419> if<00:05:27.419> you

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
the way I do it you can do it if you

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.719 
the way I do it you can do it if you
think<00:05:27.630> you<00:05:27.930> have<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.110> better<00:05:28.410> formula<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:29.099> do<00:05:29.490> it

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
think you have a better formula I do it

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.310 
think you have a better formula I do it
a<00:05:29.760> hundred<00:05:29.970> percent<00:05:30.180> minus<00:05:30.810> twenty<00:05:31.139> nine

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
a hundred percent minus twenty nine

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.450 
a hundred percent minus twenty nine
which<00:05:31.590> is<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:32.460> health<00:05:33.020> divided<00:05:34.020> by<00:05:34.139> three<00:05:34.460> so

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
which is the health divided by three so

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.010 
which is the health divided by three so
this<00:05:35.639> gives<00:05:35.880> me<00:05:35.940> ninety<00:05:36.300> percent<00:05:36.479> so<00:05:36.780> I<00:05:36.840> should

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
this gives me ninety percent so I should

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.580 
this gives me ninety percent so I should
put<00:05:37.229> 90<00:05:37.610> percent<00:05:38.610> energy<00:05:38.849> shield<00:05:39.289> for<00:05:40.289> a<00:05:40.320> fire

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
put 90 percent energy shield for a fire

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.060 
put 90 percent energy shield for a fire
source<00:05:41.270> for<00:05:42.270> lightning<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:43.229> the<00:05:43.470> cold<00:05:43.740> source

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
source for lightning and the cold source

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.790 
source for lightning and the cold source
is<00:05:44.400> divided<00:05:45.240> by<00:05:45.389> two<00:05:45.450> instead<00:05:45.900> of<00:05:45.960> three<00:05:46.110> so<00:05:46.650> it

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
is divided by two instead of three so it

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.190 
is divided by two instead of three so it
gives<00:05:47.370> you<00:05:47.550> a<00:05:47.580> lower<00:05:47.820> energy<00:05:48.240> up

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
gives you a lower energy up

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.800 
gives you a lower energy up
why<00:05:49.620> do<00:05:49.680> fire<00:05:50.610> sources<00:05:51.090> have<00:05:51.300> higher<00:05:51.570> energy

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
why do fire sources have higher energy

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.460 
why do fire sources have higher energy
fields<00:05:53.270> first<00:05:54.270> of<00:05:54.479> all<00:05:54.660> because<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.080> fire

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
fields first of all because the fire

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.990 
fields first of all because the fire
source<00:05:56.090> has<00:05:57.090> high<00:05:57.419> level<00:05:57.780> of<00:05:57.900> warmth

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
source has high level of warmth

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.400 
source has high level of warmth
has<00:05:59.510> high<00:06:00.440> level<00:06:00.860> of<00:06:01.040> mana<00:06:01.490> regeneration<00:06:02.410> so

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
has high level of mana regeneration so

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.370 
has high level of mana regeneration so
he<00:06:03.500> can<00:06:03.710> tag<00:06:03.920> more<00:06:04.160> on<00:06:04.310> the<00:06:04.430> mana<00:06:04.640> because<00:06:05.380> if

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
he can tag more on the mana because if

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.200 
he can tag more on the mana because if
you<00:06:06.560> get<00:06:06.710> hit<00:06:06.980> and<00:06:07.220> you<00:06:07.310> tell<00:06:07.520> away<00:06:07.820> your<00:06:08.030> mana

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
you get hit and you tell away your mana

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.320 
you get hit and you tell away your mana
replenishes<00:06:08.930> almost<00:06:09.290> instantly<00:06:09.740> so<00:06:10.330> that's

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
replenishes almost instantly so that's

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.740 
replenishes almost instantly so that's
why<00:06:11.600> fire<00:06:11.900> sources<00:06:12.410> can<00:06:12.650> tank<00:06:12.920> more<00:06:13.750> lightning

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
why fire sources can tank more lightning

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.900 
why fire sources can tank more lightning
and<00:06:14.930> cold<00:06:15.200> sources<00:06:15.440> have<00:06:16.040> lower<00:06:17.590> regeneration

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
and cold sources have lower regeneration

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.580 
and cold sources have lower regeneration
it<00:06:19.910> can<00:06:20.120> also<00:06:20.270> be<00:06:20.510> from<00:06:20.750> items<00:06:21.110> because<00:06:21.440> the

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
it can also be from items because the

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.140 
it can also be from items because the
cold<00:06:21.830> sores<00:06:22.040> would<00:06:22.220> for<00:06:22.460> example<00:06:22.490> use<00:06:23.120> a

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
cold sores would for example use a

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.100 
cold sores would for example use a
fathom<00:06:23.750> while<00:06:25.420> fire<00:06:26.420> source<00:06:26.720> will<00:06:26.930> use<00:06:27.080> a

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
fathom while fire source will use a
