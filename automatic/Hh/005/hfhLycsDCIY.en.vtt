want to show you one of our irrigation

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.570 
want to show you one of our irrigation
systems<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.470> we<00:00:07.680> have<00:00:07.859> available<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
systems that we have available on the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.530 
systems that we have available on the
website<00:00:09.000> it's<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.050> solar<00:00:10.380> water<00:00:11.130> timer<00:00:11.540> so

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
website it's the solar water timer so

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.180 
website it's the solar water timer so
you<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.780> see<00:00:12.929> it's<00:00:13.139> set<00:00:13.290> up<00:00:13.440> here<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.769> front<00:00:13.950> of

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
you can see it's set up here in front of

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.419 
you can see it's set up here in front of
me

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
me

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.580 
me
we've<00:00:14.730> already<00:00:14.940> set<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.839> go<00:00:15.870> off<00:00:16.049> during

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
we've already set this to go off during

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.529 
we've already set this to go off during
the<00:00:16.710> video<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.400> see<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:17.910> operation

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
the video so you can see it in operation

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.590 
the video so you can see it in operation
and<00:00:19.109> now<00:00:19.470> what<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.130> tool<00:00:20.789> really<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
and now what this tool really is it's a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.769 
and now what this tool really is it's a
very<00:00:21.720> handy<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.410> compact<00:00:22.890> little<00:00:23.070> device<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
very handy and compact little device and

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.500 
very handy and compact little device and
it<00:00:24.779> has<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.590> ability<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.430> morph<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.359> your

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
it has the ability to morph in your

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.819 
it has the ability to morph in your
plants<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.780> take<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.960> closer<00:00:34.290> look<00:00:34.440> here

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
plants so if we take a closer look here

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.620 
plants so if we take a closer look here
at<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> front<00:00:35.309> tire<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.239> see<00:00:36.420> on

the products I just talked you through

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.630 
the products I just talked you through
how<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.120> product<00:00:39.570> actually<00:00:39.750> works<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.640> first

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
how the product actually works so first

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.799 
how the product actually works so first
of<00:00:41.820> all<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.270> what's<00:00:42.510> called<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
of all we have what's called the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.130 
of all we have what's called the
frequency<00:00:43.379> dial<00:00:43.860> here<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> left<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.899> with

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
frequency dial here on the left and with

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.549 
frequency dial here on the left and with
that<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.620> set<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.390> how<00:00:48.390> often<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:49.110> want

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
that you can set and how often you want

00:00:49.559 --> 00:01:02.540 
that you can set and how often you want
your<00:00:49.980> water<00:00:50.219> timer<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:50.760> off

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.160 

sit<00:01:03.550> there<00:01:03.700> once<00:01:04.059> that<00:01:04.269> was<00:01:04.420> just<00:01:04.629> what<00:01:04.989> we've

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
sit there once that was just what we've

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.350 
sit there once that was just what we've
currently<00:01:05.440> set<00:01:05.800> it<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.010> will<00:01:06.190> run<00:01:06.700> every<00:01:07.000> five

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
currently set it to will run every five

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.600 
currently set it to will run every five
minutes<00:01:07.750> for<00:01:07.930> ten<00:01:08.170> seconds<00:01:08.710> just<00:01:09.250> so<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.460> can

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
minutes for ten seconds just so you can

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.750 
minutes for ten seconds just so you can
see<00:01:09.850> how<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.450> product<00:01:10.780> works<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:12.670> of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
course you can sell sooo any frequency

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.980 
course you can sell sooo any frequency
and<00:01:14.860> every<00:01:15.369> one<00:01:15.460> time<00:01:15.729> that<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:16.030> require<00:01:16.420> so

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
we'll go back here to the frequency dial

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.180 
we'll go back here to the frequency dial
and<00:01:19.540> you<00:01:19.750> can<00:01:19.930> set<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.350> go<00:01:20.380> off<00:01:20.560> every<00:01:20.830> five

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
and you can set it to go off every five

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.950 
and you can set it to go off every five
minutes<00:01:21.430> every<00:01:21.909> 10<00:01:22.180> minutes<00:01:22.509> every<00:01:22.659> 15

hours<00:01:30.310> or<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.240> can<00:01:31.390> tell<00:01:31.570> as<00:01:31.659> you<00:01:31.750> go<00:01:31.869> off<00:01:31.990> once

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
hours or you can tell as you go off once

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:48.060 
hours or you can tell as you go off once
a<00:01:32.740> day<00:01:32.890> twice<00:01:33.280> a<00:01:33.430> day<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:47.110> then<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.590> run<00:01:47.770> time

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
a day twice a day and then the run time

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.889 
a day twice a day and then the run time
is<00:01:48.280> how<00:01:48.520> long<00:01:48.729> run<00:01:49.509> for<00:01:51.330> anywhere<00:01:52.330> from<00:01:52.570> 10

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
is how long run for anywhere from 10

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.639 
is how long run for anywhere from 10
seconds<00:01:53.530> all<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.979> way<00:01:54.070> up<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.960> 15<00:01:55.960> minutes<00:01:56.380> to

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
seconds all the way up to 15 minutes to

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.770 
seconds all the way up to 15 minutes to
an<00:01:57.340> hour<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:59.710> 2<00:01:59.950> hours<00:02:00.159> of<00:02:00.310> run<00:02:00.820> time<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:01.780> we

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
an hour and to 2 hours of run time so we

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.080 
an hour and to 2 hours of run time so we
fine-tune<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.929> and<00:02:05.110> set<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.649> whatever

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
fine-tune it and set it to whatever

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.850 
fine-tune it and set it to whatever
timing<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.239> want<00:02:07.479> for<00:02:07.780> your<00:02:07.959> own<00:02:08.170> greenhouse

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
timing you want for your own greenhouse

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.640 
timing you want for your own greenhouse
or<00:02:09.220> polytunnel<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.840> it's<00:02:10.989> a<00:02:11.050> convenient<00:02:11.380> and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650
