earth quakes Central America did
continue<00:02:44.739> rocking<00:02:45.340> for<00:02:45.549> a<00:02:45.609> little<00:02:45.730> bit<00:02:46.000> and

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
continue rocking for a little bit and

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.179 
continue rocking for a little bit and
Oklahoma<00:02:47.739> so<00:02:48.510> baking<00:02:49.510> but<00:02:50.019> uh<00:02:50.079> no<00:02:50.680> more<00:02:50.859> six

pointers<00:02:51.669> like<00:02:51.849> we<00:02:51.969> had<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.299> last<00:02:52.480> days<00:02:53.199> let's

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
pointers like we had the last days let's

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.349 
pointers like we had the last days let's
quickly<00:02:54.189> move<00:02:54.459> over<00:02:54.699> to<00:02:54.819> space<00:02:55.090> weather

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
quickly move over to space weather

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.209 
quickly move over to space weather
there's<00:02:55.930> not<00:02:56.019> much<00:02:56.349> to<00:02:56.530> report<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.010> solar

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:57.219 
there's not much to report the solar

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.740 
there's not much to report the solar
flare<00:02:57.549> has<00:02:57.760> been<00:02:57.969> on<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.120> major<00:02:58.419> decline

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
flare has been on a major decline

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.050 
flare has been on a major decline
especially<00:02:59.409> as<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.650> big<00:02:59.829> sunspots<00:03:00.430> departed

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
especially as the big sunspots departed

especially as the big sunspots departed
this<00:03:01.870> little<00:03:02.199> grouping<00:03:02.530> hear<00:03:03.010> this<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:03.879> looks

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
this little grouping hear this and looks

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.689 
this little grouping hear this and looks
like<00:03:04.900> we<00:03:05.019> may<00:03:05.199> have<00:03:05.230> one<00:03:05.620> cresting<00:03:06.219> right<00:03:06.459> now

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:06.699 
like we may have one cresting right now

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.390 
like we may have one cresting right now
but<00:03:06.939> all<00:03:07.150> in<00:03:07.359> all<00:03:07.480> we're<00:03:08.199> back<00:03:08.469> to<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.739> blank<00:03:09.069> Sun

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
but all in all we're back to a blank Sun

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.860 
but all in all we're back to a blank Sun
the<00:03:10.269> main<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:12.280> main<00:03:12.310> thing<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.299> we<00:03:13.419> to<00:03:13.629> talk

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
the main the main thing that we to talk

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.439 
the main the main thing that we to talk
about<00:03:14.019> is<00:03:14.379> we<00:03:14.769> did<00:03:15.069> take<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:16.030> bit<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.269> an

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:16.449 
about is we did take a bit of an

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:20.129 
about is we did take a bit of an
interplanetary<00:03:16.959> shock<00:03:17.680> yesterday<00:03:18.419> but<00:03:19.419> it

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
interplanetary shock yesterday but it

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.689 
interplanetary shock yesterday but it
may<00:03:20.709> have<00:03:20.829> been<00:03:20.919> a<00:03:21.009> little<00:03:21.099> more<00:03:21.459> than<00:03:21.669> the

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:21.699 
may have been a little more than the

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.999 
may have been a little more than the
coronal<00:03:22.269> mass<00:03:22.449> ejection<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.259> as<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.799> can<00:03:23.979> see

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:24.009 
coronal mass ejection and as you can see

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.089 
coronal mass ejection and as you can see
updates<00:03:25.019> pretty<00:03:26.019> dynamically<00:03:26.620> every<00:03:26.889> five

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
updates pretty dynamically every five

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.809 
updates pretty dynamically every five
minutes<00:03:27.370> there<00:03:27.720> but<00:03:29.069> what<00:03:30.069> I<00:03:30.099> commented

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
minutes there but what I commented

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.819 
minutes there but what I commented
before<00:03:30.970> was<00:03:31.389> that<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.659> CM<00:03:32.019> e<00:03:32.139> looked<00:03:32.379> so<00:03:32.590> weak

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
before was that the CM e looked so weak

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.619 
before was that the CM e looked so weak
we<00:03:33.009> might<00:03:33.220> not<00:03:33.370> even<00:03:33.430> be<00:03:33.759> able<00:03:33.939> to<00:03:34.120> notice<00:03:34.419> it

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
we might not even be able to notice it

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.710 
we might not even be able to notice it
amidst<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.139> telemetry<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:36.030> we<00:03:37.030> indeed<00:03:37.449> were

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
amidst the telemetry and we indeed were

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.240 
amidst the telemetry and we indeed were
able<00:03:38.079> to<00:03:38.229> notice<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:38.769> I<00:03:38.859> don't<00:03:39.009> know<00:03:39.099> if<00:03:39.189> you

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
able to notice it I don't know if you

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.999 
able to notice it I don't know if you
guys<00:03:39.400> can<00:03:39.669> see<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.750> routing<00:03:41.470> right<00:03:41.739> there

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:42.009 
guys can see that I routing right there

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:44.009 
guys can see that I routing right there
that<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.310> what<00:03:42.729> calling<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.389> interplanetary

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
and as you guys know you can't have part

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.819

it arrive later it doesn't make sense so

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.800 
it arrive later it doesn't make sense so
what<00:04:01.870> this<00:04:02.109> is<00:04:02.349> right<00:04:02.590> here<00:04:02.949> speed<00:04:03.759> dense<00:04:04.090> a

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
really hit KP for let's take a look at

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.710 
really hit KP for let's take a look at
the<00:04:35.680> last<00:04:35.830> 24<00:04:36.400> hours<00:04:36.430> of<00:04:36.699> our<00:04:36.910> star<00:04:37.330> here<00:04:37.630> to

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
the last 24 hours of our star here to

the last 24 hours of our star here to
close<00:04:38.009> no<00:04:39.009> eruption<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:41.050> coronal<00:04:41.530> hole<00:04:41.650> that

close no eruption the coronal hole that

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.219 
close no eruption the coronal hole that
we<00:04:41.889> are<00:04:42.039> taking<00:04:42.370> remember<00:04:42.970> this<00:04:43.360> one<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:44.050> see

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
we are taking remember this one you see

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.100 
we are taking remember this one you see
up<00:04:44.350> down<00:04:44.530> south<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.220> U<00:04:45.699> shape<00:04:45.729> and<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:47.050> was

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
up down south is a U shape and this was

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.140 
up down south is a U shape and this was
facing<00:04:47.680> or<00:04:47.800> three<00:04:48.100> days<00:04:48.280> ago<00:04:48.490> I<00:04:48.610> imagine

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
facing or three days ago I imagine

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.820 
facing or three days ago I imagine
that's<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.539> coronal<00:04:49.990> stream<00:04:50.380> we're<00:04:50.500> taking

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
that's the coronal stream we're taking

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.129 
that's the coronal stream we're taking
right<00:04:50.979> now<00:04:51.009> we<00:04:51.789> should<00:04:51.820> expect<00:04:52.419> maybe<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:52.990> see

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
right now we should expect maybe to see

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.050 
right now we should expect maybe to see
something<00:04:53.440> from<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:53.919> can't<00:04:54.759> wait<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:54.940> see

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
something from this can't wait to see

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.300 
something from this can't wait to see
the<00:04:55.240> rest<00:04:55.360> of<00:04:55.539> that<00:04:55.720> coronal<00:04:56.110> hole<00:04:56.310> filaments

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
the rest of that coronal hole filaments

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.950 
the rest of that coronal hole filaments
are<00:04:57.400> still<00:04:57.639> there<00:04:57.759> now<00:04:58.000> I'm<00:04:58.150> really<00:04:58.600> starting

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
are still there now I'm really starting

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.420 
are still there now I'm really starting
to<00:04:59.020> all<00:04:59.229> this<00:04:59.440> one<00:04:59.650> that's<00:04:59.830> a<00:04:59.949> pretty<00:05:00.160> big

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
to all this one that's a pretty big

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.089 
to all this one that's a pretty big
filament<00:05:01.000> we<00:05:01.660> have<00:05:01.750> another<00:05:01.960> one<00:05:02.199> up<00:05:02.410> here<00:05:02.650> all

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
filament we have another one up here all
