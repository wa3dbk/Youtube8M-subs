 I will never forget that they drive me crazy and 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.810
 I can not control myself and that look that 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.509
 when they saw themselves in, it was those eyes 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.090
 which made me apologize if sometimes I 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.880
 I do reanimate it is that jealousy is not 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.310

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.770
 suffer for nonsense I want to see you very 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.320

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.820
 way of kissing when you caress me already 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.090
 is your way of speaking your breath 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.690
 your tender look and your voice is if you're 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.880

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.310

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.190
 heart calms down you're the side 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.760

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.549

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.010
 You lose my fear if I do not have you 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.500

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.260
 brain to seize or the shrill 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.000
 seats to deny today I want you to know 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.459
 that you always love 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.159
 stay in my life and ximo world madness 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.680
 indomitable things do not doubt the tumult 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:00.069
 marking forever jumping that way 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.900

 until the death of my local stables 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.489
 I 'm sorry we got all of them 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.709

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.950

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.250
