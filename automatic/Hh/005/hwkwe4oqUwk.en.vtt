 the egg 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.460

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.670
 once we have that mixture a little 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.970
 whitish we will add the yogurt and return 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.970
 to mix 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.470
 and we have mixed we will add these 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.470
 karina dry products etc 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.479
 is running out of sugar 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.490
 the chemical yeast a teaspoon 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.050
 and a pinch of salt 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.050
 and now to mix 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.600
 short 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.690
 as you see to finish mixing the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.730
 mass we have used an opportunity and 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.010
 once we have mixed it we are going to 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.830
 put into the tray now we explain how 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.540
 we do 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.580
 to train we need to use are 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.720
 two teaspoons in this case are going to be 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.220
 great because we're going to make them more 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.660
 great but if you want small faces 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.250
 you have to listen to smaller 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.970
 everything just needs to take a portion 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.870
 of dough 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.650
 we'll go 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.580
 putting in our baking tray 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.930
 remembered by the avastin of separated 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.720
 because if you do not get it right you're going to 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.090
 inflate a little and they will stay stuck 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.500
 one another in the auction that forms 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.299
 be perfect since the balloon in the oven 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.299
 it will swell by themselves 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.879
 cabbage 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.250
 as you see we have in our cookies 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.550
 that we have decorated with a loss of 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.140
 chocolate to make it more beautiful 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.270
 the oven claims preheated to 180 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.730
 degrees for about 10 minutes and 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.650
 let's put the cookies 180 degrees 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.960
 for 8 or 10 minutes until they are 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.100
 a little bit of the diet and remember that it is 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.900
 realistic does not have to look like much of 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.490
 cooking if they do not stay very dry they have 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.340
 to be very fluffy inside 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.019
 juicy so let's tell the oven 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.760
 As you can see here we have already measures 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.069
 what we have done at the first time and 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.090
 then we have lined up in one more tray 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.830
 only we have left to do a little 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.709
 after removing them from the oven and now 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.950
