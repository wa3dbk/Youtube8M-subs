00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:08.269
 far in the east behind mountains and feet 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.860
 is a lonely single mountain the 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.880
 Dwarves are determined theirs 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.880
 to conquer homeland back 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.050
 I appreciate visiting as well as everyone 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.640
 others hobbit even more 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.720
 I guess to know him there before 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.090
 visited me 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.119
 so I let myself be surrounded by plants 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.520
 are a whole happy gathering like that 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.230
 that's the hobbit you asked me for 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.819
 the fourteenth one for your expedition 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.620
 to find and my choice fell to one 

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:38.569
 do not bag it yet no no everything 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.249
 come and pass by most unseen 

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:41.629
 If you want it, give us one 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:45.550
 give clear advantage 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.550
 We take this chance and pick us up 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.920
 ask why the half left why bilbo 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.219
 beutlin 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:06.220
 maybe because I'm scared and he 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:08.530
 So, give more courage this is yours 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.690
 you want to penetrate a mountain 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.440
 and if some would do that 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.110
 not references consider a dark one 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:31.360
 Power has found a way back in 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:41.530
 the world why thinks beutlin project 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:43.420
 I would not cheer me up 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.960
 as this calls forth two mightiest 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.960
 prefer 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.869
 a fighter heart 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.869
 I can not ask for more 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.640
 the home is not just behind you 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.640
 the world 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:19.370
 can come it could have been worse but 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.370
 both a joke
