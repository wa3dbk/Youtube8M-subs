00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.240
 It looks like it's also outside 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:09.700
 This time 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:14.910
 It is a life had been minute beach you You know the last time 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.890
 But this is I'm using a little recently pretty 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.060
 Over and that life heh 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:27.689
 The lowest cost per person 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.369
 It's quite cheap, so I think that depending on the situation there will be a lot of money that can be used so it's a bit offensive once 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.910
 I will try to go 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.780
 It is the Yappa Roque bread's 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.850

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.850

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:55.370
 This kind of place I guess this month this little equipment but I have a place which is adjacent 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:59.739
 By'm given damage to the forecast of the equipment and the aim during its just 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.739
 I think it is better to go there 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.290
 Use your shop to attack your opponent 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:14.299

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.550
 [musics] 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.750
 A bit another way 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.810
 At the commander level now 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.810
 By 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.790
 4 weeks and 3 years 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.640
