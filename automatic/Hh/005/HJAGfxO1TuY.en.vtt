00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
one much easier to activate and of

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.469 
one much easier to activate and of
course<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.830> plate<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.430> flies<00:01:26.820> out<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.330> those

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
course the plate just flies out on those

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.039 
course the plate just flies out on those
bearings<00:01:31.130> fantastic<00:01:32.130> flipper<00:01:32.630> feels<00:01:33.630> great

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
bearings fantastic flipper feels great

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.260 
bearings fantastic flipper feels great
in<00:01:34.290> hand<00:01:34.640> it's<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.700> little<00:01:35.729> bit<00:01:36.000> thicker

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
in hand it's a little bit thicker

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.230 
in hand it's a little bit thicker
overall<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> pocket<00:01:39.990> clip<00:01:40.670> is<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
overall and the pocket clip is not the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.980 
overall and the pocket clip is not the
standard<00:01:42.450> ZT<00:01:43.200> finish<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.310> looks<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.670> it's

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
standard ZT finish it looks like it's

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.700 
standard ZT finish it looks like it's
it's<00:01:45.990> got<00:01:46.229> some<00:01:46.500> stone<00:01:46.979> wash<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.579> it

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
it's got some stone wash to it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.960 
it's got some stone wash to it
so<00:01:49.710> hopefully<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.430> will<00:01:50.490> hold<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.939> better

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
so hopefully that will hold up better

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.109 
so hopefully that will hold up better
than<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.540> standard<00:01:51.780> ZT<00:01:52.670> or<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.759> least<00:01:53.939> you

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
than the standard ZT or at least you

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.240 
than the standard ZT or at least you
know<00:01:54.240> as<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.810> wears<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.560> won't<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:55.979> as

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
know as it wears in it won't be as

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.870 
know as it wears in it won't be as
annoying<00:01:58.310> screws<00:01:59.310> look<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.729> they're

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
annoying screws look like they're

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.160 
annoying screws look like they're
probably<00:02:00.119> gonna<00:02:00.360> rub<00:02:00.930> off<00:02:01.700> standard<00:02:02.869> CT<00:02:03.869> black

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
probably gonna rub off standard CT black

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.490 
probably gonna rub off standard CT black
butter<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.500> call<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.990> rubs<00:02:06.990> off<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.469> butter

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
butter I call it rubs off like butter

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.130 
butter I call it rubs off like butter
but<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.399> knife<00:02:10.640> just<00:02:10.670> feels<00:02:11.510> great<00:02:11.900> in<00:02:12.110> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
but the knife just feels great in the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.760 
but the knife just feels great in the
hand<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:13.240> little<00:02:14.240> bit<00:02:14.390> bigger<00:02:15.070> overall<00:02:16.070> a

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
hand a little bit bigger overall a

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.490 
hand a little bit bigger overall a
little<00:02:18.770> wider<00:02:18.950> here<00:02:20.290> everything's<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.380> little

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
little wider here everything's a little

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.150 
little wider here everything's a little
thicker<00:02:21.890> on<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:23.230> which<00:02:24.230> actually<00:02:24.800> makes<00:02:25.010> it

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
thicker on it which actually makes it

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.680 
thicker on it which actually makes it
feel<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.640> little<00:02:25.880> bit<00:02:26.030> better<00:02:26.180> in<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> hand<00:02:26.630> to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
feel a little bit better in the hand to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.220 
feel a little bit better in the hand to
me<00:02:27.430> another<00:02:28.430> comparison<00:02:29.030> here<00:02:29.240> would<00:02:29.330> be<00:02:29.450> a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:41.380 

Mannix<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:35.170> very<00:02:36.170> comfortable<00:02:36.890> knife<00:02:40.390> this

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
Mannix to very comfortable knife this

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.630 
Mannix to very comfortable knife this
one<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.930> air<00:02:42.080> goes<00:02:42.320> are<00:02:42.470> just<00:02:42.680> much<00:02:43.400> more

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
one in the air goes are just much more

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.360 
one in the air goes are just much more
form-fitting<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:48.380> MINIX<00:02:48.680> dude<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.280> know

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
form-fitting the MINIX dude you know

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.010 
form-fitting the MINIX dude you know
great<00:02:49.700> knife<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:50.590> think<00:02:51.590> anybody<00:02:53.020> disagrees

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
great knife I think anybody disagrees

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.630 
great knife I think anybody disagrees
with<00:02:54.050> that<00:02:54.200> but<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.740> does<00:02:54.950> take<00:02:55.160> up<00:02:55.340> quite<00:02:55.520> a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
with that but it does take up quite a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.920 
with that but it does take up quite a
bit<00:02:55.880> of<00:02:55.970> room<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.360> pocket

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.140 

so<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.230> see<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.870> difference<00:03:02.870> there<00:03:03.110> and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
so this see the difference there and

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.060 
so this see the difference there and
with<00:03:05.150> this<00:03:05.690> way<00:03:07.600> for<00:03:08.600> what<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:08.900> get<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.980> of

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
with this way for what you get and of

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.910 
with this way for what you get and of
course<00:03:10.280> it's<00:03:10.630> quite<00:03:11.630> a<00:03:11.660> bit<00:03:11.810> more<00:03:11.990> expensive

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.630
