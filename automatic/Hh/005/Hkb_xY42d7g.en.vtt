00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.210
 some comments that have warned me 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.789
 that I followed you had implemented 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.760
 build battle and I wanted to upload it 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.619

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.239

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.710
 before massive a number of comments 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.589

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.239

 server for version 1.7 and 1.8 x 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.750
 it's worth that there's been some other 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.450
 comment that he had asked me to 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.399

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.770

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.469
 bates with all the version at 1.7 and 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.410
