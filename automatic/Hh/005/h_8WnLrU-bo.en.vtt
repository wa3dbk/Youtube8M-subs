00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.379
 yes yes here is fishy down with question that 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.500
 a boy, yes, again for a month 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.900
 last uploaded and before 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.749
 the people who don't know I 'm going there 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.410
 explain it completely again it is mainly 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:31.490
 is just yes okay plays a matter of life 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.079
 in speaking what 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.500
 yes they achieved will be free for all 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.170
 competition involving at least a two point 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.539
 zero ratio must win 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.410
 it's my very first series that i put on 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:47.930
 my channel started yes and so does it 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.769
 for a year now say about two 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.269
 years time I think so and you want 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.100
 last week of course a bee 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.469
 seen a summary of mine 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.219
 year you to better and yes youtube mean 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.620
 saw 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.260
 naturally also follows the first 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.690
 part two will let donating 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.140
 my first fisherman to say yes contest 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.970
 but you were mostly a dream contest 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.630
 of course a b3 then I have to whole 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.000
 done a lot of folders in b3 and am 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.369
 of course continue with blackops 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.049
 two began to speak out but as 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.390
 you know yes black or streak 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.729
 I just don't play that anymore that sorry 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.259
 I just don't really care about them 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.540
 don't think the people that possible 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.670
 lead my channel hear it only gijs 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.299
 food 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:40.270
 What a way and also not blackops 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:42.850
 two more well we will continue 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.119
 that was very important their language and it 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.560
 whole path the tactics I picked up 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.930
 a ship without a net scaler 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.940
 by the way it will know i have a 9 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.670
 achieved 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.680
 concerning my beginning did not really go well either 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.930
 very much for one really went for just 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.620
 harder to get high scores 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.090
 but that is not smooth in the beginning then 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.790
 I don't play this with a real one 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.070
 auxiliary point 4 ratios node four or 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.130
 five and so and then it just took 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.740
 forty thousand kills where is at 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.940
 then again in a the uraad show 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.720
 come 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.170
 now also make that steel for me 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.280
 i have to tell you if i just think there 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.280
 towards it for sure 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.300
 Yes 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.160
 Some drawbacks of van MB2 remains 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.020
 of course everything should let apache 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.270
 fall away and still want to make 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.060
 jet look for the combination of my arm 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.840
 baby close we are actually going specifically 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.660
 to 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.470
 danger close danger close school but 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:55.300
 say order with a bluetooth or I will shoot 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:58.540
 the curves as around and 10% extra strong 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.900
 and that disadvantage with that 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:08.110
 er supporting you had that is also super 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:12.760
 strong and yes that remains one 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.620
 big disadvantage in this game but i became you 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.760
 flush large and on the mat than their 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.400
 and super bad 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.909
 cunt and so naturally we go roughly the 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.939
 the match oh hey what's up yummy 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.590
 just don't go after a child 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.420
 and you are going to see it i am just going 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.329
 children then that is pretty special 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.090
 because I now only have 8 ilse head 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.829
 so yes if you serve another mole then 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.989
 a lot has to be said and done 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.650
 that against tricks and get you tricks 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.849
 strictly meet 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.709
 that is one of the most important things 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:48.299
 that you have to do 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.670
 in mb2 i play with the predator missal 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.049
 then the hair again and then I play 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.090
 with the has logical combination to 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.139
 just to make kills with you 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.349
 killstreaks 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:05.639
 and just plays a lot of fun with the mp 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.069
 on people who may not recognize 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.780
 that proposition with the ump with sign there 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.380
 one of the best anywhere 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.780
 in terms of weapons and so I am 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.450
 is for me with my cd is only for me 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.280
 use almost even heal my case 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.660
 is doing that with perth 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.150
 slider yes yes i can also scan the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.470
 user makes so much I think 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.130
 I want to be there soon so one free 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.560
 small gent and then stopping power 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.690
 you really have to have that 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.150
 and v2 is really the turn you need 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.060
 have found stopping power and here 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:51.190
 You could also put another through walls 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:57.040
 Peter Lakes pens parties and if so 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:59.290
 you just play with some but it 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.780
 they so war individually black red 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.660
 can play white but I need you 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.200
 to be honest I don't really think so 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.960
 yes van schie especially match that 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.850
 one time that doesn't matter much 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.530
 Before you can say nematodes 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.550
 skillsource and better 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.990
 she couldn't put anything on 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.940
 just play again with stop it 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.260
 building and I also play a view 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.260
 Yes correct 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.560
 you no longer hear that 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.240
 and yes that is just plain 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.580
 nice of course also a hefty one 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.820
 knows them easily to hold many 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.810
 practice so long 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:47.840
 others need rowing 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.520
 I put her to play the mania 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.560
 of course it also saw campers ocean at 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.560
 on and btm one i can help you 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.490
 what does god want the icon to be a pity 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.540
 that just a lot of alcohol bike that 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.380
 schools 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:06.080
 very much is made 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.870
 yes they say they are about to what 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.060
 it makes you eat except you must 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.550
 just don't 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.530
 there is not all close I understand you 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.980
 like to sleep so yes then they would 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.900
 in this case everyone is sharpening 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.120
 in fact the pp is almost back again 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.030
 and the me must be sufficient 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.590
 back and we have draw definer you see 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:32.600
 der 8 I really think it would be in between 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.370
 say give me a thumbs up and the 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.200
 compote more new official because I have 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.010
 also picked up several other gps 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.240
 mbt 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.840
 says something as always until the next 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.020
 times apparently 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.020
 on
