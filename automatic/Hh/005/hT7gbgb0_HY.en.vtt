00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.090
 hello today I'm going to prepare some cookies 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:08.200
 with puff pastry are very easy and 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.320
 they are very rich 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:15.830
 we need the dough some pine nuts 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.340
 laminated almonds grated theater 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.779
 a little cinnamon sugar fat squares 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.239
 of almond and anise 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.210
 sesame what you want this is very 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:33.500
 easy you can put what you have by hand 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.270
 at home the oven preheats to 200 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.220
 degrees then at the time of putting the 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.390
 we went up a little bit more 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.910
 the mass we treat the stretching we put 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.470
 fat sugar instead of flour 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.470
 to stretch it a little 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.720
 we put a little bit on the roller too 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.270
 so that the 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.270
 the mass and stretch it 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:17.740
 we put the kitchen paper where we are going 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.400
 of the bad turn and remove the paper 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.400
 what he brings 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.480
 back to pour more sugar gras 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.200
 and we stretch again a little bit 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.710
 so they are not too fat 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.710
 Once the dough is thrown we mark 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.980
 to cut then the cookies come 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.030
 the size that you think you want big 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.030
 small regular 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.790
 we have to click very well so that 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:09.310
 climb as little as possible if there are no 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:13.040
 too much now we throw more icing sugar 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.880
 the amount that each one wants according to you 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.880
 like the sweet 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.629
 let's make half of coconut pine nuts and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.629
 anise is 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.320
 of coconut then it is very rich we give it 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.320
 something very rich a little bit of anise is 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.640
 ah 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.640
 and the linear ones above 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.849
 how to see that opinion is a little bit 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.250
 I'm going to take a few cubes of 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.370
 crispy almond and that is coming coast 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.099

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.150

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.150
 little bit of sesame 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.430
 a little cinnamon 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.980
 and the rolled almonds 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.630
 and now I tapped him with the 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.290
 roll so that it stays stuck that does not 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:52.040
 let go by the way and we've already 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.040
 I raised the oven to 220 and we put it 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.220

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.200
