00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 in today's video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.730
 to make the milk that came out in a video 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.410
 that a few weeks ago and I 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.059
 They all asked how milk is 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.889
 birdseed it is to lose weight because 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.599
 is that I get fat since it has some 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.910
 enzymes that help us burn fat 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.949
 in excess we have and it 's very good 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.740
 true then first before 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.539
 start with the preparation to spend it 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.100
 chetout finite steak please be 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.080
 subscribe to the part below for 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.670
 that many of these videos reach you and 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.349
 also tell them that the milk can 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.849
 they have to take right at the moment 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.130
 they get up before breakfast 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.079
 before lunch and before dinner I 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.989
 I only take it twice a day and I do not 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.250
 It is recommended that you always take it 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.930
 then if they take it for the organs 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.700
 It's fine but I do not know what can happen 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.780
 that you start losing too much weight 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.910
 then you have to have a little bit of 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.649
 care of the kiss and so we will learn 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.079
 to make the milk canary seed just let's 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.090
 need birdseed for human consumption and 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.699
 a liter and a little more water 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.469
 to put in a small container a little 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.370
 of water and now what we are going to do is 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.070
 add two tablespoons full of birdseed 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.150
 one 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.040
 and two come like this if they want to can 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.500
 add three but with two is enough 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.540
 now what are we going to let this stand 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.370
 for at least 12 hours is to say that I 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.080
 I recommend that they do it at night to 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.000
 that at the time of breakfast you 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.740
 they can prepare they have already passed the 12 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.590
 hours and now what I'm going to do is 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.270
 strain to remove all the water is 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.830
 well, we are going to use it 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.830
 I'm going to strain absolutely everything 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.100
 and ready that I have the birdseed that 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.569
 strained and now I'm going to put everything in my 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.789
 blender since I have a liter of water 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.450
 and I'm going to put a little bit more for 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.430
 start liquefying 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.840
 and with this little bit of water I start 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.840
 liquefy for 30 seconds 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.729
 Now I'm going to add the excess water 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.729
 that is , what is left of the liter of water 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.399
 and now I'm going to liquefy for 2 minutes 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.399
 I looked 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.979
 and ready we have almost done our 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.429
 canary seed milk and now the only thing 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.850
 I'm going to do is pass this through the colander 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.520
 to avoid impurities 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.960
 ready we will be here here already have 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.020
 milk canary ready to consume 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.760
 but it is the one that also exceeds what 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.380
 we can do an exfoliant only 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.270
 we add a little honey and we already have 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.220
 an exfoliant for our skin so 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.570
 you know nothing is bounced he recommends you 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.460
 before the take is the is a 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.730
 go back with the spoon so you do not 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.960
 nod and you're ready to take and 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.960
 to help you lose weight 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.879
 and me 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.260
 super simple you know you have to 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.300
 use the birdseed that is for consumption 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.010
 human is not necessary to eat the birds and 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.530
 that I would recommend that you not look for 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.760
 in the stores of the Chinese because I know 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.710
 that will ask me that question and well 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.120
 find in a chinese store kevin or 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.710
 also the supermarkets or in the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.940
 health food stores and if I expect them 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.320
 have liked the video and have not 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.910
 only milk canary because also 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.470
 has nutrients and I 'm sure there will be 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.210
 people who will ask me if it is that 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.620
 they can use is a garment or sugar 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.600
 true that sugar I do not recommend it if 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.670
 they want to lose weight the plants and not 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.650
 can be used but at the moment that 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.020
 you are going to just drink 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.700
 then there they will add the do not leave 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.380
 release nothing but milk 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.270
 alpiste that remained in his jar and what 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.280
 they can put a refrigerator obviously 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.540
 so that you do not mistreat yourself then essence 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.760
