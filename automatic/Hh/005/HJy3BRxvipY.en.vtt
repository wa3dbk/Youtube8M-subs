can be really nice to have of course and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.150 
can be really nice to have of course and
I<00:00:36.690> should<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.380> looked<00:00:37.590> at<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.770> before<00:00:37.950> I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
I should have looked at that before I

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.069 
I should have looked at that before I
did<00:00:38.400> the<00:00:38.520> video<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:39.060> I<00:00:39.090> can't<00:00:39.450> remember<00:00:39.750> their

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
did the video but I can't remember their

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.280 
did the video but I can't remember their
names<00:00:40.290> right<00:00:40.560> now<00:00:40.739> ah<00:00:41.010> that's<00:00:41.730> not<00:00:41.940> good<00:00:42.150> huh

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
names right now ah that's not good huh

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.720 
names right now ah that's not good huh
and<00:00:43.710> then<00:00:44.010> there's<00:00:44.190> always<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.550> problem

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and then there's always that problem

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.700 
and then there's always that problem
because<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> names<00:00:45.810> in<00:00:46.020> Japanese<00:00:46.500> are

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
because the names in Japanese are

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.870 
because the names in Japanese are
different<00:00:47.010> than<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> names<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.580> English

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
different than the names in English

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.370 
different than the names in English
sometimes<00:00:48.330> so<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.350> be

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
sometimes so you know that can be

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.650 
sometimes so you know that can be
confusing<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.100> like<00:00:50.790> always<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.480> these

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
confusing but like always with these

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.980 
confusing but like always with these
