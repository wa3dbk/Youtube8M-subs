00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.320
 anticipated on the facebook page a 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.540

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.960
 probably yes with other youtuber's 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.150
 which I will not tell you 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.650

 it will be beautiful I hope not to be ashamed 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.459
 because an account is when he was standing 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.150
 in front of the webcam and certainly not cheering 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.410
 as often then a fool and when 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.120
 stadium and in front of the public are a bit 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.690
 strange you have the rumors there 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.700
 version remains cannot stand at the end e 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.380

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.940

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.760
 del carroccio is like everyone tells me 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.860
 I say how low you are and you like it 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.380
 no I don't like it and then with paolo 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.480
 I will also be at the Spice Comics on the 9th 10th 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.269
 May there will also be teheran you do 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.190
 soon there will be the comedian and the isi casse 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.880
 turn as usual take a ride 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.920
 and even there one believes it will whisk then new 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.570
 from the channel now organized a little while 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.120
 the forecast of my youtube channel 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.320
 because I want to structure it in a way 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.959
 bit different from how it was up 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.800
 now he has tested 500,000 lists 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.380
 that tremble because the cores I had the 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.299
 logo was can very confusing void e 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.340
 trying to reduce we say legalissima 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.690
 because to see we say from the new 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.910
 layout given on the home 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.380
 a little less playlist because I want to 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.239
 try to get over the channel like two 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.940
 already anticipated with a magical place on the 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.590
 facebook page more on appearance 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.760
 music that waited for me, I like it 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.090
 more because we say when we do 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.180
 this feeling economy however when 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.660
 I mount and when I upload a music video 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.660
 and go 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.420
 but that shuddering inside of me today 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.010
 now I load it 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.450
 hate it if we think about this 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.670
 like audio but wo n't like audio ha 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.890
 sung very badly and that of the species 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.810
 of anxiety but it is also pleasant and it is 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.120
 the only meaning this is the feeling 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.010
 which I feel is beautiful and loaded 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.550
 video on the staff you know it is one too 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.800
 beautiful stele that fosters and pushes you 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.810
 wants to tell these in the test 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.760
 only more with songs like le 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.770
 songs like music videos I make 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.880
 more than maybe with the gameplay wants 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.370
 etc. etc. 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.720
 so expect an increase of mine 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.299
 musical activity and over twenty of 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.070
 frog defense skill of the montages let's say 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.840
 when we want to call that the play of 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.519
 things those things we 're doing 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.160
 new we say yes to some taken from 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.540
 stream that I do to send cuts 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.070
 I respect things because sometimes they come 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.810
 funny and sorry to leave it like that 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.130
 throw in nothing to donate 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.810
 low quality of the streams until 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.100
 no sides of the species partner arrive 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.100
 I have to keep the quality low because 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.110
 otherwise not everyone can watch 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.270
 the stream because not everyone at least with 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.340
 insertable as your initials sorry 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.020
 however in short it is worth having fun 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.060
 well and then there will be as usual 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.680
 all the various jan cohorts of lol cases 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.820
 will therefore remain league of legends is not 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.140
 which did not abandon him is not that he is not there 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.270
 I play more than I want to do some 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.740
 I don't want to just copy myself 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.419
 then otherwise it becomes a fashion 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.340
 it becomes boring and becomes like the channel 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.680
 stall that always does the same things 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.470
 after a few names the fuck i was wanting 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.460
 that your cock is breathless because 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.440
 because I'm that kind of people too 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.300
 when it makes others happy 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.560
 happy even herself therefore if you 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.480
 you are finished I am happy for this 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.340
 I always keep that feedback 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.330
 I always tend to always reply to you 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.100
 all messages on the facebook page 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.330
 a board of action seems to be coming 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.150
 I reply to all lose all 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.070
 morning dust to write things to 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.080

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.120
 facebook page let you know that they are there 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.919

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.540
 van de paris that often come to me and 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.860
 how it occurred to you to do the 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.540
 I already have billeri acer in the songs 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.919
 carcinogenic the songs this crap 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.450
 that you come to mind this I go 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.740
 very simply I am used to a 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.480
 environment with my work and to do us 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.750
 Speech therapist I am used to an environment 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.430
 a little more serious, however, he does not find 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.280
 with a professional minimum and this 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.420
 professionalism will kill two personalities 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.610
 delayed as you can see ie me 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.660
 when i 'm myself i can't 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.730
 to be so in front of another person 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.540
 for those who are not ashamed of this good 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:58.300
 I can do the dick and I can 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.360
 open some yoox to be a call is 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.760
 basically then it was actually 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.580
 mine is obscene creativity combined with mine is 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.530
 delayed gene is combined with the drug a 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.150
 drug casino then all this 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.590
 time to launch it which is finished 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.320

 music video just because it's good 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.810
 I want to run away a little more 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.810
 Hello
