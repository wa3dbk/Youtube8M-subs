00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.740
 the people 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.870
 in this video I'll give a tip is the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.670
 mothers who are breastfeeding and have 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.939
 electric pump or milking 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.110
 manual is or even the little bomb 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:24.750
 manual is to freeze milk is what is 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.680
 cool I bought it on baby and also with 35 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.460
 boxes that mark the bid 9 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:37.230
 So they are in 25 little sachets. 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.239
 It's for you with John Milk so are 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.030
 nice that you take him to the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.809
 freezer if milk shot puts here leads by 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.609
 Freezer 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.559
 I chose this brand because I was 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.920
 selling easy is not be was not nothing 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.949
 so of recommendation I liked it is basic 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.649
 have other brands as well but I do not 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:07.590
 I came to use it in 25 units in 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:17.100
 every 10th box is 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:18.330
 it shows up to 180 ml much more 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:26.460
 more 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:29.730
 here รณ it you put the date the name 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:36.830
 the time and volume of milk you 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.830
 put the record is here รณ open write 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:46.140
 He has two riders in two right 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.830
 to take the air and can put it in 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.330
 Freezer 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.960
 I always put it so I'll take one more 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.150
 Sachet is one of those transparent 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.670
 inside the freezer so you do not 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.800
 have no contact really ne 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.690
 but the bag he picks me up right after 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.820
 You can do well, the sea was going to lay there. 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.100
 inside the water bath he just does not 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.560
 you can lean against the pan because 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.870
 plastic and there is no way 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.490
 Even if he's going, it's going to end up ripping. 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.060
 the ideal even 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.010
 is to freeze in the refrigerator in the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.230
 normal even after you warm the milk 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.290
 but if you need I do well not maria 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.400
 have no problem with it so 25 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.640
 units 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.790
 It was worth it was not so expensive to 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.130
 value, but because that lot of 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.170
 the glass inside the freezer and 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.400
 Another because I bought because I'm going 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.800
 send it to school 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.470
 So where do I get two sachets from each other? 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.310
 every day for her the problem is solved 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.380
 problem 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.720
 so one more tip for this brand 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.300
 here I liked other packaging 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.300
 You 're the one that we
