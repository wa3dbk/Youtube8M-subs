you can see that they definitely made an

because<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.900> virtual<00:01:10.350> machine<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.830> only

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
because the this virtual machine is only

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.550 
because the this virtual machine is only
giving<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:12.090> much<00:01:12.330> memory<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.170> isn't

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
giving it that much memory this isn't

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.950 
giving it that much memory this isn't
actually<00:01:13.710> running<00:01:14.580> again<00:01:15.000> natively<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.720> my

actually running again natively on my
Mac<00:01:16.140> Pro<00:01:17.180> see<00:01:18.180> check<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:18.750> display<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.860> can

Mac Pro see check out display you can
see<00:01:20.190> this<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.640> looks<00:01:20.850> exactly<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.540> Windows

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
see this this looks exactly like Windows

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.210 
see this this looks exactly like Windows
you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.620> select<00:01:23.190> your<00:01:23.250> screen<00:01:23.670> res<00:01:24.500> so<00:01:25.500> again

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
you can select your screen res so again

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.460 
you can select your screen res so again
I<00:01:26.250> don't<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.480> anything<00:01:27.510> to

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
I don't have to like do anything to

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.410 
I don't have to like do anything to
figure<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:29.070> how<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> use<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.060> it

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
figure out how to use this because it

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.010 
figure out how to use this because it
basically<00:01:31.050> looks<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.070> windows<00:01:32.220> XP<00:01:33.020> now

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
basically looks just like windows XP now

basically looks just like windows XP now
I'm<00:01:34.200> going<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.440> go<00:01:34.500> ahead<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.650> restart<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
I'm going to go ahead and restart it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.860 
I'm going to go ahead and restart it
here<00:01:35.520> inside<00:01:35.760> my<00:01:35.820> virtual<00:01:36.300> session<00:01:36.660> so<00:01:36.780> you

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
here inside my virtual session so you

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.630 
here inside my virtual session so you
can<00:01:36.990> see<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.290> how<00:01:37.440> incredibly<00:01:37.860> fastest

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
can see just how incredibly fastest

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.170 
can see just how incredibly fastest
thing<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.380> it's<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.620> restart<00:01:40.940> boom<00:01:41.940> boom

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
thing is it's going to restart boom boom

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.080 
thing is it's going to restart boom boom
boom

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.750 

they're<00:01:48.090> done<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.710> ever<00:01:49.920> ever<00:01:50.280> seen

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
Windows Start that fast I haven't since

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.990 
Windows Start that fast I haven't since
may<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:54.990> back<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.770> early<00:01:56.010> days<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.670> Windows

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
may be back in the early days of Windows

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.750 
may be back in the early days of Windows
I'm<00:01:57.180> talking<00:01:57.540> maybe<00:01:57.690> 95<00:01:58.409> but<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.460> never

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
I'm talking maybe 95 but I have never

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.650 
I'm talking maybe 95 but I have never
seen<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> version<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.479> Windows<00:02:00.780> boot<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.200> fast

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
seen a version of Windows boot that fast

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.359 
seen a version of Windows boot that fast
so<00:02:03.660> basically<00:02:04.140> that's<00:02:04.440> what<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.800> is<00:02:05.100> it's

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
so basically that's what this is it's

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.919 
so basically that's what this is it's
not<00:02:05.610> designed<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:08.899> something<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
takes over for Linux it's basically

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.360

things<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:33.930> react<00:02:34.320> OS<00:02:34.709> because<00:02:35.130> people<00:02:35.489> want

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
things like react OS because people want

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.190 
things like react OS because people want
something<00:02:36.330> that's<00:02:36.480> not<00:02:36.690> going<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.019> go

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
something that's not going to go

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.110 
something that's not going to go
anywhere<00:02:37.440> that's<00:02:37.920> going<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.190> maybe<00:02:38.550> not<00:02:38.880> even

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
anywhere that's going to maybe not even

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.850 
anywhere that's going to maybe not even
be<00:02:39.239> Microsoft<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.959> still<00:02:40.170> works<00:02:40.470> like<00:02:40.709> what

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
be Microsoft it still works like what

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.160 
be Microsoft it still works like what
people<00:02:41.130> are<00:02:41.220> used<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.540> based<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:42.989> my

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
people are used to and just based on my

people are used to and just based on my
clicking<00:02:43.590> around<00:02:43.680> here<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.310> looks<00:02:44.519> like<00:02:44.610> this

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
clicking around here it looks like this

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.090 
clicking around here it looks like this
is<00:02:45.600> pretty<00:02:45.959> similar<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.500> what<00:02:46.769> people<00:02:47.040> are

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
is pretty similar to what people are

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.540 
is pretty similar to what people are
used<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:48.019> it's<00:02:49.019> using<00:02:49.800> what's<00:02:49.980> called<00:02:50.040> wine

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
used to it's using what's called wine

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.430 
used to it's using what's called wine
which<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.299> way<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.810> basically<00:02:52.320> a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
which is a way it's basically a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.009 
which is a way it's basically a
programming<00:02:53.370> interface<00:02:53.730> for<00:02:54.150> Windows

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
programming interface for Windows

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.350 
programming interface for Windows
applications<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.799> Linux<00:02:56.220> but<00:02:56.489> from<00:02:57.150> my

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
applications on Linux but from my

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.720 
applications on Linux but from my
understanding<00:02:58.100> reactive<00:02:59.100> wes<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.280> not

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
understanding reactive wes is not

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.690 
understanding reactive wes is not
actually<00:03:00.620> Linux<00:03:01.620> it's<00:03:01.829> not<00:03:02.010> linux<00:03:02.340> with<00:03:02.670> a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
actually Linux it's not linux with a

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.580 
actually Linux it's not linux with a
with<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> windows<00:03:03.540> skin<00:03:03.989> on<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.200> it's<00:03:04.470> actually

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
with a windows skin on it it's actually

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.490 
with a windows skin on it it's actually
its<00:03:04.890> own<00:03:05.040> thing<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.660> I'm<00:03:06.900> going<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.110> post<00:03:07.260> some

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
its own thing so I'm going to post some

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.710 
its own thing so I'm going to post some

it running here in a vmware session so

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.720 
it running here in a vmware session so
it's<00:03:18.810> just<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.769> know<00:03:19.890> it's<00:03:19.920> very<00:03:20.519> easy

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730
