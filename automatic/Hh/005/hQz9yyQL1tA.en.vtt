00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
you're going to be wanting to click Y

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.530 
you're going to be wanting to click Y
left<00:00:40.260> bumper<00:00:40.440> Y<00:00:40.860> see<00:00:41.790> how<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.879> switch<00:00:42.149> weapons

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
left bumper Y see how I switch weapons

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
left bumper Y see how I switch weapons
right<00:00:42.690> there<00:00:42.870> well<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.920> trick<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.520> when

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
right there well the trick is is when

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
right there well the trick is is when
you<00:00:44.760> click<00:00:45.030> Y<00:00:45.510> left<00:00:45.899> bumper<00:00:46.079> Y<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.800> want<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
you click Y left bumper Y you want to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.760 
you click Y left bumper Y you want to
click<00:00:47.250> Y<00:00:47.910> left<00:00:48.329> bumper<00:00:48.510> at<00:00:48.899> relatively<00:00:49.440> about

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
click Y left bumper at relatively about

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.569 
click Y left bumper at relatively about
the<00:00:49.920> same<00:00:50.100> time<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.640> Y<00:00:50.820> first<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.890> thinks

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the same time but Y first so it thinks

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.130 
the same time but Y first so it thinks
that<00:00:53.730> you're<00:00:53.910> switching<00:00:54.300> weapons<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
that you're switching weapons but you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.439 
that you're switching weapons but you
pre<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.500> pullout<00:00:55.770> attack<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.850> cancel<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
pre a pullout attack to cancel out the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.779 
pre a pullout attack to cancel out the
motion<00:00:57.840> then<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.109> cancel<00:00:58.500> out<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.829> pack<00:00:59.160> so

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
motion then you cancel out the pack so

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.700 
motion then you cancel out the pack so
cancels<00:01:00.270> out<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> entire<00:01:00.719> motion<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.469> it

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
cancels out the entire motion of it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.160 
cancels out the entire motion of it
pulling<00:01:01.920> out<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> sniper<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.870> don't<00:01:04.049> know
