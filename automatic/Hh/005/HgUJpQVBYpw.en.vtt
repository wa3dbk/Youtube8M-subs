00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.450 
just kept the box for the purpose of
this<00:01:32.880> video<00:01:33.799> so<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> brush

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
this video so this is what the brush

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.420 
this video so this is what the brush
looks<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.299> supposed<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.689> like

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
looks like it is supposed to be like

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.380 
looks like it is supposed to be like
handheld<00:01:38.430> um<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:40.579> can<00:01:41.579> fit<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.820> your<00:01:41.850> palm<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
handheld um I can fit in your palm and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.830 
handheld um I can fit in your palm and
then<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.750> bristles<00:01:43.740> are<00:01:44.149> really<00:01:45.149> thin<00:01:45.600> and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
then the bristles are really thin and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.490 
then the bristles are really thin and
they're<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.140> different<00:01:46.170> sizes<00:01:46.909> so<00:01:48.500> basically

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
they're of different sizes so basically

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.920 
they're of different sizes so basically
it<00:01:49.740> comes<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.970> box<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.659> then<00:01:51.810> it

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it comes like this in a box and then it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.499 
it comes like this in a box and then it
has<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.619> little<00:01:53.250> card<00:01:53.939> thing<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.220 
concave design do not use with heat it's
basically<00:02:15.030> all<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.540> says<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.960> box

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
basically all that it says on the box

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.590 
basically all that it says on the box
and<00:02:16.620> then<00:02:16.880> how<00:02:17.880> did<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.030> like<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.330> little

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
and then how did you like this little

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.500 
and then how did you like this little
card<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.110> as<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:19.950> see<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.400> big<00:02:20.910> thing<00:02:21.240> is

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
card and as you can see the big thing is

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.600 
card and as you can see the big thing is
the<00:02:21.930> British<00:02:22.890> flag<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.930> think<00:02:25.710> that<00:02:26.400> this

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
the British flag so I think that this

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.490 
the British flag so I think that this
was<00:02:26.880> yeah<00:02:27.840> produced<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:30.000> UK<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.990> that's

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
was yeah produced in the UK so that's

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.870 
was yeah produced in the UK so that's
kind<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.890> cool<00:02:31.950> British<00:02:32.730> made<00:02:33.000> um<00:02:34.490> yeah<00:02:35.490> I

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
kind of cool British made um yeah I

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.990 
kind of cool British made um yeah I
guess<00:02:36.560> there's<00:02:37.560> not<00:02:37.770> much<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.220> say<00:02:38.459> other<00:02:38.760> than

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
guess there's not much to say other than

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.630 
guess there's not much to say other than
that<00:02:39.420> it's<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.690> brush<00:02:39.950> which<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:40.980> kind<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.400> funny

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
that it's a brush which is kind of funny

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.570 
that it's a brush which is kind of funny

pricey<00:04:11.459> so<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:12.180> mean<00:04:12.720> if<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.900> want<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.110> try<00:04:13.260> the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
pricey so I mean if you want to try the

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.080 
pricey so I mean if you want to try the
wet<00:04:13.560> brush<00:04:13.769> that's<00:04:14.310> another<00:04:14.730> good

so it is really tingly and gross and I

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.200 
so it is really tingly and gross and I
thought<00:05:09.390> I'd<00:05:09.540> just<00:05:09.750> do<00:05:10.080> um<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.980> second<00:05:11.760> on<00:05:11.880> dry
