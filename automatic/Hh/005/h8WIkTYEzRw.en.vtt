the most beneficial aspect of rebounding
I<00:00:27.630> believe<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.920> your<00:00:29.039> pants<00:00:29.400> fall<00:00:29.580> off

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
I believe is that your pants fall off

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.880 
I believe is that your pants fall off
while<00:00:30.029> you're<00:00:30.240> jumping<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.900> kidding<00:00:31.260> it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
actually I feel that it moves the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.260 
actually I feel that it moves the
lymphatic<00:00:34.559> system<00:00:34.850> moving<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> lymphatic

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
lymphatic system moving the lymphatic

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
lymphatic system moving the lymphatic
system<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.780> very<00:00:37.110> important<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.460> of

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the key reasons why we choose to eat raw

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.959 
the key reasons why we choose to eat raw
