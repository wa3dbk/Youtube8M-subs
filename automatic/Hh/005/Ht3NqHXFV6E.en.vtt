 on this last point the president of the

 reporters said did not play 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.640
 the role of the truth dialogue commission

 and reconciliation cdvr who according to him has 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.690
 well its place in the processes the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.730
 reconciliation for him being the affair 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.730
 of all ngo's elsewhere without 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.490
 consideration of our fellow citizens I 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.290
 congratulated a system that led the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.560
 map of peace across the country 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.790
 I think other lands themselves 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.910
 of ministers the party front 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.350
 policies do it and there are so many 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:29.410
 the truth dialogue commission 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:35.830
 reconciliation also vix talent to 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:38.530
 a reconciliation of the same element years 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.160
 essential of reconciliation is 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.840
 improving the daily lives of citizens 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.540
 and that's why for me the program 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.380
 economic is an essential catalyst 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.460
 of reconciliation and we n 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.600
 strong growth 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.710
 everyone needs to be 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.700
 inserted in this desire to 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.830
 reconciliation 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.690
 for the training of 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.550
 government of a camp president 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.470
 the republic has indicated that it is 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.400
 of a mission government and nothing 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.050
 else 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.280
 one told me does not mean that everything 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.950
 the world should in the government 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.180
 this must be very clear including my 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.220
 allies I'm responsible for the executive 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.680
 I have to set up a 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.080
 government that allow me to offer 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.780
 to the Ivorians what I promised them 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.209
 the fact that this or that party is 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.110
 postponed ministerial is not my 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.750
 concern 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.959

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.750

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.850

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.100
 in line with the commitments I made to 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.260
 the place of the Ivorians and this 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.450
 government I trained includes 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.959
 personalities who made their 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.610
 evidence or elsewhere and the president 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.280
 alassane ouattara added in closing 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.590

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.430
