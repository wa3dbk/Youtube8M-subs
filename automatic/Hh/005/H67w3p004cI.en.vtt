 water quality in the Moscow river is still 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.899

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.790

 the arteries of the capital take samples of the fret and 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.110
 found out that the nature of the pollution in different 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.749
 areas can seriously vary 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.789
 so what does the river Moscow consist of? 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.079
 cried supporters 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.009
 about the fact that in Moscow the river does not flow at all 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.900
 water guess many 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.270

 its history which is difficult 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.750
 today judging by the fresh vada samples

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.489

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.630
 the content of harmful impurities does not exceed

 which runs into the river bed of Moscow 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.770
 if we talk about man-made 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.120
 pollution sources then 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.620
 first place is industrial and

 took part of the city 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.919
 mainly due to system system

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.869
 even at the output of course we have

 This is true 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.840
 the only way to deal with it 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.140
 improve urban sewage treatment plants 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.870
