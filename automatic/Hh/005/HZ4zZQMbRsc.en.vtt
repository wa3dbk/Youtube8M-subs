a<00:01:49.570> good<00:01:49.690> figure<00:01:50.110> I<00:01:50.229> like<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.530> soft<00:01:50.770> goods<00:01:50.950> cape

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
a good figure I like the soft goods cape

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.920 
a good figure I like the soft goods cape
that<00:01:51.400> we<00:01:51.520> have<00:01:51.670> over<00:01:51.909> here<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:52.330> really<00:01:52.600> helps

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
that we have over here it really helps

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.840 
that we have over here it really helps
with<00:01:53.049> poseability<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.950> I<00:01:54.340> think<00:01:54.580> we<00:01:54.670> get<00:01:54.790> a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
with poseability and I think we get a

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.609 
with poseability and I think we get a
really<00:01:55.060> cool<00:01:55.330> new<00:01:55.510> head<00:01:55.720> sculpt<00:01:56.080> there's<00:01:56.320> some

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
really cool new head sculpt there's some

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.980 
really cool new head sculpt there's some
assembly<00:01:56.860> required<00:01:57.400> but<00:01:57.640> it's<00:01:57.760> very<00:01:58.030> easy<00:01:58.479> and

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
assembly required but it's very easy and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.240 
assembly required but it's very easy and
I<00:01:59.080> just<00:01:59.260> think<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.500> paint<00:01:59.770> apps<00:01:59.950> on<00:02:00.130> this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
I just think the paint apps on this

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.039 
I just think the paint apps on this
figure<00:02:00.460> overall<00:02:01.030> in<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.240> plastic<00:02:01.720> choices

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
figure overall in the plastic choices

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.570 
figure overall in the plastic choices
just<00:02:02.290> came<00:02:02.470> out<00:02:02.619> really<00:02:02.920> really<00:02:03.040> well

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
just came out really really well

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.130 
just came out really really well
now<00:02:03.670> hella<00:02:03.850> has<00:02:04.060> only<00:02:04.270> one<00:02:04.479> accessory<00:02:04.930> it's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
now hella has only one accessory it's

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.750 
now hella has only one accessory it's
the<00:02:05.290> sword<00:02:05.619> right<00:02:05.680> here<00:02:06.070> that<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.369> don't<00:02:06.640> know

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
the sword right here that I don't know

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.309

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
if it has a name or anything like that

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.440

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
actually is missing a little bit of

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.210

paint<00:02:23.290> on<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:23.530> knuckle<00:02:23.830> that's<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.040> little

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
paint on the knuckle that's a little

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.949 
paint on the knuckle that's a little
irritating<00:02:24.760> now<00:02:24.939> I'm<00:02:25.090> very<00:02:25.120> pleased<00:02:25.840> with

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
irritating now I'm very pleased with

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.630 
irritating now I'm very pleased with
this<00:02:26.140> head<00:02:26.379> sculpt<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.099> like<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.400> paint

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
this head sculpt and I like the paint

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.369 
this head sculpt and I like the paint
apps<00:02:27.819> as<00:02:28.030> well<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.420> flesh<00:02:28.689> tone<00:02:28.989> came<00:02:29.260> out

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
apps as well the flesh tone came out

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.090 
apps as well the flesh tone came out
really<00:02:29.709> really

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
really really

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.740 
really really
good<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.400> really<00:02:30.550> like<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.970> green<00:02:31.210> lips<00:02:31.570> right

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.810 
good I really like the green lips right
over<00:02:31.960> there<00:02:32.110> looks<00:02:32.590> like<00:02:32.740> it<00:02:32.860> misfired<00:02:33.490> maybe

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
over there looks like it misfired maybe

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.120 
over there looks like it misfired maybe
just<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.240> tiny<00:02:34.600> bit<00:02:35.050> but<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.320> only<00:02:35.590> noticed<00:02:35.860> that

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
just a tiny bit but I only noticed that

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.580 
just a tiny bit but I only noticed that
just<00:02:36.520> now<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.060> she<00:02:37.570> has<00:02:37.600> silver<00:02:38.020> painted<00:02:38.380> eyes

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
just now and she has silver painted eyes

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.440 
just now and she has silver painted eyes
right<00:02:38.950> there<00:02:39.160> it's<00:02:39.310> kind<00:02:39.550> of<00:02:39.610> tricky<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:39.940> see<00:02:40.270> I

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
right there it's kind of tricky to see I

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.360 
right there it's kind of tricky to see I
really<00:02:41.080> like<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:41.440> green<00:02:41.680> plastic<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.310> they

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
really like this green plastic that they

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.310 
really like this green plastic that they
used<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.940> has<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.270> shimmer<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:43.990> so<00:02:44.140> we<00:02:44.200> get

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
used it has this shimmer to it so we get

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.990 
used it has this shimmer to it so we get
some<00:02:44.440> nice<00:02:44.560> shimmering<00:02:45.070> green<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.640> think<00:02:45.820> that

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
some nice shimmering green I think that

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.460 
some nice shimmering green I think that
looks<00:02:46.120> really<00:02:46.180> nice<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.630> get<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.870> flat<00:02:47.230> green

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
looks really nice I get that flat green

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.720 
looks really nice I get that flat green
right<00:02:47.680> there<00:02:47.860> at<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.070> top<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.430> her<00:02:48.520> head

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
right there at the top of her head

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.520 
right there at the top of her head
looking<00:02:49.360> at<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.600> back<00:02:49.840> right<00:02:50.050> over<00:02:50.110> there<00:02:50.410> you

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
looking at the back right over there you

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.020 
looking at the back right over there you
can<00:02:50.650> see<00:02:50.800> where<00:02:50.890> these<00:02:51.040> two<00:02:51.280> pieces<00:02:51.460> plug<00:02:51.850> in

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
can see where these two pieces plug in

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.670 
can see where these two pieces plug in
so<00:02:52.480> when<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.660> get<00:02:52.810> this<00:02:53.020> thing<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.620> is

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
so when you get this thing this is

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.590 
so when you get this thing this is
disassembled<00:02:54.640> right<00:02:54.790> over<00:02:55.030> here<00:02:55.240> so<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.450> just

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
disassembled right over here so you just

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.300 
disassembled right over here so you just
have<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.840> take<00:02:55.990> this<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.440> then<00:02:56.530> just<00:02:56.740> plug<00:02:57.130> it

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
have to take this and then just plug it

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.460 
have to take this and then just plug it
right<00:02:57.640> in<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:58.420> stays<00:02:58.690> very<00:02:58.870> nicely<00:02:59.200> it's

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
right in and it stays very nicely it's

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.500 
right in and it stays very nicely it's
very<00:02:59.620> easy<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.010> work<00:03:00.130> with<00:03:00.280> again<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.180> can<00:03:01.330> see

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
very easy to work with again you can see

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.850 
very easy to work with again you can see
a<00:03:01.540> little<00:03:01.780> bit<00:03:01.960> of<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:02.110> red<00:03:02.260> felt<00:03:02.560> as<00:03:02.740> I

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
a little bit of the red felt as I

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.200 
a little bit of the red felt as I
mentioned<00:03:03.160> in<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.310> Doctor<00:03:03.610> Strange<00:03:03.670> video

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
mentioned in the Doctor Strange video

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.910 
mentioned in the Doctor Strange video
these<00:03:04.780> figures<00:03:05.140> all<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.500> little<00:03:05.770> bit<00:03:05.890> of

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
these figures all have a little bit of

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.770 
these figures all have a little bit of

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
that we have the Cape section right over

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.960 
that we have the Cape section right over
here<00:03:20.380> on<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.590> figure<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.040> it's<00:03:21.460> plugged<00:03:21.790> into

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
here on the figure and it's plugged into

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.430 
here on the figure and it's plugged into
this<00:03:22.210> upper<00:03:22.630> torso<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:23.050> haven't<00:03:23.320> actually

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
Cape it's very soft on this side right

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.870 
Cape it's very soft on this side right
over<00:03:29.530> here<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:29.980> then<00:03:30.100> it's<00:03:30.250> kind<00:03:30.550> of<00:03:30.580> a<00:03:30.730> little

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
over here and then it's kind of a little

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.910 
over here and then it's kind of a little
bit<00:03:30.970> more<00:03:31.000> rough<00:03:31.330> on<00:03:31.480> this<00:03:31.720> back<00:03:32.110> end<00:03:32.380> but

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
bit more rough on this back end but

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.560 
bit more rough on this back end but
anyway<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.220> haven't<00:03:33.520> tried<00:03:33.730> unplugging<00:03:34.300> this

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
anyway I haven't tried unplugging this

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.760 
anyway I haven't tried unplugging this
yet<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:34.960> don't<00:03:35.080> know<00:03:35.200> if<00:03:35.260> it's<00:03:35.380> meant<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.680> be

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
yet I don't know if it's meant to be

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.830 
yet I don't know if it's meant to be
done<00:03:35.860> like<00:03:36.250> that<00:03:36.460> but<00:03:36.850> see<00:03:37.420> these<00:03:37.540> shoulder

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
done like that but see these shoulder

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.330 
done like that but see these shoulder
pads<00:03:38.050> can<00:03:38.320> be<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.470> little<00:03:38.590> bit<00:03:38.770> wobbly<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:39.250> you

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
pads can be a little bit wobbly so you

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.550 
pads can be a little bit wobbly so you
can<00:03:39.460> adjust<00:03:39.760> those<00:03:39.910> as<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.270> need<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.870> really

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
can adjust those as you need to I really

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.290 
can adjust those as you need to I really
like<00:03:41.770> this<00:03:41.980> metallic<00:03:42.310> plastic<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.180> they

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
like this metallic plastic that they

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.700 
like this metallic plastic that they
used<00:03:43.540> for<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.780> majority<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.440> figure

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
used for the majority of the figure

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.870 
used for the majority of the figure
though<00:03:44.860> that's<00:03:45.070> one<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.280> my<00:03:45.340> favorite<00:03:45.670> things

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
though that's one of my favorite things

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.610 
though that's one of my favorite things
about<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:46.330> I<00:03:46.420> just<00:03:46.600> love<00:03:46.930> how<00:03:47.050> this<00:03:47.170> reflects

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
about it I just love how this reflects

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.920 
about it I just love how this reflects
light<00:03:47.890> that<00:03:48.190> looks<00:03:48.340> really<00:03:48.850> really<00:03:49.210> good<00:03:49.450> you

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
light that looks really really good you

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.720 
light that looks really really good you
have<00:03:50.080> that<00:03:50.230> matte<00:03:50.470> green<00:03:50.800> color<00:03:51.160> painted<00:03:51.610> over

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
have that matte green color painted over

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.580 
have that matte green color painted over
it<00:03:51.970> too<00:03:52.150> so<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.570> design<00:03:52.870> came<00:03:53.170> out<00:03:53.290> really

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
it too so that design came out really

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.020 
it too so that design came out really
well<00:03:53.800> I<00:03:54.070> think<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.490> paint<00:03:54.700> apps<00:03:54.850> are<00:03:55.000> just

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
well I think the paint apps are just

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.120 
well I think the paint apps are just
very<00:03:55.480> very<00:03:55.570> clean<00:03:55.960> on<00:03:56.080> this<00:03:56.230> figure<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.830> really

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
very very clean on this figure I really

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.290 
very very clean on this figure I really
like<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.460> again<00:03:57.700> I<00:03:57.730> had<00:03:57.910> mentioned<00:03:58.240> the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
like it again I had mentioned the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.970 
like it again I had mentioned the
knuckle<00:03:58.600> right<00:03:58.750> over<00:03:58.960> there<00:03:59.110> this<00:03:59.560> one<00:03:59.830> of<00:03:59.920> my

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
knuckle right over there this one of my

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.470 
knuckle right over there this one of my
bigger<00:04:00.190> complaints<00:04:00.700> any<00:04:00.910> missing<00:04:01.210> just<00:04:01.390> a

the<00:04:32.950> articulation<00:04:33.640> on<00:04:33.730> this<00:04:33.880> figure<00:04:34.090> despite

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
the articulation on this figure despite

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.270 
the articulation on this figure despite
her<00:04:34.630> head<00:04:34.810> not<00:04:34.990> being<00:04:35.290> able<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.500> move<00:04:35.770> up<00:04:36.040> so

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
her head not being able to move up so

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.040 
her head not being able to move up so
that's<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.520> bit<00:04:36.700> of<00:04:36.790> a<00:04:36.850> shame<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.510> can't<00:04:37.870> get<00:04:37.990> her

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:51.309 
degrees to get rotation at the elbow you

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:53.249 
degrees to get rotation at the elbow you
get<00:04:51.429> a<00:04:51.460> wrist<00:04:51.759> swivel<00:04:52.209> and<00:04:52.360> they<00:04:52.569> do<00:04:52.629> hinge<00:04:53.020> up

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
here that rotate side to side you get

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.980 
here that rotate side to side you get
some<00:04:57.279> pivot<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:57.819> it<00:04:58.389> doesn't<00:04:58.599> really<00:04:58.779> crunch

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
some pivot and it doesn't really crunch

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.809 
some pivot and it doesn't really crunch
forward<00:04:59.229> but<00:04:59.439> it<00:04:59.529> moves<00:04:59.709> back<00:05:00.009> some<00:05:00.339> you<00:05:00.729> get

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
forward but it moves back some you get

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.219 
forward but it moves back some you get
these<00:05:00.939> wide<00:05:01.209> joints<00:05:01.569> at<00:05:01.659> the<00:05:01.749> hips<00:05:01.929> which<00:05:02.110> are

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
these wide joints at the hips which are

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.290 
these wide joints at the hips which are
a<00:05:02.259> bit<00:05:02.529> frustrating<00:05:03.249> so<00:05:03.729> if<00:05:03.909> you<00:05:03.969> want<00:05:04.119> to<00:05:04.179> move

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
a bit frustrating so if you want to move

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.299 
a bit frustrating so if you want to move
in<00:05:04.449> outward<00:05:04.809> you<00:05:04.990> just<00:05:05.139> go<00:05:05.289> like<00:05:05.409> that<00:05:05.469> to<00:05:06.219> move

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:06.309 
in outward you just go like that to move

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:07.799 
in outward you just go like that to move
them<00:05:06.490> forward<00:05:06.729> you<00:05:06.849> have<00:05:06.939> to<00:05:07.029> rotate<00:05:07.240> them<00:05:07.569> and

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:07.809 
them forward you have to rotate them and

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:09.239 
them forward you have to rotate them and
then<00:05:07.990> move<00:05:08.169> them<00:05:08.259> forward<00:05:08.589> and<00:05:08.830> then<00:05:08.979> you<00:05:09.099> have

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:09.249 
then move them forward and then you have

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:10.529 
then move them forward and then you have
the<00:05:09.369> upper<00:05:09.639> thigh<00:05:09.819> swivel<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.330> you<00:05:10.419> could

latest<00:05:34.930> Thor<00:05:35.349> figure<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:35.889> I<00:05:35.919> think<00:05:36.129> the<00:05:36.189> scale

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:36.399 
latest Thor figure and I think the scale

latest Thor figure and I think the scale
between<00:05:36.610> these<00:05:36.879> three<00:05:37.089> looks<00:05:37.269> pretty<00:05:37.479> good
