it'll<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.190> reversed<00:01:20.580> because<00:01:20.820> apple<00:01:21.270> didn't

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
it'll be reversed because apple didn't

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.750 
it'll be reversed because apple didn't
seem<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.870> want<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.140> make<00:01:22.230> a<00:01:22.260> standard<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:23.730> to

seem to want to make a standard way to
have<00:01:24.120> it<00:01:24.210> read<00:01:24.390> out<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:24.960> some<00:01:25.200> laptops

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
have it read out so on some laptops

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.840 
have it read out so on some laptops
you'll<00:01:25.770> notice<00:01:26.010> that<00:01:26.040> when<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.370> tip<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.760> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you'll notice that when you tip to the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.360 
you'll notice that when you tip to the
left<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.330> example<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:28.500> x<00:01:28.650> axis<00:01:29.040> will<00:01:29.190> move

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
left for example the x axis will move

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.040 
left for example the x axis will move
the<00:01:29.550> other<00:01:29.670> direction<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.570> use<00:01:30.720> flip

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
the other direction so you just use flip

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.070 
the other direction so you just use flip
x<00:01:31.290> axis<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.100> would<00:01:32.220> fix<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:33.660> i<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.870> it

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
x axis and it would fix that if i do it

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.960 
x axis and it would fix that if i do it
with<00:01:34.230> this<00:01:34.380> you'll<00:01:34.590> see<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.010> goes<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.730> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
with this you'll see that it goes to the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.460 
with this you'll see that it goes to the
right<00:01:36.150> when<00:01:36.300> I<00:01:36.330> tip<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.780> left<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.320> on

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
right when I tip to the left and so on

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.260 
right when I tip to the left and so on
you<00:01:37.800> can<00:01:37.950> read<00:01:38.100> more<00:01:38.130> about<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.880> link

and down but you can really make it send
anything<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.950> let's<00:02:41.130> try<00:02:42.590> I'll<00:02:43.590> say<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.550> of

anything so let's try I'll say a and of

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.540 
anything so let's try I'll say a and of
course<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.690> can't<00:02:46.290> send<00:02:46.590> capital<00:02:47.100> letters<00:02:47.340> so

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
course I can't send capital letters so

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.199 
course I can't send capital letters so
its<00:02:48.120> case<00:02:48.980> insensitive<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.850> reality<00:02:51.000> I

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
its case insensitive but in reality I

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.730 
its case insensitive but in reality I
can't<00:02:51.480> send<00:02:51.750> capital<00:02:52.140> letters<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.500> can<00:02:52.680> only

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
can't send capital letters so I can only

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.690 
can't send capital letters so I can only
send<00:02:53.070> lowercase<00:02:53.490> letters<00:02:54.920> now<00:02:55.920> I'll<00:02:56.310> sit

course it's sending really rapidly

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.300 
course it's sending really rapidly
signals<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.930> can<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.350> even<00:03:31.620> if<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.070> stop

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
signals so you can it even if you stop

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.259 
signals so you can it even if you stop
tipping<00:03:32.670> you'll<00:03:32.760> see<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.150> keeps

is in some ways dangerous you shouldn't
I<00:03:36.840> have<00:03:36.989> only<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.470> shouldn't<00:03:38.160> have<00:03:38.280> any

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
I have only you shouldn't have any

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.370 
I have only you shouldn't have any
sensitive<00:03:39.120> information<00:03:39.450> open<00:03:40.049> while<00:03:40.200> you're

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
sensitive information open while you're

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.810 
sensitive information open while you're
playing<00:03:40.470> with<00:03:40.739> tilted<00:03:41.130> joystick<00:03:41.519> because<00:03:41.730> you

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
playing with tilted joystick because you

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.199 
playing with tilted joystick because you
can<00:03:41.940> see<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.420> can<00:03:42.720> go<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> little<00:03:43.019> haywire

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
can see that it can go a little haywire

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.569 
can see that it can go a little haywire
so<00:03:45.209> if<00:03:45.510> we<00:03:45.600> go<00:03:46.019> back<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.410> defaults<00:03:47.010> left

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
so if we go back to the defaults left

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.520 
so if we go back to the defaults left
right<00:03:47.850> up<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.090> down<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.570> we<00:03:48.870> call<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.230> menu

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
right up and down and we call the menu

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.740 
right up and down and we call the menu
to<00:03:49.769> play<00:03:49.980> pac-man<00:03:50.280> we<00:03:51.120> can<00:03:51.299> try<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.570> out<00:03:51.720> with

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
documents because an arrow key would

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.480 
documents because an arrow key would
would<00:04:51.450> do<00:04:51.600> that<00:04:51.720> so<00:04:51.930> if<00:04:52.050> i<00:04:52.110> hold<00:04:52.260> apple<00:04:52.680> tip<00:04:53.340> to

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
would do that so if i hold apple tip to

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.540
