00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.189 
let's talk about stretching let's talk
about<00:00:21.270> how<00:00:21.750> important<00:00:22.590> stretching<00:00:23.550> really<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
about how important stretching really is

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.160 
about how important stretching really is
most<00:00:25.199> people<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.769> no<00:00:26.130> idea<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:27.689> importance

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
most people have no idea the importance

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.560 
most people have no idea the importance
of<00:00:28.289> stretching<00:00:28.910> now<00:00:30.080> makes<00:00:31.080> no<00:00:31.500> sense<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.520> me

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
of stretching now makes no sense to me

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.560 
of stretching now makes no sense to me
to<00:00:33.570> spend<00:00:33.930> years<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.440> years<00:00:35.420> working<00:00:36.420> your

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
to spend years and years working your

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.560 
to spend years and years working your
ass<00:00:36.719> off<00:00:37.020> putting<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:37.739> much<00:00:38.010> muscle<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
ass off putting as much muscle on the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.290 
ass off putting as much muscle on the
body<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:40.020> possible<00:00:40.730> but<00:00:41.730> yet<00:00:42.230> losing

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
body as possible but yet losing

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.430 
body as possible but yet losing
flexibility<00:00:45.590> mobility<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.690> function<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
flexibility mobility and function of the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.380 
flexibility mobility and function of the
body<00:00:50.059> now<00:00:51.350> if<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.590> happens<00:00:53.399> you're<00:00:53.910> actually

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
body now if this happens you're actually

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.319 
body now if this happens you're actually
going<00:00:54.629> backwards<00:00:55.610> it<00:00:56.610> actually<00:00:56.969> becomes

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
going backwards it actually becomes

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.400 
going backwards it actually becomes
counterproductive<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.489> problems

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
counterproductive if you have problems

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.229 
counterproductive if you have problems
for<00:01:01.410> example<00:01:01.920> putting<00:01:02.190> your<00:01:02.430> shirt<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
for example putting your shirt on in the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.679 
for example putting your shirt on in the
morning<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:04.199> taking<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.710> shirt<00:01:04.920> off<00:01:05.689> running

morning or taking your shirt off running
you<00:01:07.320> know<00:01:07.439> bending<00:01:07.860> down<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.220> picking

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
you know bending down and picking

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.940 
you know bending down and picking
something<00:01:08.790> up<00:01:08.970> off<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.360> ground<00:01:09.950> playing

something up off the ground playing
basketball<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.420> daily

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
activities that everyone else can do

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.190 
activities that everyone else can do
easily<00:01:15.950> then<00:01:16.950> you're<00:01:17.610> actually<00:01:18.200> going

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
easily then you're actually going

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.600 
easily then you're actually going
backwards<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:21.000> you're<00:01:21.210> actually<00:01:21.750> not<00:01:22.650> making

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
backwards and you're actually not making

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.469 
backwards and you're actually not making
your<00:01:23.970> body<00:01:24.650> better<00:01:25.729> you're<00:01:26.729> actually<00:01:27.150> making

your body better you're actually making
it<00:01:27.780> worse<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.979> think<00:01:29.310> about<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.759> logically

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140

know this is mostly the reason why I
continued<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.240> stretch<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.930> learn<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
continued to stretch and learn to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.990 
continued to stretch and learn to
stretch<00:01:58.650> because<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.009> started<00:01:59.430> doing<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.790> as<00:01:59.940> a

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
stretch because I started doing it as a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.520 
stretch because I started doing it as a
youngster<00:02:00.950> now<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.780> trying<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.930> stress<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
youngster now I just trying to stress to

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.120 
youngster now I just trying to stress to
people<00:02:04.680> how<00:02:05.220> important<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:07.770> lose

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
people how important it is to not lose

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.470 
people how important it is to not lose
function<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.910> their<00:02:09.000> body<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:11.489> not<00:02:11.760> lose

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
function of their body and to not lose

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.949 
function of their body and to not lose
mobility<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.560> not<00:02:14.300> get<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.540> point<00:02:15.570> where

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
mobility and not get to the point where

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.880 
mobility and not get to the point where
you<00:02:16.140> can't<00:02:16.500> simply<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:17.280> normal<00:02:18.120> daily

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
you can't simply do normal daily

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.390 
you can't simply do normal daily
activities<00:02:21.110> now<00:02:22.110> let's<00:02:22.500> talk<00:02:22.739> about<00:02:22.800> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
activities now let's talk about the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.500 
activities now let's talk about the
faucet<00:02:24.209> issue<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:25.620> faucet<00:02:26.190> issue<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.120> very

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
faucet issue the faucet issue is a very

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.850 
faucet issue the faucet issue is a very
thin<00:02:28.170> lining<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:30.030> covers<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.750> muscle<00:02:30.989> its

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
thin lining that covers the muscle its

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.780 
thin lining that covers the muscle its
job<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.540> protect<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.260> muscle<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:35.549> like<00:02:35.760> a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
job is to protect the muscle it's like a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
job is to protect the muscle it's like a
protective<00:02:36.540> sheath<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.730> protects<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.970> every

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
protective sheath that protects it every

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.870 
protective sheath that protects it every
muscle<00:02:40.049> in<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.320> body

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
muscle in the body

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.240 
muscle in the body
now<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.510> frost<00:02:42.810> tissue<00:02:43.230> can<00:02:43.709> actually

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
now the frost tissue can actually

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.650 
now the frost tissue can actually
inhibit<00:02:45.090> growth<00:02:45.299> in<00:02:46.290> each<00:02:46.829> muscle<00:02:47.160> and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
inhibit growth in each muscle and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.020 
inhibit growth in each muscle and
genetically<00:02:48.660> some<00:02:49.079> people<00:02:49.410> have<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:50.040> thicker

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
genetically some people have a thicker

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.470 
genetically some people have a thicker
tighter<00:02:52.019> stronger<00:02:53.010> fossa<00:02:53.790> tissue<00:02:54.209> than

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
tighter stronger fossa tissue than

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.470 
tighter stronger fossa tissue than
others<00:02:54.900> which<00:02:55.650> therefore<00:02:56.340> would<00:02:57.150> inhibit

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
others which therefore would inhibit

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.979 
others which therefore would inhibit
their<00:02:57.810> muscle<00:02:58.110> growth<00:02:58.290> even<00:02:58.560> more<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.989> can

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
their muscle growth even more and can

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.830 
their muscle growth even more and can
make<00:03:01.200> certain<00:03:01.650> muscles<00:03:02.100> almost<00:03:03.060> impossible

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
make certain muscles almost impossible

make certain muscles almost impossible
to<00:03:04.049> grow<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:06.140> stretching<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.950> muscle

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
to grow and stretching that muscle

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
intensely on a daily basis can actually

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.170 
intensely on a daily basis can actually
stretch<00:03:12.989> out<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.380> facha<00:03:13.650> tissue<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.430> allow

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
stretch out the facha tissue and allow

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.860 
stretch out the facha tissue and allow
the<00:03:15.510> muscle<00:03:16.320> more<00:03:16.739> room<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.459> grow<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.299> also

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the muscle more room to grow and to also

the muscle more room to grow and to also
grow<00:03:19.380> at<00:03:19.980> a

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
grow at a

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.040 
grow at a
great<00:03:21.340> I've<00:03:22.340> actually<00:03:22.640> heard<00:03:23.270> and<00:03:23.630> known

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
great I've actually heard and known

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.350 
great I've actually heard and known
people<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:25.130> have<00:03:25.280> went<00:03:25.550> to<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.670> extremes

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
people that have went to the extremes

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.360 
people that have went to the extremes
and<00:03:26.840> they've<00:03:27.020> actually<00:03:27.200> had<00:03:27.560> their<00:03:27.800> faucet

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
and they've actually had their faucet

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.260 
and they've actually had their faucet
issue<00:03:29.050> sliced<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.550> muscle<00:03:32.030> can

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
issue sliced so that the muscle can

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.600 
issue sliced so that the muscle can
actually<00:03:32.720> pop<00:03:33.110> out<00:03:33.350> of<00:03:33.740> the<00:03:33.950> faucet<00:03:34.400> issue

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
actually pop out of the faucet issue

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.690 
actually pop out of the faucet issue
which<00:03:35.390> will<00:03:35.570> allow<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.170> muscle<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.650> grow<00:03:37.100> at

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
which will allow that muscle to grow at

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.120 
which will allow that muscle to grow at
a<00:03:37.760> faster<00:03:38.360> rate<00:03:38.390> now<00:03:39.320> obviously<00:03:39.800> that's<00:03:39.950> a

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
a faster rate now obviously that's a

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.640 
a faster rate now obviously that's a
very<00:03:40.430> extreme<00:03:40.850> measure<00:03:41.330> and<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:41.720> no<00:03:42.410> longer

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
very extreme measure and you no longer

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.550 
very extreme measure and you no longer
have<00:03:43.100> that<00:03:43.600> protective<00:03:44.600> sheath<00:03:44.900> over<00:03:45.110> the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
have that protective sheath over the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.880 
have that protective sheath over the
muscle<00:03:45.920> but<00:03:46.430> that's<00:03:46.670> just<00:03:46.790> an<00:03:46.970> example<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.890> the

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
muscle but that's just an example of the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.160 
muscle but that's just an example of the
importance<00:03:49.460> of<00:03:49.760> stretching<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.720> facha

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
importance of stretching that facha

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.340 
importance of stretching that facha
tissue<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.980> allowing<00:03:52.820> your<00:03:52.940> muscles<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:54.170> grow

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
tissue and allowing your muscles to grow

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.660 
tissue and allowing your muscles to grow
at<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.620> faster<00:03:55.100> rate<00:03:55.420> now<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.840> hope<00:03:57.710> that<00:03:58.070> the

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
at a faster rate now I hope that the

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.070 
at a faster rate now I hope that the
things<00:03:58.910> I've<00:03:59.150> said<00:03:59.860> have<00:04:00.860> actually<00:04:02.080> made

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
things I've said have actually made

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.590 
things I've said have actually made
people<00:04:03.350> want<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:04.550> stretch<00:04:04.820> on<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.210> regular

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
people want to stretch on a regular

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.750 
people want to stretch on a regular
basis<00:04:06.020> and<00:04:06.200> add<00:04:06.560> stretching<00:04:07.310> into<00:04:07.490> their

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
basis and add stretching into their

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.930 
basis and add stretching into their
daily<00:04:08.000> routine<00:04:08.540> if<00:04:08.780> not<00:04:09.770> for<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.160> simple<00:04:10.550> fact

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
daily routine if not for the simple fact

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.150 
daily routine if not for the simple fact
of<00:04:11.290> not<00:04:12.290> losing<00:04:13.660> mobility<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:14.870> function<00:04:15.770> of

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
of not losing mobility and function of

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.190 
of not losing mobility and function of
the<00:04:16.670> body<00:04:16.880> but<00:04:17.600> for<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.950> fact<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:20.049> helping<00:04:21.049> you

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
the body but for the fact of helping you

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.830 
the body but for the fact of helping you
reach<00:04:21.410> your<00:04:21.440> goals<00:04:21.830> faster<00:04:22.340> if<00:04:22.790> indeed<00:04:23.630> your

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
reach your goals faster if indeed your

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.660 
reach your goals faster if indeed your
goal<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.860> become<00:04:25.550> as<00:04:25.700> big<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:26.330> muscular<00:04:26.870> as

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
goal is to become as big and muscular as

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:36.610 
goal is to become as big and muscular as
possible<00:04:28.670> so<00:04:30.160> let's<00:04:31.510> stretch<00:04:33.130> every<00:04:34.130> day
