00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 in this video I'll show you how i shoot 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.080
 paint in wooden structures on 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.860
 processing example 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.179
 windows is a matter of course this work is necessary 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.340
 produce in the summer when you can remove the window 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.680
 at the beginning I pro experimented simple 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.500
 and available options for removing paint 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.140
 the first extremity I scored in the arch is 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:32.520
 low quality result too you 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.620
 boron is obtained and the paint remains second 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.940
 option charged on grinder grinding 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.070
 circle result paint removes well circle 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.610
 literally in 30 seconds achieves 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.610
 paint 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.530
 the third option left was the arch alone I 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.930
 took an electric hair dryer and working sven 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.460
 did not understand what is the best option for removal 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.720
 there is no old paint than a hair dryer on it 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.940
 option I became 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.860
 and share your acquired 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.070
 skills 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.090
 so those working with a hairdryer frame I 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.229
 put it vertically in your left hand take 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.970
 hair dryer in the right hand log 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.720
 Knife handle should preferably be 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:34.789
 wooden paint removal start from the bottom 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:38.299
 up roll incline 45 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.649
 degrees and about as warm 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.619
 the air rises up and 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.250
 pre- pours the next 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:49.390
 heating surface paint until 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.220
 bubbles start working no one 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.149
 this work is desirable to carry out on the street 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.140
 in the open air and if so 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.720
 no opportunity 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.429
 you must turn on the fan and open 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:08.649
 ventilation quality is excellent 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:11.510
 the paint is taken off pop and very easy 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.569
 virtually no physical effort 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.239
 after complete removal of paint, we begin 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.910
 wood processing for this charge 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.220
 grinder grinding wheel on the ground 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.160
 stage to start i applied went to the trigger 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.690
 number 30 that is the roughest on 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.420
 second stage grinding 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.030
 I applied the skin 80 minutes after 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.500
 processing skolko number 80 principle 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.510
 the quality is very, very 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.940
 OK, but if someone is not taken soon 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.989
 too something can still apply the skin 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.709
 that 120 for windowing 1-bedroom I have 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.840
 went 2 grinding skins 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.450
 32 sanding skins on all bones 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.550
 such processing wooden structure in 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.849
 In this case, it becomes like us 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.849
 lot 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.550
 then the structure can be covered with stain 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.790
 in this case, I applied the stain 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.250
 mahogany wood stain is necessary 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.410
 apply quickly and evenly the more 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.390
 the layers of the stain the darker it becomes 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.300
 Stake design on in three hours 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.240
 the keychain is fully absorbed and can 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.970
 further processing can be 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.180
 varnish can be coated with varnish 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.270
 I think it is better not to apply this paint. 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.410
 why paint consists of binding 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:49.100
 This material is a linseed or varnish varnish or 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.820
 drying oil is added pigment which 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.820
 give the paint color lacquer and bodice 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.550
 absorbed into the apple tree cop remain 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.970
 on the surface thereby forms a crust 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.080
 on the wooden surface with which we 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.420
 now and fought and that is practical 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.240
 rational it turns out that the color of the tree 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.880
 better to give materials that 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.200
 soak in both the tree and not leaving the coca 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.370
 on the tree how we applied in this 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.460
 case stain 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.900
 she fully eat into the tree cover 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.110
 varnish or linseed oil 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.480
 practically the varnish absorbs little 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.120
 the tree dries quickly 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.150
 thereby leaving the film on it this 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.490
 film in three or four years can be drying 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.710
 completely absorbed into the wood dries 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.350
 very long, that is, three days 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.110
 thereby it does not leave the film on 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.530
 wood surface and she is very good 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.380
 saves a tree and if you are an olive 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.050
 cover two more times then it is wooden 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.280
 the design will have a very 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.190
 attractive view for a long time 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.240
 being on the street 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.910
 wooden construction which is not 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.960
 amenable atmosphere can influence nym 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.520
 cover and varnish 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.510
 rationally obtained once I took off the window 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.030
 it is necessary to make a revision of glasses 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.880
 old shtapiki I picked up all the plane 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.600
 which runs through the return glass went to 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.600
 Forging grooves of glass installation caused 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.120
 transparent silicone 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.790
 having washed the glass beforehand stuck them 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.400
 to silicone it gave impermeability 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.220
 which is not maintained bead in 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.620
 Later shtapiki I'll not changed 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.200
 glad if someone helped and you leave 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.500
 your comments thank you for all 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.500
 good for you
