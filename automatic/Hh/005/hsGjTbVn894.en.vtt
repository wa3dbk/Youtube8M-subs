00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
tell us down here usually it does

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.340 
tell us down here usually it does
well<00:01:22.850> maybe<00:01:23.150> not<00:01:23.330> oh<00:01:23.570> well<00:01:25.840> what<00:01:26.840> shall<00:01:27.050> we<00:01:27.110> do

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
well maybe not oh well what shall we do

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.560 
well maybe not oh well what shall we do
for<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.590> rest<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.040> day<00:01:28.510> we<00:01:29.510> should

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
for the rest of the day we should

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.060 
for the rest of the day we should
probably<00:01:29.780> cut<00:01:30.050> up<00:01:30.140> some<00:01:30.320> lumber<00:01:30.590> because<00:01:30.920> the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
probably cut up some lumber because the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.280 
probably cut up some lumber because the
chicken<00:01:31.430> coop<00:01:31.640> we<00:01:32.240> only<00:01:32.390> get<00:01:32.570> won't<00:01:33.050> begin

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
chicken coop we only get won't begin

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.130 
chicken coop we only get won't begin
that<00:01:33.500> in<00:01:33.680> three<00:01:33.920> days<00:01:34.210> so<00:01:35.210> we'll<00:01:35.870> need<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:38.140> have

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
that in three days so we'll need to have

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.540 
that in three days so we'll need to have
I<00:01:39.560> think<00:01:39.920> third<00:01:40.220> 20<00:01:40.730> or<00:01:40.820> 30<00:01:41.060> lumber<00:01:41.420> for<00:01:41.600> that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
I think third 20 or 30 lumber for that

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.430 
I think third 20 or 30 lumber for that
I'm<00:01:43.550> so<00:01:43.790> low<00:01:43.970> on<00:01:44.000> energy<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.480> don't<00:01:44.690> want<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.900> use

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
I'm so low on energy I don't want to use

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.100 
I'm so low on energy I don't want to use
it<00:01:45.650> too<00:01:45.920> much<00:01:46.510> well<00:01:47.510> let's<00:01:47.660> go<00:01:47.840> into<00:01:48.020> the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
it too much well let's go into the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.920 
it too much well let's go into the
mountain<00:01:48.440> see<00:01:48.650> if<00:01:48.740> we<00:01:48.860> can<00:01:48.980> find<00:01:49.190> some<00:01:49.340> berries

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
mountain see if we can find some berries

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.600 
mountain see if we can find some berries
then<00:01:50.930> eat<00:01:51.260> though<00:01:51.500> is<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:51.770> restore<00:01:52.340> some

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
then eat though is to restore some

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:01.680 
then eat though is to restore some
energy<00:01:53.060> I<00:01:58.660> don't<00:01:59.660> know

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
energy I don't know

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.780 
energy I don't know
what<00:02:02.350> we<00:02:02.470> should<00:02:02.710> do<00:02:02.890> one<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.190> these<00:02:03.340> days<00:02:03.580> is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
what we should do one of these days is

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.650 
what we should do one of these days is
