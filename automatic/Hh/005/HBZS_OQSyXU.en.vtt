hi everybody I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:03.410> convert<00:00:04.410> an<00:00:05.400> ordinary<00:00:05.850> brush<00:00:06.120> into<00:00:06.330> a

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
to convert an ordinary brush into a

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.440 
to convert an ordinary brush into a
water<00:00:06.750> fed<00:00:07.080> brush<00:00:07.589> it's<00:00:08.400> very<00:00:08.460> very<00:00:08.880> simple

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
water fed brush it's very very simple

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.240 
water fed brush it's very very simple
and<00:00:09.599> very<00:00:09.690> very<00:00:10.110> light<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.800> they're<00:00:10.950> quite

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
and very very light and they're quite

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.959 
and very very light and they're quite
effective<00:00:12.469> one<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.620> them<00:00:13.799> recently<00:00:14.040> that's

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
effective one of them recently that's

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.050 
effective one of them recently that's
going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.599> demo<00:00:15.960> one<00:00:16.289> they're<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.910> one

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
going to be the demo one they're the one

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.540 
going to be the demo one they're the one
I've<00:00:18.180> done<00:00:18.330> recently<00:00:18.980> is<00:00:19.980> one<00:00:20.250> from

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
I've done recently is one from

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.330 
I've done recently is one from
Wilkinsons<00:00:21.210> like<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.769> but<00:00:22.769> nice<00:00:22.980> rubber

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
Wilkinsons like this but nice rubber

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.189 
Wilkinsons like this but nice rubber
ends<00:00:23.519> their<00:00:23.939> bristles<00:00:24.630> are<00:00:24.750> good<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.050> there's

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
ends their bristles are good but there's

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.929 
ends their bristles are good but there's
two<00:00:25.350> types<00:00:25.710> because<00:00:26.099> we<00:00:26.369> don't<00:00:26.550> get<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.730> hard

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
two types because we don't get the hard

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.060 
two types because we don't get the hard
one<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.420> too<00:00:27.660> hard<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.680> softer

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
one this is too hard it's a softer

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.540 
one this is too hard it's a softer
version<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.599> quite<00:00:31.050> ideal

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
version but this is really quite ideal

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.600 
version but this is really quite ideal
you<00:00:32.550> just<00:00:32.759> unscrew<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:34.399> so<00:00:35.399> let's

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
you just unscrew it like that so let's

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.069 
you just unscrew it like that so let's
assuming<00:00:36.030> you've<00:00:36.210> perhaps<00:00:36.540> gone<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
assuming you've perhaps gone to

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.770 
assuming you've perhaps gone to
Wilkinson's<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.680> are<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.040> them<00:00:40.340> alright

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
Wilkinson's you are one of them alright

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.319 
Wilkinson's you are one of them alright
what<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.930> need<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.680> order<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.309> couple<00:00:45.210> of

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
jets these are fan jets I've got the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.680 
jets these are fan jets I've got the
slots<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.980> I<00:00:49.980> prefer<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> pencil<00:00:51.270> ones<00:00:51.510> but

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
slots in I prefer the pencil ones but

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.189 
slots in I prefer the pencil ones but
it's<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.850> them<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:55.020> need

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
a wide piece and some plastic tubing

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.459 
a wide piece and some plastic tubing
simple<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.340> need<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.609> drill<00:01:00.469> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
simple as that you need to drill the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.979 
simple as that you need to drill the
right<00:01:01.680> diameter<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.789> course<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> Jets<00:01:03.780> if

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
right diameter of course for the Jets if

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.620 
right diameter of course for the Jets if
you<00:01:04.110> get<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.439> wrong<00:01:05.210> seriously<00:01:06.210> wrong<00:01:06.420> well

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
you get it wrong seriously wrong well

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.300 
you get it wrong seriously wrong well
the<00:01:06.900> brushes<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.380> only<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.680> couple<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.040> quid

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the brushes are only a couple of quid

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.789 
the brushes are only a couple of quid
but<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.960> always<00:01:10.110> stick<00:01:10.409> them<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.680> with

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
but you can always stick them in with

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.890 
but you can always stick them in with
our<00:01:10.950> old<00:01:11.100> eye<00:01:11.250> afterwards<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
our old eye afterwards if you get the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200 
our old eye afterwards if you get the
hole<00:01:13.110> diameters<00:01:13.710> wrong<00:01:14.010> all<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> first

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
hole diameters wrong all right the first

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.200 
hole diameters wrong all right the first
thing<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.780> when<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.590> your<00:01:16.650> brush

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
thing to do when you get your brush

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.249 
thing to do when you get your brush
let's<00:01:18.210> measure<00:01:18.450> off<00:01:18.750> about<00:01:19.850> six<00:01:21.259> centimetres

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
let's measure off about six centimetres

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.350 
let's measure off about six centimetres
from<00:01:22.860> each<00:01:23.040> end<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:24.680> get<00:01:25.680> your<00:01:25.860> holes<00:01:26.210> it's<00:01:27.210> not

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
from each end to get your holes it's not

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.840 
from each end to get your holes it's not
absolutely<00:01:27.930> critical<00:01:28.439> drill<00:01:29.310> them<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
absolutely critical drill them the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.260 
absolutely critical drill them the
correct<00:01:30.090> diameters<00:01:31.850> then<00:01:32.850> you'll<00:01:33.000> need<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
correct diameters then you'll need to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.030 
correct diameters then you'll need to
pull<00:01:33.509> out<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.689> bristles<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> right<00:01:34.650> place

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
pull out the bristles in the right place

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.679 
pull out the bristles in the right place
now<00:01:36.350> what<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:37.909> is<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.210> actually

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
now what you can do is just actually

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.480 
now what you can do is just actually
pull<00:01:39.930> them<00:01:40.079> out<00:01:40.259> I'll<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.619> demonstrate<00:01:40.860> use

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
pull them out I'll just demonstrate use

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.870 
pull them out I'll just demonstrate use
a<00:01:41.520> pair<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> pliers<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:43.290> whole<00:01:43.439> lot<00:01:43.680> just

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
a pair of pliers the whole lot just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.499 
a pair of pliers the whole lot just
pulls<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:46.670> because<00:01:47.670> they're<00:01:47.850> only<00:01:48.119> held<00:01:48.329> in

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
pulls out because they're only held in

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.420 
pulls out because they're only held in
with<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.869> staples<00:01:49.229> I'll<00:01:49.710> try<00:01:49.979> another<00:01:50.220> one

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
with like staples I'll try another one

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.940 
with like staples I'll try another one
there<00:01:50.780> there<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.229> whole<00:01:52.380> things<00:01:52.649> come

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
there there you go the whole things come

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.889 
there there you go the whole things come
out<00:01:53.100> there<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.790> that's<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> easiest

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
out there like that that's the easiest

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.959 
out there like that that's the easiest
way<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.229> doing<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.619> rather<00:01:55.799> than<00:01:56.009> try<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.340> cut

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
way of doing it rather than try and cut

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.539 
way of doing it rather than try and cut
the<00:01:57.119> bristles<00:01:57.479> off<00:01:57.659> which<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.049> used<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.439> do<00:01:58.649> so

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the bristles off which I used to do so

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.660 
the bristles off which I used to do so
let's<00:01:59.880> assume<00:02:00.509> you've<00:02:00.780> done<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.549> you<00:02:02.549> can

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
let's assume you've done that you can

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.749 
let's assume you've done that you can
see<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> holes<00:02:03.270> there<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.810> well<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:05.310> get<00:02:05.490> your

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
see the holes there as well you get your

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.670
