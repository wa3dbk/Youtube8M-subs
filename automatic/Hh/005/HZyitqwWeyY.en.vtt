so we've crafting table to that the only

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.690 
so we've crafting table to that the only
thing<00:01:05.939> shown<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.689> grid<00:01:07.530> would<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:08.010> just

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
thing shown in this grid would be just

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.300

model<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> would<00:01:50.430> say<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.450> believe<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.990> mod

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
model I would say and I believe this mod

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.710 
model I would say and I believe this mod
actually<00:01:52.770> works<00:01:53.159> with<00:01:53.399> mudded<00:01:53.790> items<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.479> well

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
actually works with mudded items as well

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.410 
actually works with mudded items as well
I<00:01:54.990> can't<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.680> too<00:01:55.950> sure<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.939> believe<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
I can't be too sure but I believe it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.889 
I can't be too sure but I believe it
does<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:58.610> think<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.939> read<00:02:00.149> somewhere<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.659> does

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
does I think I read somewhere it does

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.060 
does I think I read somewhere it does
but<00:02:01.380> yeah<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.430> an<00:02:02.670> awesome<00:02:03.149> addition<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070

especially if you using technical board

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.919 
especially if you using technical board
slight<00:02:06.899> build<00:02:07.829> craft<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.550> red<00:02:09.149> power<00:02:09.390> this

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
slight build craft and red power this

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.339 
slight build craft and red power this
could<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.289> come<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.560> very<00:02:11.430> handy
