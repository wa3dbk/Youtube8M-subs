00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.380 
a real practical car and then you've got
a<00:02:07.080> real<00:02:07.440> guy<00:02:08.190> with<00:02:08.490> zombie<00:02:08.880> makeup<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
a real guy with zombie makeup on a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.900 
a real guy with zombie makeup on a
motorcycle<00:02:09.690> chasing<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.560> car<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.790> then

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
motorcycle chasing that car but then

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.479 
motorcycle chasing that car but then
he's<00:02:12.060> gotta<00:02:12.240> hit<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:13.050> lamppost<00:02:13.620> because<00:02:14.280> I

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
he's gotta hit like a lamppost because I

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.420 
he's gotta hit like a lamppost because I
swerve<00:02:14.850> or<00:02:15.180> whatever<00:02:15.860> now<00:02:16.860> how<00:02:17.010> do<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.190> do

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
swerve or whatever now how do you do

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.680 
swerve or whatever now how do you do
that<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.730> can't<00:02:17.940> have<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> stunt<00:02:18.330> guy<00:02:18.480> hit<00:02:18.660> a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
that you can't have a stunt guy hit a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.430 
that you can't have a stunt guy hit a
lamppost<00:02:18.930> right<00:02:20.570> so<00:02:21.570> it's<00:02:21.720> like<00:02:21.810> you've<00:02:22.260> got

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
lamppost right so it's like you've got

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.140 
lamppost right so it's like you've got
this<00:02:22.620> digital<00:02:23.160> set<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.640> background

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
this digital set in the background

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.540 
this digital set in the background
you've<00:02:24.540> got<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.900> practical<00:02:25.620> zombie<00:02:26.130> now<00:02:26.489> you

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
you've got this practical zombie now you

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.750 
you've got this practical zombie now you
need<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.820> digital<00:02:27.120> lamppost<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:29.220> mean<00:02:29.430> there

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
need a digital lamppost and I mean there

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.880 
need a digital lamppost and I mean there
was<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.180> many<00:02:30.300> different<00:02:30.600> elements<00:02:30.930> going

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
was so many different elements going

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.420 
was so many different elements going
into<00:02:32.370> making<00:02:33.030> these<00:02:33.150> shots<00:02:33.570> work<00:02:34.340> because<00:02:35.340> you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
into making these shots work because you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.690 
into making these shots work because you
can't<00:02:35.640> close<00:02:35.940> down<00:02:36.000> Red<00:02:36.510> Square<00:02:36.750> for<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.110> week

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
can't close down Red Square for a week

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.479 
can't close down Red Square for a week
it's<00:02:38.700> impossible<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.570> mean<00:02:40.370> Russians<00:02:41.370> would

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
it's impossible I mean Russians would

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.240 
it's impossible I mean Russians would
kill<00:02:41.670> us<00:02:41.989> literally<00:02:42.989> there's<00:02:43.709> enough<00:02:43.980> traffic

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
kill us literally there's enough traffic

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.790 
kill us literally there's enough traffic
in<00:02:44.550> Los<00:02:44.700> already<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.989> just<00:02:46.019> could<00:02:46.680> never

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
in Los already and just could never

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.060 
in Los already and just could never
afford<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:48.690> probably<00:02:48.989> used<00:02:49.230> every<00:02:49.950> bit

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
afford it so it probably used every bit

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.220 
afford it so it probably used every bit
of<00:02:50.130> his<00:02:50.280> imagination<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:51.510> really<00:02:51.959> make<00:02:52.110> that

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
of his imagination to really make that

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.080 
of his imagination to really make that
scene<00:02:52.590> happen<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.400> quite<00:02:53.850> spectacular

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
scene happen and it's quite spectacular

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.570 
scene happen and it's quite spectacular
I<00:02:54.570> think<00:02:54.810> anybody<00:02:55.170> who<00:02:55.320> knows<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.890> technical

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
I think anybody who knows the technical

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.040 
I think anybody who knows the technical
aspects<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.090> filmmaking<00:02:57.540> are<00:02:57.750> going<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.930> be

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
aspects of filmmaking are going to be

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.949 
aspects of filmmaking are going to be
very<00:02:58.310> impressed<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.550> inspired<00:02:59.760> it's<00:03:00.630> very

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
very impressed and inspired it's very

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.570 
very impressed and inspired it's very
much<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.200> family<00:03:01.350> affair<00:03:01.800> could<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.310> describe

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
much a family affair could you describe

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.400 
much a family affair could you describe
for<00:03:02.910> example<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.420> first<00:03:03.660> day<00:03:03.900> on<00:03:03.930> set<00:03:04.110> when

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
for example the first day on set when

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.509 
for example the first day on set when
you'll<00:03:04.590> see<00:03:04.830> each<00:03:04.920> other<00:03:05.100> again<00:03:05.220> uh<00:03:05.310> perhaps

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
you'll see each other again uh perhaps

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.400 
you'll see each other again uh perhaps
also<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.120> last<00:03:06.330> day<00:03:06.570> when<00:03:06.840> it's<00:03:06.959> time<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.230> say

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
also the last day when it's time to say
