00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
to run which basically means that you

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.080 
to run which basically means that you
need<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> buy<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> remote<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.850> install<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.969> to

the<00:00:45.120> car<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.870> course<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> don't<00:00:46.289> get

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the car and of course you don't get

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.959

batteries or charges or anything like
that<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.379> starting<00:00:49.770> price<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.039> about<00:00:50.340> 75

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.010 
that but at a starting price of about 75
bucks<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.180> think<00:00:51.480> that's<00:00:51.629> pretty<00:00:51.750> good

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020

look at the front one here you can see
the<00:02:29.080> front<00:02:29.980> shock<00:02:30.190> towers<00:02:30.400> got<00:02:30.610> plenty<00:02:30.790> of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
the front shock towers got plenty of

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.720 
the front shock towers got plenty of
adjustments<00:02:31.420> for<00:02:31.540> shocks<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.340> rear

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
adjustments for shocks and the rear

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.430 
adjustments for shocks and the rear
shock<00:02:33.970> tower<00:02:34.000> does<00:02:34.480> as<00:02:34.690> well<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.110> can<00:02:35.230> see

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
shock tower does as well you can see

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.940 
shock tower does as well you can see
there<00:02:35.650> it's<00:02:36.250> very<00:02:36.459> nice<00:02:37.680> going<00:02:38.680> along<00:02:38.920> here

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
there it's very nice going along here

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.890 
there it's very nice going along here
you've<00:02:39.400> got<00:02:39.670> no<00:02:39.940> centered<00:02:40.330> if<00:02:40.450> it's<00:02:40.630> just<00:02:40.810> a

you've got no centered if it's just a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.900 
you've got no centered if it's just a
little<00:02:41.020> spur<00:02:41.380> gear<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.250> believe<00:02:42.550> that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
little spur gear and I believe that

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.880 
little spur gear and I believe that
little<00:02:43.150> guy<00:02:43.270> in<00:02:43.450> there<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.900> little<00:02:44.170> metal

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
little guy in there that little metal

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
piece in the middle there is actually a

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.940 
piece in the middle there is actually a
bit<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.870> clutch<00:02:47.140> system<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.680> they<00:02:47.800> got

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
bit of a clutch system that they got

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.340 
bit of a clutch system that they got
going<00:02:48.280> on<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:49.630> then<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:50.050> course<00:02:50.080> you've<00:02:50.320> got

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
going on and then of course you've got

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.750 
going on and then of course you've got
your<00:02:50.560> shaft<00:02:50.800> driven<00:02:50.980> all<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.310> way<00:02:51.400> through

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
your shaft driven all the way through

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.380 
your shaft driven all the way through
battery<00:02:52.420> trays<00:02:52.690> along<00:02:53.050> here<00:02:54.150> anything<00:02:55.150> else

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
battery trays along here anything else

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.660 
battery trays along here anything else
on<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.570> other<00:02:55.600> side<00:02:55.870> no<00:02:56.050> not<00:02:56.230> really

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
on the other side no not really

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.470 
on the other side no not really
now<00:02:57.670> you've<00:02:57.880> got<00:02:59.520> toe<00:03:00.520> adjustment<00:03:01.060> here<00:03:01.270> and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
now you've got toe adjustment here and

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.120 
now you've got toe adjustment here and
you've<00:03:01.840> got<00:03:01.870> camber<00:03:02.350> adjustment<00:03:02.410> at<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:02.950> top

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
you've got camber adjustment at the top

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.850 
you've got camber adjustment at the top
as<00:03:03.310> well<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:03.730> pretty<00:03:04.630> well<00:03:04.780> equipped<00:03:05.110> the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
as well so pretty well equipped the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.449 
as well so pretty well equipped the
shocks<00:03:06.790> are<00:03:07.390> not<00:03:07.780> too<00:03:08.050> bad<00:03:08.380> today<00:03:08.709> they<00:03:09.250> kind

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
shocks are not too bad today they kind

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.930 
shocks are not too bad today they kind
of<00:03:09.550> feel<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.760> little<00:03:09.850> springy<00:03:10.330> at<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.630> front

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
of feel a little springy at the front

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.520 
of feel a little springy at the front
actually<00:03:12.940> no<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.720> back<00:03:13.989> feel<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.290> lot<00:03:14.500> more

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
actually no the back feel a lot more

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.290 
actually no the back feel a lot more
springy<00:03:14.950> than<00:03:15.190> than<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:15.940> front<00:03:16.090> do

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
springy than than the front do

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.580 
springy than than the front do
especially<00:03:16.510> this<00:03:16.840> one<00:03:17.049> almost<00:03:17.380> feels<00:03:17.530> like

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
especially this one almost feels like

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.650 
especially this one almost feels like
it's<00:03:17.769> got<00:03:17.890> no<00:03:18.040> oil<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:19.239> I'm<00:03:19.570> probably

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
it's got no oil in it so I'm probably

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.440 
it's got no oil in it so I'm probably
gonna<00:03:19.900> have<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.049> check<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.650> shocks<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.670> the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
gonna have to check the shocks the the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.900 
gonna have to check the shocks the the
front<00:03:22.660> shocks<00:03:22.900> feel<00:03:23.080> a<00:03:23.110> lot<00:03:23.320> better<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.910> as

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
front shocks feel a lot better and as

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.670 
front shocks feel a lot better and as
you<00:03:25.000> can<00:03:25.150> see<00:03:25.299> they<00:03:25.480> are<00:03:25.510> plastic<00:03:26.080> body<00:03:26.290> chocks

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
you can see they are plastic body chocks

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.710 
you can see they are plastic body chocks
plastic<00:03:27.160> caps<00:03:27.430> but<00:03:28.030> they<00:03:28.150> do<00:03:28.269> have<00:03:28.420> threaded

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
plastic caps but they do have threaded

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.910 
plastic caps but they do have threaded
bodies<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.230> then<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.440> course<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.709> can<00:03:29.830> adjust

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
bodies and then of course you can adjust

perhaps<00:04:59.980> you<00:05:00.980> can<00:05:01.130> see<00:05:01.310> them<00:05:01.430> there<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:01.760> it

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
perhaps you can see them there and it

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.320 
perhaps you can see them there and it
actually<00:05:02.150> sort<00:05:02.570> of<00:05:02.660> comes<00:05:03.020> around<00:05:03.380> so<00:05:04.240> can<00:05:05.240> you

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
actually sort of comes around so can you

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.420 
actually sort of comes around so can you
guys<00:05:05.450> see<00:05:05.660> that<00:05:05.810> okay<00:05:06.140> so<00:05:06.890> it<00:05:06.950> comes<00:05:07.010> around

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
guys see that okay so it comes around

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.020 
guys see that okay so it comes around
there<00:05:08.530> so<00:05:09.530> it's<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:09.860> look<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:10.460> looks<00:05:10.640> kind<00:05:10.940> of

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
there so it's it look it looks kind of

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.570 
there so it's it look it looks kind of
sturdy<00:05:11.950> certainly<00:05:12.950> it<00:05:13.040> doesn't<00:05:13.190> need<00:05:13.370> to<00:05:13.490> be

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
sturdy certainly it doesn't need to be

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.430 
sturdy certainly it doesn't need to be
anything<00:05:13.790> too<00:05:14.060> spectacular<00:05:14.300> for<00:05:15.170> a<00:05:15.200> little

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
anything too spectacular for a little

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.560 
anything too spectacular for a little
car<00:05:15.620> this<00:05:15.860> size<00:05:16.100> but<00:05:16.910> I<00:05:16.970> am<00:05:17.090> curious<00:05:17.390> to<00:05:17.540> see
