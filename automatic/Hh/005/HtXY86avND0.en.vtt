really easy like I said it's kind of
like<00:00:49.800> an<00:00:49.860> intermediate<00:00:50.370> level<00:00:50.489> trick<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
like an intermediate level trick but you

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.189

people<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.420> session<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.899> fire<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> foot

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
people are session you fire out a foot

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.020 
people are session you fire out a foot
plant<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.399> people<00:00:59.699> are<00:00:59.789> Sykes

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
plant with and like people are Sykes

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.130 
plant with and like people are Sykes
it's<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.390> not<00:01:00.510> something<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.960> see

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
it's just not something that you see

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.349 
it's just not something that you see
every<00:01:01.379> day<00:01:01.410> anymore<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.340> most<00:01:02.460> ideal<00:01:02.760> setup

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
every day anymore the most ideal setup

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.990 
every day anymore the most ideal setup
would<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.140> actually<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.920> wall<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.610> or<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
would just actually a wall that or a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.670 
would just actually a wall that or a
tree<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.659> maybe<00:01:06.869> has<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.260> bit<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
tree that maybe has a little bit of a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.109 
tree that maybe has a little bit of a
slant<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:08.909> practice

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
slant to it so you can really practice

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.440 
slant to it so you can really practice
like<00:01:09.799> sticking<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.640> wall<00:01:11.790> because<00:01:12.150> that's

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
like sticking on the wall because that's

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.330 
like sticking on the wall because that's
that's<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> crucial<00:01:13.680> part<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that's a really a crucial part of the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.789 
that's a really a crucial part of the
trick<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.939> whipping<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.110> bike<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.590> then

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
trick is like whipping the bike and then

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.399 
trick is like whipping the bike and then
like<00:01:17.040> really<00:01:17.729> getting<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.090> solid<00:01:18.540> plant<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
like really getting a solid plant on the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.899 
like really getting a solid plant on the
wall<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:20.040> time<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.610> let<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
wall so you have time to like let it

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.700 
wall so you have time to like let it
spin<00:01:21.270> around<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.900> then<00:01:22.020> spot<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.409> pedals

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
spin around and then spot your pedals

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.160 
spin around and then spot your pedals
and<00:01:22.830> come<00:01:22.979> off<00:01:23.299> it's<00:01:24.299> good<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> try<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and come off it's good to try to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.080 
and come off it's good to try to
approach<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.740> wall<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> same<00:01:26.670> speed

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
approach the wall with the same speed

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.539 
approach the wall with the same speed
that<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.689> would<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.080> do<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.189> normal

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
that you would to do just like a normal

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.460 
that you would to do just like a normal
wall<00:01:29.700> right<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> nice<00:01:30.540> solid<00:01:31.290> wall

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
wall right just like a nice solid wall

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.980 
wall right just like a nice solid wall
ride<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.070> off<00:01:32.159> then<00:01:32.640> from<00:01:32.850> there<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
ride on and off then from there just you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.859 
ride on and off then from there just you
start<00:01:34.650> your<00:01:34.770> tail<00:01:34.950> whip<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:36.689> bike

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
start your tail whip and then your bike

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.539 
start your tail whip and then your bike
should<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.409> half<00:01:37.650> way<00:01:37.680> around<00:01:37.950> by<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> time

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
should be half way around by the time

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.929 
should be half way around by the time
you<00:01:38.670> reach<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.850> wall<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.920> enough<00:01:41.460> speed<00:01:41.729> that

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
you reach the wall and enough speed that

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.819 
you reach the wall and enough speed that
you<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> solid<00:01:42.450> plan<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.530> stick

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
you get a solid plan so you can stick

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.920 
you get a solid plan so you can stick
and<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.549> watch<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.790> come<00:01:45.090> around<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.540> spot

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
and just watch it come around and spot

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.810 
and just watch it come around and spot
your<00:01:46.049> pedals<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.799> definitely<00:01:47.009> it'll<00:01:47.640> take<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
your pedals you definitely it'll take a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.609 
your pedals you definitely it'll take a
long<00:01:48.030> time<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.450> really<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.869> master<00:01:49.320> getting

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
long time to really like master getting

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.580 
long time to really like master getting
the<00:01:49.710> rotation<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:51.509> then<00:01:51.630> from<00:01:51.899> there<00:01:52.079> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the rotation and then from there you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.560 
the rotation and then from there you
just<00:01:52.740> kind<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.100> start<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.149> least<00:01:54.299> for<00:01:54.479> me

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
just kind of start I or at least for me

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.800 
just kind of start I or at least for me
like<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.490> would<00:01:56.490> got<00:01:56.909> mastered<00:01:57.450> getting<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
like I would got mastered getting the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.480 
like I would got mastered getting the
rotation<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.590> next<00:01:58.890> step<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.280> like

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
rotation and the next step is like

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.219 
rotation and the next step is like
learning<00:01:59.880> how<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.119> actually<00:02:00.299> get<00:02:00.630> back<00:02:00.869> over

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
learning how to actually get back over

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.660 
learning how to actually get back over
and<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.500> land<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:01.979> kind<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.250> straddling

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
and like land like kind of straddling

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.749 
and like land like kind of straddling
your<00:02:02.820> bike<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:04.320> then<00:02:04.890> from<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.340> next<00:02:05.579> step

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
your bike and then from the next step

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.510 
your bike and then from the next step
for<00:02:06.030> me<00:02:06.060> at<00:02:06.240> least<00:02:06.450> was<00:02:06.799> okay<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.129> now<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.310> got

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
for me at least was okay and now I got

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.969 
for me at least was okay and now I got
to<00:02:08.550> catch<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.450> front<00:02:09.810> front<00:02:10.349> pedal<00:02:10.709> right

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
to catch the front front pedal right

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.750 
to catch the front front pedal right
foot

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
foot

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.390 
foot
before<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:13.019> learning<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.409> whip<00:02:14.280> it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
before just just learning to whip it

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.179 
before just just learning to whip it
around<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:15.090> then<00:02:15.510> jump<00:02:15.900> right<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.860> get<00:02:17.010> that

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
around and then jump right just get that

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.280 
around and then jump right just get that
that<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.090> first<00:02:18.420> foot<00:02:18.659> planted<00:02:19.079> on<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
that that first foot planted on the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.979 
that that first foot planted on the
pedal<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.709> then<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:21.209> deal<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.840> get

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
pedal and then you deal you get

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.360 
pedal and then you deal you get
comfortable<00:02:22.409> doing<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.980> then<00:02:23.220> you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
comfortable doing that and then you

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.949 
comfortable doing that and then you
really<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.730> go<00:02:23.879> for<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.239> spot<00:02:24.480> your<00:02:24.629> pedals
