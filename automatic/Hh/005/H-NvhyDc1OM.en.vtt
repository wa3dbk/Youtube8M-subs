00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
make sure you do over a table because

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.130 
make sure you do over a table because
they're<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.290> small<00:02:35.440> parts<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:37.270> little<00:02:37.540> toggle

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
they're a small parts that little toggle

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.630 
they're a small parts that little toggle
that<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.500> showed<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:38.830> earlier<00:02:38.890> on<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.430> actually

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
that I showed you earlier on to actually

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.020 
that I showed you earlier on to actually
switch<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.170> ball<00:02:41.170> on<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.560> off<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:42.580> start<00:02:42.910> to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
switch the ball on and off you start to

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.509 
switch the ball on and off you start to
rotate<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.570> counter<00:02:44.019> clockwise<00:02:44.290> now<00:02:45.220> try

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
rotate that counter clockwise now try

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.690 
rotate that counter clockwise now try
and<00:02:45.610> keep<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.940> up<00:02:46.440> while<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.590> rotate<00:02:48.519> that

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
and keep this up while you rotate that

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.280 
and keep this up while you rotate that
because<00:02:49.420> there's<00:02:49.570> actually<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.870> spring

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
because there's actually a spring

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.560 
because there's actually a spring
mechanism<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.980> there<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.459> at<00:02:52.030> some<00:02:52.239> point

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
mechanism in there and at some point

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.830 
mechanism in there and at some point
it'll<00:02:53.230> start<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.739> spring<00:02:54.100> out<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:55.750> you

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
it'll start to spring out and so you

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.240 
it'll start to spring out and so you
want<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.050> make<00:02:56.170> sure<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.830> keep<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.100> hold

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
want to make sure that you keep a hold

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.150 
want to make sure that you keep a hold
of<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.489> piece<00:02:58.500> set<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.530> down<00:02:59.830> nice<00:03:00.130> and

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
of this piece set that down nice and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.729 
of this piece set that down nice and
safe<00:03:00.519> there<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.600> then<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.140> next<00:03:02.170> thing<00:03:02.410> is<00:03:02.560> to

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
safe there and then the next thing is to

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.860 
safe there and then the next thing is to
turn<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.280> ball<00:03:03.459> over<00:03:03.700> on<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.510> palm<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.750> your

actually empty you can set that down you

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.940 
actually empty you can set that down you
have<00:03:12.970> your<00:03:13.090> lighting<00:03:13.510> mechanism<00:03:14.049> will<00:03:14.709> set

you<00:03:33.040> now<00:03:33.160> how<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.489> set<00:03:34.120> them<00:03:34.239> back<00:03:34.420> into<00:03:34.660> the

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
you now how to set them back into the

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.740 
you now how to set them back into the
ball<00:03:35.049> with<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.799> illumination<00:03:36.489> kit<00:03:36.820> with<00:03:37.239> the

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
ball with the illumination kit with the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.560 
ball with the illumination kit with the
light<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.950> LED<00:03:39.459> facing<00:03:40.359> down<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:42.570> batteries

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
light the LED facing down the batteries

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.449 
light the LED facing down the batteries
will<00:03:43.750> actually<00:03:43.989> go<00:03:44.109> in<00:03:44.290> with<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.190> negative

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
will actually go in with the negative

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.630 
will actually go in with the negative
side<00:03:45.970> down<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:47.040> actually<00:03:48.040> on<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.280> battery

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
side down and actually on the battery

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.729 
side down and actually on the battery
you'll<00:03:48.790> say<00:03:49.000> positive<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.600> negative<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.650> you

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
you'll say positive and negative so you

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.020 
you'll say positive and negative so you
set<00:03:50.950> them<00:03:51.040> in<00:03:51.160> negative<00:03:51.700> side<00:03:51.910> down<00:03:52.150> one<00:03:52.980> two

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
set them in negative side down one two

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.870 
set them in negative side down one two
three<00:03:55.980> set<00:03:56.980> that<00:03:57.100> back<00:03:57.310> into<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.880> ball<00:03:59.880> and

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
three set that back into the ball and

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.660 
three set that back into the ball and
then<00:04:01.000> be<00:04:01.630> real<00:04:01.840> careful<00:04:02.140> not<00:04:02.320> to<00:04:02.500> what<00:04:03.400> we<00:04:03.489> call

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
then be real careful not to what we call

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.699 
then be real careful not to what we call
cross<00:04:04.060> thread<00:04:04.420> is<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.930> actually<00:04:05.049> screw<00:04:05.530> that

cross thread is to actually screw that

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.030 
cross thread is to actually screw that
plastic<00:04:06.220> piece<00:04:06.430> back<00:04:07.120> in

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040
