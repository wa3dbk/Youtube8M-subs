00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.080
 then we will attack the animation part 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.480
 and we will now be interested in 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.550
 first place to what is called the 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.050
 timeline so the little palette of 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.290
 chronological one just finds it down 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.969
 the screen 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.490
 so if you do not see with you 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.290
 see the catalog you have the small 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.730
 icon just up here stop there 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.910
 you see that in fact I can switch 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.140
 from catalog to chronology 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.579
 Conversely 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.570
 suddenly there is this attention to you 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.500
 can switch from one to another because 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.169
 that it still allows you to slide 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.730
 possibly animated objects and 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.480
 return to the timeline afterwards 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.700
 to rework them 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.170
 then the chronology the window we go 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.720
 so from the top left so already 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.020
 sent that here I have an animation in my 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.390
 listing 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.760
 only one with parameters 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.579
 very determined animation that myself 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.590
 I then defined the window of 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.720
 timeline here you are going to have the 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.220
 duration in fact of animation and the number 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.710
 of image per second so to have at 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.800
 less a minimal fluidity correct on 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.880
 will say 25 images 24-25 it's fine here 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.690
 I'm on ten seconds of animation 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.119
 so we see it very well in the 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.829
 chronology r i'm going from 0 to 10 if you 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.270
 change this figure of course you 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.010
 will be able to lengthen in fact the duration 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.960
 see animation so here I spent on 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.010
 20 seconds 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.820
 I can possibly like that worth 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.409
 and then come back we'll have here so 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.970
 all the part of what will be animated 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.500
 so the extra 100g no thing that is 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.000
 animated in my scene so inevitably I 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.140
 do not see anything but here I can 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.820
 so reach the animation 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.440
 materials animation objects 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.030
 animation of lots including lights 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.820
 cameras everything is animated 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.050
 will appear in the list here if ever 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.550
 you need to work on a 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.159
 hierarchical list and not here 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.810
 to have only one visually 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.420
 animated element you see that necessarily 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.850
 as we are doped down here we can not 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.170
 show you the whole hierarchy 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.460
 you still have a mode here full 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.930
 screen down right there who will you 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.610
 so show a full window of 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.740
 chronology you see that there suddenly 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.540
 replace by the catalog alas here you 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.800
 will have the entire hierarchical list of your 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.450
 animations and all foot images that 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.399
 will be associated so that allows you in 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.310
 simply to have a 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.649
 better visualization of your work 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.140
 so here is full screen mode or mode 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.509
 doc and as I am currently in 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.369
 so follow the timeline see that there I 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.269
 so I'm sure from 0 to 10 seconds you 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.590
 and a small cursor that will take you 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.060
 allow to zoom in or out or with 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.140
 the monette is also used to do it so 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.019
 allows us to possibly be more 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.100
 accurate in your work or to see from 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.540
 much wider way 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.769
 the timeline of your animation well 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.800
 heard you have all the controls 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.900
 classic navigation in this 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.489
 chronology with of course the possibility 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.959
 route back to the first image 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.000
 from the sequence where to go to the last 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.130
 retreated from an advanced image of an image 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.570
 or just to please here 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.860
 you also have control over time 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.900
 where you will be able to go to a 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.269
 indeterminate image number or 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.860
 possibly here a moment of the 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.989
 sequence by simply returning 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.570
 so the timer the code times that you 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.850
 want the recording mode him he 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.360
 will therefore be used to record key images 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.970
 by animating water objects 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.130
 in places with solid materials 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.940
 of things like that state in fact so 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.040
 we'll see it later 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.180
 then here it's for loops so 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.700
 you will be able to have 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.810
 animations you realize a course that 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.100
 you do it curly you want everything 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.230
 so just enter the number of 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.300
 loops needed by activating the loop 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.140
 and so it will repeat the animation what 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.790
 that he arrives in the global film then 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.380
 we will have a constant speed mode 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.640
 the constant speed mode that's all 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.100
 simply when I'm actually animating 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.360
 a course of cameras if I tick 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.920
 constant speed I have the same speed 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.480
 from beginning to end it's basically the 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.740
 camera path will come alive by default 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.850
 on the 10 seconds of animations too 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.770
 when I create them so we'll see it 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.000
 later 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.930
 so he will have a speed determined not 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.540
 which will define simply 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.709
 the speed will be calculated automatically 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.840
 10 seconds to make a course of 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.180
 for example 5 m bah here it will do so 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.130
 automatically calculate the speed 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.260
 if now you uncheck speed 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.209
 constant there will be an acceleration or 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.770
 at the beginning of the calculation and a deceleration at 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.510
 the end of the calculation one the 20 at the end of 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.890
 animation 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.330
 open gl mode yes lets you all 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.610
 simply having a display 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.570
 opengl a little more basic but 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.620
 maybe a little better defined at 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.760
 edge level to see better 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.860
 possibly the animations of what 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.110
 you're realizing that's it 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.440
 how does the timeline work so 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.440
 chronology
