00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.970
 every fellow goodbye dear friends 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.799
 French motorists my name is 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.870
 thomas i'm every professional 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.429
 of cars and I address you this 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.179
 evening thanks to the use of all for 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.770
 tell you about a French problem my 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.650
 time because we suffer particularly 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.850
 France that follows diesel indeed I 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.850
 find that we finally speak quite little 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.609
 from diesel to talk about announced effect 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.680
 last year that confirmed that the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.529
 diesel was carcinogenic especially by 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.669
 the bento pyrene rejects it 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.950
 I think we do not talk enough about 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.940
 diesel and they are a great time to 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.399
 make a national debate 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.820
 indeed France is the first country 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.380
 to the world producer of 10 l we consume 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.060
 a huge 70% of our 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.850
 when our fuel consumption 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.190
 that of households in any case is 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.140
 composed of diesel companies 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.160
 French can not recover the VAT 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.380
 only on the diesel 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.990
 in short we imposed a story 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.200
 of love with the diesel that is big 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.420
 time 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.050
 finally we must put an end to this 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.730
 love story or just so the 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.860
 origins of diesel elsewhere in France 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.479
 are pretty vague we do not know too much 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.080
 why did we come to such a 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.830
 situation 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 it would seem that the government at the 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.380
 end of the 1950s through the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.820
 nuclear program end up with a 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.610
 oil stock he did not know too much 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.979
 what to do so most certainly in 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.750
 any case that the government has 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.920
 turned to the builders their 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.720
 asking to look into the matter 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.020
 of diesel and promising them to key 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.710
 a lighter tax system that was soon 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.740
 to bring down the French who did not 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.890
 delayed forgiveness to influence the choices 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.800
 purchase of French since we're going more 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.810
 away with a dj hell and we pay less 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.360
 pay less at the pump so the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.900
 diesel has 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.250
 still allowed to lighten the budget 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.260
 household fuel in many 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.150
 years today we have a boat of 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.150
 achievements that such as this effect 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:08.270
 are getting smaller and that the blow 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.970
 Use 100km actually 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.950
 is not really amortized by the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.210
 diesel diesel vehicles cost more 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.310
 expensive to produce that more expensive to 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.160
 maintain more expensive assured we need 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.480
 Precious metals for depollution 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.910
 today we only look at the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.980
 co2 as a criterion in any case in France 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.080
 the euro 6 standard arrives in 2014 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.320
 fortunately it takes into account 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.460
 the number of fine particles and not 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.710
 plus the name of particles in general gold 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.730
 these fine particle particles are 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.350
 those who are the most carcinogenic 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.820
 the most harmful since it penetrates 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.530
 in our lungs while the 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.810
 particles of the time that was more 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.260
 thick and a bigger one was still 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.750
 filterable by our human systems 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.980
 so here is the French government has 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.900
 distorted the market 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.730
 info it's our freedom of choice 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.620
 today in athens the diesel is 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.560
 forbidden to protect the modules the 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.930
 monuments to obviously avoid the 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.140
 noise pollution since one of them 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.150
 still remain very noisy and he 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.060
 It is high time to make light and 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.130
 to make us passionate about cars 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.600
 car professionals to type 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.980
 a big blow on the table and 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.320
 ask the French government to 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.910
 to be accountable by what is going on 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.380
 to pass in a few years is that 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.060
 the government under pressure 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.250
 European as it is it's already the 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.660
 case in germany with the prohibition of 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.140
 the most polluting diesel in the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.090
 German cities 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.200
 it will happen the same thing in France on 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.300
 will have to face because we have 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.260
 already been we already took it invented 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.810
 European Commission for 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.890
 breaches of air quality on 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.019
 French government will turn to 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.459
 we asked us to 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.260
 to abandon the diesel or pay a 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.150
 tax at the entrance of the voids while 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.120
 it is itself that influences the influence 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.980
 our choice so to avoid that it 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.890
 must be manifested today 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.390
 that we are present that we are active and 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.220
 to make our voices heard 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.630
 it is by one of the hands a debate 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.940
 Only to motorists 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.360
 it's a debate that concerns the whole 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.920
 world because we can we go it's our 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.940
 tomorrow's children it's us in a 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.680
 time maybe they will have some 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.820
 cancers we do not wish it is 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.310
 time to restore the balance so 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.720
 act 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.940
 now if you agree with 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.330
 I do not hesitate to comment on the space 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.130
 from below 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.859
 make your own videos do your 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.600
 own site I call this top 10 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.930
 it must really alert the public 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.030
 public 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.520
 Thank you for listening to me and 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.419
 let's all act together for an air 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.419
 much cleaner wind
