00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
think it's time because you know when I

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.900 
think it's time because you know when I
pull<00:00:24.150> apart<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.199> see<00:00:26.010> my<00:00:26.220> scalp<00:00:26.609> and

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
pull apart you can see see my scalp and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:37.940 
pull apart you can see see my scalp and
then<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.359> have<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> lot<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.260> growth<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:36.950> and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
then I have a lot of growth going on and

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.340 
then I have a lot of growth going on and
I<00:00:38.820> want<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.540> ahead<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.930> put<00:00:40.620> loose<00:00:40.950> hair

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
I want to go ahead and put loose hair

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.500 
I want to go ahead and put loose hair
with<00:00:43.350> some<00:00:43.590> locks<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.370> lot<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> lot<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.329> loose

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.369 
with some locks a lot a lot of loose
hair<00:00:45.840> going<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:47.570> which<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.750> guess<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.140> just

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
hair going on which I guess was just

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.319 
hair going on which I guess was just
good<00:00:51.050> you<00:00:52.160> know<00:00:53.690> loose<00:00:54.690> hair<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.440> stuff<00:00:56.329> go

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
good you know loose hair and stuff go

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.150 
good you know loose hair and stuff go
ahead<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.719> put<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.289> some<00:00:58.469> put<00:00:58.980> some

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
ahead and put that with some put some

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.240 
ahead and put that with some put some
put<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.789> lock<00:01:00.090> pick<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> lock<00:01:01.440> stronger

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
put a lock pick a lock stronger

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.380 
put a lock pick a lock stronger
I<00:01:02.280> guess<00:01:02.489> that's<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> whole<00:01:02.940> point<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:04.189> Sigma

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
I guess that's the whole point of Sigma

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:13.300 
I guess that's the whole point of Sigma
free<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.720> me<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> make<00:01:07.799> my<00:01:07.830> walk<00:01:08.220> stronger

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310
