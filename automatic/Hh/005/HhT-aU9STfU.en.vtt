00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.820 
veins in his arms and all the wrinkles
and<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.540> soup<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:17.010> really<00:02:17.430> cool<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.830> he's

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
and the soup it's really cool and he's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.010 
and the soup it's really cool and he's
just<00:02:20.010> an<00:02:20.160> awesome<00:02:20.340> figure<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
just an awesome figure and the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.370 
just an awesome figure and the
articulation<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.660> actually<00:02:24.660> pretty<00:02:24.840> good<00:02:25.050> I'm

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
articulation is actually pretty good I'm

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.810 
articulation is actually pretty good I'm
going<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.709> go<00:02:25.770> ahead<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:25.950> show<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.220> so

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
going to go ahead and show you that so

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.270 
going to go ahead and show you that so
here<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.150> go<00:02:27.440> all<00:02:28.440> right<00:02:28.590> since<00:02:28.890> these<00:02:29.010> really

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
here we go all right since these really

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.660 
here we go all right since these really
big<00:02:29.490> E's<00:02:29.670> gonna<00:02:29.790> be<00:02:29.880> ops<00:02:30.090> camera<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.080> anyways

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
big E's gonna be ops camera but anyways

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.199 
big E's gonna be ops camera but anyways
so<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.060> legs<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.959> round<00:02:34.350> like<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.550> don't

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
so the legs can round like that I don't

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.259 
so the legs can round like that I don't
know<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:36.540> they<00:02:36.660> can<00:02:36.720> go<00:02:36.930> outward<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:38.459> knee<00:02:38.790> can

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
know if they can go outward the knee can

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.350 
know if they can go outward the knee can
bend<00:02:40.250> like<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:42.630> ankle<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.890> rotate<00:02:44.430> 360

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
bend like so the ankle can rotate 360

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.310 
bend like so the ankle can rotate 360
degrees<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.730> they<00:02:47.910> can<00:02:48.180> they<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.450> move<00:02:49.110> up

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
degrees and they can they can move up

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.290 
degrees and they can they can move up
and<00:02:49.440> down<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:49.890> mine's<00:02:50.400> new<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:51.150> pretty

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
and down but mine's new so it's pretty

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.810 
and down but mine's new so it's pretty
stiff<00:02:52.790> do<00:02:53.790> waste<00:02:54.239> can<00:02:54.600> go<00:02:54.810> 360<00:02:55.620> degrees<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
stiff do waste can go 360 degrees the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.360 
stiff do waste can go 360 degrees the
arms<00:02:57.300> can<00:02:57.540> go<00:02:57.690> out<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.400> n<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:01.500> elbows<00:03:02.010> can

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
arms can go out and n the elbows can

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
arms can go out and n the elbows can
bend<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:04.320> wrist<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:04.980> move<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:06.150> can<00:03:06.269> go

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
bend the wrist can move and it can go

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.550 
bend the wrist can move and it can go
back<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.050> forward<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:09.300> head<00:03:09.570> can<00:03:10.410> go

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
back and forward and the head can go

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.320 
back and forward and the head can go
slightly<00:03:10.980> up<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.489> down<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.080> turn<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.940> quite<00:03:15.300> a

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
slightly up and down and turn so quite a

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.800 
slightly up and down and turn so quite a
bit<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.630> articulation<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:17.480> overall<00:03:18.480> he's

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
bit of articulation and overall he's

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.830 
bit of articulation and overall he's
just<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.170> really<00:03:19.350> nice<00:03:19.620> figure<00:03:20.100> as<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.360> probably

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
just a really nice figure as I probably

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.520 
just a really nice figure as I probably
said<00:03:22.110> for<00:03:22.320> like<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> third<00:03:22.769> time<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:24.320> yeah<00:03:25.320> oh
