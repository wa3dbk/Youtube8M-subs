 they know in brazil they speak portuguese in 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.239

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.280
 movie but it was good we started 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.690
 where action scenes hands 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.770
 they started killing everyone and how was 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.770
 the most intense part 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.930
 it went off it turns off the cinema turns off the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.810

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.300
 Sir speaking Portuguese in Portuguese I 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.370
 I did not understand anything I do not speak Portuguese in 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.400
 the guy and he says he always meets in 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.430
 phrases at the beginning of the month to 15 people 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.420
 sinners 6 and when he says that 15 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.720
 pressures hit about 6 do this and I 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.150
 nothing, not even a joke, I started thinking 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.800
 well in those in the tragedies that happened in 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.160
 bad things and I already danced chile that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.630
 it was the first thing I did save my life 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.010
 since my camera and I started recording everything 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.930

 I knew what had happened 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.670
 Then he took out my camera and I'm going 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.380
 I ask the people next door and what 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.380

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.049

 let's finish with the question 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.510
 that the question of today is to 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.300
 you who were asked by twitter 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.420
 this is my twitter is solution that comes up 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.130
 and that is the question of today if 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.680
 you had to invent an olympic game 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.510
 which would be a very good question since 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.720
 we are on those dates if you had to 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.820
 invent an Olympic game what would be the 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.670
 flip-flop to see who pee 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.340
 further to see who spits the furthest 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.380
 lifting people if you see that 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.940
 put an Olympic sport what would be the 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.600
 best answer I put them in the 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.670
