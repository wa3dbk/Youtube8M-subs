00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.509
 hello to you all courtyard and today we 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.910
 see one interesting fight on 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.180
 french premium pshki third 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.010
 patient level 36 pak 40 very very i 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.230
 I love this car probably in my game 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.820
 2 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.960
 favorite cars two favorite tanks 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.520
 both of these tanks meanwhile flash drives 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.000
 probably my list of favorite tanks will be 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.480
 replenish it naturally and quite 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.930
 to myself 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.610
 it is logical but for now it 's two tanks lunch 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.520
 about this both german this patient 36 pak 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.010
 40 but in the game will find both French or 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.670
 she was French in life 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.780
 and here it is not in my opinion all the same it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.600
 It was a German Fri-shka Frenchman took it 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.230
 or not, but in general I don't remember something like that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.949
 i sure 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.500
 and E25 is another German Fri-shka already 7 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.479
 level is also premium and it's just 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.010
 wonderful cars they are different in style of play 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.229
 e25 this tank with a little alpha which 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.880
 due and bad breakthrough which should 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.159
 ride all over the map and home 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.070
 the enemy is not shining everywhere 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.990
 fcm 36 pak 40 is very slow so with 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.840
 good breakthrough good alpha which 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.340
 must understand the vantage point and 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.570
 Damage Damage Damage Home 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.759
 damage shot after shot and not 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.579
 looking at all these differences play me 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.680
 it turns out well both there and there but on E25 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.439
 naturally drag much harder 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.990
 because there is a higher level of fighting there 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.810
 more powerful opponents there often drain because 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.640
 that at high levels of battles plum 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.979
 much more often and no matter what 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.990
 opponents there somehow weaken 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:01.560
 but the allies there are somehow weaker as well 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.540
 fcm 36 pak 40 this is a wonderful car i and 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.080
 I like to play on it 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:12.150
 rollback is about 120 there are 115 fights and I 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.400
 had absolutely no feeling 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.819
 that here I am bored that I no longer 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.760
 I want to roll on it there is still not yet 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.340
 this bright this bright example will be 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.220
 what can a patient 36 pak 40 and for what her 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.110
 can love falls on pro retirement 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.650
 by the way she is not so often on the very 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.900
 rarely do the functions manage to roll out and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.790
 get to the province naturally on 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.970
 provinces should pull under 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.610
 this team itself fights when on 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.739
 provinces people merge the whole team 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.280
 there for two minutes in this case 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.739
 the patient certainly won't drag because 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.580
 one against there 12 10 opponents 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.349
 it's not for cm pak she can't 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.010
 despite its rate of fire damage and 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:02.040
 no armor very small very 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.230
 very little health and she cannot 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.390
 haul against a huge amount 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.489
 opponents but when the team 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.530
 not the house itself comes across and thanks 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:15.150
 she manages to shoot for your light 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:20.100
 then it is very cool because because 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.530
 that's cool you shine they damage you yourself 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.920
 damage and at the same time do not shine because 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.250
 This card province now charge 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.470
 3361 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.079
 it's without a rammer on such 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.600
 honey we are not put it without a battle 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.370
 frat ventilation here too not 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.470
 you will put therefore really big 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.880
 there is no sense to pump up a military fraternity 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.260
 although martial brotherhood will add to you 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.350
 one and a half in my interest to the review 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.310
 one and a half percent to review 400 meters this 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.560
 not a big number not though not a big one 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.040
 figure 400 meters compared to other 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.870
 reviews of the same 330 are good numbers in 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.079
 add in the optics that I have 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.610
 it will be worth it with the butterfly and instead 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:07.120
 four 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.129
 honeycomb 40 meters I will get more meters from 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.359
 us limit 445 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.739
 and when you have a review 445 you shine 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.900
 movement in general, all sudoku can 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.180
 see though when you have a review 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.669
 More already there is a clearance of bushes 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.650
 Clearance bushes this undoubtedly very 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.800
 cool really because you can 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:32.440
 shine the enemy in general everywhere and everywhere 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:35.410
 and it's cool so with a perry charge of 3 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.479
 St 361 seconds with an overview of 440 meters 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.610
 stealth coefficient small 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.900
 therefore the smallest body in the ratio 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.190
 the invisibility netting disguise this 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.110
 wonderful car despite the fact that it 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.570
 gets to the fifth level where and fight 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.960
 pretty hard they can still 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.729
 play because it even gets fifth 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.360
 level you are able to give your damage 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.509
 very stable and punch them from someone else 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.330
 our goals are 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:06.280
 kv-1 well kv-1 makes the way gold if in 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.080
 forehead is hard because there need 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.789
 vyselivat all these pens 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.370
 then with punching into the boards and aft no 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.949
 there are no problems at all and so for what I love 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.010
 in the center of 6 pak40 so this is for the fact that 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:24.039
 nothing really doing I instructed 2000 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.919
 Damage received 9 frags and 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:30.280
 Tula failed to take yes I do not remember gives 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.530
 warm on such a shallow level but the essence is 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.570
 that is very cool and very cool 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.510
 I really like to ride a cut 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:41.020
 patient 36 pak 40 is and these levels 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.030
 of level 4 with 5 and Umino everything absolutely 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.520
 she is everywhere and she is cool everywhere she is not 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.440
 nice thanks to everyone who watched 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.970
