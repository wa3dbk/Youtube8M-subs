now college football has succumbed to

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.430 
now college football has succumbed to
the<00:03:44.880> pressure<00:03:44.910> exerted<00:03:45.330> by<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.930> National

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
the pressure exerted by the National

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.400 
the pressure exerted by the National
Football<00:03:46.560> League<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:47.510> make<00:03:48.510> its<00:03:48.720> sport<00:03:49.140> much

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
instituted in college than in pro but we

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.210 
instituted in college than in pro but we
had<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.109> cart<00:04:19.350> before<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.770> horse

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
had the cart before the horse

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.670 
had the cart before the horse
we<00:04:20.700> had<00:04:20.880> pro<00:04:21.210> football<00:04:21.690> do<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:22.080> first<00:04:22.320> last

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
we had pro football do this first last

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.730 
we had pro football do this first last
year<00:04:23.070> which<00:04:23.490> is<00:04:23.520> making<00:04:24.419> college<00:04:24.930> follow<00:04:25.290> suit

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
year which is making college follow suit

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.200 
year which is making college follow suit
this<00:04:26.220> year

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
this year

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.760 
this year
I<00:04:27.240> mean<00:04:27.360> both<00:04:27.720> games<00:04:28.080> are<00:04:28.319> starting<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.650> look

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
I mean both games are starting to look

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.620 
I mean both games are starting to look
like<00:04:28.949> flag<00:04:29.280> football<00:04:29.580> to<00:04:29.910> me<00:04:30.030> because<00:04:30.360> last

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
like flag football to me because last

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.320 
like flag football to me because last
year<00:04:30.930> pro<00:04:31.440> football<00:04:31.919> lost<00:04:32.910> some<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.210> its

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
year pro football lost some of its

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.589 
year pro football lost some of its
luster<00:04:33.470> because<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.520> violent<00:04:36.030> sport<00:04:36.330> I

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
luster because it is a violent sport I

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.240 
luster because it is a violent sport I
accept<00:04:37.530> what<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.830> is

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
accept what it is

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.890 
accept what it is
I<00:04:38.280> think<00:04:38.699> they<00:04:38.849> accept<00:04:39.210> what<00:04:39.389> it<00:04:39.479> is<00:04:39.599> when<00:04:39.780> they

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
I think they accept what it is when they

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.640 
I think they accept what it is when they
sign<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.349> dotted<00:04:40.530> line<00:04:41.220> you<00:04:42.000> know<00:04:42.120> what<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:42.990> we

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
sign the dotted line you know what I we

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.249
