00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.010
 I had none more I've been busted 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.580

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.279

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.589
 a rocket hitch and when I went to 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.569

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:23.119
 face directly went was a little gift 

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:24.859
 of Christmas that Santa Claus gave me was a 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.589
 rocket and I ran out of cars so 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.759

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.720
 I better not say that it is I try 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.300

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.270

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.960

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.580
 one the host father father mother and grandfather 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.289

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.280
 giving it air everything does nothing more than 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.890
 I'm accelerating to the one around here 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.250
 Another one, well, come on, another one has taken me 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.660
 tap and it exploded is pretty the by 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.270
 where do I have to go now that does that 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.140
 fact that it is a vale vale and ser initiates 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.060
 over here seriously my mother uncle 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.850
 I did not know, thank goodness, that I go first 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.310
 and I have plenty of time not how much 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.320
 I have time 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.829
 thousandth of a second puts me but good 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.229
 this this thing that I just entered and 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.179
 I have to do another looping of this not 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.250
 I know which ryder I think it's called no no what 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.270
 I know very well what it's called but now 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.420
 that will leave me let's go up 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.980
 c'mon c'mon let's take the speck yes 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.200
 I've taken it I've taken it but that's 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.019
 impossible to get there missing a ramp 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.410
 or something still falls short good 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.660
 arrived and so I was hit by here what 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.849
 nice is everything with the snow we have them 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.950
 forgotten I think there's snow or what 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.019
 It's obvious that he's already living it 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.450
 collided good now I hope not to cut 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.910
 finding me a train in front of me is already 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.380
 that I was missing by laps or the point to 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.750
 fairy point where I have to go by 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.440
 please see where I have everything now 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.660
 south over here 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.040
 This car is getting snow on me 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.720
 and it falls and falls and falls and falls well I have the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.940
 damaged car nothing happens if we give it 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.519
 work to the courson cars is so what 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.470
 we fix and because so many races for 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.349
 please why because there are so many ramps 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.880
 because I do not know if God tell the truth if 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.380
 I am sincere to me racing with 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.750
 I do not like ramps but good 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.220
 I have finished and I finished I tell you the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.650
 I really prefer the races that do not 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.140
 they have ramps like that so there's more 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.970
 speed does not jump us but speed and 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.920
 good guys here I see how it ends or a 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.350
 car marches but because it's running 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.630
 back I do not understand it good guys here 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.820
 I leave you a background image for the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.170
 goodbye a car back I do not know 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.910
 why are you doing the reverse 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.950
 that will not do the guard rail of this 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.020
 retreat, my mother, what a pimp 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.340

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.660
