00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
melon pan for the next set of lines you

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:58.189 
melon pan for the next set of lines you
wanted<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:47.800> be<00:00:47.920> diagonal<00:00:48.579> when<00:00:48.760> they<00:00:48.909> overlap

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.170 

get<00:00:59.199> for<00:00:59.559> light<00:00:59.890> ten<00:01:00.159> small<00:01:00.399> pieces<00:01:00.760> of<00:01:00.909> clay

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
get for light ten small pieces of clay

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.579 
get for light ten small pieces of clay
and<00:01:01.329> make<00:01:01.539> sure<00:01:01.570> that<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.899> ones<00:01:02.289> in<00:01:02.530> the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
and make sure that the ones in the

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.770 
and make sure that the ones in the
middle<00:01:02.859> are<00:01:02.979> slightly<00:01:03.369> bigger<00:01:03.670> and<00:01:03.969> put<00:01:04.629> them

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
compress them together and bend them so

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.320 
compress them together and bend them so
it<00:01:11.570> has<00:01:11.689> a<00:01:11.720> slight<00:01:12.140> curve<00:01:12.820> now<00:01:13.820> dust<00:01:14.180> the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
it has a slight curve now dust the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.999 
it has a slight curve now dust the
chocolate<00:01:14.720> cornet<00:01:15.020> with<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.170> pigments<00:01:15.710> like<00:01:15.860> we

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
chocolate cornet with a pigments like we

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.889 
chocolate cornet with a pigments like we
did<00:01:16.130> with<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.280> melon<00:01:16.610> pen<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.060> gradually

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
did with the melon pen and gradually

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.980 
did with the melon pen and gradually
build<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:18.229> up<00:01:18.320> from<00:01:18.590> light<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.920> dark<00:01:19.899> flip<00:01:20.899> it

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
build it up from light to dark flip it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.600 
build it up from light to dark flip it
over<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.290> dust<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.830> bottom<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.340> make<00:01:22.460> it

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
over and dust the bottom to make it

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.020 
over and dust the bottom to make it
slightly<00:01:22.880> darker

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.399 

next<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.149> out<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> needle<00:01:30.719> tool<00:01:30.899> and<00:01:31.170> make<00:01:31.259> an

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
next get out a needle tool and make an

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.690 
next get out a needle tool and make an
indent<00:01:31.799> near<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> top<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.549> chocolate

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
cornet get a brown piece of clay and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.370 
cornet get a brown piece of clay and
insert<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.240> small<00:01:36.509> hole<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.929> made<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
insert it in the small hole we made and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.910 
insert it in the small hole we made and
then<00:01:37.500> texture<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.390> if<00:01:39.649> you<00:01:40.649> would<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.859> to

this<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.870> really<00:01:52.080> doesn't<00:01:52.620> need<00:01:52.740> any

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
this one really doesn't need any

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:09.350 
this one really doesn't need any
explanation<00:02:07.429> we<00:02:08.429> want<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.700> make<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> pancake

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
explanation we want to make the pancake

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.060 
explanation we want to make the pancake
tops<00:02:09.630> much<00:02:09.959> darker<00:02:10.440> than<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.679> chocolate

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
tops much darker than the chocolate

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.400 
tops much darker than the chocolate
cornet<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.459> melon<00:02:12.000> pen<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.810> really<00:02:13.110> build<00:02:13.320> up

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
cornet and melon pen so really build up

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.880 
cornet and melon pen so really build up
the<00:02:13.530> color<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.100> one<00:02:15.380> get<00:02:16.380> out<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.560> dark

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
the color on this one get out a dark

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.350 
the color on this one get out a dark
brown<00:02:17.040> piece<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.490> clay<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.910> roll<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.209> out

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
brown piece of clay and roll it out

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.360 
brown piece of clay and roll it out
these<00:02:18.959> are<00:02:19.140> going<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.350> be<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.709> zukie<00:02:20.130> beans

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
these are going to be that zukie beans

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.990 
these are going to be that zukie beans
inside<00:02:21.740> cut<00:02:22.740> them<00:02:22.950> like<00:02:23.130> shown<00:02:23.430> into<00:02:23.790> many

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
inside cut them like shown into many

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.960 
inside cut them like shown into many
many<00:02:24.150> different<00:02:24.420> pieces<00:02:25.459> use<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> bottle<00:02:26.910> of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
many different pieces use a bottle of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.970 
many different pieces use a bottle of
TLS<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.780> pour<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.140> onto<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.410> piece<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.650> wax

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
TLS and pour it onto a piece of wax

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.680 
TLS and pour it onto a piece of wax
paper<00:02:29.100> that's<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.180> would<00:02:30.270> be<00:02:30.420> clean

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
paper that's just so it would be clean

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.220 
paper that's just so it would be clean
and<00:02:30.870> then<00:02:31.440> add<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.770> adzuki<00:02:32.070> beans<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.790> it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
and then add the adzuki beans to it

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.600 
and then add the adzuki beans to it
scrape<00:02:34.230> off<00:02:34.410> brown<00:02:34.680> chalk<00:02:34.980> into<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> mixture

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
scrape off brown chalk into the mixture

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.660 
scrape off brown chalk into the mixture
so<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.120> color<00:02:36.330> will<00:02:36.510> be<00:02:36.630> different<00:02:40.400> flip<00:02:41.400> over

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
so the color will be different flip over

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.280 
so the color will be different flip over
