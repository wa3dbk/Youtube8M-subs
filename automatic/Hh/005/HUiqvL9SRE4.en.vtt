the camera with one hand my tripod is uh
is<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> mail<00:01:10.799> right<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:12.409> okay<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.439> most

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
is in the mail right now okay so most

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.830 
is in the mail right now okay so most
wrist<00:01:14.220> wraps<00:01:15.080> when<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.290> get<00:01:16.500> them<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.600> thumb

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
wrist wraps when you get them the thumb

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.230 
wrist wraps when you get them the thumb
loop<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.229> only<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.649> one<00:01:19.679> side<00:01:19.939> okay<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:20.969> let's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
loop is only on one side okay so let's

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660 
loop is only on one side okay so let's
say<00:01:21.359> we<00:01:21.479> got<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> left<00:01:21.899> here<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.670> this

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
say we got on the left here so this

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.359 
say we got on the left here so this
thumb<00:01:23.939> loop<00:01:24.350> would<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.469> on<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.649> left<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:26.130> both

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
thumb loop would be on the left for both

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.959 
thumb loop would be on the left for both
sets<00:01:26.999> of<00:01:27.149> wrist<00:01:27.390> straps<00:01:27.600> they<00:01:27.749> send<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.969> your

sets of wrist straps they send you your

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.539 
sets of wrist straps they send you your
hands<00:01:30.359> are<00:01:30.479> not<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> same<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.469> are

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
hands are not the same they are

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.599 
hands are not the same they are
non-superimposable<00:01:32.549> mirror<00:01:32.759> images<00:01:34.219> this<00:01:35.219> so

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
non-superimposable mirror images this so

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.520 
non-superimposable mirror images this so
for<00:01:35.939> your<00:01:36.210> left<00:01:36.479> hand<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> thumb<00:01:37.140> loop<00:01:37.289> should

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
for your left hand the thumb loop should

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.349 
for your left hand the thumb loop should
be<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.579> your<00:01:38.729> right<00:01:38.909> hand<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.179> should<00:01:39.270> be

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
on the other side but foremost they put

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.910 
on the other side but foremost they put
it<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.039> same<00:01:41.189> side<00:01:42.289> tighten<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:43.619> ensure

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
it on the same side tighten and ensure

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.190 
it on the same side tighten and ensure
like<00:01:44.219> that<00:01:44.429> I<00:01:44.460> think<00:01:44.819> ah<00:01:45.469> I<00:01:46.469> don't<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:47.009> that

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
like that I think ah I don't like that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.950

these are pretty stiff and very
supportive<00:02:24.170> but<00:02:25.170> without

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
supportive but without

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.590 
supportive but without
ridiculous<00:02:28.170> pressure<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:29.040> my<00:02:29.280> wrists<00:02:29.670> which<00:02:30.450> I

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
ridiculous pressure on my wrists which I

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.040 
ridiculous pressure on my wrists which I
really<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.790> these<00:02:32.790> are<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.330> don't<00:02:33.630> know<00:02:33.810> if<00:02:33.960> I

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
really like these are I don't know if I

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.080 
really like these are I don't know if I
go<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.530> far<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:34.770> say<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.250> my<00:02:35.400> favorite<00:02:35.790> rap<00:02:35.910> of

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
go so far to say to my favorite rap of

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.820 
go so far to say to my favorite rap of
all<00:02:36.210> time<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:37.380> apt<00:02:37.950> hybrid<00:02:38.940> raps<00:02:39.180> they<00:02:39.420> had

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
all time the apt hybrid raps they had

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.690 
all time the apt hybrid raps they had
which<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.920> think<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.100> was<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> hybrid<00:02:41.430> between

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
which I think it was a hybrid between

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.970 
which I think it was a hybrid between
the<00:02:41.850> strangulate<00:02:42.390> ER<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.900> convicts<00:02:43.380> were

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the strangulate ER and the convicts were

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.820 
the strangulate ER and the convicts were
really<00:02:44.250> good<00:02:44.460> but<00:02:45.270> these<00:02:45.510> are<00:02:45.720> damn<00:02:46.470> close

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
really good but these are damn close

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.750 
really good but these are damn close
these<00:02:47.610> are<00:02:47.790> really<00:02:48.210> really<00:02:48.300> close<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.920> if

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
these are really really close and if

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.760 
these are really really close and if
they<00:02:50.880> grow<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.240> me<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.420> little<00:02:51.510> bit<00:02:51.630> more<00:02:51.870> they

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
they grow on me a little bit more they

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.880 
they grow on me a little bit more they
might<00:02:52.950> get<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.340> point<00:02:53.370> where<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:55.170> consider

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
might get to the point where I consider

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.610 
might get to the point where I consider
them<00:02:56.070> my<00:02:56.130> favorite<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.590> highly<00:02:58.590> recommend

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620

wrapping<00:03:01.740> your<00:03:01.830> wrist<00:03:02.330> you're<00:03:03.330> rapping<00:03:03.780> above

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
wrapping your wrist you're rapping above

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.960 
wrapping your wrist you're rapping above
and<00:03:04.620> below<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.920> wrist<00:03:05.250> joint<00:03:05.460> a<00:03:05.700> lot<00:03:05.880> of

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
and below the wrist joint a lot of

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.870 
and below the wrist joint a lot of
people<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.390> rap<00:03:07.190> like<00:03:08.190> below<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.670> wrist

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
people just rap like below the wrist

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.600 
people just rap like below the wrist
joint<00:03:09.120> like<00:03:10.050> where<00:03:10.200> my<00:03:10.320> watch<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.830> is<00:03:11.160> sitting

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
joint like where my watch is is sitting

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.730 
joint like where my watch is is sitting
right<00:03:11.640> now<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.930> have<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.230> wrap<00:03:13.380> all<00:03:13.620> the

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
right now and you have to wrap all the

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.690 
right now and you have to wrap all the
way<00:03:13.770> around<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:15.170> but<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.410> think<00:03:16.610> for<00:03:17.610> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
way around that but I think for the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.110 
way around that but I think for the
price<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.980> for<00:03:20.310> what<00:03:20.460> the<00:03:20.610> quality<00:03:21.000> you

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
price and and for what the quality you

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.530 
price and and for what the quality you
get<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:22.760> don't<00:03:23.760> think<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.000> can<00:03:24.120> really<00:03:24.300> beat

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
get I don't think you can really beat

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.020 
get I don't think you can really beat
these<00:03:24.920> so<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:25.950> hope<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.520> review<00:03:26.700> has<00:03:27.000> been
