00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 in this video we will explain to you step 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.069
 step three ways to join the great 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.290
 squares one of the ways is to put in a 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.889
 side the other side and on the other side the other side 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.130
 back hooked the wool going on 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.090
 crochet around a corner and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.670
 on the other side also around the corner 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.960
 we hook the thread and we're going to do 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.960
 half points 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.880
 around the great contour and catching 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.170
 half points on the one hand and means 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.339
 points on the other 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.060
 and we take a point here and a point 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:51.630
 of the great and the other side 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.810
 and we make a half point and so we're going to 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.810
 to go 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.769
 repeating 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.369
 until arriving 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.369
 to the corner 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.799
 so we see how the 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:31.899
 tissue without holes in between we now go 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.899
 to teach another way to join the grammys 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.340
 we make the first group of 3 varetas 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.980
 and now we would have to make a 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.350
 separation chain and do the 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.360
 next group of 3 varetas in this 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.360
 space what we are going to do is 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.649
 Taking the tissue upside down 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.509
 this is the right and this is the reverse 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.509
 we make a point 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.660
 we make a half point 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.629
 in this space of the great and 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.730
 and we weave the next group of 3 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.260
 varetas 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.799
 in the space that touches us 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.799
 a 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.840
 two 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.480
 and three varetas now we would have to 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.480
 make another chain but 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.780
 we make a half point in the next 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.720
 Great space and the other side 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.220
 and we make the group of 3 varetas that we 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.730
 play in this space 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.730
 one 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.549
 two 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.709
 and three varetas 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.120
 we make another half point in the next 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.569
 space 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.330
 and we start the corner that we make a 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.930
 group of 3 varetas 1 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.930
 two 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.319
 3 ribs and now we will have to do 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.240
 the two separation chains we make a 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.319
 dot slipped into the corner of the other 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.319
 side of the other grammy 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.860
 we make 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.860
 the second chain 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.250
 and we have the second half of the corner 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.810
 a 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.760
 two 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.459
 and three varetas 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.040
 and he has already left us and has already left us 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.860
 the great and united and now we will continue 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.110
 normal weaving this great and we make a 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.319
 separation chain and here we make a 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.319
 group of 3 varetas 1 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.380
 two 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.860
 and three varetas 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.080
 another separation chain and another group 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.780
 of 3 ribs 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.790
 and so until the end of this great 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.769
 Y 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.380
 we have come to the other corner we do 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.989
 the two separation chains we unite with 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.419
 a point slipped with the third 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.360
 chain of the first crochet and we make 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.740
 another slipped point to join with the 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.349
 another corner 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.349
 and we have already united this great and 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.330
 in this way we have some holes left 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:44.830
 in the middle 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:49.129
 to continue joining bigger 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:54.430
 we make the first group of 3 doublets in 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:54.430
 one of the corners of the next granny 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.980
 a 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.390
 and three varetas 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.030
 we make 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.850
 and we repeat the same procedure as 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.570
 we have done with the others we make a 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.570
 half point 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.620
 and we continue making a group of 3 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.710
 varetas 1 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.190
 two 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.660
 and three varetas 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.030
 we make 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.270
 another half point 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.020
 and another group of three varetas 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.300
 and so we can go weaving the grain 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.160
 as we get hooked the 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.900
 with each other now what 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.690
 we would have to do is continue this 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.080
 great and normal until you get to this 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.080
 corner 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:03.830
 another way of joining them grant and choosing 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:05.980
 with a needle we put the right one with 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.720
 the right 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:12.770
 and we started sewing 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.770
 around the corner 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.039
 and we will go sewing 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:39.230
 with the wool 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:41.620
 taking a point from each of the 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.620
 big 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.770
 we have already sewn the great and this 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.650
 way we see that we do not have any left 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.590
 space in the middle we have the three forms 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:15.249
 one is sewing with the needle the other is 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.969
 uniting as we go doing 

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:21.479
 the great and and the other is to unite through 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:21.479
 half points
