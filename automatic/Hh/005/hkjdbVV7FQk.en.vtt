guys<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:32.480> know<00:02:32.599> that<00:02:32.870> they're<00:02:32.989> made<00:02:33.200> for<00:02:33.700> that

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
guys you know that they're made for that

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.970 
guys you know that they're made for that
they're<00:02:34.880> called<00:02:35.120> breathe<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:36.349> air<00:02:36.500> max<00:02:36.739> one

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
they're called breathe the air max one

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.000 
they're called breathe the air max one
city<00:02:37.280> quick<00:02:37.519> strike<00:02:37.819> but<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.860> they<00:02:39.860> came

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
city quick strike but the the they came

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.400 
city quick strike but the the they came
out<00:02:40.130> with<00:02:40.310> several<00:02:40.870> colorways<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.140> then<00:02:42.230> they

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
out with several colorways and then they

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.160 
out with several colorways and then they
have<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.799> breeze<00:02:43.069> breeze<00:02:43.670> flow<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.390> whatnot

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
have the breeze breeze flow and whatnot

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.940 
have the breeze breeze flow and whatnot
so<00:02:46.540> with<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.900> know<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.410> air<00:02:48.739> will<00:02:48.920> flow

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
so with that you know the air will flow

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.170 
so with that you know the air will flow
through<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.670> then<00:02:49.760> your<00:02:49.880> feet<00:02:50.030> will<00:02:50.150> feel

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
you can rock them with I mean you can

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.750 
you can rock them with I mean you can
rock<00:02:54.410> them<00:02:54.530> when<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:54.709> anything<00:02:54.950> but<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.640> can

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
wear them with no socks and then they

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.050 
wear them with no socks and then they
should<00:02:57.620> be<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.739> font<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.190> should<00:02:58.400> be<00:02:58.459> fine<00:02:58.760> and

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
should be a font you should be fine and

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.319 
should be a font you should be fine and
then<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.810> inside<00:03:00.290> right<00:03:01.250> here<00:03:01.489> it's<00:03:02.030> like<00:03:02.180> a

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
then the inside right here it's like a

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.410 
then the inside right here it's like a
leather<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.989> would<00:03:03.170> say<00:03:03.880> we're<00:03:04.880> sort<00:03:05.150> of<00:03:05.269> like

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
leather I would say we're sort of like

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.809 
leather I would say we're sort of like
leather<00:03:05.690> lining<00:03:06.079> all<00:03:06.680> on<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.220> inside<00:03:07.340> I'm

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
leather lining all on the inside I'm

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.190
