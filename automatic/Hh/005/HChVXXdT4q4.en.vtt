00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:05.109 
hey guys and welcome back to my world so

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.870 
hey guys and welcome back to my world so
today<00:00:05.350> I'm<00:00:05.500> looking<00:00:05.620> at<00:00:05.920> how<00:00:06.130> to<00:00:06.190> detect<00:00:06.610> if

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
today I'm looking at how to detect if

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.090 
today I'm looking at how to detect if
you're<00:00:07.089> in<00:00:07.390> a<00:00:07.540> cave<00:00:07.810> whether<00:00:08.559> you're<00:00:08.830> in<00:00:09.010> a

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 
you're in a cave whether you're in a

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.859 
you're in a cave whether you're in a
house<00:00:09.280> with<00:00:09.610> you<00:00:09.730> standing<00:00:10.030> under<00:00:10.299> a<00:00:10.330> tree<00:00:10.360> and

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:10.869 
house with you standing under a tree and

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.020 
house with you standing under a tree and
so<00:00:11.139> forth<00:00:11.440> so<00:00:11.650> the<00:00:12.190> moment<00:00:12.400> I<00:00:12.520> come<00:00:12.699> out<00:00:12.850> from

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
so forth so the moment I come out from

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.000 
so forth so the moment I come out from
under<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:13.510> stream<00:00:13.840> you'll<00:00:14.139> see<00:00:14.350> that<00:00:14.500> I<00:00:14.650> am<00:00:14.830> no

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
under the stream you'll see that I am no

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.650 
under the stream you'll see that I am no
longer<00:00:15.039> covered<00:00:15.699> and<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:16.299> moment<00:00:16.510> I<00:00:16.539> go

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
longer covered and the moment I go

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.540 
longer covered and the moment I go
underneath<00:00:16.900> the<00:00:17.140> tree<00:00:17.350> I<00:00:17.529> am<00:00:18.009> covered<00:00:18.339> it's

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
underneath the tree I am covered it's

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.240 
underneath the tree I am covered it's
same<00:00:18.759> works<00:00:19.000> exactly<00:00:19.359> for<00:00:19.900> the<00:00:20.289> cave<00:00:20.529> again

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
same works exactly for the cave again

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.529 
same works exactly for the cave again
I've<00:00:21.339> got<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:21.609> titles<00:00:21.970> here<00:00:22.089> just<00:00:22.330> so<00:00:22.419> that

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
I've got the titles here just so that

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:23.550 
I've got the titles here just so that
you<00:00:22.630> can<00:00:22.750> actually<00:00:22.929> have<00:00:23.140> a<00:00:23.169> visual

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
you can actually have a visual

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.140 
you can actually have a visual
representation<00:00:24.550> of<00:00:24.669> what's<00:00:24.939> actually

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
representation of what's actually

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.900 
representation of what's actually
happening<00:00:25.390> so<00:00:26.169> as<00:00:26.470> you<00:00:26.949> can<00:00:27.039> see<00:00:27.160> when<00:00:27.609> I'm<00:00:27.730> not

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
happening so as you can see when I'm not

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.419 
happening so as you can see when I'm not
covered<00:00:28.240> I<00:00:28.359> can<00:00:28.630> walk<00:00:28.839> around<00:00:29.079> outside

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
covered I can walk around outside

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.970 
covered I can walk around outside
because<00:00:30.429> it's<00:00:30.669> a<00:00:30.849> nighttime<00:00:31.269> so<00:00:31.810> and<00:00:32.110> one<00:00:32.860> of

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
because it's a nighttime so and one of

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.600 
because it's a nighttime so and one of
the<00:00:33.070> possible<00:00:33.579> uses<00:00:33.820> for<00:00:34.180> this<00:00:34.300> is<00:00:34.539> if<00:00:34.809> I<00:00:34.960> go

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the possible uses for this is if I go

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.770 
the possible uses for this is if I go
game<00:00:37.620> zero<00:00:38.620> so<00:00:38.739> I've<00:00:38.829> put<00:00:38.949> myself<00:00:39.100> into

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
game zero so I've put myself into

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.430 
game zero so I've put myself into
survival<00:00:40.859> and<00:00:41.859> I<00:00:42.309> then<00:00:42.550> change<00:00:43.210> it<00:00:43.359> to<00:00:43.440> time

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
survival and I then change it to time

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.990 
survival and I then change it to time
six<00:00:45.190> a<00:00:45.399> day<00:00:46.469> okay<00:00:47.469> you'll<00:00:47.920> see<00:00:48.010> that<00:00:48.280> unless

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
six a day okay you'll see that unless

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.930 
six a day okay you'll see that unless
I'm<00:00:49.239> undercover<00:00:49.690> I<00:00:50.140> will<00:00:50.590> actually<00:00:50.859> burn<00:00:51.399> so

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
I'm undercover I will actually burn so

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.349 
I'm undercover I will actually burn so
there<00:00:52.840> we<00:00:52.929> go<00:00:52.960> I've<00:00:53.230> covered<00:00:53.530> and<00:00:54.059> I've<00:00:55.059> now

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
there we go I've covered and I've now

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.680 
there we go I've covered and I've now
still<00:00:56.230> burn<00:00:56.440> while<00:00:56.679> them<00:00:57.239> while<00:00:58.239> I'm<00:00:58.420> still<00:00:58.570> on

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
still burn while them while I'm still on

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.079 
still burn while them while I'm still on
fire<00:00:58.899> so<00:00:59.379> as<00:00:59.649> long<00:00:59.890> as<00:00:59.949> I'm<00:01:00.160> covered<00:01:00.609> whoops<00:01:00.820> I

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
fire so as long as I'm covered whoops I

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.610 
fire so as long as I'm covered whoops I
will<00:01:01.570> not<00:01:01.839> burn<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.370> I<00:01:03.519> died<00:01:04.080> okay<00:01:05.080> cool<00:01:05.590> so

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
will not burn and I died okay cool so

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.360 
will not burn and I died okay cool so
this<00:01:06.340> kind<00:01:06.550> of<00:01:06.610> really<00:01:06.820> opens<00:01:07.270> up<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.660> lot<00:01:08.260> of

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
this kind of really opens up a lot of

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.450 
this kind of really opens up a lot of
different<00:01:09.370> game<00:01:10.030> VIP<00:01:10.870> game<00:01:11.620> modes<00:01:12.010> or<00:01:12.280> game

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
different game VIP game modes or game

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.540 
different game VIP game modes or game
variations<00:01:12.760> and<00:01:13.240> then<00:01:13.990> I'm<00:01:14.920> actually<00:01:15.190> we<00:01:15.400> are

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
variations and then I'm actually we are

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.920 
variations and then I'm actually we are
actually<00:01:15.700> working<00:01:15.910> on<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.540> I'm<00:01:16.630> not<00:01:16.720> going<00:01:16.870> to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
actually working on and I'm not going to

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.950 
actually working on and I'm not going to
say<00:01:17.020> who<00:01:17.170> we<00:01:17.380> are<00:01:17.560> are<00:01:18.490> working<00:01:18.820> on<00:01:18.940> a<00:01:19.090> like<00:01:19.930> a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
say who we are are working on a like a

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.880 
say who we are are working on a like a
vampire<00:01:20.230> type<00:01:20.980> map<00:01:21.280> so<00:01:22.260> what<00:01:23.260> I'm<00:01:23.380> just<00:01:23.680> going

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
vampire type map so what I'm just going

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.430 
vampire type map so what I'm just going
to<00:01:24.010> show<00:01:24.160> you<00:01:24.190> is<00:01:24.430> actually<00:01:24.910> how<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.440> testing

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
to show you is actually how the testing

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.950 
to show you is actually how the testing
for<00:01:26.680> it<00:01:26.800> works<00:01:27.040> now<00:01:27.310> over<00:01:28.120> here<00:01:28.330> I<00:01:28.540> have<00:01:28.780> a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
for it works now over here I have a

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.800 
for it works now over here I have a
block<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.530> air<00:01:29.920> now<00:01:30.400> I<00:01:30.430> place<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:31.090> block<00:01:31.630> of

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
block of air now I place this block of

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.480 
block of air now I place this block of
air<00:01:32.020> by<00:01:32.260> hand<00:01:32.650> okay<00:01:32.860> now<00:01:32.980> I'm<00:01:33.040> joking<00:01:33.400> it's

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
air by hand okay now I'm joking it's

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.400 
air by hand okay now I'm joking it's
just<00:01:33.730> a<00:01:33.850> straightforward<00:01:34.240> block<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.140> it<00:01:35.260> it's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
just a straightforward block of it it's

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.470 
just a straightforward block of it it's
got<00:01:35.500> nothing<00:01:35.830> in<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:36.040> so<00:01:36.580> what<00:01:37.030> I'm<00:01:37.150> doing<00:01:37.390> is

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
got nothing in it so what I'm doing is

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.260 
got nothing in it so what I'm doing is
I'm<00:01:37.600> doing<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.870> test<00:01:38.230> for<00:01:38.500> blocks<00:01:39.060> okay<00:01:40.060> from

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
I'm doing a test for blocks okay from

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.880 
I'm doing a test for blocks okay from
the<00:01:40.480> Y<00:01:40.750> for<00:01:41.590> Corps<00:01:41.920> for<00:01:42.810> hot<00:01:43.810> wife<00:01:44.020> or<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.680> Y

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
the Y for Corps for hot wife or to the Y

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.270 
the Y for Corps for hot wife or to the Y
100<00:01:45.550> so<00:01:45.670> this<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:45.880> roughly<00:01:46.510> about<00:01:47.100> 96<00:01:48.100> air

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
100 so this is roughly about 96 air

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.180 
100 so this is roughly about 96 air
blocks<00:01:48.820> that<00:01:49.120> I'm<00:01:49.390> comparing<00:01:50.230> to<00:01:50.830> where<00:01:51.070> I'm

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
blocks that I'm comparing to where I'm

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.470 
blocks that I'm comparing to where I'm
currently<00:01:51.370> standing<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:51.970> let<00:01:52.090> me<00:01:52.180> just<00:01:52.300> really

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
currently standing so let me just really

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.100 
currently standing so let me just really
get<00:01:52.690> up<00:01:52.780> get<00:01:53.320> over<00:01:53.380> here<00:01:53.710> so<00:01:54.120> first<00:01:55.120> off<00:01:55.270> you'll

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
get up get over here so first off you'll

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.720 
get up get over here so first off you'll

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.330 
see that I've got over here I've got a
custom<00:01:58.270> head<00:01:58.480> so<00:01:59.110> if<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.860> head<00:02:00.040> is<00:02:00.070> actually

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
custom head so if the head is actually

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.130 
custom head so if the head is actually
called<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.760> vampire<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:01.450> when<00:02:01.690> I<00:02:01.720> put<00:02:02.020> the

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
head on and I will then act I will then

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.430 
head on and I will then act I will then
get<00:02:05.790> one<00:02:06.790> added<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.300> my<00:02:07.420> vampire<00:02:07.840> score<00:02:08.229> so

what I'm doing is I'm actually going to

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.010 
what I'm doing is I'm actually going to
run<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.810> come<00:02:37.959> on<00:02:38.080> one<00:02:38.440> block<00:02:38.830> above<00:02:39.400> me<00:02:39.730> so

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
run this come on one block above me so

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.840 
run this come on one block above me so
the<00:02:41.020> block<00:02:41.230> I'm<00:02:41.410> standing<00:02:41.830> on<00:02:41.950> when<00:02:42.250> my<00:02:42.520> feet

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
the block I'm standing on when my feet

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.670 
the block I'm standing on when my feet
my<00:02:43.420> feet<00:02:43.690> is<00:02:43.840> blocked<00:02:44.170> zero

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
my feet is blocked zero

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.760 
my feet is blocked zero
my<00:02:45.670> head<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:46.060> block<00:02:46.330> one<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:47.440> I'm<00:02:47.500> going<00:02:47.709> to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
my head is block one so I'm going to

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.160 
my head is block one so I'm going to
test<00:02:48.040> from<00:02:48.400> block<00:02:48.640> one<00:02:48.910> I'm<00:02:49.150> going<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.870> test

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
test from block one I'm going to test

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.210 
test from block one I'm going to test
that<00:02:50.350> area<00:02:51.310> from<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.940> from<00:02:52.870> block<00:02:53.410> or<00:02:53.620> height

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
that area from and from block or height

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.790 
that area from and from block or height
number<00:02:54.610> four<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:55.060> height<00:02:55.270> number<00:02:55.600> 100<00:02:56.410> I'm

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
number four to height number 100 I'm

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.270 
number four to height number 100 I'm
going<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:57.370> test<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:58.810> see<00:02:58.840> if<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.650> relative

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
going to test to see if it is relative

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.610 
going to test to see if it is relative
to<00:03:00.310> where<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.270> am<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:02.110> hundred<00:03:02.380> blocks

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
to where I am so the hundred blocks

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.300 
to where I am so the hundred blocks
above<00:03:02.980> me<00:03:03.220> if<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.970> is<00:03:04.180> equal<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:05.260> if<00:03:05.709> the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
above me if that is equal to that if the

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.090 
above me if that is equal to that if the
hundred<00:03:06.610> blocks<00:03:06.850> above<00:03:07.150> me<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:07.510> equal<00:03:08.320> to<00:03:08.620> the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
hundred blocks above me is equal to the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.250 
hundred blocks above me is equal to the
hundred<00:03:09.340> blocks<00:03:09.550> of<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.600> means<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:10.989> I'm

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
hundred blocks of that it means that I'm

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.420 
hundred blocks of that it means that I'm
most<00:03:11.650> probably<00:03:12.190> outside<00:03:13.000> okay<00:03:13.989> so<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:15.160> if

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
most probably outside okay so and if

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.630 
most probably outside okay so and if
it's<00:03:15.640> not<00:03:15.940> so<00:03:16.360> for<00:03:16.510> example<00:03:16.840> if<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.280> let<00:03:18.280> me<00:03:18.400> just

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
it's not so for example if I let me just

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.050 
it's not so for example if I let me just
quickly<00:03:18.880> go<00:03:19.720> where<00:03:20.680> can<00:03:21.010> we<00:03:21.100> go<00:03:21.220> test<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.610> so<00:03:21.910> if

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
quickly go where can we go test it so if

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.190 
quickly go where can we go test it so if
I'm<00:03:22.410> covered<00:03:23.410> over<00:03:23.650> here<00:03:24.269> okay<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.900> block

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
I'm covered over here okay that block

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.380 
I'm covered over here okay that block
above<00:03:26.890> me<00:03:27.070> is<00:03:27.220> no<00:03:27.430> longer<00:03:27.670> equal<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.269> those

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
above me is no longer equal to those

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.539 
above me is no longer equal to those
block<00:03:28.660> of<00:03:28.870> blocks<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.620> that<00:03:30.010> little<00:03:30.280> spot

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
block of blocks and that little spot

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.120 
block of blocks and that little spot
over<00:03:30.820> there<00:03:30.850> because<00:03:31.209> there<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:32.049> stone<00:03:32.350> above

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
over there because there is stone above

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.259 
over there because there is stone above
me<00:03:33.280> okay<00:03:34.209> so<00:03:34.570> it's<00:03:34.750> really<00:03:35.040> very<00:03:36.040> very

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
me okay so it's really very very

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.030 
me okay so it's really very very
straightforward<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.299> simple<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:38.530> test<00:03:38.890> for

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
straightforward and simple so test for

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.300 
straightforward and simple so test for
blocking<00:03:39.600> that<00:03:40.600> area<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.170> where<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.350> am<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.860> then

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
blocking that area to where I am I then

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.330 
blocking that area to where I am I then
output<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.730> signal<00:03:43.000> so<00:03:43.680> I've<00:03:44.680> got<00:03:45.010> kind<00:03:45.310> of

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
output a signal so I've got kind of

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.069 
output a signal so I've got kind of
inverted<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.090> signal<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:46.540> I<00:03:46.570> will<00:03:46.840> always

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
inverted the signal so I will always

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.300 
inverted the signal so I will always
have<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.220> signal<00:03:48.549> on<00:03:48.670> if<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.299> is<00:03:50.310> protecting

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
have the signal on if it is protecting

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.900 
have the signal on if it is protecting
positive

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
positive

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.300 
positive
okay<00:03:52.570> then<00:03:52.780> I'm<00:03:52.870> inverted<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.530> signal<00:03:53.890> so

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
okay then I'm inverted the signal so

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.670 
okay then I'm inverted the signal so
that<00:03:54.459> when<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:54.910> am<00:03:55.690> no<00:03:55.930> longer<00:03:55.959> let<00:03:56.440> me<00:03:56.500> just

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
that when I am no longer let me just

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.319 
that when I am no longer let me just
quickly<00:03:56.829> get<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.910> when<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.120> am<00:03:58.360> no<00:03:58.540> longer<00:04:00.329> equal

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
quickly get so when I am no longer equal

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.750 
quickly get so when I am no longer equal
so<00:04:01.840> if<00:04:01.959> if<00:04:02.110> I'm<00:04:02.290> under<00:04:02.560> something<00:04:02.890> it<00:04:03.280> turns<00:04:03.549> it

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
so if if I'm under something it turns it

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.670 
so if if I'm under something it turns it
off<00:04:03.880> which<00:04:04.120> turns<00:04:04.420> that<00:04:04.510> torch<00:04:04.900> on<00:04:05.170> okay<00:04:05.620> so

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
off which turns that torch on okay so

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.500 
off which turns that torch on okay so
this<00:04:05.860> way<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.070> can<00:04:06.370> actually<00:04:06.489> control<00:04:06.670> when

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
this way I can actually control when

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.130 
this way I can actually control when
it's<00:04:07.630> on<00:04:07.750> or<00:04:08.049> off<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:09.310> when<00:04:09.489> this<00:04:09.820> this<00:04:10.360> block

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
it's on or off so when this this block

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.380 
it's on or off so when this this block
over<00:04:11.350> here<00:04:11.440> activates<00:04:12.040> this<00:04:12.610> thing<00:04:12.910> just<00:04:13.120> says

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
over here activates this thing just says

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.140 
over here activates this thing just says
that<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.799> are<00:04:14.950> not<00:04:15.130> covered<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.610> then

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
that and you are not covered and then

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.940 
that and you are not covered and then
when<00:04:16.299> this<00:04:16.419> torch<00:04:16.690> goes<00:04:16.930> on<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.350> says<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.709> am

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
when this torch goes on it says I am

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.699 
when this torch goes on it says I am
covered<00:04:18.370> okay<00:04:19.209> so<00:04:19.630> what<00:04:19.840> I've<00:04:19.930> just<00:04:19.959> got<00:04:20.380> over

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
covered okay so what I've just got over

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.990 
covered okay so what I've just got over
here<00:04:20.919> is<00:04:20.979> well<00:04:21.160> actually<00:04:21.400> got<00:04:21.609> a<00:04:21.640> scoreboard

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
here is well actually got a scoreboard

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.779 
here is well actually got a scoreboard
which<00:04:22.330> just<00:04:22.539> sets<00:04:22.690> my<00:04:22.960> outside<00:04:23.530> score<00:04:24.039> to<00:04:24.520> 1

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
which just sets my outside score to 1

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.089 
which just sets my outside score to 1
and<00:04:25.000> 0<00:04:25.090> just<00:04:25.419> so<00:04:25.720> that<00:04:25.870> I<00:04:25.990> always<00:04:26.560> know<00:04:26.890> where

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
and 0 just so that I always know where

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:27.360 
and 0 just so that I always know where
I'm

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
I'm

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.939 
I'm
side<00:04:27.580> or<00:04:27.729> not<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.510> I<00:04:29.020> can<00:04:29.229> then<00:04:29.350> run<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.680> whole

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
side or not and I can then run a whole

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.700 
side or not and I can then run a whole
bunch<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.310> other<00:04:30.550> commands<00:04:30.940> based<00:04:31.810> on<00:04:32.080> that

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
bunch of other commands based on that

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.250 
bunch of other commands based on that
but<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.550> is<00:04:33.699> really<00:04:34.030> how<00:04:34.479> whichever<00:04:34.990> way<00:04:35.199> you

but that is really how whichever way you
want<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.740> use<00:04:35.949> whatever<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:36.550> want<00:04:36.790> use<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.090> for
