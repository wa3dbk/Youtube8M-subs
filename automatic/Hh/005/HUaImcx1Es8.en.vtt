treatment<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.460> hydrogen

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
treatment you can do is a hydrogen

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.819 
treatment you can do is a hydrogen
peroxide<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.290> would<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
peroxide and what you would do with that

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.560 
peroxide and what you would do with that
is<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> dip<00:00:44.370> your<00:00:44.579> toothbrush<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.210> hydrogen

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
peroxide and brush regularly I've never

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.880 
peroxide and brush regularly I've never
tried<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.629> because<00:00:49.110> i'm<00:00:49.260> pretty<00:00:49.530> sure<00:00:49.739> that

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
tried that because i'm pretty sure that

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.680 
tried that because i'm pretty sure that
would<00:00:50.010> kill<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.489> mouth<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:51.210> my<00:00:51.360> mouth<00:00:51.510> is

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
would kill my mouth because my mouth is

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.840 
would kill my mouth because my mouth is
really<00:00:51.930> sensitive<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.579> really

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
really sensitive and if you have really

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.209 
really sensitive and if you have really
sensitive<00:00:54.059> teeth<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.170> would<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.620> suggest<00:00:55.860> that

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
sensitive teeth I would not suggest that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.819 
sensitive teeth I would not suggest that
at<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.780> also<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.379> you're<00:00:58.530> going<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> do

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
at all and also if you're going to do

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.459 
at all and also if you're going to do
that<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.250> don't<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.420> regularly<00:01:00.989> because

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that one don't do it regularly because

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.009 
that one don't do it regularly because
it<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.309> damage<00:01:02.609> your<00:01:02.820> enamel<00:01:03.120> pretty<00:01:03.750> quickly

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it can damage your enamel pretty quickly

sensitive<00:01:42.750> teeth<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.680> was<00:01:44.159> expected<00:01:45.259> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
sensitive teeth so that was expected and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.139 
sensitive teeth so that was expected and
you<00:01:46.320> could<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.799> use<00:01:46.920> sensodyne<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:47.729> another

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
you could just use sensodyne or another

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.310 
you could just use sensodyne or another
sensitivity<00:01:49.049> toothpaste<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.950> help<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:50.820> that

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
sensitivity toothpaste to help with that

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.710 
sensitivity toothpaste to help with that
another<00:01:52.320> one<00:01:52.530> I've<00:01:52.829> also<00:01:53.159> used

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
another one I've also used

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
another one I've also used
just<00:01:55.080> like<00:01:55.590> walgreens<00:01:56.190> brand<00:01:56.580> stuff<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.740> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
just like walgreens brand stuff and the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.290 
just like walgreens brand stuff and the
only<00:01:58.890> difference<00:01:59.250> between<00:01:59.370> that<00:01:59.760> and<00:01:59.820> more

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
only difference between that and more

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.130 
only difference between that and more
higher-end<00:02:01.430> teeth<00:02:02.430> whitening<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.060> how<00:02:03.930> long

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
higher-end teeth whitening is how long

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.550 
higher-end teeth whitening is how long
they<00:02:04.470> take<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:06.060> house<00:02:06.750> sensitive<00:02:07.350> my

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
they take and the house sensitive my

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.650 
they take and the house sensitive my
teeth<00:02:07.740> are<00:02:07.860> going<00:02:07.980> to<00:02:08.070> feel<00:02:08.190> afterwards<00:02:08.759> so

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
teeth are going to feel afterwards so

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.030 
teeth are going to feel afterwards so
pretty<00:02:09.990> much<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> cheaper<00:02:10.860> ones

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
pretty much like the cheaper ones

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.740 
pretty much like the cheaper ones
they're<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.670> work<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:11.820> as<00:02:12.240> well<00:02:12.270> as

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
they're going to work just as well as

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.840 
they're going to work just as well as
the<00:02:13.110> more<00:02:13.260> expensive<00:02:13.500> ones<00:02:13.890> they're<00:02:14.610> just

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
the more expensive ones they're just

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.430 
the more expensive ones they're just
going<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.120> take<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.330> lot<00:02:15.660> longer<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.110> they

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
going to take a lot longer and they

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.900 
going to take a lot longer and they
could<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:16.800> really<00:02:17.070> like<00:02:17.250> kill<00:02:17.520> your<00:02:17.700> teeth

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
could have really like kill your teeth

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.150 
could have really like kill your teeth
so<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.600> don't<00:02:18.930> really<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.830> use<00:02:19.890> those

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
so I don't really like to use those

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.370 
so I don't really like to use those
because<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.730> like<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> segreta<00:02:21.600> fication<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.320> I

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
because I like a segreta fication and I

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.270 
because I like a segreta fication and I
don't<00:02:22.560> really<00:02:22.740> like<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.160> hurt<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:24.570> another<00:02:24.960> one

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
don't really like to hurt so another one

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.160 
don't really like to hurt so another one
that's<00:02:26.280> kind<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.640> just<00:02:26.880> like<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.360> Rembrandt

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170

do it for like really short amount of

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.850 
do it for like really short amount of
time<00:03:07.370> but<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.610> does<00:03:08.790> absolutely<00:03:09.000> nothing<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:10.500> I

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
time but it does absolutely nothing so I

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
like to do it for like a half hour this

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.400 
like to do it for like a half hour this
does<00:03:14.070> also<00:03:14.670> cause<00:03:14.970> some<00:03:15.360> sensitivity<00:03:16.080> not<00:03:16.110> as

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
does also cause some sensitivity not as

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.550 
does also cause some sensitivity not as
much<00:03:16.620> as<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.160> Rembrandt<00:03:17.580> conda's<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.290> also

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
much as the Rembrandt conda's but I also

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.710 
much as the Rembrandt conda's but I also
don't<00:03:19.920> think<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.880> works<00:03:21.090> as<00:03:21.330> well<00:03:21.360> as<00:03:21.510> the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
don't think this works as well as the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.970 
don't think this works as well as the
Rembrandt<00:03:22.080> client<00:03:22.350> but<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.530> does<00:03:22.650> definitely

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
Rembrandt client but it does definitely

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.789

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
starting out because I don't think it's

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.170 
starting out because I don't think it's
going<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.750> work<00:04:03.930> well<00:04:04.560> enough<00:04:04.680> it's<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.520> highly

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
going to work well enough it's a highly

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.699 
going to work well enough it's a highly
concentrated<00:04:06.420> enough<00:04:07.080> for<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.530> like

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
concentrated enough for it to like

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.160 
concentrated enough for it to like
really<00:04:07.950> whiten<00:04:08.430> your<00:04:08.459> teeth<00:04:08.780> but<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.840> would

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
really whiten your teeth but I would

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.949 
really whiten your teeth but I would
suggest<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.940> if<00:04:11.940> your<00:04:12.360> teeth<00:04:12.510> are<00:04:12.599> already

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
suggest is if your teeth are already

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.110 
suggest is if your teeth are already
white<00:04:13.140> and<00:04:13.380> this<00:04:13.470> is<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.739> touch-up<00:04:14.130> I<00:04:14.340> uses

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
like once every two weeks and it works
