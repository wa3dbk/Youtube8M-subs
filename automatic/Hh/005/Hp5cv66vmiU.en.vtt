actually<00:01:31.110> make<00:01:31.590> sure<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> person<00:01:32.130> has<00:01:32.430> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
actually make sure the person has a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.670 
actually make sure the person has a
floor<00:01:32.909> I'm<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> make<00:01:33.810> some<00:01:33.990> sort

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
floor I'm just going to make some sort

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.640 
floor I'm just going to make some sort
of<00:01:34.799> cheap<00:01:35.420> outlining<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.840> then<00:01:40.020> once<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.500> do

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
of cheap outlining so then once you do

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.590 
of cheap outlining so then once you do
that<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.520> could<00:01:41.700> place<00:01:41.939> another<00:01:41.970> redstone

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
that you could place another redstone

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.990 
that you could place another redstone
torch<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.649> burns<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.759> whatever

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
torch here and it burns out but whatever

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.139 
torch here and it burns out but whatever
that<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.540> its<00:01:46.229> destroyed<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.729> comes<00:01:47.970> on

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
that is its destroyed that one comes on

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.289 
that is its destroyed that one comes on
so<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.840> put<00:01:49.110> more<00:01:49.320> redstone<00:01:49.590> um

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
so then you can put more redstone um

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.710 
so then you can put more redstone um
that<00:01:51.299> leads<00:01:51.600> down<00:01:51.899> here<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:52.979> down<00:01:53.159> there

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
that leads down here and then down there

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
that leads down here and then down there
so<00:01:54.720> make<00:01:55.110> sure<00:01:55.140> you're<00:01:55.500> under<00:01:55.860> their<00:01:56.009> floor<00:01:56.430> so

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
so make sure you're under their floor so

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.690 
so make sure you're under their floor so
