class it's good more like armor metallic
look<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.950> could<00:01:47.700> leave<00:01:48.030> wearing<00:01:48.329> that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
look to it you could leave wearing that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.270 
look to it you could leave wearing that
over<00:01:48.600> top<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.259> has<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> protection<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
over top of it so it has a protection to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.090 
over top of it so it has a protection to
it<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:53.790> boots<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.270> gloves<00:01:54.509> are<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> nice

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
it the boots and the gloves are a nice

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.109 
it the boots and the gloves are a nice
washed<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.340> red<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.840> they<00:01:57.930> look<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.170> leather

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
washed out red so they look like leather

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.100 
washed out red so they look like leather
gun<00:02:00.119> glass<00:02:00.329> not<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.600> same<00:02:00.750> red<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
gun glass not the same red as the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.969 
gun glass not the same red as the
stripes<00:02:01.619> here<00:02:01.969> so<00:02:02.969> again<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.810> looks<00:02:03.979> realistic

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
stripes here so again it looks realistic

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.160 
stripes here so again it looks realistic
