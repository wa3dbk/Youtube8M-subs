hey guys Chris here with the surfboard

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.120 
hey guys Chris here with the surfboard
warehouse<00:00:09.290> today<00:00:10.290> we're<00:00:10.679> going<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.889> talk

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
warehouse today we're going to talk

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.900 
warehouse today we're going to talk
about<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.730> FCS<00:00:12.360> 2<00:00:13.070> accelerator<00:00:14.070> fins<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
about the FCS 2 accelerator fins and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.670 
about the FCS 2 accelerator fins and
those<00:00:15.089> are<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> fins<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.719> have<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.049> my<00:00:16.170> hand<00:00:16.440> and

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
those are the fins I have in my hand and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.019 
those are the fins I have in my hand and
what<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.949> see<00:00:17.160> out<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.400> front<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.640> me<00:00:17.789> here

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
what you see out in front of me here

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.179 
what you see out in front of me here
again<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.840> couple<00:00:19.199> different<00:00:19.500> materials<00:00:19.980> there

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
again a couple different materials there

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.460 
again a couple different materials there
that<00:00:20.400> we'll<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.670> into<00:00:20.970> here<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.359> second<00:00:21.869> but

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
that we'll get into here in a second but

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.830 
that we'll get into here in a second but
of<00:00:22.560> course<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.010> accelerator<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.820> an<00:00:23.970> FCS<00:00:24.480> two

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
of course the accelerator is an FCS two

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.560 
of course the accelerator is an FCS two
fin<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.800> that's<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.039> brand<00:00:26.369> new<00:00:26.580> screwless<00:00:27.269> fin

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
fin so that's a brand new screwless fin

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.689 
fin so that's a brand new screwless fin
system<00:00:27.990> from<00:00:28.260> FCS<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.250> now<00:00:29.429> available

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
system from FCS that is now available

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.690 
system from FCS that is now available
you<00:00:30.630> would<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.289> FCS<00:00:31.859> two<00:00:32.070> plugs<00:00:32.430> in

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
you would have to have FCS two plugs in

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.330 
you would have to have FCS two plugs in
your<00:00:32.850> board<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.930> did<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.559> system<00:00:35.100> is

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
your board but if you did this system is

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.670 
your board but if you did this system is
screwless<00:00:35.969> these<00:00:36.480> fins<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.870> snap<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
screwless these fins just snap in and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.850 
screwless these fins just snap in and
snap<00:00:37.950> out<00:00:38.190> awesome<00:00:38.820> innovation<00:00:39.629> by<00:00:39.809> FCS<00:00:40.350> we

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.599 
test these in our fanatic fin testing
program<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.320> can<00:00:58.469> see<00:00:58.739> how<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> carbon<00:00:59.250> feels

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
program you can see how the carbon feels

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.950 
program you can see how the carbon feels
you<00:00:59.850> can<00:00:59.879> see<00:01:00.149> how<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> performance<00:01:00.480> core

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you can see how the performance core

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.389 
you can see how the performance core
feels<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.469> even<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.890> how<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.100> glass

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
feels you can even see how the glass

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.490 
feels you can even see how the glass
flex<00:01:02.730> feels<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.239> want<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> different

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
flex feels if you want to different

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859 
flex feels if you want to different
people<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:05.040> different<00:01:05.090> fields<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.210> fins<00:01:06.630> you

four<00:01:46.619> fins<00:01:47.040> released<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.030> FCS<00:01:48.450> 2<00:01:48.869> series

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
four fins released in the FCS 2 series

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.139 
four fins released in the FCS 2 series
they're<00:01:49.530> called<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> essentials<00:01:50.549> range<00:01:50.880> and

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
they're called the essentials range and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.630 
they're called the essentials range and
they<00:01:51.540> all<00:01:51.750> have<00:01:52.020> carbon<00:01:52.530> placement<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.460> is

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
they all have carbon placement that is

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.639 
they all have carbon placement that is
very<00:01:53.850> different<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.479> very<00:01:54.689> strategic<00:01:55.350> based

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
very different and very strategic based

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.550 
very different and very strategic based
on<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> template<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.909> fin<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.719> FCS<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
on the template of the fin so FCS and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.499 
on the template of the fin so FCS and
this<00:01:58.710> group<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.100> team<00:01:59.340> riders<00:01:59.700> figured<00:02:00.360> out

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
this group of team riders figured out

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.420 
this group of team riders figured out
that<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> carbon<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.350> best<00:02:01.590> placed<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.159> this

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that the carbon is best placed in this

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.580 
that the carbon is best placed in this
fin<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.270> manner<00:02:03.600> if<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.200> look<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.439> some

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
fin in this manner if you look at some

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.560 
fin in this manner if you look at some
of<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> upstair<00:02:05.070> FCS<00:02:05.549> two<00:02:05.759> fins<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.270> carbon

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
of the upstair FCS two fins the carbon

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.760 
of the upstair FCS two fins the carbon
is<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.899> different<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.439> that's

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
is going to be different and that's

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.859 
is going to be different and that's
because<00:02:08.099> those<00:02:08.399> templates<00:02:09.030> need<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.479> flex<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
because those templates need to flex a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.690 
because those templates need to flex a
little<00:02:09.899> bit<00:02:10.229> differently<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:11.129> optimized

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
little bit differently for optimized

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.059 
little bit differently for optimized
performance<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.470> accelerate

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
performance with the accelerate

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.130 
performance with the accelerate
you<00:02:14.549> kind<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:14.939> want<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> use<00:02:15.390> these<00:02:15.569> in<00:02:15.629> waves

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
you kind of want to use these in waves

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.069 
you kind of want to use these in waves
of<00:02:16.409> consequence<00:02:17.099> really<00:02:18.060> really<00:02:18.480> kind<00:02:18.989> of

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
of consequence really really kind of

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.530 
of consequence really really kind of
bigger<00:02:19.409> hollower<00:02:20.010> powerful<00:02:20.640> waves<00:02:20.819> I'd<00:02:21.180> say

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
bigger hollower powerful waves I'd say

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.229 
bigger hollower powerful waves I'd say
you<00:02:21.900> know<00:02:22.049> chest<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.950> above<00:02:23.250> anywhere<00:02:24.090> maybe

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
you know chest and above anywhere maybe

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.509 
you know chest and above anywhere maybe
even<00:02:24.689> two<00:02:24.930> double<00:02:25.620> overhead<00:02:26.069> is<00:02:26.250> where<00:02:26.400> you're

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
even two double overhead is where you're

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.520 
even two double overhead is where you're
gonna<00:02:26.579> want<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:26.939> use<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.299> accelerator<00:02:27.810> good

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
gonna want to use the accelerator good

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.740 
gonna want to use the accelerator good

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
all-around fin for powerful surf it's

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.660 
all-around fin for powerful surf it's
going<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.260> give<00:02:31.409> you<00:02:31.560> enough<00:02:31.890> reaction<00:02:32.459> time

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
going to give you enough reaction time

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.789 
going to give you enough reaction time
and<00:02:32.909> enough<00:02:33.450> hold<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:34.140> you're<00:02:34.470> going<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> use

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
and enough hold if you're going to use

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.199 
and enough hold if you're going to use
the<00:02:34.950> Carver<00:02:35.400> which<00:02:35.549> we'll<00:02:35.730> talk<00:02:35.849> about<00:02:35.909> in<00:02:36.090> a

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
the Carver which we'll talk about in a

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.210 
the Carver which we'll talk about in a
different<00:02:36.239> video<00:02:36.599> that's<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.409> lot<00:02:37.680> more<00:02:37.920> hold

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
different video that's a lot more hold

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.800 
different video that's a lot more hold
if<00:02:38.430> you're<00:02:38.879> going<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.060> use<00:02:39.239> some<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.689> other

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
if you're going to use some of the other

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.569 
if you're going to use some of the other
fins<00:02:40.260> that's<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.680> little<00:02:40.889> bit<00:02:41.040> less<00:02:41.310> hold

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
fins that's a little bit less hold

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.220 
fins that's a little bit less hold
because<00:02:41.730> their<00:02:41.939> template<00:02:42.389> is<00:02:42.569> more<00:02:42.810> up<00:02:43.019> and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
because their template is more up and

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.110 
because their template is more up and
down<00:02:43.319> so<00:02:44.099> these<00:02:44.250> ones<00:02:44.459> are<00:02:44.579> kind<00:02:44.849> of<00:02:44.909> in<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
down so these ones are kind of in the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.300 
down so these ones are kind of in the
middle<00:02:45.299> again<00:02:45.930> for<00:02:46.260> powerful<00:02:46.590> waves<00:02:46.980> where

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
middle again for powerful waves where

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.490 
middle again for powerful waves where
you<00:02:47.370> still<00:02:47.760> want<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.480> good<00:02:48.989> amount<00:02:49.290> of

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
you still want a good amount of

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.530 
you still want a good amount of
maneuverability<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.549> dime<00:02:50.939> not

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
maneuverability on a dime not

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.479 
maneuverability on a dime not
necessarily<00:02:51.959> long<00:02:52.349> drawn-out<00:02:52.709> turns<00:02:53.099> but<00:02:53.340> you

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
necessarily long drawn-out turns but you

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.460 
necessarily long drawn-out turns but you
just<00:02:53.669> want<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:53.879> be<00:02:54.000> able<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.239> maneuver<00:02:54.780> quickly

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
just want to be able to maneuver quickly

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.830 
just want to be able to maneuver quickly
on<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> powerful<00:02:56.310> wave<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:57.480> again<00:02:57.689> that

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
on a powerful wave so again that

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.869 
on a powerful wave so again that
template<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.470> kind<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.739> average<00:02:59.129> you<00:02:59.549> can<00:02:59.669> see

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
template is kind of average you can see

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.629

you<00:03:23.669> kind<00:03:23.909> of<00:03:23.940> have<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.180> look<00:03:24.329> at<00:03:24.449> that<00:03:24.599> on<00:03:24.810> a

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
you kind of have to look at that on a

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.659 
you kind of have to look at that on a
case-by-case<00:03:25.109> basis<00:03:25.949> and<00:03:26.129> figure<00:03:26.370> out<00:03:26.400> what

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
case-by-case basis and figure out what

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.210 
case-by-case basis and figure out what
kind<00:03:26.879> of<00:03:26.970> feel<00:03:27.209> you're<00:03:27.449> going<00:03:27.690> for<00:03:28.079> over<00:03:28.769> here

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
kind of feel you're going for over here

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.530 
kind of feel you're going for over here
you're<00:03:29.340> gonna<00:03:29.430> see<00:03:29.669> the<00:03:29.790> performance<00:03:30.239> core

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
you're gonna see the performance core

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.119 
you're gonna see the performance core
and<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.750> glass<00:03:31.019> flex<00:03:31.319> kind<00:03:31.769> of<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:31.919> same

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
and the glass flex kind of the same

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.569 
and the glass flex kind of the same
thing

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
thing

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.879 
thing
performance<00:03:33.180> core<00:03:33.389> is<00:03:33.479> stiffer<00:03:33.780> not<00:03:34.199> as<00:03:34.379> stiff

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
performance core is stiffer not as stiff

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.949 
performance core is stiffer not as stiff
as<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.310> performance<00:03:35.639> core<00:03:35.909> carbon<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.540> it

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
as the performance core carbon and it

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.809 
as the performance core carbon and it
really<00:03:37.139> doesn't<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.799> highest<00:03:38.489> end<00:03:38.699> of

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
really doesn't have the highest end of

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.699 
really doesn't have the highest end of
technology<00:03:39.389> which<00:03:39.599> is<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.930> Carbon<00:03:40.319> inlay

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
technology which is that Carbon inlay

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.589 
technology which is that Carbon inlay
and<00:03:40.979> then<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.579> glass<00:03:41.790> flex<00:03:42.180> kind<00:03:42.449> of<00:03:42.510> your

the<00:03:48.419> glass<00:03:48.690> licks<00:03:48.959> in<00:03:49.139> smaller<00:03:49.530> waves<00:03:49.889> that's

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
the glass licks in smaller waves that's

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.189 
the glass licks in smaller waves that's
because<00:03:50.819> that's<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.209> most<00:03:51.449> flexible<00:03:51.989> of

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
because that's the most flexible of

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.830 
because that's the most flexible of
these<00:03:52.470> three<00:03:52.799> materials<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:54.329> performance

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
these three materials the performance

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.050 
these three materials the performance
cork<00:03:55.049> carbon<00:03:55.470> comes<00:03:55.949> in<00:03:56.099> that<00:03:56.220> small<00:03:56.549> medium

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
cork carbon comes in that small medium

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.939 
cork carbon comes in that small medium
and<00:03:57.180> large<00:03:57.540> size<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.379> you<00:03:58.470> can<00:03:58.590> really<00:03:58.739> get

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
and large size so you can really get

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.920 
and large size so you can really get
dialed<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.549> for<00:03:59.760> your<00:03:59.939> height<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.239> weight<00:04:00.479> on

in the accelerator only come in a medium

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.420 
in the accelerator only come in a medium
so<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.599> little<00:04:06.840> bit<00:04:06.959> less<00:04:07.290> options<00:04:07.620> on<00:04:08.129> that

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
so a little bit less options on that

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.729 
so a little bit less options on that
side<00:04:08.699> again<00:04:09.389> with<00:04:09.810> all<00:04:09.959> these<00:04:10.079> options<00:04:10.530> and
