00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.519
 and so we will do a little video review of ours 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.299
 equipment that we collected fox motoblock 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.630
 the dawn 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.439
 ten horsepower and final 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.170
 the result is a high-grade minitractor with 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.170
 power shaft hydraulics 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.170
 hydraulic brakes 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.120
 we completely start all the glue 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:43.520
 why moving hydraulic brakes 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.520
 the drum hydraulics on the axis 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.520
 We look forward to us, we have done 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.989
 DAC and correct when turning out 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:03.430
 the wheels we lay down and turn out 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.590
 the wheels go off and the inner wheel 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.850
 more outer wheel turns 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.830
 turns less 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.630
 so it turns out the correct radius is 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:17.710
 turning the tractor does not push nison yes not 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.720
 carries calma from this side here we have 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:27.550
 there is a dispenser masks 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:31.450
 pump drive well and ours accordingly 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.259
 gearbox done arm 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.890
 carries but nothing bothers us 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:42.670
 unlocking our boxes when turning 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:46.119
 to the right as to how the portion of the car should be left 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.610
 turned left unlocked right 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:56.259
 is there a single separation right 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:59.140
 position you 16 tires place for 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.880
 balanced on concrete balanced 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.880
 which weights without the author 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.910
 but come on come on, Bring 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.340
