 liquefy remember that whenever you 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.540
 hot things start with the 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.219
 lower speed and then they will go 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.139
 rising gradually so that they do not 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.590
 the steam comes out and the 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.590
 blender 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.570

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.120
 seasoning I will prepare my missions I will 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.579
 use maguey leaf to make 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.609
 missions are getting it this way I'm 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.829

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.710
 approximately and that I'm going to take 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.250
 four since 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:32.050

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.820

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.130
 a leaf 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.060
 and now all this I'm going to put in another 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.580
 bag 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.120

 I do not answer our sauce myself 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.740
 I usually put two ladles of 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.070
 sharp so the warmth comes if 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.070

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.850
 if they take additional land if not 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.160
 they get special bags to make 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.530
 You can do so much in a bag 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.190
 regular of this type of plastic 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.190
 common 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.770
 so that she is well wrapped in her paper 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.880
 of aluminum and you will not get to burn 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.260
 your bag 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.180

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:53.159
 that there is no express we will leave it 40 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.770
 minutes after he starts whistling 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.719
 if it is in steam it was conventional one hour 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.210
