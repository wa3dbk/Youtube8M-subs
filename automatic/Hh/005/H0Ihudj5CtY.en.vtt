00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
then they'll be bouncing around in this

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.980 
then they'll be bouncing around in this
space<00:01:45.340> they're<00:01:45.610> quite<00:01:45.820> agile<00:01:46.479> for<00:01:46.659> their<00:01:46.810> size

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
space they're quite agile for their size

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.370 
space they're quite agile for their size
and<00:01:47.020> quite<00:01:47.439> quite<00:01:47.770> powerful<00:01:48.250> um<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.380> think

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
and quite quite powerful um I think

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.899 
and quite quite powerful um I think
their<00:01:50.470> coolest<00:01:50.770> ability<00:01:51.280> though<00:01:51.429> is<00:01:51.460> they<00:01:51.759> can

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
their coolest ability though is they can

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.219 
their coolest ability though is they can
pick<00:01:52.119> up<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:53.189> eyes<00:01:54.189> like<00:01:55.149> friends<00:01:55.600> or<00:01:55.689> foes<00:01:55.960> and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
pick up a eyes like friends or foes and

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.919 
pick up a eyes like friends or foes and
they<00:01:56.710> can<00:01:56.829> toss<00:01:57.070> them<00:01:57.310> at<00:01:57.399> people<00:01:57.549> and<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:58.899> I

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
they can toss them at people and so I

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.529 
they can toss them at people and so I
think<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.229> everybody<00:02:00.189> around<00:02:01.030> them<00:02:01.210> finds

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
think that everybody around them finds

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:02.880 
think that everybody around them finds
them<00:02:01.630> quite<00:02:01.869> terrifying<00:02:02.380> including

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
them quite terrifying including

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.800 
them quite terrifying including
sometimes<00:02:03.490> your<00:02:03.850> enemies<00:02:04.240> cuz<00:02:04.539> they<00:02:04.659> just

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
sometimes your enemies cuz they just

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.419 
sometimes your enemies cuz they just
become<00:02:05.080> tools<00:02:05.289> of<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.590> handyman<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.159> get<00:02:06.310> it

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
become tools of the handyman to get it

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.179 
become tools of the handyman to get it
to<00:02:06.610> get<00:02:06.759> a<00:02:06.789> hooker
