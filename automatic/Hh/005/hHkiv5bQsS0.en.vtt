um<00:02:12.790> as<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.660> know<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.230> just<00:02:14.560> joined<00:02:15.390> while

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
um as you know that I just joined while

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.690 
um as you know that I just joined while
this<00:02:16.570> game<00:02:16.780> was<00:02:16.990> going<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:17.680> we've<00:02:18.550> already

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
this game was going on so we've already

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.330 
this game was going on so we've already
lost<00:02:18.940> around<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.930> joined<00:02:20.620> in

lost around and I joined in

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.650 
lost around and I joined in
I<00:02:21.400> guess<00:02:21.910> halfway<00:02:22.090> through<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:23.849> you<00:02:24.849> know<00:02:25.000> as

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
I guess halfway through and you know as

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.660 
I guess halfway through and you know as
you<00:02:25.720> can<00:02:25.989> see<00:02:26.170> by<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.379> title<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.069> video<00:02:27.280> I

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
you can see by the title of this video I

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.780 
you can see by the title of this video I
make<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.300> bad<00:02:28.540> choice<00:02:28.569> is<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.230> value<00:02:29.830> making<00:02:30.730> a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
make a bad choice is a value making a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.690 
make a bad choice is a value making a
bad<00:02:30.940> choice<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:32.620> had<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.370> face<00:02:33.550> the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
bad choice I had to face the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.059

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
well I guess some teammates because I

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.660 
well I guess some teammates because I

troy is very helpful because obviously
the<00:03:17.709> reason<00:03:17.829> why<00:03:18.069> you<00:03:18.129> tend<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.579> use<00:03:18.700> slave<00:03:18.940> and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
the reason why you tend to use slave and

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.300 
the reason why you tend to use slave and

pro in other game modes because there's

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.800

a lot of people that you face seconds

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.720 
a lot of people that you face seconds
and<00:03:23.410> whence<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.709> when<00:03:23.860> there's<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.099> lot<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.310> oil

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
and whence it when there's a lot of oil

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.550 
and whence it when there's a lot of oil
group<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:25.090> people<00:03:25.359> coming<00:03:25.540> at<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.380> want

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
to reload fast and just in case if you

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.140 
to reload fast and just in case if you
run<00:03:29.049> out<00:03:29.079> of<00:03:29.200> bullets<00:03:29.579> but<00:03:30.579> in<00:03:30.819> such<00:03:31.000> an

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
run out of bullets but in such an

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.289 
run out of bullets but in such an
destroy<00:03:31.420> that's<00:03:31.810> what<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.109> know<00:03:32.790> what<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:33.940> what

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
destroy that's what I know what you what

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.309 
destroy that's what I know what you what
you<00:03:34.329> tend<00:03:34.569> to<00:03:34.660> get<00:03:34.840> as<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.019> one-on-one

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
you tend to get as a one-on-one

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.080 
you tend to get as a one-on-one
situation<00:03:35.440> because<00:03:36.340> there's<00:03:36.609> only<00:03:36.730> six

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
situation because there's only six

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.370 
situation because there's only six
people<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.569> you're<00:03:37.660> playing<00:03:37.840> against<00:03:38.139> then

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
people that you're playing against then

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.550 
people that you're playing against then
everyone<00:03:39.280> spread<00:03:39.609> out<00:03:39.700> evenly<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:41.019> guess

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
everyone spread out evenly so I guess

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.039 
everyone spread out evenly so I guess
