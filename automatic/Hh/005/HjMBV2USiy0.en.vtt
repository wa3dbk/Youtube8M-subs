00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:10.750
 and then bring this game a long time ago 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.210
 I left recently I found it 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.209
 in place thor but unfortunately not 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.490
 I could download it because he told me not to 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.920
 was available in my country so 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.730
 I had to download it for a page if 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.060
 you want come 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.730
 mortal kombat for android voucher has already 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.359
 come out as though already pretty dumb in 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.359
 the play store 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:41.660
 the world in general this game are 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.290
 impressive 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.260
 the cell phone had it on top of the ram or 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.990
 be this game consumed me everything and more 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.590
 screen recorders 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.650
 literally screen winner 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.840
 how this is recorded and with a little 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.700
 definition can be said well because no 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.100
 I know I never had this 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.540
 they would have seen the amount of smoke 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.130
 that there were already cells when I was 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.130
 recording was awesome 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.240
 the game consumes enough branches for 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.400
 download because it consumes a lot of rage 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.670
 so keep that in mind when 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.049
 Think as much as I thought I weighed 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.850
 I would throw the 2 or 3 gigs maybe 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:37.430
 but game weighs 16 2 gigas and is not so 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.970
 heavy apart is also recommended 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:46.210
 have 15 sometimes arrive to play 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.210
 the game requires 1 gb of ram 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.159
 do not 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.420
 so x do not tell me very well the law 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.680
 these are not the best graphics that 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.410
 they have more graphic games and obviously 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.119
 it goes more fluid the motorola x mode me 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.990
 came out a message that I'm going to put 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.990
 right now 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.570
 i 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.140
 worth that message 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.129
 it ruined my whole life when when 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:41.299
 I talked to him 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:43.780
 but still I could play and pressing what 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.299
 I recorded mother 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.530
 the link being down as always link 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:54.969
 play are not by mega voucher not this time not 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.969
 I doubt it will be by mega 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.560
 so that the download is 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.240
 free although one will always be 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.990
 characteristic of this game I like 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.060
 the qualities of this pretty style 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.730
 the blood on all this game I gave him 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:14.840
 also the doctor 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.310
 he likes it by blood is the truth 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.350
 obviously it does not look much like that of 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.460
 three is to say that the controls cannes 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.660
 completely the controls there is a 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.270
 variety of people that we are for 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.200
 buy this all this I have recorded 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.360
 OK 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.129
 I bought the characters that are 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.129
 seeing now that they are playing 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.150
 I bought a variety of characters to 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.660
 that they can see some vouchers later in the 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.690
 store there are a lot 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.670
 they come in bronze silver and gold and three 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.620
 exclusive characters also have the 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.720
 shop that is bought strong have silver 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.720
 I really am not very sure loser 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.989
 we have also 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.900
 the mission is that it would be the towers that 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.690
 would be to fight against others 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.989
 characters and other options too but 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.340
 jump soon I'm not too sure 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.970
 of that I do not have very extended 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.970
 personal 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.750
 has some effects this game the truth 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:25.110
 super good that actually I 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:28.470
 impress enough my mother was what 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.150
 I liked it is obviously like 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:37.250
 no it was not the best 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:39.590
 I do not like that it was playable 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.440
 was to play I tried to do the best I could 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.790
 I could and it went like this 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.580
 I hope hope you like are worth 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.920
 regret if it looks stuck worth says that 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.050
 is being stuck right now I know 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.200
 that is the ally but man that this 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.580
 heavy game because there consumes me the rmi 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.530
 bad screen recorder of my cell phone and 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.560
 really cast smoke was burning 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:07.760
 inside if this is all this is 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.440
 past it was something unexpected but 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.800
 come on about this that I could not anymore 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.280
 no no I did not demand more from this exterior that 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.340
 It did not look very good , I do not demand anything more and 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.870
 I hope you like it, you know that 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.870
 in like it's been pretty good 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.240
 and they will try to climb mortal kombat of 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.130
 them more often 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:36.870
 I will try to fix it I do not know what I do not know 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:40.120
 how 12 will not be until the deadly kombat and 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.370
 I think many already the obvious came out 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.870
 recently so until one day ago 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:49.660
 far back less than a day ago hours not 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.230
 have been addressed but little happens 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.230
 a brother 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:03.510
 and they do not want us 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:09.689
 equitable 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.110
 Well, you know how to declare the game 

00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:18.760
 pretty good a hug and until the 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.740
 following 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:25.460
 fuck that there will be because the video 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:28.449

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.449
 Y
