00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.250
 people are going to be there again 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.009
 today we will do something sweet 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.699
 celestial absolute and 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.460
 though chocolate mousse chocolate cream is that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.410
 a bit of a chocolate pudding but he 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.269
 Do not believe what the basis will be 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.640
 I was totally surprised as well 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.130
 heard that goes but it works and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.570
 Although the basis for our chocolate cream 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.410
 40 a avocado a hate avocado and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.989
 look what color does we have 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.010
 which open now 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.559
 poison green but that does not stay so delicious 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.690
 chocolaty brown was all you had 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.420
 you just need it if you think so 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.890
 of course bigger group does more 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 avocados I'm doing very small now 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.120
 amount really only for two people 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.850
 small snack you take several 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.250
 things so I take an avocado and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.320
 I'll do it here in my shredder 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.409
 You can do it with one 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.950
 the blender bar no problem at all 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.930
 nice scratch out funny you will not 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.270
 believe that looks the same 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.820
 a sofa corner chocolate cream but the color 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.290
 we just get that from 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.140
 really poison too deliciously chocolaty 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.930
 brown namely with cacau 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.720
 best he takes a revealed 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.820
 Variant of dark cacau that is 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.439
 important because otherwise it will be very oily 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.490
 avocado has a lot of fat itself 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.490
 we take three spoons 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.000
 then some vanilla sugar is added 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.890
 better still is a vanilla bean the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.550
 scratched out and you like that 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.200
 takes 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.750
 Unfortunately, I have no today 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.700
 because vanilla bean because of the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.500
 Vanilla sugar for me is enough 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.400
 Add three level tablespoons 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.739
 sugar 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.340
 you can also take the agave force 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.739
 Something soja cream oats cream that something 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.430
 you may say we would say so 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.750
 start with three tablespoons and 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.209
 we can do that accordingly 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.239
 increase if we see that still has to 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.690
 to be a little bit different 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.550
 where is it already developed here 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.450
 Come on 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.450
 look here now man 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.400
 zack zack zack 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.400
 and there arises our stockumer 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.550
 and it's done that's really 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:09.130
 real quick 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:16.090
 you see it looks and tastes great 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:17.790
 also super totally chocolaty and that is 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.020
 Now great as a dessert I would say 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:28.000
 Do that half an hour before you go 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:29.980
 Serve want me even now 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.750
 simple trick how not to get out of this 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.440
 just chocolate cream as he can do 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.230
 but also a chocolate spread because 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.970
 Most chocolate creams are like nutella 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.420
 the ones still have to be sold too 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.420
 in it 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.160
 Whether we do that in and out now 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:51.010
 then we have a delicious one 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:55.900
 protoss for I always take r2 is 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:59.110
 Take another three tablespoons 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.950
 that was a generous and now with 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.580
 you look for those from ours so far in 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.580
 bread cut up 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.320
 comes one more hazel music and good ones 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.199
 and now it's not just chocolate anymore 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.820
 but bread spread I think 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.460
 this idea and the simplicity of 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.770
 Recipe just great and so you can 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.250
 just on the fast what sweet delicious 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.030
 conjure 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.210
 no matter if it is red or in the dessert bowl 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.590
 For how do you like the idea you have 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.220
 schonmal nutella even made that 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.169
 I would really be interested 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.930
 write that in the comments 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.389
 bye bye and so on 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.960

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.960
