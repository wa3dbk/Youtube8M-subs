00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
in a 2010 mac mini we've already shut

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.650 
in a 2010 mac mini we've already shut
down<00:00:53.710> unplugged<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.670> placed<00:00:54.970> our<00:00:55.210> mini<00:00:55.390> on<00:00:55.629> a

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
soft static free surface we are now

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.690 
soft static free surface we are now
ready<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.660> begin

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.570 

you

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.980 

the<00:01:05.580> first<00:01:05.820> step<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.300> turn<00:01:06.660> the<00:01:06.780> mac<00:01:06.960> mini

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the first step is to turn the mac mini

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.380 
the first step is to turn the mac mini
upside<00:01:07.740> down<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.700> access<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
upside down so that we can access the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.960 
upside down so that we can access the
bottom<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.500> open<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> bottom<00:01:11.190> cover<00:01:11.460> place

then<00:01:14.400> gently<00:01:14.760> rotate<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> counterclockwise

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
then gently rotate it counterclockwise

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.860 
then gently rotate it counterclockwise
until<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.620> white<00:01:16.800> dots<00:01:17.100> line<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:17.720> you<00:01:18.720> may

until the white dots line up you may

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.780 
until the white dots line up you may
then<00:01:19.050> lift<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.410> bottom<00:01:19.560> out<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.130> set<00:01:20.640> it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
then lift the bottom out and set it

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.510 
then lift the bottom out and set it
aside<00:01:20.940> you'll<00:01:21.900> find<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.410> memory<00:01:22.560> located<00:01:23.370> on
