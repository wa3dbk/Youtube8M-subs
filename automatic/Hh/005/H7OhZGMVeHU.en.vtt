not<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.230> dime<00:01:42.620> in<00:01:42.800> my<00:01:42.950> pocket<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:43.550> I

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
not a dime in my pocket and I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.810 
not a dime in my pocket and I
strategically<00:01:45.020> scheduled<00:01:45.680> dinner<00:01:46.160> with<00:01:46.550> a

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
strategically scheduled dinner with a

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.000 
strategically scheduled dinner with a
supplier<00:01:47.300> every<00:01:47.600> night<00:01:48.080> so<00:01:48.380> that<00:01:48.410> I<00:01:48.560> could<00:01:48.680> eat

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
supplier every night so that I could eat

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.100 
supplier every night so that I could eat
and<00:01:49.310> that<00:01:49.850> was<00:01:50.030> sort<00:01:50.180> of<00:01:50.300> my<00:01:50.360> biggest<00:01:50.660> trip<00:01:50.960> I

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
and that was sort of my biggest trip I

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.990 
and that was sort of my biggest trip I
mean<00:01:51.260> those<00:01:51.440> were<00:01:51.680> things<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:52.010> you<00:01:52.190> did<00:01:52.400> that

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
mean those were things that you did that

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.150 
mean those were things that you did that
was<00:01:53.270> just<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.780> way<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:54.080> worked<00:01:54.290> at<00:01:54.620> that<00:01:54.890> time

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
was just the way it worked at that time

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.130 
was just the way it worked at that time
there's<00:01:55.490> always<00:01:55.790> things<00:01:56.210> that<00:01:56.420> you'll<00:01:57.080> have

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
there's always things that you'll have

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
there's always things that you'll have
to<00:01:57.440> sacrifice<00:01:57.650> to<00:01:58.340> move<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.420> next<00:01:59.720> level

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
to sacrifice to move to the next level

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.330 
to sacrifice to move to the next level
so<00:02:01.160> if<00:02:01.460> somebody<00:02:01.940> came<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.750> me<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.440> asked<00:02:04.280> me

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
so if somebody came to me and asked me

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.430 
so if somebody came to me and asked me
for<00:02:04.700> advice<00:02:04.730> I<00:02:05.300> think<00:02:05.600> perseverance<00:02:06.260> is

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
for advice I think perseverance is

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.440 
for advice I think perseverance is
probably<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.010> very<00:02:07.130> first<00:02:07.700> thing<00:02:08.030> I<00:02:08.300> would

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
probably the very first thing I would

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.070 
probably the very first thing I would
tell<00:02:08.720> them<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:09.410> must<00:02:09.710> persevere<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.900> mean<00:02:11.900> I've

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
tell them you must persevere I mean I've

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.440 
tell them you must persevere I mean I've
learned<00:02:12.380> from<00:02:12.590> my<00:02:12.680> mistakes<00:02:13.220> I've<00:02:14.090> done<00:02:14.300> the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
learned from my mistakes I've done the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.440 
learned from my mistakes I've done the
best<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.810> can<00:02:14.870> I've<00:02:15.800> been<00:02:16.040> honest<00:02:16.460> I've<00:02:16.820> worked

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
best I can I've been honest I've worked

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:39.540 
best I can I've been honest I've worked
hard<00:02:17.750> that's<00:02:18.740> how<00:02:19.430> I've<00:02:19.670> built<00:02:20.000> my<00:02:20.090> business
