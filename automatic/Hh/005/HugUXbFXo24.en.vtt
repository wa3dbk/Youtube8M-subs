00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
to just write without a dust cover that

mark<00:01:42.380> on<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.390> I'm<00:01:44.390> guessing<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.530> if<00:01:45.710> you

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830

mark on it and I'm guessing that if you
use<00:01:46.210> one<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.240> these<00:01:47.390> connectors<00:01:48.110> for<00:01:48.320> s<00:01:48.470> video

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
use one of these connectors for s video

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.000 
use one of these connectors for s video
or<00:01:49.040> something<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:50.270> switch<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.630> over<00:01:50.840> from<00:01:51.229> l2h

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
or something you switch it over from l2h

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:00.679 
or something you switch it over from l2h
or<00:01:52.820> h2l<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:54.340> we<00:01:55.340> have<00:01:55.549> our<00:01:55.790> power<00:01:56.540> jack
