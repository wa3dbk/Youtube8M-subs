hi<00:00:02.100> in<00:00:02.490> this<00:00:02.760> video<00:00:02.939> I'm<00:00:03.240> going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.510> be<00:00:03.570> demoing

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
hi in this video I'm going to be demoing

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.380 
hi in this video I'm going to be demoing
continuity<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.859> running<00:00:05.400> on<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.609> iPad<00:00:05.970> I'm

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
continuity to running on the iPad I'm

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.089 
continuity to running on the iPad I'm
also<00:00:06.720> going<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.049> highlight<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.649> achievement

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
also going to highlight the achievement

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.700 
also going to highlight the achievement
system<00:00:08.220> we've<00:00:08.490> added<00:00:08.639> for<00:00:08.910> continuity<00:00:09.240> to

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
system we've added for continuity to

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.110 
system we've added for continuity to
just<00:00:10.710> before<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:10.980> begin<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.280> want<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.610> apologize

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
just before I begin I want to apologize

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.970 
just before I begin I want to apologize
for<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.480> background<00:00:12.840> noise<00:00:12.929> it's<00:00:13.530> basically

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
for the background noise it's basically

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.720 
for the background noise it's basically
as<00:00:14.250> quiet<00:00:14.969> as<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.240> gets<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.480> my<00:00:15.630> neighborhood

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
as quiet as it gets in my neighborhood

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.179 
as quiet as it gets in my neighborhood
so<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:18.510> continuity<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.590> object<00:00:19.740> at<00:00:20.039> each

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
so in continuity to the object at each

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.550 
so in continuity to the object at each
level<00:00:20.460> as<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:21.270> continuity<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.410> take

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
level as in continuity one is to take

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.980 
level as in continuity one is to take
the<00:00:22.710> character<00:00:23.160> collect<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.150> key<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.570> then

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the character collect the key and then

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.439 
the character collect the key and then
move<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> door<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.789> using<00:00:27.090> two

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
move to the door you do this using two

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.570 
move to the door you do this using two
modes<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.380> first<00:00:28.590> mode<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.070> move<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
modes in the first mode you can move the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.330 
modes in the first mode you can move the
tiles<00:00:29.939> by<00:00:30.119> dragging<00:00:30.539> them<00:00:32.239> in<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.980> second

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
tiles by dragging them in the second

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.690 
tiles by dragging them in the second
mode<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.940> move<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.210> character<00:00:40.700> these

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
mode you can move the character these

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.610 
mode you can move the character these
coins<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.300> something<00:00:42.629> new<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.899> continuity<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
coins are something new in continuity to

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.490 
coins are something new in continuity to
each<00:00:44.610> level<00:00:45.000> has<00:00:45.030> some<00:00:45.899> number<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.260> clients

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
each level has some number of clients

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.470 
each level has some number of clients
you<00:00:47.280> don't<00:00:47.460> ever<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.000> collect<00:00:48.270> them

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
you don't ever have to collect them

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.330 
you don't ever have to collect them
however<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.260> collect<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.190> coins

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
however if you collect all of the coins

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.650 
however if you collect all of the coins
in<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.640> level<00:00:50.910> you'll<00:00:51.300> learn<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.600> achieve

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
in the level you'll learn and achieve

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.779 
in the level you'll learn and achieve
them<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> now<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> key<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.520> can

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
them so now that we have the key we can

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.270 
them so now that we have the key we can
directly<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> door<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.379> beat<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> level

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
directly to the door and beat the level

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.920 
directly to the door and beat the level
with<00:00:59.460> without<00:00:59.879> collecting<00:01:00.210> lead<00:01:00.600> remained

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
with without collecting lead remained

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.300 
with without collecting lead remained
coins<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.260> beat<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> level<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.950> bring

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
coins and so we beat the level and bring

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.010 
coins and so we beat the level and bring
the<00:01:08.430> achievement<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.630> didn't<00:01:09.869> earn

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the achievement for it we didn't earn

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.440 
the achievement for it we didn't earn
the<00:01:10.229> client<00:01:10.619> achievement<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> level

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
the client achievement for the level

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.429 
the client achievement for the level
because<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.510> only<00:01:12.659> got<00:01:12.780> two<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> five

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
because we only got two of the five

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.590 
because we only got two of the five
coins<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.310> didn't<00:01:14.610> earn<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.180> time

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
coins and we didn't earn the time

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.539 
coins and we didn't earn the time
achievement<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.259> level<00:01:16.530> each<00:01:17.189> level<00:01:17.520> has

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
achievement for the level each level has

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.160 
achievement for the level each level has
a<00:01:17.700> time<00:01:18.060> achievement<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.930> earned<00:01:19.049> by

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
a time achievement that can be earned by

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.929 
a time achievement that can be earned by
beating<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.680> level<00:01:20.040> faster<00:01:20.490> than<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> certain

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
beating the level faster than a certain

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.760 
beating the level faster than a certain
time<00:01:21.210> while<00:01:21.900> having<00:01:22.080> collected<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
time while having collected all the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.550 
time while having collected all the
coins<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.420> point<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.869> levels<00:01:25.229> beaten

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
coins so at this point the levels beaten

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.920 
coins so at this point the levels beaten
we<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.189> proceed<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.700> next<00:01:26.850> level<00:01:27.180> however

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
we can proceed to the next level however

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.649 
we can proceed to the next level however
I'm<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.220> replay<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> level<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> try<00:01:30.600> to
