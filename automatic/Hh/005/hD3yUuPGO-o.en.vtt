00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.950
 hey cordially welcomes you 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.810
 there are today I show you the song 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.390
 because of andreas bourani like you 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.520
 Maybe you have already recognized everyone 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.710
 infos like for example lumix or 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.590
 You can also find the original chords in 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.599
 the description of the video I have 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.519
 Therefore, not me for the original 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.140
 Chords decided because Andreas Bourani 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.780
 sinks very very high and therefore has 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.870
 I picked out alternative chords 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.629
 are much better to play and also 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.299
 singing a lot better are the same 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.809
 start with the stanza in connection 

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:49.180
 I'll show you then the refrain and then 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.489
 there is a third song 'bad the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.110
 bridge let's go with the stanza here 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.290
 you only need two chords 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.340
 once g dur 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.870
 and then i moi 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.090
 and the two chords are now 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.830
 repeated four times and I do that 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.830
 now before it starts with g 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.690
 that may be a long way off 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.000
 and so on as you stop now 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.799
 if you make that a few meeting so 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.670
 I fight the pages with mine 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.670
 palms off or we open blow 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.240
 or if you are gambling 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.680
 34 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.950
 1 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.450
 It does not matter that's why I explain that 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.320
 also not detailed that you can 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.850
 decide for yourself 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.180
 important is that the chords have it 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.590
 that's why I gave you so much to catastrophe 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.420
 the reform of the song exists 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.820
 basically once two 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.619
 different parks that is a part 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.020
 you will surely be in the original song 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.250
 Also, it's a bit quieter to listen to 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.720
 the second part is then just one 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.220
 the band is a bit more impulsive 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.239
 because of a blow and so on 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:24.150
 further we need for the reform 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:27.030
 following chords cdu 41 where now completely 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.630
 times two short beats then to go from here 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.630
 with d major 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.200
 and now again two beats before 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.430
 at all 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.670
 and then it's time again with c 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.670
 major 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.319
 12 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.300
 and then this comes this short break 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.980
 and then we come to the second part of the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.980
 re fund interrupted as the chords c 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.970
 the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.710
 G 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.910
 4 of the two-wheel I would go everywhere 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.910
 play 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.410
 last line is played four times and 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.910
 then you have the refrain quite well 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.040
 then I talked about it 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.470
 that there is another song pack 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.819
 namely the bridge makes the difference 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.430
 But now not at all from the 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.040
 see the second couple of the re fund and see 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.280
 that single chords c 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.280
 the 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.270
 p &amp; g at all 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.620
 see 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.540
 G 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.540
 rather 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.160
 I do not need four times now 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.420
 Play is enough if I short now 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.840
 demonstrate and you know, I think 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.000
 decision 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.580
 that was already the tutorial I 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.870
 Hope you got along with it 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.670
 respect in all cases first one the 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.120
 people who made it 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.830
 I know that but that is not easy 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.480
 if you look at the video 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.420
 always rewinding and so on 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.400
 then it is in any case clear if 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.950
 do not just write me a message 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.140
 I should play this and that again 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.920
 or you write me you are super good 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.870
 coped 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.010
 it can go on like this 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.880
 video and see you next time 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.880
 again chips
