I know that this is just rough because

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.650 
I know that this is just rough because
Russell<00:00:10.290> Westbrook<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:10.920> out<00:00:11.460> once<00:00:12.059> again

there was some extra swelling in his

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.150 
there was some extra swelling in his
knee<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.120> they<00:00:15.480> didn't<00:00:15.780> see<00:00:15.960> before<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.680> now

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
knee that they didn't see before and now

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.310 
knee that they didn't see before and now
he's<00:00:17.400> gonna<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.850> undergo<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.390> third<00:00:18.990> knee

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
he's gonna have to undergo a third knee

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.010 
he's gonna have to undergo a third knee
surgery<00:00:19.859> best<00:00:20.550> case<00:00:20.789> scenario<00:00:20.820> he<00:00:21.539> comes<00:00:21.779> back

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
surgery best case scenario he comes back

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.689 
surgery best case scenario he comes back
the<00:00:22.230> first<00:00:22.470> game<00:00:22.710> after<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.189> all-star<00:00:23.670> break

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the first game after the all-star break

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.880 
the first game after the all-star break
but<00:00:24.420> most<00:00:24.600> likely<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.170> gonna<00:00:25.260> take<00:00:25.560> even

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
but most likely it's gonna take even

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.189 
but most likely it's gonna take even
more<00:00:25.920> time<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:27.090> that's<00:00:27.300> definitely<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.869> couple

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
more time so that's definitely a couple

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.839 
more time so that's definitely a couple
months<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.740> who<00:00:29.220> knows<00:00:29.429> what's<00:00:29.640> gonna<00:00:29.760> happen

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
months and who knows what's gonna happen

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.420 
months and who knows what's gonna happen
until<00:00:30.300> then<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.320> I'm<00:00:31.410> gonna<00:00:31.529> break<00:00:31.800> down<00:00:32.009> how

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
until then so I'm gonna break down how

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.040 
until then so I'm gonna break down how
it's<00:00:32.610> gonna<00:00:32.700> turn<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.059> for<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.420> Thunder<00:00:33.870> and

it's gonna turn out for the Thunder and
what<00:00:34.500> they're<00:00:34.649> gonna<00:00:34.770> do<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.940> those<00:00:36.059> next

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
what they're gonna do so in those next

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.940 
what they're gonna do so in those next
couple<00:00:36.450> months<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.110> now<00:00:37.320> we<00:00:37.380> are<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
couple months right now we are in the

couple months right now we are in the
second<00:00:38.370> seed<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.879> that's<00:00:39.510> pretty<00:00:39.780> solid<00:00:40.110> we

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
second seed and that's pretty solid we

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.709 
second seed and that's pretty solid we
are<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.800> fire<00:00:41.250> before<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:41.969> happened<00:00:42.390> Russell

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
are on fire before this happened Russell

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.779 
are on fire before this happened Russell
Westbrook<00:00:43.110> he<00:00:43.559> was<00:00:43.739> feeling<00:00:44.100> good<00:00:44.250> he's

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
Westbrook he was feeling good he's

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.209 
Westbrook he was feeling good he's
putting<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.180> some<00:00:45.360> solid<00:00:45.780> numbers<00:00:46.110> KD<00:00:46.950> with

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
putting up some solid numbers KD with

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.590 
putting up some solid numbers KD with
Russell<00:00:47.579> Westbrook<00:00:47.610> taken<00:00:48.270> away<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
Russell Westbrook taken away the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.840 
Russell Westbrook taken away the
defenders<00:00:49.110> creating<00:00:49.860> some<00:00:50.039> space<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.489> KD

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
defenders creating some space for KD

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.299 
defenders creating some space for KD
everything<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.600> working<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.140> perfection<00:00:52.530> now

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
everything was working to perfection now

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
everything was working to perfection now
at<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> point<00:00:53.910> guard<00:00:54.090> position<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.809> only<00:00:54.960> have

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
at the point guard position we only have

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.619 
at the point guard position we only have
Reggie<00:00:55.559> Jackson<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.370> Derrick<00:00:56.789> Fisher<00:00:56.969> so

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
Reggie Jackson and Derrick Fisher so

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
Reggie Jackson and Derrick Fisher so
this<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.989> definitely<00:00:58.199> taking<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.859> big<00:00:59.219> hit<00:00:59.489> at

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
this is definitely taking a big hit at

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.670 
this is definitely taking a big hit at
our<00:00:59.879> depth<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.840> hopefully<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.530> get

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
our depth but hopefully we can get

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.860 
our depth but hopefully we can get
somebody<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.550> side<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.059> give<00:01:03.210> us<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.480> spark

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
somebody on the side to give us a spark

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.109 
somebody on the side to give us a spark
because<00:01:04.530> San<00:01:04.769> freshly<00:01:05.159> said<00:01:05.430> he<00:01:05.670> might<00:01:05.939> go

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
because San freshly said he might go

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.330 
because San freshly said he might go
after<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> new<00:01:06.659> player<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.380> try<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.130> them

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
after a new player and try to get them

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.940 
after a new player and try to get them
in<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.549> while<00:01:09.390> rest<00:01:09.689> works<00:01:09.900> out<00:01:10.110> now<00:01:10.799> let's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
in here while rest works out now let's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.740 
in here while rest works out now let's
look<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.250> our<00:01:11.400> title<00:01:11.790> chances<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.390> need<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
look at our title chances we need the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.420 
look at our title chances we need the
best<00:01:13.020> possible<00:01:13.290> seeding<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> West

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
best possible seeding in the West

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.880 
best possible seeding in the West
because<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.119> Western<00:01:15.540> Conference<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:16.170> much

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
because the Western Conference is much

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.039 
because the Western Conference is much
more<00:01:17.130> competitive<00:01:17.520> than<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.939> East<00:01:18.240> right<00:01:18.869> now

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
more competitive than the East right now

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.050 
more competitive than the East right now
we're<00:01:19.229> second<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> West<00:01:20.070> even<00:01:20.880> with

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
we're second in the West even with

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
we're second in the West even with
Westbrook<00:01:21.360> healthy<00:01:21.810> now<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.290> he's<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.619> I

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
Westbrook healthy now that he's out I

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.469 
Westbrook healthy now that he's out I
don't<00:01:23.280> think<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.700> gonna<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:24.000> able<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.240> stay

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
don't think it's gonna be able to stay

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.480 
don't think it's gonna be able to stay
the<00:01:24.630> same<00:01:24.659> until<00:01:25.080> he<00:01:25.350> comes<00:01:25.560> back<00:01:25.650> so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the same until he comes back so

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.340 
the same until he comes back so
hopefully<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.060> still<00:01:27.479> maintain<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:28.020> home

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
hopefully we can still maintain a home

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.499 
hopefully we can still maintain a home
court<00:01:28.619> advantage<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> one<00:01:30.030> problem<00:01:30.210> with

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
court advantage but the one problem with

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.719 
court advantage but the one problem with
KD<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.680> when<00:01:31.799> westbrook's<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> court

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
KD is that when westbrook's on the court

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850 
KD is that when westbrook's on the court
as<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.939> said<00:01:33.210> before<00:01:33.570> Westbrook<00:01:34.350> draws<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
as I said before Westbrook draws the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.950 
as I said before Westbrook draws the
defenders<00:01:35.400> he<00:01:35.610> draws<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.880> defenders<00:01:36.509> off<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
defenders he draws the defenders off of

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
in there in the West but just now maybe

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.470 
in there in the West but just now maybe
the<00:02:25.680> second<00:02:26.040> seed<00:02:26.280> but<00:02:26.730> if<00:02:26.850> Westbrook<00:02:27.270> comes

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
like he was about a week ago I think we

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.220 
like he was about a week ago I think we
can<00:02:32.370> still<00:02:32.670> make<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.850> run<00:02:33.270> at<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.600> second<00:02:34.080> and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
can still make a run at that second and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.590 
can still make a run at that second and
maybe<00:02:34.410> even<00:02:34.680> first<00:02:35.130> seed<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.940> only<00:02:36.180> thing<00:02:36.420> is

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
maybe even first seed the only thing is

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.260 
maybe even first seed the only thing is
the<00:02:36.840> bench<00:02:37.110> right<00:02:37.410> now<00:02:37.470> really<00:02:38.459> needs<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.060> step
