00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
when I get in that mood where I just

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.000

need to withdraw generally I drink and

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.330 
need to withdraw generally I drink and
um<00:02:07.450> if<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.629> had<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.899> pick<00:02:08.929> one<00:02:09.140> sin<00:02:09.769> food<00:02:10.069> that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
um if I had to pick one sin food that

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.640 
um if I had to pick one sin food that
just<00:02:11.120> tops<00:02:11.750> all<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.140> others<00:02:12.349> it<00:02:12.470> with<00:02:12.560> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
just tops all the others it with the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.880 
just tops all the others it with the
alcohol<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:14.019> not<00:02:15.019> only<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.739> so

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
alcohol and not only is it just so

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.380 
alcohol and not only is it just so
incredibly<00:02:16.310> detrimental<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:16.970> weight<00:02:17.209> loss

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
incredibly detrimental to weight loss

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.780 
incredibly detrimental to weight loss
but<00:02:17.870> it's<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.830> Trussell<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.400> spirit

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
but it's that Trussell to the spirit

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.490 
but it's that Trussell to the spirit
drinking<00:02:20.269> all<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.540> time<00:02:20.569> it's<00:02:20.930> like<00:02:20.989> it's<00:02:21.230> fun

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
drinking all the time it's like it's fun

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.030 
drinking all the time it's like it's fun
but<00:02:21.769> then<00:02:21.950> it's<00:02:22.099> like<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.430> big<00:02:22.489> crash<00:02:23.000> and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
but then it's like this big crash and

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.699 
but then it's like this big crash and
it's<00:02:25.040> not<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.400> much<00:02:25.459> an<00:02:26.300> alcoholism<00:02:27.290> thing<00:02:27.530> but

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
it's not so much an alcoholism thing but

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.290 
it's not so much an alcoholism thing but
I<00:02:27.739> think<00:02:27.860> if<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.340> didn't<00:02:28.700> have<00:02:28.819> so<00:02:29.180> much

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300

alcoholism and that's something that
I've<00:02:32.959> given<00:02:33.410> thought<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.650> before<00:02:33.950> just

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
I've given thought to before just

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.059 
I've given thought to before just
because<00:02:34.519> it's<00:02:35.060> my<00:02:35.269> place<00:02:35.810> I<00:02:35.959> go<00:02:36.140> when<00:02:36.439> I<00:02:36.859> get

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
because it's my place I go when I get

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.340 
because it's my place I go when I get
depressed<00:02:37.219> and<00:02:37.790> it's<00:02:38.090> always<00:02:38.390> kept<00:02:38.840> me<00:02:38.989> over

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
depressed and it's always kept me over

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.500 
depressed and it's always kept me over
wait<00:02:39.470> since<00:02:39.920> since<00:02:40.790> especially<00:02:41.030> since<00:02:41.270> I've

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
wait since since especially since I've

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.890 
wait since since especially since I've
been<00:02:41.690> 21<00:02:42.260> um<00:02:43.090> because<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.360> go<00:02:44.480> out<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.810> you

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
been 21 um because you go out and you

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.600 
been 21 um because you go out and you
drink<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.500> then<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.740> leads<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.250> more<00:02:46.400> eating

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
drink and then that leads to more eating

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.640 
drink and then that leads to more eating
and<00:02:46.820> then<00:02:46.970> more<00:02:47.120> drinking<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:48.440> just

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
and then more drinking and it just

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.620 
and then more drinking and it just
becomes<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.280> social<00:02:49.760> lubricant<00:02:50.240> but<00:02:50.330> it's

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
becomes the social lubricant but it's

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.630 
becomes the social lubricant but it's
always<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.990> way<00:02:51.260> for<00:02:51.560> me<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.680> mask<00:02:52.010> because<00:02:52.400> if

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
always a way for me to mask because if

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.010 
always a way for me to mask because if
I'm<00:02:52.760> feeling<00:02:52.940> really<00:02:53.180> cheerful<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.660> happy<00:02:53.810> I

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
don't even think about it but when I am

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.370 
don't even think about it but when I am
feeling<00:02:58.850> like<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.180> failure<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.840> just<00:03:00.110> want<00:03:00.320> to

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
didn't and I know a lot of you have seen

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.890 
didn't and I know a lot of you have seen
my<00:04:03.560> why<00:04:04.280> water<00:04:04.610> is<00:04:04.760> important<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.390> video<00:04:05.600> which

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
my why water is important to video which

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.210 
my why water is important to video which
if<00:04:06.050> you<00:04:06.170> haven't<00:04:06.200> seen<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:06.710> really<00:04:06.890> should

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
if you haven't seen it you really should

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.500 
if you haven't seen it you really should
because<00:04:07.370> I<00:04:07.610> talk<00:04:07.790> all<00:04:07.940> about<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.330> science

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
because I talk all about the science

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.830 
because I talk all about the science
about<00:04:08.960> how<00:04:09.470> water<00:04:10.010> works<00:04:11.000> but<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.510> briefly

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
about how water works but to briefly

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.590 
about how water works but to briefly
summarize<00:04:12.050> water<00:04:12.860> makes<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.850> kidneys<00:04:14.240> work

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
summarize water makes the kidneys work

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.229 
summarize water makes the kidneys work
great<00:04:15.200> which<00:04:15.950> takes<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.580> burden<00:04:16.790> off<00:04:17.030> the

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
great which takes the burden off the

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.210 
great which takes the burden off the
liver<00:04:17.450> which<00:04:17.989> makes<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.500> liver<00:04:18.680> be<00:04:18.920> able<00:04:19.160> to

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
liver which makes the liver be able to

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.640 
liver which makes the liver be able to
burn<00:04:19.430> or<00:04:19.760> convert<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.989> stored<00:04:21.230> fat<00:04:21.440> in<00:04:21.620> your

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
burn or convert the stored fat in your

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.410 
burn or convert the stored fat in your
body<00:04:21.770> into<00:04:22.220> energy<00:04:22.490> which<00:04:22.850> then<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.120> can<00:04:23.300> burn

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
body into energy which then you can burn

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.840 
body into energy which then you can burn
off<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:24.200> basically<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.770> livers<00:04:25.070> function<00:04:25.610> is

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
off so basically the livers function is

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.390 
off so basically the livers function is
to<00:04:26.210> make<00:04:27.170> you<00:04:27.200> burn<00:04:27.620> fat<00:04:27.680> off<00:04:28.100> your<00:04:28.250> body

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
to make you burn fat off your body

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.310 
to make you burn fat off your body
essentially<00:04:29.150> although<00:04:29.780> it<00:04:29.900> doesn't<00:04:30.050> do<00:04:30.200> it

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
essentially although it doesn't do it

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.010 
essentially although it doesn't do it
itself<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:30.920> in<00:04:31.910> order<00:04:32.180> for<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.780> liver<00:04:32.930> to

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
itself and in order for the liver to

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.150 
itself and in order for the liver to
function<00:04:33.500> properly<00:04:33.590> you<00:04:33.890> need<00:04:33.950> to<00:04:34.070> be

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
function properly you need to be

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.950 
function properly you need to be
completely<00:04:34.670> hydrated<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.360> what<00:04:35.660> happens

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
completely hydrated and what happens

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.480 
completely hydrated and what happens
when<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.110> drink<00:04:36.260> alcohol<00:04:36.500> as<00:04:37.010> I've<00:04:37.160> learned

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
when you drink alcohol as I've learned

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.890 
when you drink alcohol as I've learned
since<00:04:37.820> making<00:04:38.090> this<00:04:38.270> vow<00:04:38.480> not<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.780> drink

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
since making this vow not to drink

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.260 
since making this vow not to drink
alcohol<00:04:39.230> is<00:04:39.680> that<00:04:41.110> your<00:04:42.110> liver<00:04:42.400> stops<00:04:43.400> taking

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
alcohol is that your liver stops taking

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.120 
alcohol is that your liver stops taking
the<00:04:44.600> fat<00:04:44.810> off<00:04:45.020> your<00:04:45.050> body<00:04:45.380> and<00:04:45.650> making<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:46.040> an

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
the fat off your body and making it an

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.820 
the fat off your body and making it an
energy<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.730> just<00:04:47.180> works<00:04:47.960> on<00:04:48.229> burning<00:04:48.650> off<00:04:48.800> the

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
energy it just works on burning off the

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.070 
energy it just works on burning off the
fats<00:04:49.250> from<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.700> alcohol<00:04:49.850> so<00:04:50.570> literally<00:04:51.050> you

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
fats from the alcohol so literally you

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.480 
fats from the alcohol so literally you
stop<00:04:51.680> burning<00:04:52.040> fat

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
stop burning fat

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.980 
stop burning fat
and<00:04:52.610> you<00:04:52.729> start<00:04:52.940> drinking<00:04:53.060> alcohol<00:04:53.599> because

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
and you start drinking alcohol because

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.809 
and you start drinking alcohol because
the<00:04:54.169> body<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:54.860> liver<00:04:55.069> literally<00:04:55.550> just<00:04:55.699> goes

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
the body the liver literally just goes

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.850 
the body the liver literally just goes
only<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.569> the<00:04:56.750> alcohol<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.349> is<00:04:57.440> just<00:04:57.560> trying

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
only to the alcohol and is just trying

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.950 
only to the alcohol and is just trying
to<00:04:58.009> pull<00:04:58.190> those<00:04:58.400> fats<00:04:58.729> and<00:04:59.030> burn<00:04:59.330> them<00:04:59.539> off<00:04:59.690> as

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
to pull those fats and burn them off as

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.659 
to pull those fats and burn them off as
quickly<00:05:00.169> as<00:05:00.349> possible<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:00.949> it's<00:05:01.430> a<00:05:01.460> double

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
quickly as possible and it's a double

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:02.980 
quickly as possible and it's a double
whammy<00:05:01.849> too<00:05:02.300> because<00:05:02.569> when<00:05:02.720> you<00:05:02.810> drink

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
whammy too because when you drink

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.960 
whammy too because when you drink
alcohol<00:05:03.139> then<00:05:04.039> you<00:05:04.430> also<00:05:04.580> get<00:05:04.819> dehydrated

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
alcohol then you also get dehydrated

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.510 
alcohol then you also get dehydrated
which<00:05:05.630> makes<00:05:05.870> your<00:05:06.080> kidneys<00:05:06.590> were<00:05:07.220> class

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
which makes your kidneys were class

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.309 
which makes your kidneys were class
which<00:05:07.849> makes<00:05:08.060> your<00:05:08.240> liver<00:05:08.449> work<00:05:08.870> way<00:05:09.050> less

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
which makes your liver work way less

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:10.719 
which makes your liver work way less
which<00:05:09.740> means<00:05:09.949> you're<00:05:10.069> not<00:05:10.190> even<00:05:10.400> burning<00:05:10.580> off

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
which means you're not even burning off

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.309 
which means you're not even burning off
the<00:05:10.759> fats<00:05:11.060> from<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.360> alcohol<00:05:11.479> so<00:05:12.139> not<00:05:12.289> only

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:12.319 
the fats from the alcohol so not only

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:13.570 
the fats from the alcohol so not only
are<00:05:12.530> you<00:05:12.620> not<00:05:12.710> burning<00:05:12.979> off<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.190> fats<00:05:13.460> from

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
are you not burning off the fats from

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.800 
are you not burning off the fats from
your<00:05:13.759> body<00:05:13.910> but<00:05:14.180> then<00:05:14.330> you're<00:05:14.449> adding<00:05:14.750> all

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
your body but then you're adding all

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.330 
your body but then you're adding all
these<00:05:14.930> extra<00:05:15.199> facet<00:05:15.620> your<00:05:15.710> liver<00:05:15.860> can't<00:05:16.160> burn

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
these extra facet your liver can't burn

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.249 
these extra facet your liver can't burn
off<00:05:16.460> because<00:05:16.759> you<00:05:16.849> dehydrated<00:05:17.300> it's<00:05:17.960> just<00:05:18.169> a

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
off because you dehydrated it's just a

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.770 
off because you dehydrated it's just a
big<00:05:19.130> show<00:05:19.370> it's<00:05:19.819> a<00:05:19.940> total<00:05:20.240> disaster<00:05:20.360> for

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
big show it's a total disaster for

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.680 
big show it's a total disaster for
weight<00:05:20.900> loss<00:05:21.080> so<00:05:22.000> that's<00:05:23.000> what<00:05:23.180> I<00:05:23.210> do<00:05:23.330> when<00:05:23.539> I'm

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
weight loss so that's what I do when I'm

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.610 
weight loss so that's what I do when I'm
depressed<00:05:23.840> and<00:05:24.199> it's<00:05:24.349> been<00:05:24.470> really

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
depressed and it's been really

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.249 
depressed and it's been really
interesting<00:05:25.360> I<00:05:26.360> suppose<00:05:26.720> to<00:05:26.990> make<00:05:27.110> the

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
interesting I suppose to make the

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.770 
interesting I suppose to make the
decision<00:05:27.620> not<00:05:27.650> to<00:05:27.889> go<00:05:28.159> that<00:05:28.520> place<00:05:29.030> even

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
decision not to go that place even

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.730 
decision not to go that place even
though<00:05:29.870> I'm<00:05:29.990> not<00:05:30.020> really<00:05:30.229> depressed<00:05:30.620> right

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
though I'm not really depressed right

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.980 
though I'm not really depressed right
now<00:05:30.800> it<00:05:31.130> just<00:05:31.190> it's<00:05:31.610> kind<00:05:32.090> of<00:05:32.270> part<00:05:32.509> of<00:05:32.659> my<00:05:32.750> life

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
now it just it's kind of part of my life

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.330 
now it just it's kind of part of my life
and<00:05:33.199> it<00:05:33.289> is<00:05:33.409> definitely<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:33.889> first<00:05:34.039> place<00:05:34.220> I

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
and it is definitely the first place I
