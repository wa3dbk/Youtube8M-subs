at the base of Masada and soon we all

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.770 
at the base of Masada and soon we all

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.100 
as we took the cable car to the top the
view<00:05:17.020> was<00:05:17.050> breathtaking<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:19.270> shape<00:05:19.660> of<00:05:19.990> the
