gonna show let's show you the old
boolean<00:00:16.109> tool<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.880> explain<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> bit<00:00:18.090> about

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
boolean tool and explain a bit about

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.900 
boolean tool and explain a bit about
what<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> means<00:00:18.930> are<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.520> balloons<00:00:20.520> are<00:00:20.670> very

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
what the means are and balloons are very

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.390 
what the means are and balloons are very
helpful<00:00:21.449> if<00:00:21.660> you've<00:00:21.900> got<00:00:22.170> two<00:00:22.680> objects<00:00:23.250> and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
helpful if you've got two objects and

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.960 
helpful if you've got two objects and
you'd<00:00:23.490> like<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.820> join<00:00:24.060> them<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.949> not<00:00:26.789> just

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
you'd like to join them and not just

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.990 
you'd like to join them and not just
join<00:00:27.210> them<00:00:27.390> into<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:28.199> object<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.730> actual

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
join them into one object but the actual

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.310 
join them into one object but the actual
mesh<00:00:31.189> joins<00:00:32.189> together<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.690> different<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
mesh joins together so it's different to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.619 
mesh joins together so it's different to
the<00:00:34.500> ctrl<00:00:35.040> J<00:00:37.399> shortcut<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:39.450> actually

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the ctrl J shortcut and it actually

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.450 
the ctrl J shortcut and it actually
joins<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.290> two<00:00:40.440> meshes<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:41.149> one<00:00:42.149> single

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
joins the two meshes as one single

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.060 
joins the two meshes as one single
object<00:00:44.989> now<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> other<00:00:46.379> thing<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.739> useful

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
object now the other thing it's useful

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.279 
object now the other thing it's useful
for<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.610> want<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.910> carve<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.600> shape<00:00:49.050> out

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
for is if you want to carve a shape out

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
for is if you want to carve a shape out
of<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.590> mish<00:00:49.829> using<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.329> shape<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
of one mish using the shape of a

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.400 
of one mish using the shape of a
completely<00:00:53.309> separate<00:00:53.760> mesh<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.199> I'll<00:00:55.260> show

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
completely separate mesh so I'll show

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.950 
completely separate mesh so I'll show
you<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> process<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:57.149> old<00:00:57.300> process<00:00:57.600> how

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you the process of the old process how

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
you the process of the old process how
it's<00:00:58.379> always<00:00:58.620> been<00:00:58.739> done<00:01:00.530> first<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.829> we

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
it's always been done first of all we

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.980 
it's always been done first of all we
create<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> cube<00:01:04.189> then<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.760> duplicate<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
create a cube then we duplicate that and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.620 
create a cube then we duplicate that and
we<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.260> another<00:01:07.619> cube<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.760> my<00:01:08.880> objective<00:01:09.390> is

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
we have another cube so my objective is

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.520 
we have another cube so my objective is
to<00:01:09.689> cut<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:11.220> cube<00:01:11.580> shape<00:01:11.850> out<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.260> cube

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
to cut this cube shape out of this cube

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.520 
to cut this cube shape out of this cube
shape<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> I'll<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.330> name<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:16.170> cube

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
shape so I'll have to name this cube

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.859 
shape so I'll have to name this cube
something<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.670> remember<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.299> cube

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
something that I can remember like cube

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.370 
something that I can remember like cube
to<00:01:19.290> select<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:21.299> first<00:01:21.509> cube<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.710> at<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
to select the first cube going at the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.120 
to select the first cube going at the
object<00:01:25.380> modifiers<00:01:26.450> go<00:01:27.450> over<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.130> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
object modifiers go over here to the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.690 
object modifiers go over here to the
lean<00:01:29.990> go<00:01:30.990> over<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.500> cube<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.820> select

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
lean go over here to cube to select

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.660 
lean go over here to cube to select
difference<00:01:35.700> then<00:01:36.540> press<00:01:36.869> apply<00:01:37.189> then<00:01:38.189> delete

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
difference then press apply then delete

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.590 
difference then press apply then delete
the<00:01:39.180> old<00:01:39.210> cube<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:41.250> our<00:01:41.700> new

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the old cube and then we have our new

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.889 
the old cube and then we have our new
mesh<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.880> as<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.180> tell<00:01:45.240> that's<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.689> very

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
mesh but as you can tell that's a very

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.100 
mesh but as you can tell that's a very
time-consuming<00:01:46.170> process<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:48.390> six<00:01:48.990> or

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
time-consuming process and it's six or

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.810 
time-consuming process and it's six or
seven<00:01:49.380> clicks<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.369> one<00:01:50.549> simple

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
seven clicks just to do one simple

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.359 
seven clicks just to do one simple
operation<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.689> you're<00:01:52.680> likely<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.189> doing

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
operation that you're likely to be doing

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.550 
operation that you're likely to be doing
fairly<00:01:53.729> often<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> new<00:01:55.320> Google

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
fairly often so with the new Google

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.380 
fairly often so with the new Google
plugin<00:01:56.040> I'll<00:01:56.490> explain<00:01:57.000> how<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:59.390> process

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
plugin I'll explain how that process

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.240 
plugin I'll explain how that process
becomes<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.780> whole<00:02:00.899> lot<00:02:01.079> quicker<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:02.040> we<00:02:02.070> go

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
becomes a whole lot quicker so we go

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.420 
becomes a whole lot quicker so we go
