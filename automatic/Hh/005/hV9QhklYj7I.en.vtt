think it matters that much either so ya

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.650 
think it matters that much either so ya
don't<00:02:09.690> say<00:02:10.590> anything<00:02:10.830> about<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.190> because

just doesn't really matter so wizard
knocks<00:02:16.560> out<00:02:16.800> ground<00:02:17.280> one<00:02:17.670> hey<00:02:17.850> that's<00:02:18.090> just

good<00:04:31.500> at<00:04:31.590> predicting<00:04:31.830> things<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.610> we<00:04:33.479> values

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
good at predicting things and we values

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.629 
good at predicting things and we values
his<00:04:33.990> night<00:04:34.169> /<00:04:34.470> on<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:35.360> dizzy<00:04:36.360> punch<00:04:37.639> does

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
his night / on it and dizzy punch does

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.170 
his night / on it and dizzy punch does
about<00:04:39.090> half<00:04:39.449> of<00:04:39.979> we<00:04:40.979> vowels<00:04:41.250> HP<00:04:41.789> right<00:04:41.940> there

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
about half of we vowels HP right there

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.920 
about half of we vowels HP right there
which<00:04:42.330> is<00:04:42.360> not<00:04:42.810> good<00:04:44.060> courser<00:04:45.060> uses<00:04:45.360> avalanche

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
which is not good courser uses avalanche

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.680 
which is not good courser uses avalanche
and<00:04:46.289> I<00:04:46.979> use<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.759> on<00:04:47.820> meet<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.210> just<00:04:48.419> in<00:04:48.509> case<00:04:48.539> I

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
and I use it on meet you just in case I

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.129 
and I use it on meet you just in case I
had<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:48.930> sash<00:04:49.229> but<00:04:50.660> unfortunately<00:04:51.660> it

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
had a sash but unfortunately it

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.469 
had a sash but unfortunately it
protected<00:04:52.680> itself<00:04:52.949> but<00:04:53.699> at<00:04:53.940> least<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.270> hail

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
protected itself but at least the hail

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.200 
protected itself but at least the hail
knocked<00:04:54.870> out<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.380> possibility<00:04:56.370> of<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:56.970> sash

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
knocked out the possibility of a sash

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.249 
knocked out the possibility of a sash
now<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.810> don't<00:04:57.900> worry<00:04:58.349> about<00:04:58.410> that<00:04:59.630> so<00:05:00.630> then

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
now so I don't worry about that so then

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.710 
now so I don't worry about that so then
michi<00:05:01.740> goes<00:05:01.919> for<00:05:02.070> another<00:05:02.160> protect<00:05:02.699> and<00:05:03.000> yeah

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
really one hit because the hail did a

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.490 
really one hit because the hail did a
little<00:05:14.940> damage<00:05:15.180> but<00:05:15.389> pretty<00:05:15.960> close<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.349> one

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
little damage but pretty close to one

the<00:05:19.289> life<00:05:19.440> orb<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:19.889> then<00:05:20.280> Kangaskhan<00:05:20.820> goes<00:05:21.030> to

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
the life orb and then Kangaskhan goes to

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.219 
the life orb and then Kangaskhan goes to
the<00:05:21.300> dizzy<00:05:21.599> punch<00:05:21.840> and<00:05:22.110> that<00:05:22.199> was<00:05:22.380> ah<00:05:23.060> no

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.469 
the dizzy punch and that was ah no
useless<00:05:25.229> critical<00:05:25.710> there<00:05:25.860> but<00:05:26.099> still<00:05:26.479> not

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
useless critical there but still not

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.899 
useless critical there but still not
good<00:05:27.750> because<00:05:27.930> now<00:05:28.080> we're<00:05:28.830> down<00:05:28.979> one<00:05:29.520> on<00:05:29.669> one

core<00:05:30.270> services<00:05:30.630> kangaskhan<00:05:31.260> but<00:05:31.440> then<00:05:31.560> i<00:05:31.590> was

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
core services kangaskhan but then i was

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.790 
core services kangaskhan but then i was
thinking<00:05:32.070> wait<00:05:32.990> king<00:05:33.990> is<00:05:34.110> gone<00:05:34.320> is<00:05:34.530> pretty

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
thinking wait king is gone is pretty

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.860 
thinking wait king is gone is pretty
much<00:05:34.919> all<00:05:35.159> been<00:05:35.520> doing<00:05:35.760> physical<00:05:36.270> attacks<00:05:36.570> and

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
much all been doing physical attacks and

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.899 
much all been doing physical attacks and
cloister<00:05:37.080> is<00:05:37.289> one<00:05:37.530> of<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.680> highest<00:05:37.909> physical

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
cloister is one of the highest physical

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.120 
cloister is one of the highest physical
defenses<00:05:39.330> in<00:05:39.449> the<00:05:39.570> game<00:05:39.780> i<00:05:39.960> was<00:05:40.020> like<00:05:40.199> i<00:05:40.409> think

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
defenses in the game i was like i think

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.740 
defenses in the game i was like i think
i<00:05:41.340> got<00:05:41.490> this<00:05:41.699> when<00:05:41.880> I<00:05:41.940> saw<00:05:42.180> how<00:05:42.270> much<00:05:42.360> damage

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
i got this when I saw how much damage

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.629 
i got this when I saw how much damage
avalanche<00:05:43.320> it<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:43.830> thinking<00:05:44.190> I<00:05:44.310> was<00:05:44.430> only

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
avalanche it and thinking I was only

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.240 
avalanche it and thinking I was only
half<00:05:44.880> power<00:05:45.180> I<00:05:45.510> was<00:05:46.169> like<00:05:46.289> I<00:05:46.470> think<00:05:46.530> I<00:05:46.889> got<00:05:47.070> this

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
half power I was like I think I got this

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.649 
half power I was like I think I got this
so<00:05:48.090> then<00:05:48.330> kangaskhan<00:05:49.199> uses<00:05:49.650> dizzy<00:05:49.979> punch<00:05:50.250> and

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659 
so then kangaskhan uses dizzy punch and

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.570 
so then kangaskhan uses dizzy punch and
does<00:05:51.659> next<00:05:52.560> to<00:05:52.680> nothing<00:05:53.010> the<00:05:53.130> cloister

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
does next to nothing the cloister

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.719 
does next to nothing the cloister
because<00:05:53.880> he<00:05:54.240> has<00:05:54.330> such<00:05:54.599> high<00:05:54.840> defenses<00:05:55.729> just

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
because he has such high defenses just

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.820 
because he has such high defenses just
like<00:05:56.880> shrugs<00:05:57.330> it<00:05:57.510> off<00:05:57.659> then<00:05:58.320> cochise's

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
like shrugs it off then cochise's

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.560 
like shrugs it off then cochise's
avalanche<00:05:59.340> it<00:05:59.490> now<00:05:59.580> this<00:05:59.729> is<00:05:59.820> a<00:05:59.849> double<00:06:00.210> power

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
avalanche it now this is a double power

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.200 
avalanche it now this is a double power
which<00:06:00.870> is<00:06:01.020> 120<00:06:01.830> and<00:06:02.010> it's<00:06:02.729> like<00:06:02.880> the<00:06:02.970> power

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210
