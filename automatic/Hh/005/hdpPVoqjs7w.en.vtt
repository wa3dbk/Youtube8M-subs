00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.730
 draw in the madrigal between the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.950
 villarreal and the real betis football in 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.320
 an end of the game completely crazy 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.879
 and what point was it to give the first 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.279
 victory at home of all the 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.140
 season to the green and white team in the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.090
 first part began stronger the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.730
 villarreal playing at home and with this 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.430
 good occasion that antonio adam sent to 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.619
 corner kick good first 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.900
 intervention for the goalkeeper of the real 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.149
 Betis Balompié Betis came after 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.949
 have won in tartar on russia at 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.120
 rubin kazan and to qualify for 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.910
 eighth finals of the uefa europa 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.649
 league in which you look at serving in the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.240
 Great Andalusian derby of the big gray 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.340
 sevillian 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.680
 first performance for the betis for the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.540
 humberto calderón team with that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.180
 Leo Baptistao shot without problems 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.900
 for sergio asenjo in the first part 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.670
 few things happened 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.770
 many more things happened in the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.350
 second part especially because I enter the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.110
 grain to the game oliver towers together with 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.640
 the two changes today we see oliver towers 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.160
 combining with the Virginian to his 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.060
 shot went too high without 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.740
 problems 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.930
 for antonio adam they were the best 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.080
 minutes of a villarreal that began 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.230
 be a steamroller the Betis and suffering 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.590
 the fatigue of the long journey to 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.380
 russia no doubt another plus a Czech inside 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.240
 from the girl javi area that had entered into 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.280
 the second part makes the mistake of 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.830
 put the leg a very political action 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.410
 because it seems like the repetition that ends 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.510
 touching the ball before the Nigerian 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.050
 Uche here are not seen as outside 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.110
 game 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.360
 and later in this play by the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.060
 direction that the small ball starts 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.100
 gives the impression that he touches the ball without 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.330
 However, the referee points out the penalty and 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.420
 marked with that bruno paradinha 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.340
 in the 71st minute of the match the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.350
 villarreal came to clearly dominate the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.390
 encounter was even close to scoring 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.270
 the second but in the end an action 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.280
 also from uche was going to change the sign 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.750
 of the match 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.390
 and it came to carrying three matches 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.180
 consecutive the betis without scoring goal in 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.740
 league great personal action of cedric al 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.050
 final when I had everything in favor for 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.590
 sending the ball to the area took too long 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.180
 and the play ended in a corner 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.250
 today we are going to continue that the suit that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.599
 makes the Brazilian Gabriel miss 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.010
 the ball below the legs the 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.010
 Extremely fast Betis 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.510
 however the most important action was 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.700
 tonight he makes a mistake lifts the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.530
 legs when before he had touched the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.939
 ball just running over no no and the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.219
 referee teaches them on a card 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.499
 yellow and he expels the villarreal 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:46.260
 would end the game with 10 men 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:48.490
 when there were about 11 minutes left 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.990
 end the meeting 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.310
 a check had done everything had 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.500
 caused the penalty and had been 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.000
 expelled and the betis improved began to 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.830
 corral the villarreal and in a great 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.320
 center of didac vilà brand is always worth 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.720
 Rubén Castro who has noticed the five 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.810
 last goals in the league of the real betis 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.920
 football in minute 85 of encounter 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.920
 tied the green and white team 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.360
 what a great forward rubén castro that 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.580
 continues to mark the differences within 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.319
 the area was already to brian rodríguez and 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.510
 the tall Uruguayan striker does not wear 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.610
 that ball if it did rubén castro that 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.390
 He was able to beat his son with that 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.390
 great header 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.380
 and the betis was very close to winning the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.980
 Great match at this time 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.330
 for jordi figueras his shot to the average 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.970
 lap ended on a corner kick 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.250
 there we see how a player touches the 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.260
 villarreal to save the situation more 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.910
 for the betis this time is brian 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.640
 rodríguez from which he tops too much 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.280
 when he was asenjo he could not even 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.680
 move he is from huachipato that he 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.240
 He had his hands to his head in a 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.010
 great opportunity for the betis and not 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.420
 it would be the last one but yes the 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.230
 villarreal could also take the 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.060
 match 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.870
 oliver towers that assistance was invented 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.020
 for yoani the saints and notice the 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.850
 masterful intervention of antonio adam 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.650
 and congratulations from Jordi 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.110
 Fig trees in one of the stops of the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.580
 day but the best stop 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.960
 impressive the former goalkeeper of the real 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.820
 madrid and mayor of italian 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.380
 but if the Villarreal could also win 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.910
 of course the betis 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.000
 cedric who sent that ball to the area 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.620
 notice the one that had the day and asenjo that 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.350
 saved the furniture when the day 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.480
 cabecea go to pleasure end of the game 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.670
 really dramatic for the betis who 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.500
 I was looking for victory to have more 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.110
 hopes in the struggle for salvation 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.020
 in the end the result was not left 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.020
 happy nobody real life 1 betis 1
