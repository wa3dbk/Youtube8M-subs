00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:14.630
 we will install the control system of 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.400
 water level made by inter 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.850
 it's a very simple circuit 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.180
 works the way the buoy goes 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.180
 going up 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.040
 the processor is doing readings and goes 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.510
 marking a book of the mother looks at arriving 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:42.949
 the maximum level would be the last led and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:46.940
 switch off the engine and 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.940
 consequently will teach 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:05.340
 By the time you reach the minimum level you 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:08.340
 connect another twin-engine minimum level and so 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 successively 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.950
 is a very bad and effective being 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:26.340
 the advantage cabral is enough 2 of it 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:29.710
 get out of the sensor buoy and go 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.300
 command then I can take advantage of fiuk 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:39.240
 usually until installing the key boy 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:47.979
 the sensor is very simple 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:50.619
 in case here is a retweet placed 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.050
 strategically here in the case was done 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.970
 with a box of 65 centimeters 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:03.520
 10 last placed on the lip maputo 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:05.860
 medium but this can be done a size 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.229
 as necessary 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.290
 the one-inch barrel with the cap on 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:23.069
 to enter and that's it inside the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:29.800
 box and here the buoy beret 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:32.650
 she has a 100 year old face of a 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.790
 inch a quarter to run over 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.260
 one inch 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:42.300
 she has 13 but minimal neodi fixed on her 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:47.440
 of national strategic sensors 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:50.190
 so that it does not fail and has 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.190
 a very low cost 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.160
 the system for a while 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.640
 lion display the processor that has a 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:07.890
 software to do this it has a 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.349
 because on this battery because 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.440
 let the buoy weave in the middle of two 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.420
 sensors that is not readable 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.230
 is in the middle of two sensors ended up 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.019
 energy will know more where the box 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.190
 is that it makes the software 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:29.610
 It makes the engine work is the time to get 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.330
 in one of the ten of them already understands 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.640
 and stores but for this not happen 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.120
 there is a battery that can 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.299
 power for up to 24 hours 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.349
 one would keep the system in 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.349
 perfect operation 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:55.680
 this system that I'll be there he 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.489
 today after installed 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.489
 I tell 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:11.209
 talk is that the pump control box 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.450
 simply was turned on 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:18.769
 if what came from the buoy key already 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:25.700
 It was used existing himself and liver 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:27.740
 with automatic sensor of automatic k 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:33.350
 bomb 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:35.450
 It worked perfect, I already tested it by dialing 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:40.160
 that the box is with 400 liters of water 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:44.080
 and it really is 400 thousand per hour 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.080
 they reach the minimum level me
