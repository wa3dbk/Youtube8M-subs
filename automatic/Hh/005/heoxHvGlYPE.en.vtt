00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
if that's it guys let's get into it now

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.910 
if that's it guys let's get into it now
this<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.600> actually<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> hackers<00:00:34.710> did

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
this is actually what the hackers did

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.790 
this is actually what the hackers did
find<00:00:35.160> inside<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> source<00:00:35.820> code<00:00:36.090> BAM<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:37.140> see

the<00:00:57.870> hacker<00:00:58.079> who<00:00:58.289> actually<00:00:58.469> found<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.100> so

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the hacker who actually found this so

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.520 
the hacker who actually found this so
this<00:00:59.460> isn't<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> exact<00:01:00.210> same<00:01:00.539> area<00:01:00.989> where<00:01:01.469> you

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
this isn't the exact same area where you

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.470 
this isn't the exact same area where you
store<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.010> stats<00:01:02.550> now<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.300> you're<00:01:03.449> not

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
store your stats now if you're not

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.270 
store your stats now if you're not
familiar<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:04.110> how<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.439> actually<00:01:04.619> works<00:01:05.129> if

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
familiar if how that actually works if

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.440 
familiar if how that actually works if
you're<00:01:05.400> playing<00:01:05.580> Grand<00:01:05.939> Theft<00:01:06.030> Auto<00:01:06.299> online

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
there's actually a whole section you

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.320 
there's actually a whole section you
know<00:01:08.549> when<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.700> press<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> start<00:01:09.270> button

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
know when you press the start button

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
know when you press the start button
there's<00:01:09.659> tab<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.140> stats<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:10.950> your

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
there's tab this is stats and as your

career stats your skills your general

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.260 
career stats your skills your general
your<00:01:13.290> crimes<00:01:13.619> your<00:01:13.890> cash<00:01:14.130> everything<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.119> can

your crimes your cash everything you can

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.789 
your crimes your cash everything you can
basically<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.259> actually

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
basically think of is actually

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.380 
basically think of is actually
underneath<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.310> tab<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.850> mean<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.090> goes<00:01:18.240> as

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
underneath that tab I mean it goes as

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.969 
underneath that tab I mean it goes as
far<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:18.750> saying<00:01:18.960> how<00:01:19.020> many<00:01:19.080> hookers<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.530> slept

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
far as saying how many hookers you slept

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.410 
far as saying how many hookers you slept
with<00:01:20.189> how<00:01:20.369> much<00:01:20.520> money<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> spent<00:01:21.270> on

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
with how much money you spent on

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.450 
with how much money you spent on
vehicles<00:01:22.080> how<00:01:22.259> much<00:01:22.409> time<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.770> spent<00:01:23.040> running

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
vehicles how much time you spent running

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.730 
vehicles how much time you spent running
so<00:01:24.000> why<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:25.020> something<00:01:25.500> that's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
so why not have something that's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.340 
so why not have something that's
dedicated<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.460> these<00:01:26.880> lottery<00:01:27.299> tickets<00:01:27.780> now

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
dedicated to these lottery tickets now

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.569 
dedicated to these lottery tickets now
if<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.590> all<00:01:28.650> look<00:01:28.890> at<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.040> coding<00:01:29.340> member<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
if you all look at the coding member the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.760 
if you all look at the coding member the
coding<00:01:29.820> does<00:01:29.970> say<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.570> lottery<00:01:31.049> tickets<00:01:31.470> spot

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
coding does say the lottery tickets spot

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.679 
coding does say the lottery tickets spot
so<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> kind<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.579> makes<00:01:32.759> sense<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.210> it's

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
so the kind of makes sense because it's

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.749 
so the kind of makes sense because it's
keeping<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.259> stats<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.950> how<00:01:35.100> much<00:01:35.280> lottery

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
keeping the stats of how much lottery

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.310 
keeping the stats of how much lottery
tickets<00:01:36.030> you've<00:01:36.150> bought<00:01:36.479> since<00:01:36.810> your<00:01:36.930> GTA

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
tickets you've bought since your GTA
