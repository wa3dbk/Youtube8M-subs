things<00:00:40.650> about<00:00:40.800> Champa<00:00:41.220> one<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.640> who<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.420> he<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
things about Champa one is who is he to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.320 
things about Champa one is who is he to
pearance<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.650> second<00:00:44.040> thing<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.640> who<00:00:45.210> is

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
pearance and the second thing is who is

stronger Champa or beerus a lot of

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.400 
stronger Champa or beerus a lot of
people<00:00:48.690> wonder<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> same<00:00:49.080> thing<00:00:49.140> who's

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
people wonder the same thing who's

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.290 
people wonder the same thing who's
stronger<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:49.980> we're<00:00:50.550> no<00:00:50.730> stronger<00:00:51.180> because

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
stronger so we're no stronger because

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.450 
stronger so we're no stronger because
again<00:00:51.690> nothing<00:00:52.440> been<00:00:52.530> released<00:00:52.830> yet<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.250> only

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
again nothing been released yet the only

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.860 
again nothing been released yet the only
thing<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.700> saw<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.090> far<00:00:54.120> was<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.600> among<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
thing we saw so far was this in among a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.049 
thing we saw so far was this in among a
little<00:00:55.200> quick<00:00:55.440> preview<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.739> Champa<00:00:56.130> but<00:00:56.399> I'm

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
gonna do a prediction of who I think is

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.540 
gonna do a prediction of who I think is
strong<00:00:58.470> and<00:00:58.590> why<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.800> think<00:00:59.130> who's<00:00:59.219> stronger

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
strong and why I think who's stronger

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.430 
strong and why I think who's stronger
and<00:00:59.790> who<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.000> think<00:01:00.300> should<00:01:00.360> inform<00:01:00.600> ib2<00:01:00.840> beerus

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and who I think should inform ib2 beerus

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.860 
and who I think should inform ib2 beerus
now<00:01:02.100> let's<00:01:02.340> talk<00:01:02.460> about<00:01:02.520> who<00:01:02.880> is<00:01:02.910> stronger<00:01:03.660> so

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
now let's talk about who is stronger so

he might be afraid saying oh crap man
more<00:01:24.000> beers<00:01:24.210> notice<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.649> there's

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
more beers notice I'm here so there's

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.130 
more beers notice I'm here so there's
two<00:01:26.160> thing<00:01:26.429> right<00:01:26.610> there<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.840> could<00:01:28.050> be

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
two thing right there but it could be

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.300 
two thing right there but it could be
the<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.289> it<00:01:28.619> could<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.800> that<00:01:28.890> he's<00:01:29.009> plotting

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the a it could be that he's plotting

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.699 
the a it could be that he's plotting
something<00:01:29.520> against<00:01:30.030> beerus<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:31.229> when<00:01:31.619> it

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:31.709 
something against beerus now when it

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:32.570 
something against beerus now when it
comes<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.979> strength

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
comes to strength

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.389 
comes to strength
I<00:01:32.610> believe<00:01:33.179> that<00:01:33.660> Champa<00:01:34.560> might<00:01:35.039> be<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
I believe that Champa might be the

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.969 
I believe that Champa might be the
stronger<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.970> compared<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.750> beers<00:01:37.259> why

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
stronger one compared to beers why

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.430 
stronger one compared to beers why
because<00:01:38.399> two<00:01:38.610> reasons<00:01:38.759> one<00:01:39.270> why<00:01:39.840> would<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.200> cure

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
because two reasons one why would a cure

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.430 
because two reasons one why would a cure
trauma<00:01:40.860> bring<00:01:41.670> another<00:01:42.090> God<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.690> beers<00:01:43.289> is

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
trauma bring another God if beers is

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.919 
trauma bring another God if beers is
always<00:01:43.679> stronger<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.160> him<00:01:44.340> I'll<00:01:45.179> finish<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.780> on

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
always stronger in him I'll finish up on

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.180 
always stronger in him I'll finish up on
might<00:01:46.050> be<00:01:46.140> stronger<00:01:46.440> just<00:01:46.709> on<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> hit<00:01:47.069> go

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
might be stronger just on the hit go
