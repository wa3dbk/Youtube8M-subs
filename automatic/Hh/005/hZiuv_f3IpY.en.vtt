is the top three players who i think are
going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.640> most<00:00:47.760> important<00:00:48.239> for

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
going to be the most important for

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.049 
going to be the most important for
liverpool<00:00:48.719> next<00:00:49.649> season<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.760> starting

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
liverpool next season and we starting

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.700 
liverpool next season and we starting
off<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.390> front<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.840> daniel<00:00:52.140> sturridge<00:00:52.500> now

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
off up front with daniel sturridge now

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.439 
off up front with daniel sturridge now
obviously<00:00:53.190> i<00:00:53.489> could<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:53.969> gone<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.120> Suarez

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
obviously i could have gone with Suarez

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.700 
obviously i could have gone with Suarez
but<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.750> don't<00:00:54.960> know<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.199> he's<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> stay

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
but I don't know if he's going to stay

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.470 
but I don't know if he's going to stay
so<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:55.980> pointless<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.969> think<00:00:57.030> storage

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
so it's pointless and I think storage

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.729 
so it's pointless and I think storage
will<00:00:57.600> start<00:00:57.840> every<00:00:58.020> game<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.199> us<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:58.620> he's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
will start every game for us when he's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.650 
will start every game for us when he's
fit<00:00:58.949> again<00:00:59.190> these<00:00:59.760> are<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.030> stats<00:01:00.210> I've<00:01:00.390> given

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
fit again these are the stats I've given

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.119 
fit again these are the stats I've given
him<00:01:00.750> 90<00:01:01.230> pace<00:01:01.410> 85<00:01:02.100> dribble<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.550> 81<00:01:03.210> shot<00:01:04.129> 45

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
him 90 pace 85 dribble in 81 shot 45

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.609 
him 90 pace 85 dribble in 81 shot 45
defense<00:01:06.030> 76<00:01:06.540> head<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.900> saintly<00:01:07.170> two<00:01:07.350> paths

defense 76 head and saintly two paths

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.410 
defense 76 head and saintly two paths
and<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.010> think<00:01:08.280> they're<00:01:08.460> decent<00:01:08.820> stats<00:01:09.030> really

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and I think they're decent stats really

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.690 
and I think they're decent stats really
it<00:01:09.689> deserves<00:01:10.140> those<00:01:10.409> sort<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.770> stats<00:01:11.070> he's<00:01:11.580> not

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it deserves those sort of stats he's not

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
it deserves those sort of stats he's not
a<00:01:11.729> good<00:01:11.970> season<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.420> liverpool<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.080> season

a good season for liverpool this season

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
a good season for liverpool this season
I<00:01:13.850> wouldn't<00:01:14.850> say<00:01:15.150> he's<00:01:16.020> had<00:01:16.580> an<00:01:17.580> incredible

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
I wouldn't say he's had an incredible

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.910 
I wouldn't say he's had an incredible
season<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:19.020> he's<00:01:19.229> only<00:01:19.350> been<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.619> for

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.679 
season because he's only been here for
half<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.100> season<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.939> what<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.390> seen<00:01:21.630> from

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
think he got 10 10 goals in in one half

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.940 
think he got 10 10 goals in in one half
of<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> season<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.689> if<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.290> put<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.560> half

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
of the season so if you put that half

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.440 
of the season so if you put that half
and<00:01:53.130> off<00:01:53.189> together<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:53.610> he<00:01:53.700> gets<00:01:53.909> 20<00:01:54.180> goals<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and off together if he gets 20 goals a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.810 
and off together if he gets 20 goals a
season<00:01:54.680> that's<00:01:55.680> what<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.520> want<00:01:56.670> your

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.650 
scored quite a few go while saying quite
a<00:03:09.410> few<00:03:09.560> but<00:03:09.680> he<00:03:09.739> scored<00:03:09.980> goals<00:03:10.280> Annie<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.330> I

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
a few but he scored goals Annie and I

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.449 
a few but he scored goals Annie and I
think<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.080> was<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.230> top<00:03:12.410> three<00:03:12.739> assists<00:03:13.160> in<00:03:13.310> the

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
think it was a top three assists in the

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.460 
think it was a top three assists in the
league<00:03:13.489> as<00:03:13.790> well<00:03:13.970> so<00:03:14.330> he's<00:03:14.810> still<00:03:15.080> got<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.380> he's

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
league as well so he's still got it he's

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.600 
league as well so he's still got it he's
still<00:03:15.650> got<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.769> past<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.160> he<00:03:16.220> still<00:03:16.400> got<00:03:16.519> the

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
still got the past and he still got the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.259 
still got the past and he still got the
shooting<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:18.440> an<00:03:18.980> 84<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.640> stay<00:03:19.820> before<00:03:20.060> I
