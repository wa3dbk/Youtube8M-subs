00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.470
 since the manufacture of the first 3 56 in 1948 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.200
 has been evolving permanently as it relates to the construction of its 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.089
 cars 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:16.279
 the plant per cent was originally located in the world and only in 1950 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.230
 he moved to the stuttgart where he would definitely stay 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.369
 in 1972 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.180
 There was a new incorporation in the facilities since the 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.179
 Development center for 70 islands 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.040
 porsche has been introducing advanced technology in its models since 1949 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.620
 since in the same 3 56 it had aluminum bodywork 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.750
 ocp unthinkable for that time 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.280
 in 1951 by incorporating synchronization rings into its gearbox 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.470
 a system that means more than 100 patents 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.990
 for 1962 the 3 56 d counts as optional with three seat belt 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.390
 stitches and blocking of seat backs 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.260
 while it is only two years later it is manufactured in 904 with bodywork 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.860
 of plastic and a cx desire point 33 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.240
 the design to the 911 targa would change the conception of the cabriolets 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.380
 Being more secure and comfortable 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.910
 security also mattered and in 1966 the first crash-test was carried out on 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.910
 your partner a center with a porsche 904 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.830
 while at the same time a test bench was opened for 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 control the resignation of engines 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.450
 for 1986 by the opening of the wind tunnel in the fishing plant in scale 1 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.710
 in one 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.909
 in regard to the assembly of the cars according to the senator a lot since the 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.230
 first porsche 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.690
 armed more 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.100
 Each foot will be mounted and controlled manually and even the engines will be 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.560
 they tested the test benches one by one 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.710
 to be placed in the cars later 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.810
 following with innovations 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.139
 in the year 1972 he marked the first side castes calls for gaps 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.999
 with a 911 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:16.969
 and one year later 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.030
 already has its own test bench for crash test 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:26.060
 with regard to technological innovations in 1974 the porsche 911 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:31.059
 turbo becomes the first series car to be manufactured with engine 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.059
 supercharged by turbo compressor 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.329
 in terms of manufacturing figures, it stands out that it has gone from 10 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:45.259
 units manufactured in 1948 up to 32 thousand that are built today 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:50.559
 In addition, the boxster is manufactured in Germany and in Finland 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:56.579
