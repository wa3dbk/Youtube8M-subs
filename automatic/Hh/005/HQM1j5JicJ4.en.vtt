or a drill bit if you have one just be

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.889 
or a drill bit if you have one just be
very<00:01:01.859> careful<00:01:02.129> with<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.789> once<00:01:03.690> you're

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
very careful with it and once you're

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.299 
very careful with it and once you're
done<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> end<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.129> looking

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
done it's going to end up looking

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.899 
done it's going to end up looking
something<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.580> that's<00:01:08.580> where

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
something like this and that's where

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.170 
something like this and that's where
we're<00:01:09.150> gonna<00:01:09.210> place<00:01:09.540> our<00:01:09.750> LED<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.790> we<00:01:11.790> found

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
we're gonna place our LED and we found

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.660 
we're gonna place our LED and we found
one<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.110> these<00:01:13.260> things<00:01:13.530> they're<00:01:13.770> called<00:01:14.100> LED

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
one of these things they're called LED

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.999 
one of these things they're called LED
holders<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.420> they<00:01:15.900> prevent<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.439> LED<00:01:16.770> from

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
holders and they prevent the LED from

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.010 
holders and they prevent the LED from
going<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:18.119> place<00:01:18.150> whenever<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
going in or out of place whenever you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
going in or out of place whenever you
have<00:01:19.380> them<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.710> place<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.880> place<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.330> of

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
have them in place so we place one of

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.600 
have them in place so we place one of
those<00:01:21.600> inside<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.229> our<00:01:22.350> new<00:01:22.470> hole<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.009> that's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
those inside of our new hole and that's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.950 
those inside of our new hole and that's
going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> prevent<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> LED<00:01:24.570> from<00:01:24.780> moving

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
going to prevent the LED from moving

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.719 
going to prevent the LED from moving
around<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.130> gonna<00:01:26.250> look<00:01:26.490> something

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
around and it's gonna look something

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.179 
around and it's gonna look something
similar<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.720> when<00:01:27.930> you're<00:01:28.049> done<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
similar to this when you're done the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
similar to this when you're done the
next<00:01:29.400> step<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.210> cut<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> small<00:01:30.630> hole<00:01:30.810> into

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
next step is to cut a small hole into

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.410 
next step is to cut a small hole into
the<00:01:31.439> top<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.680> your<00:01:31.979> all<00:01:32.130> tied<00:01:32.369> box<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.210> can

with the project except is grabbing your
battery<00:01:57.540> holder<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.770> we're<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.100> place

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
battery holder and we're going to place

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.609 
battery holder and we're going to place
both<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.969> batteries<00:02:00.360> inside<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
both of the batteries inside of the

both of the batteries inside of the
battery<00:02:01.890> holder<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.570> end<00:02:03.750> up

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
battery holder so it's going to end up

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.959 
battery holder so it's going to end up
looking<00:02:04.049> something<00:02:04.439> similar<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.399> that's

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
looking something similar to this that's

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.559 
looking something similar to this that's
going<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.210> give<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.479> six<00:02:06.719> volts<00:02:07.170> total<00:02:08.569> the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
cause the batteries to overheat so once

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.770 
cause the batteries to overheat so once
you<00:02:40.010> have<00:02:40.220> this<00:02:40.430> covered<00:02:40.700> it's<00:02:41.420> going<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.630> look

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
you have this covered it's going to look

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.259 
you have this covered it's going to look
something<00:02:41.959> similar<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.739> this<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:46.030> that's<00:02:47.030> it

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
something similar to this and that's it

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.550 
something similar to this and that's it
for<00:02:47.480> your<00:02:47.599> battery<00:02:47.959> your<00:02:48.140> batteries<00:02:48.530> should

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
for your battery your batteries should

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.220 
for your battery your batteries should
be<00:02:48.860> done<00:02:49.069> now<00:02:50.030> we<00:02:50.090> can<00:02:50.450> go<00:02:50.630> ahead<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.049> solder

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
be done now we can go ahead and solder

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.979 
be done now we can go ahead and solder
all<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.650> our<00:02:51.739> connections<00:02:52.190> together<00:02:52.430> now<00:02:53.299> this

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
all of our connections together now this

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.650 
all of our connections together now this
is<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.290> schematic<00:02:54.650> for<00:02:54.980> our<00:02:55.579> project<00:02:56.120> as<00:02:56.239> you

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
is a schematic for our project as you

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.620 
is a schematic for our project as you
can<00:02:56.810> see<00:02:56.989> it<00:02:57.079> goes<00:02:57.260> from<00:02:57.380> led<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:58.160> 120<00:02:58.730> ohm<00:02:58.940> go

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
can see it goes from led to 120 ohm go

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.420 
can see it goes from led to 120 ohm go
into<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.019> battery<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.590> then<00:03:01.040> onto<00:03:01.280> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
into the battery and then onto the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.479 
into the battery and then onto the
switch<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:01.970> then<00:03:02.060> back<00:03:02.239> on<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.780> LED<00:03:03.489> so

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
switch and then back on to the LED so

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.880 
switch and then back on to the LED so
the<00:03:05.000> first<00:03:05.660> step<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:05.959> we<00:03:06.200> have<00:03:06.349> to<00:03:06.470> do<00:03:06.590> is<00:03:06.739> go

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
the first step that we have to do is go

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.000 
the first step that we have to do is go
ahead<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.250> attach<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.480> 120<00:03:09.260> ohm<00:03:09.410> resistor

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
ahead and attach the 120 ohm resistor

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.620 
ahead and attach the 120 ohm resistor
onto<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:11.390> LED<00:03:11.810> holder<00:03:12.200> or<00:03:12.410> LED<00:03:13.360> when<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:14.480> get

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
onto the LED holder or LED when you get

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.490 
onto the LED holder or LED when you get
done<00:03:14.780> with<00:03:14.930> that<00:03:14.959> it's<00:03:15.200> going<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:15.380> look

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
done with that it's going to look

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.099 
done with that it's going to look
something<00:03:15.860> similar<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.489> this<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.930> should

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
something similar to this and you should

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.110 
something similar to this and you should
be<00:03:18.290> ready<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.829> go<00:03:19.010> that's<00:03:19.430> your<00:03:19.609> LED<00:03:19.970> and

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
be ready to go that's your LED and

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.220 
be ready to go that's your LED and
you're<00:03:20.239> not<00:03:20.420> going<00:03:20.569> to<00:03:20.630> have<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.930> mess<00:03:21.079> with

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
you're not going to have to mess with

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.949 
you're not going to have to mess with
that<00:03:21.380> anymore<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:22.400> next<00:03:22.670> step<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:23.120> going<00:03:23.840> to

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
that anymore the next step is going to

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.129 
that anymore the next step is going to
be<00:03:24.079> attaching<00:03:24.530> your<00:03:24.950> switch<00:03:25.780> onto<00:03:26.780> your

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
be attaching your switch onto your

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.110 
be attaching your switch onto your
switch<00:03:27.470> hole<00:03:27.709> now<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:28.609> could<00:03:28.760> have<00:03:28.880> been<00:03:28.940> on

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
switch hole now this could have been on

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.670 
switch hole now this could have been on
the<00:03:29.239> side<00:03:29.540> on<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:29.989> top<00:03:30.019> on<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.470> bottom

wherever<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.400> may<00:03:31.519> have<00:03:31.670> placed<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.299> you

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
wherever you may have placed it you

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.210 
wherever you may have placed it you
still<00:03:33.049> have<00:03:33.079> to<00:03:33.380> make<00:03:33.530> sure<00:03:33.650> that<00:03:33.799> your<00:03:33.950> switch

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
still have to make sure that your switch

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.530 
still have to make sure that your switch
is<00:03:34.400> going<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.609> be<00:03:34.760> sitting<00:03:35.150> there<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.329> it's

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
is going to be sitting there and it's

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.690 
is going to be sitting there and it's
not<00:03:35.660> going<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.930> be<00:03:35.989> moving<00:03:36.319> around<00:03:36.489> so<00:03:37.489> once

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
not going to be moving around so once

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.129 
not going to be moving around so once
you've<00:03:37.850> done<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.389> everything<00:03:38.540> cools<00:03:39.019> down

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
you've done and everything cools down

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.750 
you've done and everything cools down
it's<00:03:39.500> going<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.650> look<00:03:39.859> something<00:03:40.010> similar<00:03:40.220> to

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
it's going to look something similar to

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.490 
it's going to look something similar to
this<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.630> can<00:03:41.660> test<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.230> make<00:03:42.350> sure

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
this and you can test it to make sure

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.319 
this and you can test it to make sure
that<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:43.250> switch<00:03:43.370> is<00:03:43.639> moving<00:03:43.970> up<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.239> down

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
that the switch is moving up and down

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.449 
that the switch is moving up and down
softly<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.410> it's<00:03:45.560> not<00:03:45.709> getting<00:03:45.859> stuck<00:03:46.220> onto

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
softly and it's not getting stuck onto

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.970 
softly and it's not getting stuck onto
anything<00:03:47.410> after<00:03:48.410> you<00:03:48.500> get<00:03:48.650> done<00:03:48.739> with<00:03:48.950> that

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
anything after you get done with that

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.160 
anything after you get done with that
then<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.850> can<00:03:50.000> attach<00:03:50.389> one<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.930> leads

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
then you can attach one of the leads

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.330 
then you can attach one of the leads
onto<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:52.760> lead<00:03:53.000> of<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.420> LED<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:55.190> can

our battery and once you get done with

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.470 
our battery and once you get done with
that<00:04:06.470> it's<00:04:06.980> gonna<00:04:07.430> look<00:04:07.700> something<00:04:08.000> very

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
that it's gonna look something very

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.960 
that it's gonna look something very
similar<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:09.109> this<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.709> you<00:04:10.489> should<00:04:10.669> be<00:04:10.790> done

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
similar to this and you should be done

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.729 
similar to this and you should be done
with<00:04:11.150> that<00:04:11.299> aside<00:04:11.630> then<00:04:12.230> we're<00:04:12.380> going<00:04:12.620> to

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
with that aside then we're going to

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.699 
with that aside then we're going to
place<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.579> LED<00:04:14.209> inside<00:04:14.480> of<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.870> LED<00:04:15.290> holder

battery onto the resistor of our LED

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.370 
battery onto the resistor of our LED
then<00:04:22.610> we're<00:04:23.030> gonna<00:04:23.150> place<00:04:23.360> hot<00:04:23.690> glue<00:04:23.960> inside

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
then we're gonna place hot glue inside

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.600 
then we're gonna place hot glue inside
of<00:04:24.500> our<00:04:24.590> tin<00:04:24.830> can

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610

and we're going to place the battery on
top<00:04:27.770> of<00:04:28.009> the<00:04:28.189> hot<00:04:28.550> glue<00:04:28.819> so<00:04:29.030> we<00:04:29.120> can<00:04:29.300> stay

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
top of the hot glue so we can stay

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.790 
top of the hot glue so we can stay
around<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.110> it's<00:04:30.199> not<00:04:30.319> going<00:04:30.439> to<00:04:30.530> be<00:04:30.620> moving

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
around and it's not going to be moving

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.040 
around and it's not going to be moving
around<00:04:31.129> inside<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.639> the<00:04:31.729> box<00:04:31.939> and<00:04:32.240> it's<00:04:32.960> gonna

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
around inside of the box and it's gonna

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.279 
around inside of the box and it's gonna
look<00:04:33.289> something<00:04:33.710> very<00:04:33.979> similar<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.520> this<00:04:35.289> now

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
look something very similar to this now

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.170 
look something very similar to this now
once<00:04:36.919> you<00:04:37.069> get<00:04:37.219> done<00:04:37.400> with<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.610> you<00:04:37.939> can<00:04:38.090> go

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
once you get done with that you can go

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.110 
once you get done with that you can go
ahead<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.569> close<00:04:38.689> the<00:04:38.930> box<00:04:39.110> of<00:04:39.319> your<00:04:39.349> all<00:04:39.590> toys

ahead and close the box of your all toys
seal<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:41.270> so<00:04:41.479> it<00:04:41.599> won't<00:04:41.750> be<00:04:41.840> moving<00:04:42.050> around

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
seal it so it won't be moving around

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.469 
seal it so it won't be moving around
test<00:04:43.250> this<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.669> see<00:04:43.849> if<00:04:43.969> everything<00:04:44.389> is

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
test this to see if everything is

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.570 
test this to see if everything is
working<00:04:44.539> and<00:04:45.080> if<00:04:45.620> it<00:04:45.770> lights<00:04:45.979> and<00:04:46.340> you<00:04:46.430> know

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
working and if it lights and you know

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.279 
working and if it lights and you know
you<00:04:46.639> got<00:04:46.849> everything<00:04:47.120> right<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:47.719> that's<00:04:48.169> how

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
you got everything right and that's how

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:49.899 
you got everything right and that's how
you<00:04:48.409> make<00:04:48.590> an<00:04:48.830> Altoid

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909
