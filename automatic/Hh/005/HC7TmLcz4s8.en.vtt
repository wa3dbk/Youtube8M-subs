00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
I'm using our vo as a base and then I'm

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.060 
I'm using our vo as a base and then I'm
using<00:01:28.979> our<00:01:29.369> vo<00:01:29.640> -<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.930> outsides<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
of those flowers next I am using our vo

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.160 
of those flowers next I am using our vo
6<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> insides<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.430> those<00:01:38.700> flowers<00:01:39.240> so

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
6 for the insides of those flowers so

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.889 
6 for the insides of those flowers so
I'm<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.439> adding<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:41.159> layer<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.540> and

I'm just adding one layer of that and
then<00:01:43.200> I'm<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.680> add<00:01:43.979> some<00:01:44.310> shading<00:01:44.640> using

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
then I'm going to add some shading using

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.780 
then I'm going to add some shading using
our<00:01:45.840> V<00:01:46.049> o.9<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.920> I'm<00:01:47.040> not<00:01:47.280> blending<00:01:47.460> that

our V o.9 and I'm not blending that

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.960 
our V o.9 and I'm not blending that
together<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.420> time<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.670> otherwise<00:01:50.670> you

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
together this time because otherwise you

could<00:04:20.750> set<00:04:20.989> from<00:04:21.260> them<00:04:21.520> so<00:04:22.520> I'm<00:04:22.580> going<00:04:22.850> to<00:04:22.940> use

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
could set from them so I'm going to use

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.160 
could set from them so I'm going to use
those<00:04:23.479> two<00:04:23.930> die<00:04:24.320> cuts

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170

before<00:04:31.170> adhering<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:32.070> frame<00:04:33.800> so<00:04:34.800> I'm<00:04:34.980> just

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
before adhering the frame so I'm just

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.790 
before adhering the frame so I'm just
going<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.430> run<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:36.240> or<00:04:37.080> run<00:04:37.350> those<00:04:37.530> dice

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800

through<00:04:38.280> my<00:04:38.400> Big<00:04:38.610> Shot<00:04:38.640> machine<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:39.540> then<00:04:40.470> I

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
through my Big Shot machine and then I

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.980 
through my Big Shot machine and then I
grabbed<00:04:40.920> a<00:04:41.130> piece<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.670> fun<00:04:42.060> foam<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:42.630> it<00:04:42.750> also

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990

measures four inch by five inch and I
cut<00:04:46.500> a<00:04:46.530> hole<00:04:46.800> in<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.070> middle<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:47.610> can<00:04:47.880> go

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
cut a hole in the middle so I can go

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.980 
cut a hole in the middle so I can go
around<00:04:48.450> that<00:04:49.410> edge<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:50.160> create<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.940> really<00:04:51.420> thin

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
around that edge to create a really thin

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.650 
around that edge to create a really thin
frame<00:04:52.590> so<00:04:52.920> I<00:04:52.980> can<00:04:53.190> do<00:04:53.460> that<00:04:53.700> behind<00:04:54.210> my

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.850 
adhesive on the back of that frame so I
can<00:05:05.760> adhere<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.210> piece<00:05:06.570> of<00:05:06.750> acetate<00:05:06.990> this<00:05:07.710> is
