outlines that really make it pop out at

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.980 
outlines that really make it pop out at
you<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.790> make<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> feel<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.600> came<00:01:57.780> right

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
you to make it feel like it came right

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.680 
you to make it feel like it came right
out<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
out of the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.510 
out of the
the<00:01:59.690> detail<00:02:00.050> is<00:02:00.230> done<00:02:00.410> very<00:02:00.680> nicely<00:02:00.860> on<00:02:01.400> the

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
the detail is done very nicely on the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.310 
the detail is done very nicely on the
space<00:02:01.790> but<00:02:02.540> one<00:02:02.660> of<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.810> things<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.140> thought

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
space but one of the things I thought

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.500 
space but one of the things I thought
was<00:02:03.380> kind<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:03.830> strange<00:02:04.220> is<00:02:04.580> that<00:02:05.120> it<00:02:05.210> includes

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
was kind of strange is that it includes

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.410 
was kind of strange is that it includes
a<00:02:05.630> little<00:02:05.750> pink<00:02:06.200> now<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.130> mousers<00:02:07.670> don't<00:02:08.119> have

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
a little pink now the mousers don't have

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.990 
a little pink now the mousers don't have
peg<00:02:08.720> holes<00:02:08.930> in<00:02:09.080> their<00:02:09.229> feet<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:10.310> peg<00:02:10.850> is

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
peg holes in their feet so that peg is

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.730 
peg holes in their feet so that peg is
not<00:02:11.150> there<00:02:11.420> for<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.720> mousers<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.230> stand<00:02:12.530> on

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
not there for the mousers to stand on

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.590 
not there for the mousers to stand on
it's<00:02:13.550> pretty<00:02:13.760> obvious<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.330> this<00:02:14.540> is

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
it's pretty obvious that this is

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.390 
it's pretty obvious that this is
probably<00:02:15.020> just<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.680> same<00:02:15.920> base<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.310> is

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
probably just the same base that is

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.610 
probably just the same base that is
included<00:02:16.850> with<00:02:16.880> one<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.210> the<00:02:17.300> turtles<00:02:17.690> there

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
included with one of the turtles there

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.380 
included with one of the turtles there
also<00:02:18.800> isn't<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.280> spot<00:02:19.520> for<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> manhole<00:02:20.150> cover

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
also isn't a spot for the manhole cover

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.360 
also isn't a spot for the manhole cover
to<00:02:20.510> fit<00:02:20.720> but<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.260> does<00:02:21.410> just<00:02:21.680> sit<00:02:21.830> nicely<00:02:22.070> on

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
to fit but it does just sit nicely on

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.010 
to fit but it does just sit nicely on
top<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.880> looks<00:02:23.210> pretty<00:02:23.450> good<00:02:23.630> while<00:02:23.870> it's

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
top and looks pretty good while it's

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.780 
top and looks pretty good while it's
there<00:02:24.610> okay

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
there okay

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.550 
there okay
so<00:02:26.090> now<00:02:26.240> let's<00:02:26.510> take<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.780> look<00:02:26.960> at<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.170> actual

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
so now let's take a look at the actual

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.700 
so now let's take a look at the actual
figures<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:29.090> mousers<00:02:29.510> look<00:02:29.720> very<00:02:30.080> nice<00:02:30.380> the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
figures the mousers look very nice the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.920 
figures the mousers look very nice the
paint<00:02:30.980> job<00:02:31.250> is<00:02:31.460> flawless<00:02:32.210> and<00:02:32.420> they<00:02:32.600> again

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
paint job is flawless and they again

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.050 
paint job is flawless and they again
include<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.470> wonderful<00:02:34.130> detailing<00:02:34.730> that

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
include that wonderful detailing that

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.490 
include that wonderful detailing that
makes<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.480> look<00:02:35.690> like<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.020> popped<00:02:36.230> right<00:02:36.380> out

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
makes it look like it popped right out

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.640 
makes it look like it popped right out
of<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.740> comic<00:02:37.070> book<00:02:37.390> they<00:02:38.390> do<00:02:38.450> have<00:02:38.840> small

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
of a comic book they do have small

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.010 
of a comic book they do have small
amounts<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.070> articulation<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.480> heads<00:02:41.900> are

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
amounts of articulation the heads are

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.600 
amounts of articulation the heads are
ball<00:02:42.170> jointed<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:42.950> they<00:02:43.070> can<00:02:43.250> look<00:02:43.370> pretty

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
ball jointed so they can look pretty

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.030 
ball jointed so they can look pretty
much<00:02:43.760> all<00:02:43.910> around<00:02:44.240> which<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.570> really<00:02:44.810> nice<00:02:45.040> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
much all around which is really nice the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.280 
much all around which is really nice the
legs<00:02:46.280> however<00:02:46.700> only<00:02:47.120> seem<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.720> move<00:02:47.810> forwards

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
legs however only seem to move forwards

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.920 
legs however only seem to move forwards
and<00:02:48.470> backwards<00:02:49.240> Nick<00:02:50.240> probably<00:02:50.480> could<00:02:50.840> have

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
and backwards Nick probably could have

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.690 
and backwards Nick probably could have
done<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.440> little<00:02:51.710> more<00:02:51.980> articulation<00:02:52.610> in

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
done with a little more articulation in

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.880 
done with a little more articulation in
the<00:02:52.790> legs<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.330> I<00:02:54.020> definitely<00:02:54.290> think<00:02:54.770> they

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
the legs and I definitely think they

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.380 
the legs and I definitely think they
should<00:02:55.070> have<00:02:55.160> had<00:02:55.280> articulated<00:02:55.610> mounts

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
should have had articulated mounts

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.840 
should have had articulated mounts
because<00:02:57.140> really<00:02:57.350> what<00:02:57.890> fun<00:02:58.100> are<00:02:58.220> mousers<00:02:58.670> if

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
because really what fun are mousers if

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.410 
because really what fun are mousers if
they<00:02:59.030> can't<00:02:59.330> even<00:02:59.480> bite<00:02:59.900> your<00:03:00.110> turtles<00:03:01.420> but

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
they can't even bite your turtles but

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.940 
they can't even bite your turtles but
even<00:03:02.690> with<00:03:02.840> my<00:03:02.959> minor<00:03:03.230> gripes<00:03:03.560> about<00:03:03.680> the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
even with my minor gripes about the

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.640 
even with my minor gripes about the
articulation<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.940> can<00:03:05.480> recognize<00:03:05.930> how<00:03:06.140> awesome

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
articulation I can recognize how awesome

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.530 
articulation I can recognize how awesome
these<00:03:06.800> little<00:03:07.070> mousers<00:03:07.459> really<00:03:07.730> are<00:03:07.880> I<00:03:08.120> mean

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
these little mousers really are I mean

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.560 
these little mousers really are I mean
they<00:03:08.690> look<00:03:09.020> perfect<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:11.030> want<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.209> say<00:03:11.330> an<00:03:11.450> old

size is better the detail looks a lot

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.479 
size is better the detail looks a lot
better<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.230> doesn't<00:03:25.070> have<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.310> silly
