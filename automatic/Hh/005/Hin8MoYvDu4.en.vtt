call<00:04:25.110> is<00:04:25.349> how<00:04:26.009> I<00:04:26.159> boy<00:04:26.460> they<00:04:26.610> don't<00:04:26.759> allow<00:04:27.030> you

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
call is how I boy they don't allow you

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.450 
call is how I boy they don't allow you
is<00:04:27.479> the<00:04:27.840> physical<00:04:28.500> near<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.979> coin<00:04:29.219> market

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
is the physical near the coin market

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.070 
is the physical near the coin market
it's<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.419> size<00:04:30.689> yeah<00:04:31.319> it's<00:04:31.680> an<00:04:31.830> ant<00:04:32.009> is<00:04:32.520> tiny

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
it's that size yeah it's an ant is tiny

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.240 
it's that size yeah it's an ant is tiny
absolutely<00:04:34.080> tiny<00:04:34.259> so<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.770> fact<00:04:34.949> that<00:04:35.009> it's<00:04:35.189> a

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
absolutely tiny so the fact that it's a

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.719 
absolutely tiny so the fact that it's a
sold-out<00:04:35.729> is<00:04:36.229> no<00:04:37.229> big<00:04:37.439> deal<00:04:37.620> but<00:04:37.830> but<00:04:38.189> the

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
sold-out is no big deal but but the

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.330 
sold-out is no big deal but but the
point<00:04:38.969> is<00:04:39.150> when<00:04:39.569> a<00:04:39.830> population<00:04:40.830> when<00:04:40.949> when<00:04:41.310> a

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
point is when a population when when a

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.670 
point is when a population when when a
population<00:04:41.849> of<00:04:41.939> bullish<00:04:42.419> it's<00:04:43.020> not<00:04:43.139> good<00:04:43.379> it's

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
population of bullish it's not good it's

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.589 
population of bullish it's not good it's
not<00:04:43.770> good<00:04:43.889> for<00:04:44.069> prospective<00:04:44.430> returns<00:04:45.120> you

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
not good for prospective returns you

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.360 
not good for prospective returns you
know<00:04:45.719> if<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.139> equity<00:04:46.560> guys<00:04:46.680> were<00:04:46.860> all<00:04:46.949> British

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
know if the equity guys were all British

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.439 
know if the equity guys were all British
to<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.520> beginning<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.819> this<00:04:47.909> year<00:04:47.969> wasn't

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
to the beginning of this year wasn't

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.149 
to the beginning of this year wasn't
good<00:04:48.719> Jeff<00:04:48.930> right<00:04:49.139> the<00:04:49.409> gold<00:04:49.620> goes<00:04:49.800> there<00:04:50.069> all

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
good Jeff right the gold goes there all
