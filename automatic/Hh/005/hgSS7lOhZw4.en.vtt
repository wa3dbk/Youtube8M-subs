00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.890
 hello good morning today we will see a breakdown 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.630
 pretty typical on TVs 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.580
 mainly from lcd which are the ones that 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.919
 usually carry this integrated and more 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.059
 concretely the economic those of 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.570
 white mark 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.230
 the fault to the cause the chip as-15 be 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.750
 integrated ssm of 48 pins and what 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.910
 found on the plate t with the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.310
 Fault symptoms are mainly 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.910
 negative images as I am 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.399
 showing and burned image or with 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.980
 excess of brightness eye many brightness 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.649
 too but the image seen 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.110
 screen is not completely white if 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.020
 the image was completely white almost 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.629
 sure it would be another fault this symptom 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.410
 it can be fixed to always be present 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.809
 or intermittent is to say at times go well 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.690
 at times and go bad if it is intermittent 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.300
 it can be for two reasons false 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.670
 contacts or by heat generally 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.070
 when it gets too hot we find out 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 if it is by false contacts giving 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.600
 small taps to the plate 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.150
 with the handle of a screwdriver 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.280
 same time looking at the screen we should 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.130
 notice changes in the image look good 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.470
 worse as we go on giving 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.050
 taps in this case that the breakdown 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.660
 be by false contacts simply 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.490
 We will have to solve the chip if the 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.770
 damage due to excessive heat is almost 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.260
 always when you turn on the image you will see 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.800
 well and after a while it will start to 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.690
 be burned or denied at that moment 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.390
 we will apply directly to the snow chip 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.550
 spray for the halo and although I do not know what 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.979
 you believe but that's how the image will look 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.500
 well until it reheats the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.440
 chip in this case we should replace the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.510
 chip by a new one to solve or 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.520
 change the chip I recommend you see 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.850
 my video tutorial practical course 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.790
 electronic welding the tin that is 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.680
 on this same website in the course section 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.800
 basic and practical electronics 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.229
 what is beats with where it is and for what 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.390
 serves late with is the plate that 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.580
 multiplex to the video signal and you 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.280
 adapts to the type of television panel 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.020
 for example to make it clearer if 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.590
 we imagine the screen as a 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.840
 grid is this plate beats with catch 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.420
 the video signal and the decrease in be 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.580
 in the rows and columns the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.580
 corresponding signals that will make up 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.740
 the image for the old technicians the 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.440
 that we come from the trc ray tube 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.530
 cathode we could say that beats with 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.840
 is the equivalent or substitute for the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.690
 amplifier plate to rgb that 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.910
 inserted into the neck of the tube then 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.250
 we can deduce that it beats with 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.310
 finds sandwiched between the plate 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.250
 main video and the screen as you are 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.340
 watching and nothing would be going dismantling up 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.530
 access it as you can appreciate to 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.880
 beats with the connection cable arrives 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.580
 also called lvds of the main plate of 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.430
 video and you get two connection buses 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.579
 with many clues as you can see 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.950
 to the panel specifically a bus will give 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.349
 the information of the signal to the rows and 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.950
 the other to the columns of the screen 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:23.079
 of the television a note to tell you that 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.480
 small televisions there is the 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.450
 possibility that the tepco is not 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.870
 included or integrated in the main plate 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.959
 this we can find out very 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.170
 simple as many of you will have already deduced 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.569
 there will be a single signal plate that will 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.859
 between the euro antenna signal connectors 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.200
 hdmi and make them a minimum of two large 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.409
 buses connecting to the panel 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.870
 TV good friends for today is already 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.090
 Enough I hope you liked it 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.750
 serve and until the next video tutorial 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.750
 bye
