00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
is go for the million because a million

is<00:01:02.090> cool<00:01:02.360> and<00:01:02.570> platinum<00:01:02.990> sounds<00:01:03.380> better<00:01:03.530> than

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
is cool and platinum sounds better than

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.710 
is cool and platinum sounds better than
the<00:01:03.770> rest<00:01:03.980> of<00:01:04.159> them<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:04.759> I<00:01:04.790> did<00:01:05.059> just<00:01:05.299> that<00:01:05.390> in

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
the rest of them so I did just that in

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.109 
the rest of them so I did just that in
the<00:01:05.900> SLS<00:01:06.290> obviously<00:01:06.770> this<00:01:06.920> is<00:01:07.130> my<00:01:07.369> SLS<00:01:07.909> that

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
the SLS obviously this is my SLS that

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.789 
the SLS obviously this is my SLS that
I've<00:01:08.540> had<00:01:08.689> customized<00:01:09.080> for<00:01:09.259> a<00:01:09.290> while<00:01:09.500> now

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
I've had customized for a while now

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.830 
I've had customized for a while now
switch<00:01:10.250> design<00:01:10.490> about<00:01:10.880> three<00:01:11.180> or<00:01:11.299> four<00:01:11.509> times

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
switch design about three or four times

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.630 
switch design about three or four times
but<00:01:12.350> I<00:01:12.409> think<00:01:12.680> I'm<00:01:12.799> happy<00:01:13.070> with<00:01:13.159> his<00:01:13.310> design

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
but I think I'm happy with his design

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.399 
but I think I'm happy with his design
now<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:13.969> I'm<00:01:14.030> probably<00:01:14.210> gonna<00:01:14.450> not<00:01:15.049> really<00:01:15.079> do

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
now and I'm probably gonna not really do

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.770 
now and I'm probably gonna not really do
anything<00:01:15.619> major<00:01:15.979> to<00:01:16.249> it<00:01:16.399> maybe<00:01:16.549> yeah<00:01:16.789> do<00:01:17.749> a

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
anything major to it maybe yeah do a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.109 
anything major to it maybe yeah do a
different<00:01:18.320> grades<00:01:18.590> on<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:18.890> but<00:01:19.249> yes<00:01:19.490> this<00:01:19.789> was

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
different grades on it but yes this was

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.669 
different grades on it but yes this was
probably<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.749> most<00:01:20.869> difficult<00:01:21.350> thing<00:01:21.530> I've

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
probably the most difficult thing I've

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.919 
probably the most difficult thing I've
done<00:01:21.859> I<00:01:21.920> need<00:01:22.159> to<00:01:22.249> do<00:01:22.369> rivals<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.359> idea<00:01:23.810> of

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
done I need to do rivals the idea of

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.410 
done I need to do rivals the idea of
aggravation<00:01:24.499> when<00:01:24.829> I<00:01:24.859> lost<00:01:25.159> about<00:01:25.280> 600<00:01:26.030> K<00:01:26.210> and

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
aggravation when I lost about 600 K and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.359 
aggravation when I lost about 600 K and
the<00:01:26.479> last<00:01:26.689> one<00:01:26.929> before<00:01:27.049> this<00:01:27.469> it<00:01:27.979> was<00:01:28.039> very

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
the last one before this it was very

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.819 
the last one before this it was very
annoying<00:01:28.759> but<00:01:29.420> once<00:01:29.899> you<00:01:30.049> get<00:01:30.170> going<00:01:30.229> it's<00:01:30.649> all

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
annoying but once you get going it's all

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.580 
annoying but once you get going it's all
fine<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.520> last<00:01:31.789> sprint<00:01:32.479> towards<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.259> final

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590
