00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 even before the release of the Jahreskreis 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.180
 online it became known that the capital 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.020
 the imperial city opens its doors to the launch 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.480
 keeps closed 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.400
 as reason for it was specified that the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.480
 city conquered by the horden mulack bals 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.009
 and was occupied 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.420
 This now applies from the city to 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.800
 exaggerate and in turn the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.779
 to gain control over it 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.609
 But this is not that easy 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.410
 First of all, it would have to be 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.900
 make ever in the imperial city 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.369
 in addition alliance must the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.369
 Most annoying and fortress 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.599
 control then and only then can 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.160
 you in the imperial city by one 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.320
 input in the sewer 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.690
 Although there are three separate entrances 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.550
 So one for every alliance but it will be 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.340
 Only one at a time be open 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.750
 which is that can change quickly 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.370
 Yours, you have just learned the most 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.120
 castles under their control shall ye 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.129
 enter 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.230
 inside the walls, many bosses are waiting 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.809
 minibuses and smaller events where 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.680
 There are lots of blood and gold 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.449
 In addition, it will also be daily 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.250
 give repeatable quests and for 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.989
 Armor forge among you even one 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.210
 new armor the imperial of 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.670
 consolation basically shares the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.220
 city ​​in four quarters on the arena den 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.140
 Temple the market and the podium 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.390
 here in the quarter are waiting for you 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.409
 different quests and events the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.750
 arena can be found, for example 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.520
 completely in the hand of the data in it 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.049
 seemingly boring 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.009
 they are imperial duels against each other 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.229
 compete 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.420
 in the temple district of the godfather 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.320
 dedicated to acatech took the inversion 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.210
 Their origin 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.400
 what exactly happened there you have to 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 probably first find out yourself on the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.700
 Marktplatz also romp around a few 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.920
 days rather throw out to your heart's content 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.750
 can you put this to you there 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.509
 crafting station disposal and there are 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.909
 a little nice weapons and in april 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.490
 or the park, there are also a few 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.659
 data throws it out the best as soon as 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.430
 Reward for taking over one 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.280
 quarter you get a spot there 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.500
 point that sounds very much to bva 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.299
 but do not worry the pvp is coming here 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.979
 not too short if you think so 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.750
 has always described only one of the three 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.969
 allianzen access to the imperial city 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.710
 but if the players alliance this all 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.930
 in the imperial city are around there the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.299
 The castles are great for downloading 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.100
 in Syria almost defenseless as one 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.729
 alliance can now go and this 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.710
 conquer 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.270
 as soon as she holds the majority of the castles 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.310
 closes the first alliance of the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.140
 access and the second gets him 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.540
 you can turn to the imperial city 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.550
 come in and 31 on the fence 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.380
 aggravating comes here now but added 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.060
 that the players of the first alliance here 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.800
 they are not going to be in town yet 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.510
 simply teleported out by magic 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.239
 but continue to hold their quarters 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.220
 together with the spur points alliance 2 must 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.750
 So only the players of Alliance 1 off 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.220
 drive the city and only then 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.319
 you can dedicate yourself to the data 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.580
 while the two alliances in the 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.769
 imperial city the swords around the ears 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.569
 But alliance 3 can go now 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.910
 and the castles attack the office deal 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.840
 if alliance 1 and 2 are too few people 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.040
 left behind 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.780
 then let's be honest who wants 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.060
 already stay behind and the job has 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.410
 Alliance 3 now easy game and urges 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.540
 also in the imperial city 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.340
 the developers hope for a constant 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.140
 back and forth between the alliances and 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.120
 So want more momentum in the current 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.310
 quite stuck europe of teese 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.049
 I personally bring this hold 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.880
 Change for absolutely correct 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.680
 finally one has as a player bvb one 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.420
 incentive to make an effort in the pvp 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.010
 where you finally have a real one 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.720
 goal in front of the entrance to the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.370
 imperial city 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.019
 However, it is a bit unfavorable 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.000
 that's what it's all about first and foremost 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.640
 what to actually destroy the ddr 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.840
 but rather pv is clear is such a 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.590
 mixing for most players 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.269
 no problem 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.310
 but how will it be the hardcore pvp 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.440
 see players and how they will be 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.670
 Nevertheless, think ahead of everything 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.590
 me that this is a really good one 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.630
 Change is also very good for the game 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.010
 could do and watch for watching 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.010
 could until next time
