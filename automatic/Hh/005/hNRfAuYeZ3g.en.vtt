00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.830
 I knew that adding naphthalene in 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.480
 the tank only serves for the tank 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.480
 of fuel do not be police 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.930
 as I said ricardo and we will treat 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.430
 chat a little about these 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.829
 so common denominations especially 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.529
 when you go to a rubber shop in a 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.769
 poster that that front alignment train 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.890
 and I swing one of the things that I do not 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.890
 we pay them generally attention is to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.960
 the logical alignment and the rolling the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.160
 most common thing more frequent in what 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.800
 It makes alignments as is 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.329
 communicating and for some reason I do not say 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.640
 we let go because if a total imprudence 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.379
 but we loose control of the steering wheel and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.190
 the car we see that it has a tendency to 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.239
 move to one side and 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.000
 regardless of the slope or 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.800
 wind always 16 to one side that 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.719
 can be reinforced about 50 inventions the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.539
 technology but they pull the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.340
 left what does that mean if you 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.410
 have a tire on that side 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.360
 totally deflated probably the 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.369
 front that makes that tire 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.960
 I have much more friction and that 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.030
 friction force acts as brake and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.159
 forces the road vehicle in that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.440
 address the first thing that you 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.140
 observe is that there is more than half yes 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.960
 level in tire pressure and 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.210
 if he keeps driving and observes that 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.310
 continue under any condition pulling 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.280
 you have an alignment problem 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.580
 the wheels do not necessarily have to 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.250
 be parallel careful when one goes 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.450
 straight line there is one according to the type of 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.610
 vehicle but they also carry 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.400
 convergence fights 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.630
 the lines do not meet in infinity 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.670
 they mark the wheel but they have 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.230
 tendency to count their modified before not 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.300
 they are parallel they are not totally 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.330
 parallel and that's just to give 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.550
 directionality the vehicle of passage a 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.560
 advice but everything has a 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.720
 front-wheel drive vehicle do not 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.280
 rare changes in the suspension of that from 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.500
 that the exchange lows were not expected 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.929
 the change this change us the wheel 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.910
 it is a thing that to the extent that 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.400
 find obstacles have movement 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.800
 has movements in several ways 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.020
 change the rope and change moves 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.570
 let's say parallel to the vehicle 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.910
 has a tendency to get inside 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.470
 outside changes the divergence or 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.690
 convergences and has a tendency to 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.040
 opened or closed if you look at the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.370
 address all second 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.319
 one side of a wheel normally the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.540
 inside of the curve is more 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.069
 tucked into the curve that the outside and 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.230
 it is reasonable that it be if it is 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.939
 programmed to make it so because the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.909
 inside wheel goes one more way 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:47.879
 short even shorter than the outside 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:49.590
 for a harrow I do not know then good to 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.299
 see the address is one thing and the heap 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.549
 of task prediction is a very thing 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.889
 complex that has to be combined 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.469
 with the suspensions that you direct the 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.359
 car and also has suspension and 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.280
 suspension to follow up goes up and down and 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.099
 when it goes up and down it can get to do 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.260
 very complicated drawings all that the 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.790
 the manufacturer in such a way that 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.799
 when the wheel goes up low by the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.599
 road accidents make and point 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.129
 about you have to point out that you have to 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.870
 change the height of the car del carmen 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.060
 the spirals or are addressed or whatever 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.129
 that can go absolutely to 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.630
 any part and transform into something 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.140
 dangerous 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.540
 already an example is tv3 surely a 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.980
 wheelchair down see if time 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.820
 of office and that when he pushes the chair 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.220
 automatically all the gorditas are 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.560
 they align in one direction all and 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.990
 why is that dedicated to them also goes 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.690
 well that the wheel is not aligned 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.390
 just with the axis of that leg but that 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.120
 is a little bit backwards 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.920
 have moved a little bit I like 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.020
 push the little wheel alone towards the line 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.390
 the tall one also has some of that 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.800
 Advance flame is put in a way 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.690
 maybe I want to complicate life now 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.550
 with physics but they are set in a 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.250
 such that when the car advances in 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.540
 wheels alone tend to line up to 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.540
 try to handle that having that 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.790
 correct handling facility then no 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.640
 neglect the direction and nothing 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.019
 periodically I get it or once I 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.450
 see where the measurements are going to be 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.640
 that look at the general state of all 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.860
 the entire suspension address to 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.900
 sometimes loose things worn ships or 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.480
 whatever and also raise a good 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.580
 idea whether or not it is aligned is the nest 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.620
 on vacation or he said it for another 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.330
 the same occasion will announce the 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.310
 covers feels an emergency car 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.540
 from another balanced the difference is 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.770
 abysmal 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.330
 most likely when you take it to 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.130
 balance your vehicle after many 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.050
 kilometers do not your diabetes 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.940
 other cars and effectively it 's two other 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.880
 in the balanced wheels 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.820
 do not lose chance 4 can make 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.300
 control alignment especially 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.130
 being on a fast-moving route where 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.170
 corrections can come to be 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.730
 absolutely dominant and do not lose 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.800
 attention also with what he does 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.570
 rolling that is going to avoid some 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.540
 shaking and on the contrary I want to try 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.230
 more before it closes you are blocked 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.140
 Alberto the theme of the swing the first 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.090
 symptom is the vibration on the steering wheel 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.700
 it can be the steering wheel if it is forward 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.430
 it can be back or the one that goes back 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.830
 normally he feels something by revelation and 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.500
 something different happens here there may be 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.900
 that associated a motivator in poor condition 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.490
 that magnifies disney a lot of 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.800
 much more complex ankle 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.030
 tried to summarize in five minutes but 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.310
 the closing of this is do not neglect it 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.530
 when can any these houses 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.210
 responsible that there are many do 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.370
 control the license in the swing and 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.670
 the status of the front train and one thing 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.920
 plus 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.720
 vehicles with front- wheel drive do not 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.190
 they just have to bend braking and 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.360
 have suspension the front wheel 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.430
 also traction 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.129
 then pull when they are 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.050
 retired people and going is not easy 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:00.030
 change nothing leave it as he did 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.979
 manufacturer that knows how to do very well and 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.020
 talking about evaluation and to balance 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.120
 a little bit of these and get us a 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:10.259
 little doubt because what he said before 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.719
 Pain is interesting and alarming 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.879
 I propose that the next block all 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:17.039
 that we integrate auto technique in 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:19.759
 millennium let's discuss a little bit 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.759
 about this issue
