love<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:59.400> to<00:04:00.400> me<00:04:00.579> I<00:04:00.610> looked<00:04:01.090> when<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:01.630> first<00:04:01.930> saw

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
love and to me I looked when I first saw

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.539 
love and to me I looked when I first saw
it<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.470> first<00:04:02.680> thought<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:02.980> came<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.430> my

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
it the first thought that came to my

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.539 
it the first thought that came to my
mind<00:04:03.760> was<00:04:04.500> tile<00:04:05.500> grout<00:04:05.890> I<00:04:06.130> thought<00:04:06.310> yeah<00:04:06.519> that

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
mind was tile grout I thought yeah that

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.000 
mind was tile grout I thought yeah that
looks<00:04:06.970> like<00:04:07.120> grout<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:08.049> you<00:04:08.230> would<00:04:08.380> need<00:04:08.530> to

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
looks like grout that you would need to

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.610 
looks like grout that you would need to
install<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.700> tile<00:04:10.060> floor<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.750> then<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.290> second

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
install a tile floor and then the second

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.910 
install a tile floor and then the second
thought<00:04:11.739> was<00:04:11.950> well<00:04:12.280> do<00:04:12.549> I<00:04:12.609> like<00:04:12.910> that<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:14.079> I

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
thought was well do I like that and I

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.289 
thought was well do I like that and I
guess<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.310> answer<00:04:15.340> was<00:04:15.700> yes<00:04:15.850> because<00:04:16.209> I

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
guess the answer was yes because I

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.810 
guess the answer was yes because I
bought<00:04:16.479> it<00:04:16.680> but<00:04:17.680> it's<00:04:18.039> it's<00:04:18.310> definitely<00:04:18.519> a

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
bought it but it's it's definitely a

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.280 
bought it but it's it's definitely a
beige

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
beige

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.880 
beige
gray<00:04:21.450> pastel<00:04:22.450> so<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.200> feel<00:04:23.410> like<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.680> will

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
gray pastel so I feel like this will

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.530 
gray pastel so I feel like this will
cater<00:04:24.160> to<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.430> very<00:04:24.670> small<00:04:25.000> group<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.360> people

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
cater to a very small group of people

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.810 
cater to a very small group of people
but<00:04:25.900> it's<00:04:26.410> interesting<00:04:26.860> it<00:04:27.220> would<00:04:27.340> be<00:04:27.490> really

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
but it's interesting it would be really

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.840 
but it's interesting it would be really
really<00:04:28.570> pretty<00:04:28.930> with<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.350> matte<00:04:29.710> topcoat<00:04:30.130> on<00:04:30.490> it

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
really pretty with a matte topcoat on it

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.540 
really pretty with a matte topcoat on it
do<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.180> black<00:04:31.540> tribal<00:04:32.170> print<00:04:32.470> on<00:04:32.680> top<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.220> or

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
do a black tribal print on top of it or

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.970 
do a black tribal print on top of it or
like<00:04:33.850> a<00:04:33.970> white<00:04:34.330> feather<00:04:34.930> print<00:04:35.290> on<00:04:35.530> top<00:04:35.560> of<00:04:35.890> it

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
like a white feather print on top of it

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.980 
like a white feather print on top of it
but<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.310> formula<00:04:36.730> is<00:04:36.760> about<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.300> same<00:04:37.540> as<00:04:37.780> the

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
but the formula is about the same as the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.810 
but the formula is about the same as the
other<00:04:38.170> two<00:04:38.500> it's<00:04:38.920> a<00:04:39.040> little<00:04:39.280> bit<00:04:39.400> thicker<00:04:39.700> than

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
other two it's a little bit thicker than

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.540 
other two it's a little bit thicker than
wear<00:04:40.690> skinny<00:04:41.170> jeans<00:04:41.260> so<00:04:42.130> you<00:04:42.220> can<00:04:42.400> definitely

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
wear skinny jeans so you can definitely

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.030 
wear skinny jeans so you can definitely
get<00:04:42.880> this<00:04:43.090> one<00:04:43.270> opaque<00:04:43.630> in<00:04:43.870> two<00:04:44.140> coats<00:04:44.470> I<00:04:44.740> don't

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
get this one opaque in two coats I don't

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.100 
get this one opaque in two coats I don't
know<00:04:45.100> it's<00:04:45.400> worth<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.670> shot<00:04:45.700> the<00:04:46.540> next<00:04:46.930> one

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
know it's worth a shot the next one

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.690 
know it's worth a shot the next one
which<00:04:47.470> is<00:04:47.500> actually<00:04:47.920> what<00:04:48.040> I'm<00:04:48.190> wearing<00:04:48.520> on<00:04:48.640> my
