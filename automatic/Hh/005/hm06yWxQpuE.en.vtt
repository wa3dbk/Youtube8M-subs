00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.290
 hello friends today makes you aware 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.700
 we make or liver sausage and mass 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.470
 and then we have to look for it 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.990
 Onion liver sausage makes you look at levels 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.060
 make or markets to try one 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.669
 to make wide price levels 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.050
 To create a lot of pleasure when 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.360
 step first because we now have a 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.550
 Belly the belly must be from the cartilage 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.250
 free and save 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.920
 and if you did that because you 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.380
 one and a half hours at 80 degrees 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.910
 bull and the liver have in the 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.340
 meantime to breathe in the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.180
 fridge and how it goes on 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.520
 six right now so we have now 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.880
 removed the cartilage from the abdomen and the 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.329
 black away and now you go like 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.980
 said for one and a half hours of the 80s 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.500
 with us in the steamer you can 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.000
 but also in a boiling pot indoors on 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.470
 make the normal stove plate 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.170
 the only important thing is that we have the temperature 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.680
 not far above 80 degrees increased since you 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.810
 otherwise very high cook has lost 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.180
 so for all eyes thumb that small 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.980
 helper julia but not 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.820
 she wants to endanger unrecognized 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:22.330
 stay 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.740
 say hello there belly and schwarten 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.840
 are ready 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.150
 one and a half hours and for my main 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.520
 liverwurst basic recipe or mine 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.610
 liverwurst base now wants the whole thing 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.860
 as you can see through the wolf 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.520
 and if it does not glass through the wolf 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.290
 show it to you so full again 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.210
 Little nonsense tells that was 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.910
 of course no states but the color 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.250
 to see something they have built 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.800
 and even now they wanted 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.360
 seven on the upper side 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.850
 the next step is now the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.160
 From then one calculates from the then 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.940
 because I would like to have a relationship 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:08.140
 two-thirds meat admission labor and 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.700
 if you show yourself so again 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.549

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:43.030
 how it goes on show you three 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.030

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.810
 become a stately crowd 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:56.160
 and if we just calculated that 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:59.000

 There were two kilograms of pigs that gave it 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.130
 means we are about 6 euros 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.070
 but you also live in the offer two euros 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.750

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:28.020
 So the kilo comes to about 3 eur 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.680
 33 and if they are now considered when 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.080
 my business around 1 euro 50 100 grams 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.190

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.530
 climate 15 euro and we have the kilo and 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.260
