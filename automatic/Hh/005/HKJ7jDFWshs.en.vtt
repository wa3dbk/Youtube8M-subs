00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
don't want to run out there like a

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.130 
don't want to run out there like a
retard<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.100> die<00:03:40.420> because<00:03:41.420> then<00:03:41.690> all<00:03:41.930> sudden

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
retard and die because then all sudden

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.259 
retard and die because then all sudden
you<00:03:42.290> don't<00:03:42.380> have<00:03:42.530> your<00:03:42.620> kill<00:03:42.799> streak<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:43.269> that

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
you don't have your kill streak and that

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.740 
you don't have your kill streak and that
you<00:03:44.690> just<00:03:44.870> wasted<00:03:45.109> your<00:03:45.940> friggin<00:03:46.940> abilities

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
you just wasted your friggin abilities

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.800 
you just wasted your friggin abilities
of<00:03:48.049> killstreak<00:03:48.560> getting<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.880> yeah<00:03:50.209> another

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
of killstreak getting and yeah another

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.210 
of killstreak getting and yeah another
reason<00:03:51.049> I<00:03:51.079> use<00:03:51.109> chopper<00:03:51.530> gunner<00:03:51.680> is<00:03:51.859> because

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
reason I use chopper gunner is because

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.130 
reason I use chopper gunner is because
when<00:03:52.519> you<00:03:52.640> if<00:03:53.000> you<00:03:53.090> put<00:03:53.239> on<00:03:53.329> there's<00:03:53.570> no<00:03:53.690> double

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
when you if you put on there's no double

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.199 
when you if you put on there's no double

for<00:03:56.359> all<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.480> mean<00:03:56.630> so<00:03:56.810> it's<00:03:56.989> kind<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.230> pointless

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
for all I mean so it's kind of pointless

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.130 
for all I mean so it's kind of pointless
to<00:03:57.829> use<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.760> AC<00:03:58.880> 130<00:03:59.299> which<00:03:59.540> is<00:03:59.720> mainly<00:03:59.930> used

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
to use the AC 130 which is mainly used

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.979 
to use the AC 130 which is mainly used
for<00:04:00.650> getting<00:04:01.250> like<00:04:01.760> doubles<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.450> triples<00:04:02.569> and

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
for getting like doubles and triples and

for getting like doubles and triples and
good<00:04:03.709> stuff<00:04:03.980> like<00:04:04.100> that<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:05.630> yeah<00:04:05.870> that's

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930
