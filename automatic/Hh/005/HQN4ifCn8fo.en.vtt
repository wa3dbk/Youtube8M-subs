everything from those don't worry we'll
put<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.170> our<00:01:52.409> own<00:01:52.439> custom<00:01:53.369> codes<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.850> that's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
put in our own custom codes and that's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.249 
put in our own custom codes and that's
basically<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> hack<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.700> go<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.909> CM<00:01:57.360> delete

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
so everything from the CM then go to NP

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.380 
so everything from the CM then go to NP
and<00:02:05.600> do<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.870> everything<00:02:06.940> now<00:02:07.940> go<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.179> the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
and do it everything now go to the

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.100 
and do it everything now go to the
prestige<00:02:08.810> hack<00:02:09.140> in<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.649> file<00:02:10.039> I<00:02:10.340> gave<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.880> and

the<00:04:13.400> patch<00:04:13.610> blocker<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.270> ps3<00:04:14.570> and<00:04:15.050> it

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
the patch blocker to the ps3 and it

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.569 
the patch blocker to the ps3 and it
won't<00:04:15.350> allow<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:15.710> to<00:04:15.920> signing<00:04:16.280> that's<00:04:16.459> what

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
won't allow you to signing that's what

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.759 
won't allow you to signing that's what
happened<00:04:16.850> to<00:04:16.910> me<00:04:17.060> right<00:04:17.269> here<00:04:17.600> so<00:04:17.900> I<00:04:18.200> just<00:04:18.440> had

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
happened to me right here so I just had

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.949 
happened to me right here so I just had
to<00:04:18.799> disable<00:04:19.220> my<00:04:19.519> firewall<00:04:20.090> really<00:04:20.510> quickly

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
to disable my firewall really quickly

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.330 
to disable my firewall really quickly
and<00:04:21.200> then<00:04:21.650> just<00:04:21.920> sign<00:04:22.130> in<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.760> worked<00:04:22.970> fine

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
and then just sign in and it worked fine

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.940 
and then just sign in and it worked fine
so<00:04:25.340> if<00:04:25.700> the<00:04:26.390> patch<00:04:26.570> bakker<00:04:26.900> doesn't<00:04:27.650> work<00:04:27.770> for

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
so if the patch bakker doesn't work for

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.150 
so if the patch bakker doesn't work for
you<00:04:28.100> that's<00:04:28.780> probably<00:04:29.780> pretty<00:04:29.990> much<00:04:30.350> on<00:04:30.620> 2%<00:04:31.130> of

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
you that's probably pretty much on 2% of

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.040 
you that's probably pretty much on 2% of
the<00:04:31.250> problem<00:04:31.670> is<00:04:31.820> your<00:04:32.000> firewall<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.990> blocking

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
the problem is your firewall is blocking

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.390 
the problem is your firewall is blocking
it<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:33.770> you<00:04:33.980> could<00:04:34.130> just<00:04:34.160> disable<00:04:34.850> that<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:36.400> now

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
it so you could just disable that so now

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.700 
it so you could just disable that so now
that<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.850> got<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.270> patch<00:04:38.900> blocker<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.560> your

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
that you got the patch blocker and your

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.290 
that you got the patch blocker and your
proxy<00:04:40.040> server<00:04:40.370> working<00:04:40.820> now<00:04:41.000> you're<00:04:41.150> just

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
proxy server working now you're just

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.960 
proxy server working now you're just
gonna<00:04:41.420> want<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:41.750> load<00:04:41.930> up<00:04:42.080> call<00:04:42.320> before<00:04:42.970> skip

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
gonna want to load up call before skip

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.460

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
like hacked stuff those are basically

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.960

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
all the stats and stuff so then go to

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.870 
all the stats and stuff so then go to
split-screen<00:05:08.450> just<00:05:09.320> start<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.710> match<00:05:09.890> it

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
split-screen just start the match it

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.150 
split-screen just start the match it
should<00:05:11.240> be<00:05:11.419> shipment<00:05:11.900> if<00:05:12.080> you<00:05:12.740> put<00:05:12.919> in<00:05:13.040> the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
should be shipment if you put in the

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.650 
should be shipment if you put in the
codes<00:05:13.400> correctly

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.850 

doesn't<00:05:17.660> matter<00:05:17.810> what<00:05:18.110> team<00:05:18.350> doesn't<00:05:18.740> matter

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
doesn't matter what team doesn't matter

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.550 
doesn't matter what team doesn't matter
what<00:05:19.010> guns<00:05:19.250> just<00:05:19.790> join<00:05:20.030> in<00:05:20.270> hit<00:05:20.600> select<00:05:20.900> twice

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
what guns just join in hit select twice

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.260 
what guns just join in hit select twice
doesn't<00:05:22.100> really<00:05:22.250> matter<00:05:22.520> what<00:05:22.700> else<00:05:22.910> you<00:05:23.120> do

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
doesn't really matter what else you do

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.900 
doesn't really matter what else you do
you<00:05:23.450> could<00:05:23.630> jump<00:05:23.930> shoot<00:05:24.740> but<00:05:25.130> you<00:05:25.340> have<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.790> hit

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
you could jump shoot but you have to hit

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.600 
you could jump shoot but you have to hit
select<00:05:26.120> toys<00:05:26.510> so<00:05:26.900> just<00:05:27.140> select<00:05:27.620> select<00:05:28.340> and

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
select toys so just select select and

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.719 
select toys so just select select and
then<00:05:28.729> end<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.060> game<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.950> that's<00:05:34.160> basically

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
then end the game and that's basically

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.870 
then end the game and that's basically
just<00:05:35.110> activating<00:05:36.110> like<00:05:36.530> the<00:05:36.860> hack<00:05:37.640> it's

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
just activating like the hack it's

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.200 
just activating like the hack it's
basically<00:05:38.210> telling<00:05:38.570> it<00:05:38.840> what<00:05:38.990> to<00:05:39.050> do<00:05:40.060> so<00:05:41.060> now

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
basically telling it what to do so now

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.480 
basically telling it what to do so now
you<00:05:41.270> can<00:05:41.510> just<00:05:41.690> go<00:05:41.870> to<00:05:41.900> play<00:05:42.590> online<00:05:42.770> and<00:05:43.220> you

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
you can just go to play online and you

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.760 
you can just go to play online and you
should<00:05:43.700> be<00:05:43.910> whatever<00:05:44.330> rank<00:05:44.570> you<00:05:44.780> set<00:05:45.080> as<00:05:45.560> you

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
and then again you don't have to test

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.100 
and then again you don't have to test
the<00:06:08.400> connection<00:06:08.550> just<00:06:09.150> sign<00:06:09.360> in<00:06:09.599> and

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
think they really care anymore since the

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.360 
think they really care anymore since the
games<00:06:51.930> just<00:06:52.080> sold<00:06:52.560> sound<00:06:53.039> like<00:06:53.190> they're

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
games just sold sound like they're

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.189

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199
