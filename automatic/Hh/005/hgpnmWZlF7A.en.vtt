I<00:04:42.450> think<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.230> commandos<00:04:43.650> are<00:04:43.800> ineffective

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
I think the commandos are ineffective

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:54.280 
I think the commandos are ineffective
versus<00:04:45.470> weak<00:04:46.470> Oh<00:04:52.490> see<00:04:53.490> he's<00:04:53.580> not<00:04:53.700> really<00:04:53.880> good

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
versus weak Oh see he's not really good

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.080 
versus weak Oh see he's not really good
but<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.410> attack<00:04:55.590> might<00:04:55.800> have<00:04:56.010> solo<00:04:56.460> armor<00:04:56.820> so

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
but the attack might have solo armor so

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.460 
but the attack might have solo armor so
I<00:04:57.120> can<00:04:57.390> actually<00:04:57.660> kill<00:04:57.870> it

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
I can actually kill it
