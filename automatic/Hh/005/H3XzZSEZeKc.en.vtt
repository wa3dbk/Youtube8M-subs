00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
stuff so that was the first time so that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.050 
stuff so that was the first time so that
is<00:02:13.770> if<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.010> put<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.550> oven<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:14.760> 5

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
minutes leave it alone and then you're

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.940 
minutes leave it alone and then you're
done<00:02:16.880> this<00:02:17.880> second<00:02:18.870> one<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.290> thought<00:02:19.560> well<00:02:19.770> let

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.150 
inside of the tortilla this is a little
bit<00:02:34.860> better<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.610> kind<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.240> wet<00:02:36.570> not<00:02:37.160> very

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
the third one started thinking what

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.940 
the third one started thinking what
would<00:02:44.040> my<00:02:44.100> grandma<00:02:44.580> do<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.720> what<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.320> did<00:02:46.440> is

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
would my grandma do so what I did is

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.030 
would my grandma do so what I did is
this<00:02:47.700> particular<00:02:47.880> one<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.600> actually<00:02:49.050> put<00:02:49.710> the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
this particular one I actually put the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.520 
this particular one I actually put the
tortilla<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.090> microwave<00:02:51.480> for<00:02:51.660> about<00:02:52.020> 20

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
tortilla in the microwave for about 20

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.830 
tortilla in the microwave for about 20
seconds<00:02:52.920> 10<00:02:53.220> seconds<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.730> one<00:02:53.910> side<00:02:54.150> 10

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
seconds 10 seconds on one side 10

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.620 
seconds 10 seconds on one side 10
seconds<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.350> other<00:02:55.560> side<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:57.120> heated

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
seconds on the other side and it heated

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.690 
seconds on the other side and it heated
it<00:02:57.750> up<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.470> was<00:02:58.500> able<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.300> adapt<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
it up so it was able to adapt to the

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.960 
it up so it was able to adapt to the
shape<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.090> pan<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:04.190> voila<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.520> think<00:03:05.880> we

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
shape of the pan and voila I think we

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.479 
shape of the pan and voila I think we
found<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.300> winner<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.950> other<00:03:08.070> thing<00:03:08.190> is

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
found a winner so the other thing is

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.100 
found a winner so the other thing is
that<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.880> doesn't<00:03:09.270> tell<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.690> box<00:03:09.870> doesn't

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
that it doesn't tell you the box doesn't

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.740 
that it doesn't tell you the box doesn't
tell<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.440> what<00:03:10.590> degrees<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.310> use<00:03:11.520> I<00:03:11.790> start<00:03:12.630> on

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
tell you what degrees to use I start on

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.540
