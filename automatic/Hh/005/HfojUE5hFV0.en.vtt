00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.759
 so with you black teaching video yet with 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.030
 hunger bika as you see a map of us benyuk and 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.949
 we will talk today about flash drives 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.570
 The first part of the issue of flash drives on nukes 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.270
 if you don't want to miss when 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.330
 will come next then subscribe to 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.740
 channel 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.630
 probably the most famous is the easiest 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.070
 flash drive on Nikita flash drive that feeds 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 everybody knows about it from the booth 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.760
 many not butt and when so that she 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.070
 always flew a hundred percent it 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.640
 really just need to get up here this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.200
 the wall coincided with this line here this 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.390
 here 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.750
 and after that aim the kings by here 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.750
 this line here 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.430
 depending on how we need to 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.620
 she flew you can throw either on the go 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:03.850
 then she flies 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:09.790
 deep from sculpts here here and so on 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.790
 you can throw 100 eggs and only slightly lower 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.160
 then she barely flies and right there 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.750
 bury 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.750
 that is, it is more mental 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.190
 from the booth you can throw and a flash drive 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.290
 moving along the wall until it disappears 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.540
 black bar and aim at that line 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.810
 along this line the top of the green 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.810
 beams 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.880
 still 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.880
 with 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.820
 she is 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.710
 the left side of the exit from the booth from there 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.970
 from where no one expects and therefore 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.240
 might catch someone by surprise 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.950
 although of course there are some bounces and therefore 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.950
 can enemies turn away 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.250
 if you stand on top and your friend 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.010
 downright dreams of fighting a booth then 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.990
 You can throw a flash drive it will 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.650
 very grateful 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.150
 this flash drive on his first blinded dark 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.160
 as we see it instantly that is there 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.100
 turn away impossible this time 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.290
 Secondly, she felt good that the person 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.910
 just worth the dark he doesn't expect that 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.370
 flash drive can fly out of the prison window 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.680
 there is some way out of the gutkin expects 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.360
 what can from the exit of the booth fly into 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.390
 flash drive you can escape the enemy is waiting 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.730
 aggression from this country but what can 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.670
 from the window to fly the length will be 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.800
 the opening to the same this flash drive on the blind 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.800
 not only dark on blinds also and here 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.830
 this position that is when a person is standing 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.830
 on the radio checkbox arcade 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.190
 what throws 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.050
 hq you make life much easier 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.610
 a man who happens to be a booth 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.730
 because he won't need 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.410
 worry for the dark and for the people 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.230
 which stand here in this direction 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.230
 she will only check the regiment 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.230
 inside 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.990
 when the enemies have already taken 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.210
 plant is one of the most nasty 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.910
 positions this positions follow the wiring 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.090
 shock many died more than once on such 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.640
 positions are very annoying because 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.320
 a man sitting here listening to hear what 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.150
 going on there in guts too 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.040
 you can jump there in unsuitable 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.140
 moment 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.290
 jump up to you when you shoot there 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.660
 may jump on you when you are here 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.230
 from here you are coping with your mustache but also 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.280
 just generally very convenient to check 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.030
 turn sideways to everyone else 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.690
 positions 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.500
 but as always I know a flash drive which 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.950
 will help you only 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.480
 it's not easy getting up like this 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.990
 aligned along this line and fed 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.990
 along this line 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.730
 It is not default, therefore, having heard a 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.310
 how much nobody will be in anal 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.400
 turn away that i'm i'm real gil nor 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.329
 never have such a flash drive movie anyone 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.450
 of the top teams and we mold 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.840
 as you see both corners prada flash drive on 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.669
 god for me it is very convenient when 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.560
 take a plant with an extension then you can 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.380
 youngsters flash as far as we can 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.520
 proper extension in case u 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:39.550
 the enemy will be false then run again and 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:43.660
 throw in the blade blade stick is given 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.430
 how many of this pipe many don't 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.780
 understand the essence of this flash drive because 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.340
 legs think that if they throw at 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.620
 order flash what's responsible there all 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.080
 followed unfortunately such a flash drive which 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.090
 flies a very long time she beat the glass and in 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.580
 general only goes away from me 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.740
 so I have a slightly different use and 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.810
 throw when 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.130
 not to blind the enemy so he 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.930
 that turned away and 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.780
 checkbooks ie either to run 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.140
 down while the man turns away 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.660
 or 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.660
 run in and kill while he spivak you 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.490
 when content letting trump they usually 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.050
 go down if they are downstairs then they have a choice 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.360
 such either they go in long there 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.180
 takes some position but about long 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.680
 about and flash drives in the dream we have already talked 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:31.810
 either invisible some position down below then 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:35.320
 there is either this one here or position here 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.450
 right immediately rather nasty 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.460
 position because i rarely check wanted 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.650
 It is of course also rarely a position on 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.580
 bomber one frag you exactly done but 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.650
 where you will most likely not be given the 3rd position 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.570
 this is a plan there for him more 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.450
 talk the following videos i will show how 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.880
 Pay tribute to control this position now 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.669
 I will show you how to counter these two 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.280
 Position is very simple ordinary flash drive 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.830
 skokom 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.180
 explodes yourself see here somewhere her 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.699
 no one ever throws therefore not 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.330
 expect to see enemies one hundred percent 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.330
 will be blind 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.039
 very efficient flash drives through glass on 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.930
 the roof when quiet is very easy you just need 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:21.280
 push up to the pipes and rush from 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.280
 4k pipes of this 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.710
 if the enemy is standing here 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.030
 Of course, such a flash drive does not go blind 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.920
 the fact that she buries somewhere there 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.730
 but no one bothers you to throw a little 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:45.810
 another flash drive to the corner 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:45.810
 platform and throw a little higher roof 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.360
 and the position of the hour is worth the enemies because 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.920
 There are not blindly default flash drives if 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.990
 let's say here cuddle up about the whole 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.990
 nothing stands on no flash drive at all 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.060
 flash glass can be thrown because of defense
