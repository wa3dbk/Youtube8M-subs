Red Bull Snow Charge is a race where 200 riders start at once,

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:37.159
find their boards, and head for the goal.

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.269
Everything depends on the start. 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.199
Anyone can take part. Our youngest is 6 years old.

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.199
All you do is head for the goal ahead of everyone else.

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:14.190
It's a race with very simple rules and is quite popular.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.160
I've never been in a race where everyone heads for the goal at once,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.160
so it was like a festival.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
I couldn't find my board, but it was fun!

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
It was great!

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.960
It was hard to find my board.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.160
I watch Red Bull videos on the website and on Youtube, so when I found out about this event,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.160
I just had to enter. I came from Shizuoka to take part today,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.160
so I'm happy I won. I hope Red Bull hosts more events like this in the future.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.860
Thank you!
