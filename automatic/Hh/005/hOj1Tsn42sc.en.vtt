00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
powered by a scan your engine so we're

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.929 
powered by a scan your engine so we're
using<00:01:27.380> good<00:01:28.130> technology<00:01:28.760> here<00:01:29.000> with<00:01:31.030> AdBlue

so you see the scan your engine with the

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:47.710 
so you see the scan your engine with the
scr<00:01:41.110> filter<00:01:42.110> boost<00:01:42.350> there<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:45.850> all<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.150> the

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
scr filter boost there and all the the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.330

radiator<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.320> sealed<00:01:48.590> off<00:01:48.770> from<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.040> engine

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
radiator is sealed off from the engine

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.340 
radiator is sealed off from the engine
compartment<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.299> draws<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.750> air<00:01:50.780> in<00:01:51.080> from

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
compartment so it draws the air in from

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.710 
compartment so it draws the air in from
the<00:01:51.439> side<00:01:51.650> and<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.979> top<00:01:52.150> so<00:01:53.150> from<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.479> cleaner

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
the side and the top so from the cleaner

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.370 
the side and the top so from the cleaner
areas<00:01:54.880> so<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.090> air<00:01:56.420> going<00:01:56.659> into<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.080> radiator

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
areas so the air going into the radiator

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.620 
areas so the air going into the radiator
is<00:01:57.530> clean<00:01:57.770> at<00:01:57.920> all<00:01:58.040> times<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.770> should<00:02:01.630> the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
is clean at all times and should the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.850 
is clean at all times and should the
machine<00:02:02.900> be<00:02:03.020> working<00:02:03.350> in<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.530> dusty

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
machine be working in a dusty

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.979 
machine be working in a dusty

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
environment the rear of the machine it's

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.929 
environment the rear of the machine it's
also<00:02:09.170> accessible<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.220> radiator<00:02:10.579> can<00:02:10.819> be

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
also accessible so the radiator can be

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:16.119 
also accessible so the radiator can be
cleaned<00:02:14.230> fan

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
slab wide core radiator so there's

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.390

than<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:12.980> previous<00:03:13.310> four<00:03:13.549> speed<00:03:13.849> gear

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
than the previous four speed gear

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.539 
than the previous four speed gear
transmission<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:16.450> reduce<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.599> steps<00:03:17.900> we<00:03:18.139> have

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
transmission to reduce the steps we have

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.920 
transmission to reduce the steps we have
closed<00:03:19.549> centre<00:03:19.909> hydraulics<00:03:20.419> again<00:03:20.750> to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
closed centre hydraulics again to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.349 
closed centre hydraulics again to
increase<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.530> efficiency<00:03:22.359> electronically

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
increase the efficiency electronically

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.869 
increase the efficiency electronically
controlled<00:03:23.870> fan<00:03:24.169> also<00:03:24.980> helps<00:03:25.609> fuel

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
controlled fan also helps fuel

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.809 
controlled fan also helps fuel
efficiency<00:03:26.859> so<00:03:27.859> many<00:03:28.069> features<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.489> are

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
efficiency so many features that are

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.240 
efficiency so many features that are
geared<00:03:29.060> on<00:03:29.299> this<00:03:29.449> machine<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:30.019> get<00:03:30.139> the<00:03:30.410> the

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
geared on this machine to get the the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.420 
geared on this machine to get the the
fuel<00:03:31.549> efficiency<00:03:31.730> down<00:03:32.269> so<00:03:33.199> that's<00:03:33.739> a<00:03:33.980> big

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
fuel efficiency down so that's a big

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.809 
fuel efficiency down so that's a big
feature<00:03:34.669> and<00:03:35.120> obviously<00:03:35.480> every<00:03:36.410> ton<00:03:37.099> of<00:03:37.129> stone

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
feature and obviously every ton of stone

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.869 
feature and obviously every ton of stone
we're<00:03:38.389> told<00:03:38.599> 30%<00:03:39.230> of<00:03:39.379> a<00:03:39.440> production<00:03:40.160> cost<00:03:40.609> is

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
we're told 30% of a production cost is

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.569 
we're told 30% of a production cost is
fuel<00:03:41.329> today<00:03:41.690> so<00:03:42.590> if<00:03:42.680> we<00:03:42.769> can<00:03:42.889> get<00:03:43.040> that<00:03:43.160> down<00:03:43.400> by

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
fuel today so if we can get that down by

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.059 
fuel today so if we can get that down by
15-20<00:03:44.329> percent<00:03:44.449> as<00:03:44.780> we<00:03:44.870> can<00:03:45.109> that's<00:03:45.769> a<00:03:45.919> big

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
15-20 percent as we can that's a big

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:55.940 
15-20 percent as we can that's a big
saving<00:03:46.489> for<00:03:46.669> the<00:03:46.760> contractor<00:03:47.510> so<00:03:48.440> thank<00:03:48.620> you

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.010 

you
