00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.680
 that came to open at the end and you have to 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.900
 give all the merit not only the 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.610
 goals but to the ultimate world in which the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.920
 Professor Lara made the decision to give 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.260
 another way to help your team here 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.690
 we are already 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.850
 is the play that allows the first goal 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.610
 of the local team as it is lost overtaking 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.980
 and in the end the author of the two goals of 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.930
 team santandereano rosemary player 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.330
 Serbian number number 11 is the one 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.970
 turns the first one throwing the ball 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.340
 on the second post at ground level 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.660
 leaving without any option there was for 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.910
 he was doing what he has to 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.860
 do taking care of his stick 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.450
 with a ball filtered by the steering wheel 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.540
 that just gave is an instant the egg 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.190
 Ã¡lvarez and this free sense the one that 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.390
 allows America when the 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.700
 yours in science go at least 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.980
 equaling except that boat that gives the 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.960
 ball is key that boat that gives the ball 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.030
 and that has to do with the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.830
 intelligence of the one who charges who knows 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.720
 take advantage of the characteristics of 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.160
 the court and that error stays in the 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.440
 head of the man is that you do not change for 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.990
 for nothing the path in the direction 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.270
 of the ball lifts her up a bit 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.130
 raised gives an extra pot the value 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.270
 that allows the ball to go to 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.729
 network background we are already in the second 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.220
 time and in this half turn of the dragon 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.750
 the edge surprised the archer too 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.490
 gomez make the weak gifts of the archer who 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.490
 may be suddenly in your two 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.950
 swipes now go to the goals over there 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.080
 suddenly committed but but the 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.640
 played the stands were well placed 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.420
 in the goal is the play against 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.869
 and again 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.229
 of America the figure appeared again 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.049
 of the team like the same 16 marking two 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.240
 goals and very effective goal ball that 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.409
 he got a ball for there is one inside 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.409
 I said taste 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.869
 the two goals so far that 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.350
 are watching this is the play of 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.350
 romerito 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.700
 giving the tractor a ball the way 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.320
 of the post owner and he was very attentive 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.230
 as a true area fisherman 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.240
 educator without humans of the pau party 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.370
 they arrive a year to nail with their foreheads 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.220
 the ball in the goalkeeper's cards is 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.840
 great the tie again to the team 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.680
 American who had to go back two 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.320
 times the game and that was in two years and 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.480
 when everything appeared as a draw 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.460
 America already had better partnerships in 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.800
 the match and here it would be confirmed what puts 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.900
 the silver for the brains sums up the 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.730
 principle and Paul will be again the 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.730
 inner edge puts the ball in the background 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.990
 for graduates well deserved at the time of 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.150
 the truth because the one that almost always 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.530
 had the weight of the match was the team 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.170
 of more people here of more experience 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.290
 the American set and here with this 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.630
 goal sealed their 322 victory a triumph 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.709
 very important in the journey of the 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.709
 aspirations of america
