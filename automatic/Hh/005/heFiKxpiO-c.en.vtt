clean<00:01:59.560> up<00:01:59.649> at<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.860> bottom<00:02:00.009> when<00:02:00.250> we're<00:02:00.369> done

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
clean up at the bottom when we're done

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.779 
clean up at the bottom when we're done
we're<00:02:01.990> just<00:02:02.020> buffing<00:02:02.590> kind<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:02.920> up<00:02:03.190> almost<00:02:03.490> to

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
we're just buffing kind of up almost to

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.170 
we're just buffing kind of up almost to
your<00:02:03.880> crease<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.979> letting<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.340> fade<00:02:06.640> out<00:02:06.880> and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
your crease but letting it fade out and

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.639 
your crease but letting it fade out and
then<00:02:07.270> I'm<00:02:07.330> gonna<00:02:07.450> take<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.720> same<00:02:07.930> brush<00:02:08.170> and

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
then I'm gonna take the same brush and

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.610 
then I'm gonna take the same brush and
dip<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:09.670> in<00:02:09.910> kind<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:10.989> a<00:02:11.080> color<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.500> would

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
dip it in kind of a color that I would

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.780 
dip it in kind of a color that I would
use<00:02:11.769> in<00:02:11.920> her<00:02:12.010> crease<00:02:12.310> which<00:02:12.550> would<00:02:12.670> probably

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
use in her crease which would probably

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.550 
use in her crease which would probably
be<00:02:13.000> like<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.420> color<00:02:13.860> just<00:02:14.860> get<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.069> little<00:02:15.250> bit

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
