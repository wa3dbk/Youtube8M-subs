00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
interesting aspects i also wanted to

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.200 
interesting aspects i also wanted to
mention<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:58.229> camera<00:04:58.860> because<00:04:59.700> of<00:04:59.850> the<00:04:59.940> depth

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
mention the camera because of the depth

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.480 
mention the camera because of the depth
of<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.450> phone<00:05:00.690> it<00:05:00.900> allows<00:05:01.169> for<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:02.990> 1<00:05:03.990> /<00:05:04.830> 2<00:05:05.220> point

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
of the phone it allows for a 1 / 2 point

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.430 
of the phone it allows for a 1 / 2 point
3<00:05:05.550> inch<00:05:07.400> one<00:05:08.400> and<00:05:08.580> one<00:05:08.850> two<00:05:09.150> thirds<00:05:09.540> sensor

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
3 inch one and one two thirds sensor

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.310 
3 inch one and one two thirds sensor
size<00:05:10.680> which<00:05:11.040> is<00:05:11.070> it<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.700> same<00:05:12.000> size<00:05:12.450> sensor<00:05:13.020> is

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
size which is it the same size sensor is

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.159 
size which is it the same size sensor is
what's<00:05:13.590> in<00:05:13.740> most<00:05:14.040> of<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.820> consumer<00:05:15.630> compacts

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
what's in most of the consumer compacts

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.760 
what's in most of the consumer compacts
and<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:18.630> it's<00:05:18.750> very<00:05:18.930> interesting<00:05:19.470> it<00:05:19.560> should

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
and so it's very interesting it should

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.219 
and so it's very interesting it should
prove<00:05:20.220> to<00:05:20.639> give<00:05:21.060> it<00:05:21.210> significantly<00:05:21.990> better

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
prove to give it significantly better

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.680 
prove to give it significantly better
low-light<00:05:22.590> photos<00:05:23.160> it's<00:05:24.150> not<00:05:24.360> going<00:05:24.479> to<00:05:24.570> be

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
low-light photos it's not going to be

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.719 
low-light photos it's not going to be
magic<00:05:25.199> but<00:05:25.440> it<00:05:25.530> will<00:05:25.620> give<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:25.919> a<00:05:25.949> measurably

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
magic but it will give you a measurably

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.020 
magic but it will give you a measurably
better<00:05:26.970> low-light<00:05:27.630> photos<00:05:28.050> and<00:05:28.470> your<00:05:28.560> typical

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
better low-light photos and your typical

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.150 
better low-light photos and your typical
smartphone<00:05:30.030> camera<00:05:30.780> you<00:05:31.620> can<00:05:31.740> see<00:05:31.889> there<00:05:32.039> it's

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
smartphone camera you can see there it's

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.040 
smartphone camera you can see there it's
dual<00:05:32.340> sim<00:05:32.729> and<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.030> do<00:05:33.120> have<00:05:33.210> an<00:05:33.360> extra<00:05:33.750> slot

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
dual sim and you do have an extra slot
