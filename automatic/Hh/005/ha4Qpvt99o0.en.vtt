 fact to but the ana maria blog and incites 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.049
 of today 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.170
 Special game card there fell more 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.230
 because what special you have earned does not 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.650
 invested was usually a mixture of 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.170
 egg wheat flour milk and butter and 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.470
 yeast but ours is a little bit 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.420
 different because it will condensed milk the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.490
 ingredient of the gods is our signature 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.670
 and you will see that it makes a 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.810
 fucking difference gets pretty good and now 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.149
 people are going to do 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.730
 fry going to face with sugar and how 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.170
 Come on then, let's go there. 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.360
 recipes how is it 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.559
 we put here our cup of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.460
 wheat flour 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.100
 just look at her here and we'll go 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:56.879
 knock our eyes 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:01:01.070
 O before playing in here continues 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.070
 Our baptism plays that our eggs 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.570
 also puts our butter 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.890
 We now put the condensed milk 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.689
 the secret friend of this recipe this one here 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.630
 it's secret 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.070
 He was hiding behind the door. 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.070
 now it 's time to go there condensed milk 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.070
 Perfect 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.960
 mix everything and then only after 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.920
 It's all mixed well, let's go 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:40.790
 there we will mix homogeneously enough 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.979
 homogeneous and it stays like that little ball 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.340
 Are you going to throw candy at this time, people? 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:52.350
 says that ours will give the whole 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.440
 growth of small farmers in order to 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.900
 the oil that will grow 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.140
 understood then there only now to mix a 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.140
 little and the yeast was body there and let's 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.910
 enjoy good so now let's give 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.350
 sequence to our revenue 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.450
 first we warm our oil 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.120
 but who cares a lot I left it here 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.650
 but less a mean fire understood and now 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.850
 how are we going to do we will 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.890
 do here 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.250
 our bugs and handles with two spoons 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.750
 and that it takes away the excess and how 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.070
 people make with this mass is half a half 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.200
 sticky 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.170
 we look can make polka dots like that 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.800
 spoon understood is turning to one in 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.020
 other 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.360
 doing this movement and then there 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.320
 dumpling let loose in our oil 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.620
 hot 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.600
 Look there, ready, now, just repeat this. 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.000
 process and decorating all the cookies 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.800
 it's on the tape and it even looks golden 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.360
 and then we 'll pass on the cinnamon and 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.360
 sugar and sent it 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.690
 and we come to the end of another recipe 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.000
 Look how wonderful that our trash I 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.160
 will make it clear that neither here nor 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.070
 half of the revenue that we have 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.010
 a lot of things to fry after is just a 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.290
 small part but that is wonderful 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.390
 I already passed it on the cinnamon sugar that 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.400
 Do not know how to do this, just put a 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.640
 little sugar a little cinnamon mixed 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.140
 will play on top and there are those 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.090
 wonders here this perfection and 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.000
 you can put pieces of 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.680
 banana or guava or even chocolate in the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.050
 mass to stay here will be one 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.130
 I like banana delights anyway. 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.480
 more sensational 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.030
 just did not put it on today because I did not have 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.610
 banana but let's prove it 's a personal one 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:45.960
 prove that 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:45.960
