00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.899
 miller 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.450
 30 minutes 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.450
 1 0 for Germany 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.160
 there is the advice news 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.680
 and has given itself a few opportunities 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.850
 now it's grinding around the 68th 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:40.860
 129 country match comparison with record 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.920
 scorer gerd müller and here 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.940
 defend them hidden 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.970
 müller will not be disturbed 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.390
 But what happens the klose the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.390
 makes 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.890
 supported by dragovic 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.880
 that's great and albers here 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.880
 chance 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.920
 around 30 years and somehow good as before 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.280
 and ever 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.280
 earned 1 0 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:28.409
 you are applause for mertesacker and the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:37.250
 second ball for marco reus does not get 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:37.250
 only the 56 minute 2 0 for Germany 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.659
 is his stadium improved and in front 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:53.259
 all tactically clearly arranged German 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.259
 team 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.670
 the good also the world ranking second 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:08.970
 set against the 55 beautiful on miller los 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:18.310
 May the classics start perfectly 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:23.980
 completed 88 minutes thanks to mesut 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:28.000
 Ozil and his jacket and then it is 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.720
 just really great end played 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.130
 of course without the really physical 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.130
 Strong resistance of the Austrians 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.030
 Great ball of large orders 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.470
 and then he does that to defenders 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.810
 So in front of the gate where I should do so 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:57.180
 the opponent 's look for müller 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.180
 So what fitness is for toni kroos
