00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.059
 hello today I'm going to show you some 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.420
 cookies almost the same as raisins 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.740
 but different already you will see that they are super 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:27.249
 easy to do for this we will need 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:30.159
 sugar flour milk and butter and of 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:32.500
 everything is the same amount I'm going to do 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:34.870
 50 decade 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.440
 now we undo the 50 grams of 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.230
 butter in the microwave more or less 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.800
 that's how we moved so that it almost melted 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.800
 almost entirely 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.950
 until we have that liquid 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.309
 in another bowl we mix the flour and 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.309
 sugar 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.480
 and we mix everything very well now 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.480
 we incorporate the liquid to the solid 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.800
 and we remove 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.570
 until more or less that way you lower it to 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.130
 in a baking tray we put paper 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:27.900
 vegetable we are putting mountaineering like this and 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.900
 separated because they expand 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.760
 nothing happens if you have a little left 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.620
 round like me then it gets 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.820
 more round 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.920
 I had 31 left so you have to 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.850
 take two trays those who have done 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.690
 50 of each ingredient heat the oven 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.140
 at 180 degrees or so you'll have to 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.590
 leave in the raw 15 minutes and the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.890
 we introduce as you see now according to 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.600
 taken out of the oven and at 17 minutes is 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.280
 as it is when you will start to leave 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.720
 then the edges of gold and 18 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.720
 they were already perfect 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.220
 and I wish they could be used 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.860
 delicious 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.090
 good had been and so far thrown 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:40.140
 to my land and they are almost as you have 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.830
 done then times and free to be and there 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.390
 you will see it 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.390
