00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.620
 Y 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.620
 me 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.650
 geography 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.240
 when the eyes feel 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:25.900
 the heart of reality is better than 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.150
 so that nothing separates us that nothing 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.490
 south of that it serves to love and to go around like 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.040
 crazy if I die for it and it 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.140
 I live for another I only know that I'm sorry 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.420
 left side of the body and the desire to 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.550
 have you done little big and not me 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.800
 invades dementia in another episode what 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.110
 the opposite of love is not hatred but the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.180
 Indifference me out of patience and 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.520
 I do not want to see you anymore I do not feel that my 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.589
 life is worth less than your sick absence 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.780
 I remember your memory that I nail and 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.420
 and I contemplate pass hours while 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.610
 I sleep it is true that from your day to day I am 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.710
 slave the nail takes out another nail but 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.080
 there is always one inside has lakes if I 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.600
 you leave I can not listen just listen to 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.270
 my heart breaking between data never 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.640
 say never never never say never 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.670
 tell you I love you if you really do not feel it 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.390
 many words to you would make us return 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.090
 I do not know why I tried so many millions 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.930
 tears would not do what he does because 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.930
 the flowers 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.810
 return the 3 because they try so 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.810
 few million tears which would 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.730
 he does it because the flowers break more 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.680
 of a thousand pieces this heart without 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.170
 compassion all this love has become 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.570
 a torture instead of I love you should 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.610
 be a forgiveness because the passion to love is 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.670
 Bitterness becomes a devil 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.440
 murmurs and an angel who never stops crying 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.990
 to forgive is the wound that oozes and does not 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.260
 stop bleeding forget is hard to 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.580
 achieve by remembering that we love with madness 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.380
 feeling that lasts and that leaves you 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.600
 more lost if the love of hate 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.760
 there's only one click I keep 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.800
 badly hurt with the soul shattered if 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.320
 they were poisoned these arrows of 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.810
 stupid cupid 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.210
 in love there is nothing left only condemned 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.370
 by the rejections infinite links of 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.890
 expired license there is nothing left 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.860
 only sorrows there are no many ties 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.720
 words nights would make us return the 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.160
 three desserts try it 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.640
 neither melons 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.640
 the majority does it because the flowers 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.410
 They wanted to come back for dessert because 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.380
 try not a million tears either 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.670
 daily what we do from the now 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.790
 I have no more do not ask me for forgiveness is not 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.820
 Already for disappointment, follow your path 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.790
 there is no room for me of my present love 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.510
 in your destiny, I do not believe you, I do not 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.700
 ask for forgiveness did not exist anymore for 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.100
 disillusionment continues your way there is no place 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.170
 of me of my love present in your destiny 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.660
 frustrated in bed day by day with 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.240
 melancholy hugging me cold when so 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.370
 I just felt my cold sad soul 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.870
 I remember when you were mine how hard it was 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.270
 when I passed him I love you 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.700
 I wanted to day do not come crying me to me 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.920
 making me suffer seeing so many batches 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.260
 stupid things I do not regret 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.510
 fight for you but I regret 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.430
 have tried so many times tell me 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.710
 how many have camped in your breasts and have 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.290
 resorted with your mouth until you reach your 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.840
 navel tell me I want to send all of them 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.720
 or simply envy them for being 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.510
 with you when you cheated on me you thought about it 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.879
 in trust in a pillar 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.920
 fundamental relationship I love you 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.650
 you said and then you lied to me if you really 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.439
 scum by millions but your funeral 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.680
 many words here would make us come back 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:48.510
 I do not know why I try a 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.400
 million tears 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:56.310

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.579
 they wanted to come back I do not know why you try 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.480
 not a million rhymes would do what 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:06.540
 I do not know why now I do not have 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.959
 But do not ask me for forgiveness, it's not history 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.180
