00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
A young stoat.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
And it's not alone.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
These wild games are too much to resist.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
Stalking, chasing and ambushing: all practiced in play.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
Soon the young stoats must hunt for themselves

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
and then these athletic skills will be crucial.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.770
It's September in the English countryside.

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.910
This stoat is about to take on an adversary ten times it's size.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.510
It's too dangerous to rush straight in.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.330
Instead, the stoat's aim is to wear the rabbit down.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.250
The rabbit is flagging and the stoat's stamina is starting to make a difference.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.150
But stamina alone is not enough,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.050
the rabbit must still be overpowered.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.410
A bite to the back of the neck and a kill.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.270
The incredible agility of the stoat practiced since it was a kit

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.030
was just enough to swing the balance.
