what area right here I think this is a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.030 
what area right here I think this is a
good<00:00:38.700> example<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.510> level<00:00:40.410> design<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.860> kind

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
good example of a level design that kind

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.680 
good example of a level design that kind
of<00:00:41.100> caters<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> bunch<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.910> different<00:00:42.059> weapon

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690
