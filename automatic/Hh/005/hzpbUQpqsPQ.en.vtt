00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
side of the building just keep going in

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.020 
side of the building just keep going in
the<00:01:10.290> same<00:01:10.530> direction<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:11.249> I'm<00:01:11.429> going<00:01:11.880> in

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the same direction that I'm going in

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.510 
the same direction that I'm going in
until<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.960> actually<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.679> to<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.039> farming

until you actually get to the farming
destination<00:01:16.249> this<00:01:17.249> will<00:01:17.399> be<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:17.969> easy<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
destination this will be really easy to

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.779 
destination this will be really easy to
get<00:01:18.719> to<00:01:18.869> after<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.259> after<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> after<00:01:20.670> you've

done this once you just need to stay to
the<00:01:23.039> right<00:01:23.069> like<00:01:23.579> I<00:01:23.759> did<00:01:23.969> the<00:01:24.060> whole<00:01:24.240> time<00:01:24.509> so

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the right like I did the whole time so

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
the right like I did the whole time so
once<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.319> get<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.499> a<00:01:25.619> destination<00:01:25.799> go<00:01:26.520> ahead

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
once you get to a destination go ahead

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.219 
once you get to a destination go ahead
and<00:01:26.789> take<00:01:26.999> out<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.359> the<00:01:27.509> enemies<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.990> you

and take out all the enemies that you
see<00:01:28.649> so<00:01:29.310> take<00:01:29.579> out<00:01:29.759> all<00:01:29.999> the<00:01:30.179> enemies<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.780> that

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
see so take out all the enemies on that

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.399 
see so take out all the enemies on that
side<00:01:31.859> of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.939> map<00:01:33.179> and<00:01:33.539> take<00:01:33.899> out<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.289> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
side of the map and take out all the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.580 
side of the map and take out all the
enemies<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.889> this<00:01:35.159> side<00:01:35.429> of<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.639> map<00:01:36.590> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
enemies on this side of the map it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.770 
enemies on this side of the map it
should<00:01:38.219> be<00:01:38.340> fairly<00:01:38.520> easy<00:01:38.729> they're<00:01:39.450> not<00:01:39.600> high

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
should be fairly easy they're not high

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.190 
should be fairly easy they're not high
level<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.759> if<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.060> actually<00:01:42.420> want<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.049> do

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
level but if you actually want to do

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.219 
level but if you actually want to do
this<00:01:43.850> this<00:01:44.850> farming<00:01:45.329> method<00:01:45.719> at<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> low<00:01:46.200> level

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
this this farming method at a low level

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.489 
this this farming method at a low level
I<00:01:46.859> would<00:01:47.100> recommend<00:01:47.399> having<00:01:48.209> a<00:01:48.509> friend<00:01:49.289> come

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499

I would recommend having a friend come
with<00:01:49.709> you<00:01:49.889> but<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.729> wasn't<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.810> high<00:01:51.959> of<00:01:52.020> level

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
with you but I wasn't that high of level

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.190 
with you but I wasn't that high of level
when<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> was<00:01:52.829> doing<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.389> so<00:01:54.389> if<00:01:55.020> you're

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
when I was doing this so if you're

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.019 
when I was doing this so if you're
trying<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.439> love<00:01:55.649> love<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.490> actually<00:01:56.999> a

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
pretty good method for

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.000 
pretty good method for
up<00:01:58.820> as<00:01:59.000> well<00:01:59.290> but<00:02:00.290> if<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.530> do<00:02:00.650> this<00:02:00.830> correctly

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
could spin up to an hour and get like

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.010 
could spin up to an hour and get like
tons<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.310> jobs<00:02:58.630> probably<00:02:59.630> get<00:02:59.870> some

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
tons of jobs probably get some

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.789 
tons of jobs probably get some
legendaries<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:00.920> whatnot<00:03:01.420> but<00:03:02.440> yeah<00:03:03.440> this<00:03:03.620> is

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
legendaries and whatnot but yeah this is

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.650 
legendaries and whatnot but yeah this is
also<00:03:03.980> good<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:04.519> leveling<00:03:04.970> up<00:03:05.090> too<00:03:05.299> so<00:03:05.540> if

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
also good for leveling up too so if

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.199 
also good for leveling up too so if
you're<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.900> load<00:03:06.170> level<00:03:06.590> um<00:03:06.830> this<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:07.880> actually

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
you're a load level um this is actually

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.690 
you're a load level um this is actually
a<00:03:08.269> pretty<00:03:08.420> good<00:03:08.600> spot<00:03:08.900> for<00:03:09.400> leveling<00:03:10.400> up<00:03:10.549> i

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
a pretty good spot for leveling up i

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.970 
a pretty good spot for leveling up i
think<00:03:10.910> i<00:03:11.000> started<00:03:11.360> off<00:03:11.450> off<00:03:11.780> at<00:03:12.110> like<00:03:12.260> level<00:03:12.680> 4

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
think i started off off at like level 4

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.810 
think i started off off at like level 4
or<00:03:13.280> some<00:03:14.530> when<00:03:15.530> i<00:03:15.560> was<00:03:15.709> doing<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:16.400> footage

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
or some when i was doing this footage

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.340 
or some when i was doing this footage
and<00:03:17.209> i<00:03:17.810> think<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.170> ended<00:03:18.530> at<00:03:18.709> level<00:03:19.640> 7<00:03:20.180> 7<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.290> a

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
and i think it ended at level 7 7 and a

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.500 
and i think it ended at level 7 7 and a
half<00:03:21.380> almost<00:03:21.739> level<00:03:22.370> eight<00:03:22.610> so<00:03:23.239> it's<00:03:23.390> pretty

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
half almost level eight so it's pretty

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.870 
half almost level eight so it's pretty
good<00:03:23.750> for<00:03:23.810> leveling<00:03:24.410> up<00:03:24.530> in<00:03:24.680> one<00:03:24.860> not<00:03:25.100> if<00:03:25.760> you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
good for leveling up in one not if you

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.729 
good for leveling up in one not if you
guys<00:03:26.030> have<00:03:26.209> any<00:03:26.420> issues<00:03:26.840> with<00:03:26.870> this<00:03:27.230> comment
