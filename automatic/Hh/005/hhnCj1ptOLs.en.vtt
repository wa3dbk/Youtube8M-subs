00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I stopped playing domination up 77 and

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.320 
I stopped playing domination up 77 and
play<00:02:11.340> free-for-all<00:02:11.969> till<00:02:12.810> level<00:02:13.049> 80

as I kept getting on teams that did not

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.790 
as I kept getting on teams that did not
understand<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.320> they<00:02:18.410> were<00:02:18.530> playing

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
understand that they were playing

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.590 
understand that they were playing
domination<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.930> was<00:02:21.080> kind<00:02:21.320> of<00:02:21.440> sad<00:02:22.420> 12<00:02:23.420> win

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
domination and it was kind of sad 12 win

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.750 
domination and it was kind of sad 12 win
streak<00:02:23.900> which<00:02:24.110> will<00:02:24.380> probably<00:02:25.070> increase<00:02:25.430> if<00:02:25.640> I

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
streak which will probably increase if I

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.250

great but I want all my matches and if

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.589 
great but I want all my matches and if
you<00:05:58.210> do<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.169> math<00:05:59.199> it's<00:05:59.650> 13<00:06:00.129> matches<00:06:00.699> getting

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
you do the math it's 13 matches getting

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.350

free-throw<00:06:05.259> is<00:06:05.289> 3.5<00:06:06.219> one<00:06:06.900> so<00:06:07.900> I<00:06:08.080> think<00:06:08.139> that's

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
free-throw is 3.5 one so I think that's

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.769 
free-throw is 3.5 one so I think that's
pretty<00:06:08.949> snazzy<00:06:09.430> and<00:06:09.879> then<00:06:10.389> the<00:06:10.509> only<00:06:10.539> other

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:10.779 
pretty snazzy and then the only other

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:13.890 
pretty snazzy and then the only other
one<00:06:11.169> is<00:06:11.289> domination<00:06:12.270> there's<00:06:13.270> my<00:06:13.509> score
