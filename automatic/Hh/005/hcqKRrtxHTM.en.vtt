00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.650
 Good day dear every time 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.720
 that got on our channel 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.300
 prepare to be surprised because every new 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:21.350
 video can be unpredictable with us 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:27.310
 you can find a video from you play it 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:30.460
 was my you just look how much 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.640
 run away i don't know just generally i don't know 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.110
 no one there, I did not say that, so 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.610
 3rd 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:54.800
 outpost everything is ready look at me i am dead 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:58.210
 oh oh oh I found the chest love so cool 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.680
 up to all sorts of what reals and review 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:07.209
 then I made a phone to the city already 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.209
 I made more difficult 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.539
 dudes who hunt us like you 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.460
 I was asked to do that is I set 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:19.330
 the usual sprite citizen of his that year 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.400
 can put and made autonomous 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.530
 movement to the hero the speed of such and such 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.770
 purity maximum speed high 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.159
 speed to move out and clean 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.170
 so to say the delay between one step I 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.729
 I do not put on a maximum because if not 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.830
 put on the maximum it looks like you 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.320
 not realistic but just like that 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.340
 continuous we go but of course 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.340
 funny montage 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.750
