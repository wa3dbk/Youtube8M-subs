00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.729 
so for fun like I honestly didn't
believe<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:03.420> gonna<00:01:03.629> work<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.080> charged<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
believe it was gonna work I charged the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.550 
believe it was gonna work I charged the
actual<00:01:05.220> battery<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.689> chassis<00:01:07.020> adapter

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
actual battery on the chassis adapter

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.620 
actual battery on the chassis adapter
and<00:01:08.930> it<00:01:09.930> actually<00:01:10.140> held<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> charge<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.250> it's

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
and it actually held the charge and it's

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.700 
and it actually held the charge and it's
doing<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.780> really<00:01:12.930> well<00:01:13.140> actually<00:01:13.380> which<00:01:13.680> is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
doing and really well actually which is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.590 
doing and really well actually which is
surprising<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.490> I'm<00:01:15.090> pretty<00:01:15.299> sure<00:01:15.390> they

surprising and I'm pretty sure they

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.420 
surprising and I'm pretty sure they
didn't<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.020> rebuilt<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.100> mean

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
didn't have it rebuilt because I mean

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.770

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.290 
films with it I know it's not real
capable<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:30.830> like<00:02:31.070> crazy<00:02:31.490> editing<00:02:32.150> or

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
capable of like crazy editing or

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.140 
capable of like crazy editing or
anything<00:02:32.330> like<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:32.720> but<00:02:33.850> should<00:02:34.850> be<00:02:34.910> pretty

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
anything like that but should be pretty

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.920 
anything like that but should be pretty
cool<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:36.110> see<00:02:36.230> what<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.380> can<00:02:36.530> do<00:02:36.680> with<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.980> and

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
cool to to see what I can do with it and

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.720 
cool to to see what I can do with it and
looking<00:02:38.930> forward<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.410> have<00:02:40.160> some<00:02:40.340> ideas<00:02:40.640> that

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
looking forward to have some ideas that

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.980 
looking forward to have some ideas that
I<00:02:40.790> want<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.030> do<00:02:41.150> so<00:02:41.360> I'm<00:02:41.480> hoping<00:02:41.690> that's<00:02:41.840> what

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
I want to do so I'm hoping that's what

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.150 
I want to do so I'm hoping that's what
the<00:02:42.080> next<00:02:42.170> video<00:02:42.470> will<00:02:42.590> be<00:02:42.620> about

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
the next video will be about

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.480 
the next video will be about
but<00:02:43.910> um<00:02:44.440> yeah<00:02:45.440> this<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:45.740> pretty<00:02:45.890> much<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.130> like

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
but um yeah this is pretty much it like

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.949 
but um yeah this is pretty much it like
it's<00:02:46.670> pretty<00:02:46.880> straightforward<00:02:47.120> well<00:02:47.870> the

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
it's pretty straightforward well the

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.640 
it's pretty straightforward well the
crazy<00:02:48.110> controls<00:02:48.650> on<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:49.190> have<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.110> beta<00:02:51.110> VCR

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
crazy controls on it I have the beta VCR

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.430 
crazy controls on it I have the beta VCR
to<00:02:52.280> play<00:02:52.459> them<00:02:52.580> back<00:02:52.730> on<00:02:52.940> but<00:02:53.300> it's<00:02:54.050> not<00:02:54.230> really

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
to play them back on but it's not really

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.210 
to play them back on but it's not really
editing<00:02:54.800> or<00:02:55.010> anything<00:02:55.160> like<00:02:55.370> that<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:56.680> I'm<00:02:57.680> to

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
editing or anything like that so I'm to

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.370 
editing or anything like that so I'm to
record<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.090> videos<00:02:59.420> on<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.690> my<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.840> you<00:03:00.050> Maddox

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
record the videos on to my to you Maddox

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.340 
record the videos on to my to you Maddox
and<00:03:00.790> edit<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:02.060> way<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:02.350> hopefully

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
and edit it that way so hopefully

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.150 
and edit it that way so hopefully
that'll<00:03:03.590> be<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.920> next<00:03:04.040> video<00:03:04.400> all<00:03:05.000> right
