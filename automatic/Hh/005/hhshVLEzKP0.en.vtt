team that's gonna win the whole thing i

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.960 
team that's gonna win the whole thing i

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
sought a lot people are saying he lost

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.599 
sought a lot people are saying he lost
but<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.269> won<00:00:24.480> before<00:00:24.689> then<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:26.279> what

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
but you won before then and so what what

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.490 
but you won before then and so what what
are<00:00:26.699> your<00:00:26.789> thoughts<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.840> first<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.349> all<00:00:28.439> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
are your thoughts so first of all I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.279 
are your thoughts so first of all I
think<00:00:28.680> our<00:00:28.920> first<00:00:29.189> game<00:00:29.460> against<00:00:30.289> flash

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
think our first game against flash

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.530 
think our first game against flash
wolves<00:00:31.470> was<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.219> end<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.820> our<00:00:32.969> hands<00:00:33.390> I

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
wolves was in the end in our hands I

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.900 
wolves was in the end in our hands I
think<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.110> played<00:00:34.469> our<00:00:34.620> game<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.190> had

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
think we played our game and we had

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.670 
think we played our game and we had
enough<00:00:36.149> open<00:00:36.510> freedom<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.469> that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
enough open freedom to do so and that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.970 
enough open freedom to do so and that
just<00:00:37.829> enabled<00:00:38.160> us<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> claim<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> win<00:00:39.210> pretty

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
just enabled us to claim the win pretty

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.700 
just enabled us to claim the win pretty
significantly<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.100> our<00:00:41.250> favor<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:42.649> saw<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
significantly in our favor I saw the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.799 
significantly in our favor I saw the
game<00:00:43.920> against<00:00:44.520> cloud<00:00:44.940> nine<00:00:45.149> where<00:00:45.480> they<00:00:45.660> hold

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
game against cloud nine where they hold

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.049 
game against cloud nine where they hold
on<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.309> playing<00:00:47.309> against<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.640> team<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.820> has<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
on to playing against a team that has a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.450 
on to playing against a team that has a
really<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:49.050> high<00:00:49.230> lead<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.710> think<00:00:50.309> that

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
really like high lead I think that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.250 
really like high lead I think that
Emilio's<00:00:51.030> did<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.270> really<00:00:51.420> great<00:00:51.570> job<00:00:51.690> trying

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
Emilio's did a really great job trying

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
Emilio's did a really great job trying
to<00:00:52.469> win<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> game<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.039> cloud<00:00:53.430> nine<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.850> just

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
to win the game for cloud nine I just

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.830 
to win the game for cloud nine I just
think<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.510> their<00:00:54.780> overall<00:00:55.969> let's<00:00:56.969> say<00:00:57.210> team

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
think that their overall let's say team

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.479 
think that their overall let's say team
dynamic<00:00:58.260> was<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.649> lacking<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.010> game<00:00:59.280> I

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
dynamic was just lacking that game I

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.819 
dynamic was just lacking that game I
guess<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.690> can't<00:01:00.870> blame<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.260> maybe<00:01:01.559> not

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
guess you can't blame it on maybe not

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.319 
guess you can't blame it on maybe not
being<00:01:02.219> able<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.820> perform<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.210> stage

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
being able to perform on that stage

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.810 
being able to perform on that stage
maybe<00:01:04.080> something<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.580> think

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
maybe something like that I just think

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.760 
maybe something like that I just think
that<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.869> play<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.350> flash<00:01:07.590> worse

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
that if we play with flash worse

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.530 
that if we play with flash worse
tomorrow<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.280> think<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> be

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
tomorrow I think we just have to be

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.539 
tomorrow I think we just have to be
prepared<00:01:09.720> be<00:01:10.350> able<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> play<00:01:10.830> our<00:01:11.010> game<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
prepared be able to play our game and

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.250 
prepared be able to play our game and
that<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.450> enable<00:01:12.630> us<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> claim<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that just will enable us to claim the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.469 
that just will enable us to claim the
wind<00:01:13.409> once<00:01:13.590> again<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.979> mean<00:01:14.790> how<00:01:14.880> confident<00:01:15.330> are

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
wind once again I mean how confident are

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.670 
wind once again I mean how confident are
you<00:01:15.540> sounds<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.049> you're<00:01:16.170> pretty<00:01:16.200> confident

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
you sounds like you're pretty confident

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.870 
you sounds like you're pretty confident
like<00:01:16.920> yeah<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.250> play<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> game<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.759> we

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
like yeah we just play the game and we

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.719 
like yeah we just play the game and we
went<00:01:18.030> um<00:01:18.900> no<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.159> bigger<00:01:20.549> deal<00:01:20.610> than

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
went um no it's just a bigger deal than

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.090 
went um no it's just a bigger deal than
just<00:01:21.299> saying<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.689> win<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.080> think<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:22.920> we're

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
just saying we win I think that if we're

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.859 
just saying we win I think that if we're
able<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.430> play<00:01:23.610> our<00:01:23.759> game<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.540> will<00:01:24.689> definitely

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
able to play our game we will definitely

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.380 
able to play our game we will definitely
win<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:26.220> also<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.640> thing<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.180> our

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
win but that's also a thing up to our

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.910 
win but that's also a thing up to our
opponents<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.049> they<00:01:28.170> let<00:01:28.320> us<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.619> what<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.890> want

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
opponents if they let us do what we want

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.149 
opponents if they let us do what we want
to<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.689> we<00:01:30.689> feel<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.079> we're<00:01:31.320> prepared<00:01:31.740> we

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
to do we feel like we're prepared we

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.010 
to do we feel like we're prepared we
have<00:01:32.280> done<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.880> lot<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> researchers<00:01:33.540> towards

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
have done a lot of researchers towards

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.649 
have done a lot of researchers towards
them<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:35.759> catch

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
them so all we have to do is just catch

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.880 
them so all we have to do is just catch
on<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.350> thought<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.860> had

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
on to that thought that we had

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.590 
on to that thought that we had
beforehand<00:01:38.520> maybe<00:01:38.880> develop<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.540> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
beforehand maybe develop it in a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.240 
beforehand maybe develop it in a
different<00:01:39.750> way<00:01:39.930> maybe<00:01:40.710> have<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.950> different

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
different way maybe have a different

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.130 
different way maybe have a different
side<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:41.579> also<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.909> approach<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.720> I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
side we also have to approach that and I

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.990 
side we also have to approach that and I
think<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:44.009> into<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> game<00:01:44.490> having<00:01:44.850> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
think if we go into the game having a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.429 
think if we go into the game having a
good<00:01:45.149> plan<00:01:45.360> our<00:01:45.509> minds<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.960> should<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.259> claimed

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
good plan our minds we should be claimed

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.560 
good plan our minds we should be claimed
the<00:01:46.530> window<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:48.090> chance<00:01:48.420> at

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the window do you have a chance at

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.700 
the window do you have a chance at
winning<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.899> tournament<00:01:49.049> cuz<00:01:49.409> everybody

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
winning this tournament cuz everybody

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.740 
winning this tournament cuz everybody

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
says Tigers is going to win it and

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.749 
says Tigers is going to win it and
they'll<00:01:51.930> go<00:01:52.079> undefeated<00:01:52.350> or<00:01:52.740> whatever<00:01:53.009> they

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
they'll go undefeated or whatever they

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.550 
they'll go undefeated or whatever they
think<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
think that do you think you have a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.649 
think that do you think you have a
chance<00:01:55.710> at<00:01:55.860> winning<00:01:56.009> us<00:01:56.159> um<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.969> think<00:01:57.060> Tigers

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
chance at winning us um I think Tigers

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.499 
chance at winning us um I think Tigers
are<00:01:57.780> not<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:57.990> bebo<00:01:58.369> they<00:01:59.369> showed<00:02:00.149> us<00:02:00.299> quite

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
are not on bebo they showed us quite

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.149 
are not on bebo they showed us quite
some<00:02:00.719> flaws<00:02:00.960> they<00:02:01.290> gave<00:02:01.439> us<00:02:01.590> an<00:02:01.680> early<00:02:01.740> lead<00:02:01.979> as

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
some flaws they gave us an early lead as

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.010 
some flaws they gave us an early lead as
well<00:02:02.369> which<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:02.969> couldn't<00:02:03.240> hold<00:02:03.329> onto<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.659> think

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
well which we couldn't hold onto I think

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.660 
well which we couldn't hold onto I think
we<00:02:04.079> were<00:02:04.200> 15<00:02:04.829> minutes<00:02:04.860> almost

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
we were 15 minutes almost

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.670 
we were 15 minutes almost
go<00:02:05.759> ahead<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:06.960> suddenly<00:02:07.320> drop

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
go ahead and then just suddenly drop

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.260 
go ahead and then just suddenly drop
with<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.009> bad<00:02:08.160> fight<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.580> think<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.060> our

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
with one bad fight I think that our

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.850 
with one bad fight I think that our
shotcalling<00:02:09.750> mid<00:02:10.020> game<00:02:10.170> was<00:02:10.349> really<00:02:10.530> poorly

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
shotcalling mid game was really poorly

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.370 
shotcalling mid game was really poorly
and<00:02:11.130> we<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.580> lack<00:02:12.180> communication<00:02:12.420> did<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.230> lot

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
and we just lack communication did a lot

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.620 
and we just lack communication did a lot
of<00:02:13.410> stupid<00:02:13.709> stuff<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.550> basically<00:02:15.180> gave

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
of stupid stuff and just basically gave

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.210 
of stupid stuff and just basically gave
them<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.989> win<00:02:16.140> rather<00:02:16.590> than<00:02:16.800> them<00:02:17.010> winning

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
them the win rather than them winning

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.729 
them the win rather than them winning
over<00:02:17.489> us<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:18.270> think<00:02:18.720> G<00:02:18.870> right<00:02:19.170> now<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.500> probably

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
over us I think G right now is probably

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.050 
over us I think G right now is probably
the<00:02:19.890> strongest<00:02:20.069> team<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.489> tournament<00:02:20.670> but

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
the strongest team in the tournament but

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.880 
the strongest team in the tournament but
they're<00:02:21.209> definitely<00:02:21.360> beatable<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:22.230> wouldn't

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
they're definitely beatable I wouldn't

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.080 
they're definitely beatable I wouldn't
say<00:02:23.010> we're<00:02:23.190> going<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.430> win<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.670> tournament

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
say we're going to win the tournament

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.020 
say we're going to win the tournament
just<00:02:24.630> yet<00:02:24.840> maybe<00:02:25.620> when<00:02:25.890> were<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.370> semis<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.910> we

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
just yet maybe when were in semis and we

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.180 
just yet maybe when were in semis and we
see<00:02:27.180> how<00:02:27.450> G<00:02:28.080> performed<00:02:28.620> against<00:02:28.860> other<00:02:29.010> teams

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
see how G performed against other teams

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.400 
see how G performed against other teams
may<00:02:29.370> we<00:02:29.489> expose<00:02:29.940> more<00:02:30.150> weaknesses<00:02:30.569> just<00:02:31.260> by

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
may we expose more weaknesses just by

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.890 
may we expose more weaknesses just by
watching<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.519> replays<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.269> trying<00:02:33.780> to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
watching the replays and trying to

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.449 
watching the replays and trying to
figure<00:02:34.140> out<00:02:34.170> how<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.470> play<00:02:34.709> were<00:02:34.890> system<00:02:35.250> but

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
figure out how to play were system but

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.100 
figure out how to play were system but
overall<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.150> think<00:02:36.300> we<00:02:36.599> have<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.750> good<00:02:36.870> shot<00:02:36.930> at

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
overall I think we have a good shot at

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.479 
overall I think we have a good shot at
winning<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.500> tournament<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:38.010> just<00:02:38.190> need<00:02:38.370> to

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
winning the tournament we just need to

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.490 
winning the tournament we just need to
keep<00:02:38.940> our<00:02:39.060> heads<00:02:39.300> come<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.870> play<00:02:40.050> our<00:02:40.230> game

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
keep our heads come and play our game

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.530 
keep our heads come and play our game
instead<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:40.980> losing<00:02:41.580> our<00:02:41.880> mind<00:02:42.150> throughout

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
instead of losing our mind throughout

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.900 
instead of losing our mind throughout
one<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.739> games<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.519> should<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:44.760> won

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
one of the games that we should have won

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.660 
one of the games that we should have won
I<00:02:45.120> know<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.440> lot<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.950> North<00:02:47.130> American<00:02:47.220> teams

I know a lot of the North American teams

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.270 
I know a lot of the North American teams

nine and G Tigers but we decline since
then<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.000> same<00:03:09.180> group<00:03:09.390> as<00:03:09.480> us<00:03:09.660> so<00:03:10.200> we<00:03:10.470> didn't

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
then the same group as us so we didn't

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.199 
then the same group as us so we didn't
really<00:03:10.709> have<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> shot<00:03:11.100> at<00:03:11.459> practicing<00:03:12.030> was

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
really have a shot at practicing was

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.090 
really have a shot at practicing was
international<00:03:12.810> teams<00:03:12.989> which<00:03:13.590> doesn't<00:03:14.070> give

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
international teams which doesn't give

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.490 
international teams which doesn't give
us<00:03:14.400> an<00:03:14.579> advantage<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.570> rather<00:03:15.810> as<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.019> deficit

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
us an advantage it rather as a deficit

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.470 
us an advantage it rather as a deficit
if<00:03:16.620> other<00:03:16.769> teams<00:03:17.010> crimp<00:03:17.340> them<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.670> think<00:03:18.329> that

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
if other teams crimp them I think that

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.819 
if other teams crimp them I think that
throughout<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.109> tournament<00:03:19.260> right<00:03:19.590> now<00:03:19.769> we

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
throughout the tournament right now we

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.740 
throughout the tournament right now we
gain<00:03:20.130> experience<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:21.000> want<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.239> gain<00:03:21.480> and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
gain experience that we want to gain and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.479 
gain experience that we want to gain and
there's<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.930> national<00:03:22.290> ground<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.890> having<00:03:23.430> a

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
there's a national ground and having a

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.710 
there's a national ground and having a
big<00:03:23.609> tournaments<00:03:24.090> now<00:03:24.239> I<00:03:24.269> back<00:03:24.510> might

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
big tournaments now I back might

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.330 
big tournaments now I back might
strengthen<00:03:25.109> us<00:03:25.410> going<00:03:25.829> towards<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.190> future

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
strengthen us going towards the future

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.370 
strengthen us going towards the future
looking<00:03:27.000> at<00:03:27.120> worse<00:03:27.299> or<00:03:27.570> whatever<00:03:27.840> tournament

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
looking at worse or whatever tournament

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.460 
looking at worse or whatever tournament
comes<00:03:28.530> up<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:29.609> think<00:03:30.120> right<00:03:30.269> now<00:03:30.450> we're<00:03:30.750> having

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
comes up I think right now we're having

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.440 
comes up I think right now we're having
a<00:03:31.590> good<00:03:32.070> time<00:03:32.130> playing<00:03:32.609> against<00:03:33.060> those<00:03:33.150> teams

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
a good time playing against those teams

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.330 
a good time playing against those teams
maybe<00:03:33.750> finding<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.650> different<00:03:34.769> play<00:03:35.010> style

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
maybe finding a different play style

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.650 
maybe finding a different play style
maybe<00:03:35.519> they<00:03:35.670> expose<00:03:35.910> weaknesses<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.450> we

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
maybe they expose weaknesses that we

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.090 
maybe they expose weaknesses that we
didn't<00:03:36.900> know<00:03:36.959> before<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.470> everything<00:03:37.859> that<00:03:37.890> we

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
didn't know before so everything that we

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.039 
didn't know before so everything that we
learn<00:03:38.280> here<00:03:38.579> we<00:03:38.910> can<00:03:39.060> transition<00:03:39.359> into<00:03:39.540> LCS

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
learn here we can transition into LCS

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.660 
learn here we can transition into LCS
which<00:03:40.260> gives<00:03:40.799> us<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:40.980> knee<00:03:41.190> towards<00:03:41.519> other

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
which gives us a knee towards other

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.400 
which gives us a knee towards other
teams<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.209> that's<00:03:42.600> basically<00:03:42.959> what<00:03:43.290> we're

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
teams and that's basically what we're

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.599 
teams and that's basically what we're
planning<00:03:43.560> with<00:03:43.799> planning<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.130> have<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.459> the

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
planning with planning to have like the

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.370 
planning with planning to have like the
best<00:03:44.700> possible<00:03:44.940> time<00:03:45.329> here<00:03:45.630> during<00:03:46.230> the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
best possible time here during the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.229 
best possible time here during the
tournament<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:47.190> game<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:47.700> outside<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.060> the

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
tournament in game and outside of the

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.210 
tournament in game and outside of the
game<00:03:48.420> but<00:03:48.660> overall<00:03:49.290> it's<00:03:49.560> really<00:03:49.859> important

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
game but overall it's really important

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.340 
game but overall it's really important
for<00:03:50.250> us<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.459> just<00:03:50.700> try<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.480> show<00:03:51.989> what<00:03:52.200> we're

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
for us to just try to show what we're

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.410 
for us to just try to show what we're
capable<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:53.160> get<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.120> best<00:03:54.239> experience

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
capable of and get the best experience

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.289 
capable of and get the best experience
that<00:03:54.959> we<00:03:55.049> can<00:03:55.170> get<00:03:55.319> out<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.590> this<00:03:55.910> this<00:03:56.910> event

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
that we can get out of this this event

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.870 
that we can get out of this this event
seems<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:58.380> huge<00:03:58.680> like<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.069> I<00:03:59.280> remember<00:03:59.700> last

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
seems so huge like the I remember last

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.300 
seems so huge like the I remember last
year<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.420> league<00:04:00.720> stage<00:04:01.380> seemed<00:04:01.709> really

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
year that the league stage seemed really

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.770 
year that the league stage seemed really
big<00:04:02.549> but<00:04:02.670> now<00:04:02.819> they've<00:04:02.970> blown<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.329> out<00:04:03.389> and<00:04:03.660> so

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
big but now they've blown it out and so

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.710 
big but now they've blown it out and so
that<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.019> whole<00:04:04.170> stadium<00:04:04.410> essentially<00:04:05.100> is<00:04:05.220> is

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
that the whole stadium essentially is is

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.449 
that the whole stadium essentially is is
one<00:04:06.720> stage<00:04:07.019> for<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.010> what<00:04:08.160> was<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.370> like

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
one stage for you what was it like

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.039 
one stage for you what was it like
playing<00:04:08.639> on<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.420> stage<00:04:09.630> when<00:04:09.840> you've<00:04:09.930> been

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
playing on that stage when you've been

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.509 
playing on that stage when you've been
around<00:04:10.109> for<00:04:10.410> a<00:04:10.440> while<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:10.889> in<00:04:11.100> front<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
around for a while but in front of the

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.009 
around for a while but in front of the
Polish<00:04:11.880> crowd<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.329> all<00:04:12.389> I<00:04:12.450> kind<00:04:12.660> of<00:04:12.720> thing<00:04:12.840> I

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
Polish crowd and all I kind of thing I

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.410 
Polish crowd and all I kind of thing I
thought<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.220> am<00:04:14.340> kind<00:04:14.489> of<00:04:14.610> it's<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.879> in<00:04:15.150> two

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
thought that I am kind of it's a in two

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.029 
thought that I am kind of it's a in two
years<00:04:15.569> ago<00:04:15.870> when<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.080> was<00:04:16.200> playing<00:04:16.349> there<00:04:16.650> they

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
years ago when I was playing there they

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.229 
years ago when I was playing there they
couldn't<00:04:17.310> basically

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
couldn't basically

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.699 
couldn't basically
something<00:04:18.630> on<00:04:18.720> top<00:04:18.870> there<00:04:19.079> because<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.560> crowd

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
something on top there because the crowd

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.409 
something on top there because the crowd
was<00:04:19.769> huge<00:04:20.190> everything<00:04:20.940> was<00:04:21.060> basically

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
was huge everything was basically

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.210 
was huge everything was basically
shaking<00:04:21.959> when<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.319> cloud<00:04:22.500> clapped<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.069> i

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
shaking when the cloud clapped and i

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.279 
shaking when the cloud clapped and i
think<00:04:23.759> that<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.060> music<00:04:24.449> itself<00:04:24.750> was<00:04:25.020> also

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
think that the music itself was also

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.920 
think that the music itself was also
making<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.680> whole<00:04:26.669> stage<00:04:26.970> vibrate<00:04:27.539> and<00:04:27.780> i

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
making the whole stage vibrate and i

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.659 
making the whole stage vibrate and i
feel<00:04:28.319> like<00:04:28.440> they've<00:04:28.650> set<00:04:29.130> on<00:04:29.220> something<00:04:29.430> on

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
feel like they've set on something on

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.249 
feel like they've set on something on
top<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.240> like<00:04:30.479> that<00:04:30.690> they<00:04:30.780> put<00:04:30.930> a<00:04:30.960> really

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
top of that like that they put a really

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.629 
top of that like that they put a really
high<00:04:31.349> standard<00:04:31.410> on<00:04:31.889> two<00:04:31.979> tournaments<00:04:32.430> in<00:04:32.520> my

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
high standard on two tournaments in my

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.029 
high standard on two tournaments in my
eyes<00:04:32.900> it's<00:04:33.900> incredible<00:04:34.410> how<00:04:34.560> much<00:04:34.620> effort

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
eyes it's incredible how much effort

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.850 
eyes it's incredible how much effort

anything<00:05:23.340> we<00:05:23.789> had<00:05:23.880> a<00:05:23.909> really<00:05:24.090> convincing

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
anything we had a really convincing

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.080 
anything we had a really convincing
start<00:05:24.900> 8<00:05:25.110> and<00:05:25.289> 0<00:05:25.370> we<00:05:26.370> felt<00:05:26.610> like<00:05:26.669> we<00:05:26.849> were<00:05:26.969> in<00:05:27.030> a

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
start 8 and 0 we felt like we were in a

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.969 
start 8 and 0 we felt like we were in a
good<00:05:27.240> driver<00:05:27.539> seat<00:05:27.810> I<00:05:28.020> think<00:05:28.380> we<00:05:28.440> got<00:05:28.469> in<00:05:28.680> a<00:05:28.740> bit

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
good driver seat I think we got in a bit

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.469 
good driver seat I think we got in a bit
of<00:05:29.009> a<00:05:29.130> slump<00:05:29.370> where<00:05:29.699> we<00:05:29.880> didn't<00:05:30.120> take<00:05:30.270> things

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
of a slump where we didn't take things

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.140 
of a slump where we didn't take things
too<00:05:30.840> serious<00:05:31.289> but<00:05:31.500> we<00:05:31.889> got<00:05:32.039> back<00:05:32.490> from<00:05:32.669> it<00:05:32.849> we

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
too serious but we got back from it we

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.330 
too serious but we got back from it we
managed<00:05:33.630> to<00:05:33.659> pull<00:05:33.960> back<00:05:34.139> from<00:05:34.259> it<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:34.590> we<00:05:35.190> just

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
managed to pull back from it and we just

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.010 
managed to pull back from it and we just
put<00:05:35.460> a<00:05:35.490> lot<00:05:35.610> of<00:05:35.639> emphasis<00:05:36.120> into<00:05:36.360> trying<00:05:36.900> to

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020

eventually are you adopting to Berlin
hell<00:05:44.099> yeah<00:05:44.250> it's<00:05:44.880> a<00:05:45.030> big<00:05:45.210> change<00:05:45.449> i<00:05:45.690> think<00:05:45.900> that

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
hell yeah it's a big change i think that

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:47.779 
hell yeah it's a big change i think that
once<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.710> set<00:05:46.889> it<00:05:46.919> somewhere<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.639> you<00:05:47.699> have

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
once you set it somewhere and you have

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:49.490 
once you set it somewhere and you have
to<00:05:47.909> move<00:05:48.180> completely<00:05:48.539> over<00:05:48.900> i<00:05:48.930> think<00:05:49.259> that's<00:05:49.409> a

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
to move completely over i think that's a

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.459 
to move completely over i think that's a
big<00:05:49.650> step<00:05:49.919> and<00:05:49.979> we<00:05:50.940> are<00:05:51.060> not<00:05:51.509> yet<00:05:51.780> moved<00:05:52.050> in<00:05:52.319> i

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
big step and we are not yet moved in i

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:53.870 
big step and we are not yet moved in i
think<00:05:52.500> we<00:05:52.740> have<00:05:52.830> like<00:05:52.860> most<00:05:53.430> of<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.639> stuff

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
think we have like most of the stuff

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.550 
think we have like most of the stuff
already<00:05:54.449> there<00:05:54.719> that<00:05:54.840> we<00:05:54.900> need<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.169> live<00:05:55.319> but

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
already there that we need to live but

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.779 
already there that we need to live but
there's<00:05:56.069> still<00:05:56.159> some<00:05:56.370> things<00:05:56.400> that<00:05:56.639> just

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
there's still some things that just

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.790 
there's still some things that just
aren't<00:05:57.030> fixed<00:05:57.569> yet<00:05:57.719> and<00:05:57.870> just<00:05:58.050> slowly<00:05:58.319> by<00:05:58.560> time

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
aren't fixed yet and just slowly by time

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.330 
aren't fixed yet and just slowly by time
maybe<00:05:59.009> we'll<00:05:59.250> make<00:05:59.400> it<00:05:59.460> home<00:05:59.960> very<00:06:00.960> good

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
maybe we'll make it home very good

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.200 
maybe we'll make it home very good
anything<00:06:02.340> that<00:06:02.460> you<00:06:02.550> would<00:06:02.669> like<00:06:02.699> to<00:06:02.940> say<00:06:03.150> to
