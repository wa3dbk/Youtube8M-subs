00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
which should turn these lights on in the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.530 
which should turn these lights on in the
back<00:01:34.579> how<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.640> are<00:01:35.820> break<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> ones<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
back how we are break the ones on the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.300 
back how we are break the ones on the
side<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.840> come<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.110> as<00:01:37.229> well<00:01:37.409> as<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
side up come on as well as one in the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.340 
side up come on as well as one in the
front<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.670> which<00:01:38.790> doesn't<00:01:38.970> see<00:01:39.240> me<00:01:39.390> yet<00:01:39.659> but

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
front here which doesn't see me yet but

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.660 
front here which doesn't see me yet but
it<00:01:40.500> will<00:01:40.939> light<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.649> there<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.799> are<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.460> great

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
it will light up there you are the great

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.630 
it will light up there you are the great
thing<00:01:44.820> about<00:01:44.939> these<00:01:45.210> lights<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:47.430> fact

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
thing about these lights is the fact

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.950 
thing about these lights is the fact
that<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.880> anybody<00:01:48.210> should<00:01:48.299> approach<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
that if anybody should approach the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.249 
that if anybody should approach the
vehicle<00:01:49.759> within<00:01:50.759> 30<00:01:51.030> feet<00:01:51.149> they<00:01:51.540> will<00:01:51.840> turn<00:01:52.079> on

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
vehicle within 30 feet they will turn on

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.380 
vehicle within 30 feet they will turn on
so<00:01:52.530> they're<00:01:52.710> great<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.399> camping<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.119> doctor

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
so they're great for camping so doctor

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.730 
so they're great for camping so doctor
for<00:01:54.509> instance<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.930> move<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.350> again<00:01:55.590> they

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
for instance if I move here again they

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.510 
for instance if I move here again they
will<00:01:55.829> turn<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.810> they<00:01:58.560> will<00:01:58.770> stay<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.219> up<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
will turn on and they will stay on up to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.950 
will turn on and they will stay on up to
eight<00:01:59.640> hours<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.390> set<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.049> up<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.380> way<00:02:01.670> so

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
eight hours if we set it up that way so

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.969 
eight hours if we set it up that way so
anyway<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.170> believe<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.619> first<00:02:04.829> time

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
anyway we believe it's the first time
