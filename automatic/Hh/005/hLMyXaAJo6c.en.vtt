00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.630
 well that's a sliced ​​bill 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.810
 obsolete russian 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.830
 1000 1000 1000 rubles and how much is here 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.570
 you have chopped money 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.790
 well, roughly over 10,000 I think 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.530
 what is not worth the task of finding every 100 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.780
 rubles that stay across the border 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.420
 power over ten thousand 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.489
 dollars are prohibited for transportation therefore 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.350
 we must initially ask the dogs 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.239
 I will explain a person more by myself 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:52.800
 5000 rubles here they are no problem we 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.750
 we set the smell starting from 500 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.460
 rubles before that is why here 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.410
 10,000 dollars a hundred ruble commits 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.170
 it will be without a dog of understandable people 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.820
 have different 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:11.159
 we hide the smell of cash and man 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.770
 dog tasks find other people kind 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.990
 a man who hid himself big 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.060
 I have a few there too 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.220
 thousand rubles something we'll see 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.110
 the dog well what I react that is 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.479
 a large amount of money shredded as we 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.479
 seen or basically on the smell of banknotes 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.800
 really smell good money 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.790
 despite the saying yes not very good 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.830
 smell smell sharp frequent facts 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.240
 export and import 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.980
 cash undeclared cash 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.560
 funds this promising enough 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.410
 smuggling direction 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.630
 that's why we adjust let's say 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.300
 then under the realities of our service and 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.310
 constantly our dogs perry train here 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.310
