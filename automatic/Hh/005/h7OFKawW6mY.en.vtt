00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hello everyone, Vader 29 09 today 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.620
 watch the fight on t-54 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.540
 the player under the nickname of Vlad but 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.570
 just Vlad will call him 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.600
 and so the card we have a robin top rep 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.119
 but he immediately rushing to the right flank 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.859
 the enemy has excellent base there 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.070
 dimple from which to highlight 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.990
 opponents thereby giving the opportunity 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.439
 your allies do great on them 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.500
 shot 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.750
 so 1 illuminated 50b it costs not 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.980
 moves immediately gets as much as a thousand 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.930
 bun has several small but 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.910
 sovzvodny Vlad kills sovzvodny 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.489
 name is Zhenya and so he goes on 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.350
 drives up to the next dimple and from here 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.360
 can be neatly with the help of the tower 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.399
 highlight those behind the barn 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.899
 my and those who are hiding around 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.219
 mills and so through the bush he 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:04.140
 rises makes a little glare and 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.260
 half of the enemy team appears 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.200
 the most dangerous here is yag pz e100 and and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.299
 drying but also drying stock and so on it 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.930
 make some shots right away 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.360
 and she runs off to the hangar you are great -1 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.110
 always need to take away those who have less 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.229
 efficiency 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.590
 or the most dangerous if hp is equally 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.070
 general rule of randomness if you follow it 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.380
 then you can play very well and so 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.750
 Further left as you can see 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.150
 Is-3 on the map but his Vlad is not much 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.009
 notices or just trying not to him 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.320
 attention not to pay well 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.960
 stronger opponents there yet 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.630
 threesomes are very dangerous because they can 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.450
 to throw nehily so in the board and besides 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.939
 the same alpha she has a lot so you need to 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.189
 him more careful to be he understands it and 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.159
 drives off immediately back a little change 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.020
 position and already slightly from another place 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.329
 will now attack opponents 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.920
 three as you can see turned away 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.180
 understand make a quick bill and 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.310
 move back immediately 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.409
 by the way I want to see what he plays 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.670
 almost completely on babe 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.370
 cumulative unix 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.040
 he doesn't have it at all for those who scold 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.819
 54-ku for the fact that it is impossible to play 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.300
 no gold 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.520
 all this nonsense and crap do not knock at all 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.819
 what kind of people because bebashkah on 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.130
 it is quite possible to play it well you 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.739
 will see in this battle but still gold 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.200
 need to carry a little bit all the same there 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.989
 opponents of which are normal babe 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.670
 you can't break through anywhere except 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.540
 some kind of karma there but still 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.349
 need to get there and so on quietly 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.769
 shelling 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.989
 Unfortunately sovzvodnogo already kill from 8 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.850
 he somehow relieved him 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.880
 Generally sent to the hangar are two 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.250
 fri-shki they are by their own in general power 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.790
 about the same as the pattern 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.850
 wafer 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.890
 woman but about the same therefore 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.340
 the waffle should be picked up sooner it is lower 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.610
 she is more maneuverable and less barn on and 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.190
 and so she is somewhat more 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.170
 dangerous so what to do next on 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.430
 yagdtigra strongly do not have to because 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.100
 which of 8 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.230
 right can greatly distribute Sorry 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.290
 make a small little small 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.049
 mistake too much to go back 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.410
 gets for it from the forest 8 and 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:27.989
 good damage still survive 438 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.780
 but it is less good tsiferki but 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.420
 for psy 4 such four shots and all 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.230
 the end of the yagdtiger meanwhile already 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.239
 destroyed and it is time e100 here it is 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.290
 just an opponent whose towers would not 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.900
 take nowhere 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.590
 so you just have to highlight it 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.750
 and try to give opportunity to allies 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.650
 shoot him and so he gets up 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.600
 on the caterpillar immediately begin to control 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.930
 but somehow it doesn't really go through it 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.220
 rule and have no flying damage 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.400
 so I'm a little bit 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.830
 through e100 opponent fat and kill 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.920
 will be long so this process is not 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.020
 fast and so what's going on for the rest 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.200
 parts of the map as you can see allies 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.300
 almost all stand on the base and well in 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.140
 In general, they just shoot at 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:22.170
 He'll shoot a shot at e100 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:25.320
 but nothing passes into him to 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.680
 sorry meanwhile l. drove straight 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.640
 centered almost to the base almost to our 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.130
 base and this is very well cut it 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.900
 It does not get not the gift you're not up position 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.750
 podeshek and not shine 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.170
 their next opponent so 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.820
 worth yag pz e100 this is also very fat 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.280
 shnyaga which will be enough too 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.760
 hard to kill some would towers and 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.910
 so you need to aim soft spots 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.240
 oval of battle is either nld but it stands like that 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.910
 that nl and with a good slope 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.940
 it turns out like about shoot almost 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.430
 useless but there is still turret turret 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.300
 commander is just nothing in all 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.910
 tanks they easily make their way and 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.550
 all damage is dealt but it's not fair 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.850
 a little bit but still in this battle 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.890
 own it very useful and every 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.260
 shot quietly 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.950
 throws in a yaga 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:29.310
 another 350 for about average damage 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:32.280
 good such homework go from t54 this 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.160
 he is cool but now ends the series 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.400
 luck and they don't start to drink 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.850
 hits and other nasty stuff and yes 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.640
 besides, the court artillery was already glowing 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:48.330
 glowed court artillery reduced and 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.750
 takes egdpz e100 on their own and so 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.210
 backlight t-54 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.000
 helped the team cut out the entire base 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.210
 the enemy how many tanks were there 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.970
 were destroyed by the light of psy fours 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:06.000
 great tank tower strong mobility 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.790
 good weapon guns quite good 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.490
 52 for different styles of play, even so 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.760
 so say 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:17.430
 54 then st is better at the ninth level it is not 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.800
 only my opinion thinks so half 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.280
 world of tanks wot illuminated 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.980
 artillery and and swoop just instantly 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.220
 demolished and remains the case for small 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:32.040
 three tanks against 11 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.820
 allies and so somewhere near here 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.850
 batshat 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.780
 now it should appear somewhere 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.520
 he enters around the light and so where 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.850
 You battsat here he finally appears 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.630
 1300 xp d 4200 i.e. three shells 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.260
 from pursed 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:51.060
 and everything and went to the hangar but the battsat is full 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:55.020
 speed enters drinking 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.690
 50 foursomes blows off 600hp 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.070
 well, it becomes decisive for him 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.130
 step because after that he 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:05.430
 removed very quickly from the battlefield 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.470
 two opponents remain now alone 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:11.480
 it's heavy of 6 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:14.340
 but he stands surrounded by two strands 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.100
 so green little ones are fast too 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.650
 It goes well, that can be supplied already result 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.790
 although there are not so many frags, but 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.270
 how much damage 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:26.870
 almost 6000 and that is six maybe there 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.940
 even without the light were in addition 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:33.360
 a huge number of tanks lit up 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:36.900
 and by the light of a beautiful battle destroyed 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.789
 to all of you I wish but in this fight 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.250
 coming to the end now tissot 6 

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:44.250
 artillery again get well and on this 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.860
