00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
back where everybody thought that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.480 
back where everybody thought that
Christopher<00:01:40.140> Daniels<00:01:40.560> was<00:01:40.680> Sin<00:01:40.860> Cara<00:01:41.070> or

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
Christopher Daniels was Sin Cara or

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.090

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and denying it it's a little different

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.510 
and denying it it's a little different
but<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.140> somewhat<00:01:46.590> similar<00:01:46.799> because

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
but it's somewhat similar because

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.760 
but it's somewhat similar because
