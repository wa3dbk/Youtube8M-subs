kinda<00:01:56.739> screws<00:01:57.039> held<00:01:57.340> in<00:01:57.459> by<00:01:57.580> a<00:01:57.610> self-tapping

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
kinda screws held in by a self-tapping

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.719 
kinda screws held in by a self-tapping
type<00:01:58.929> clip<00:01:59.380> which<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.099> screw<00:02:00.340> screw<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.610> into

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
type clip which the screw screw it into

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.570 
type clip which the screw screw it into
probably<00:02:01.450> definitely<00:02:01.989> at<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.110> factory<00:02:02.500> and

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
probably definitely at the factory and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.390 
probably definitely at the factory and
and<00:02:05.290> yeah<00:02:06.290> it's<00:02:06.440> on<00:02:06.590> there<00:02:06.740> pretty<00:02:06.800> tight<00:02:07.070> but

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
and yeah it's on there pretty tight but

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.650 
and yeah it's on there pretty tight but
you<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.550> need<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.760> little<00:02:07.970> teeny<00:02:08.150> bit<00:02:08.240> of<00:02:08.420> PB

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
you just need a little teeny bit of PB

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.940 
you just need a little teeny bit of PB

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
harness even if what I did is I filled

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.960 
harness even if what I did is I filled
actually<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.800> piece<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.070> vacuum<00:02:13.430> line<00:02:13.610> with<00:02:13.760> it

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
actually a piece of vacuum line with it

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.760 
actually a piece of vacuum line with it
junk<00:02:14.780> vacuum<00:02:15.110> line<00:02:15.260> by<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.470> way

junk vacuum line by the way

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.310 
junk vacuum line by the way
and<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.280> just<00:02:16.690> had<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.780> vacuum<00:02:18.050> line<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.260> the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
and I just had the vacuum line in the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.370 
and I just had the vacuum line in the
loop<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.650> pointed<00:02:19.460> it<00:02:19.520> towards<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.380> that

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
loop and I pointed it towards the that

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.350 
loop and I pointed it towards the that
screw<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.130> lifted<00:02:22.670> up<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.910> other<00:02:23.150> end<00:02:23.300> of

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
screw and I lifted up the other end of

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.130 
screw and I lifted up the other end of
the<00:02:23.450> vacuum<00:02:23.780> line<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.410> let<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.310> PB<00:02:25.610> catalysts

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
the vacuum line and let the PB catalysts

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.100 
the vacuum line and let the PB catalysts
work<00:02:27.140> its<00:02:27.350> magic

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110

out make sure you hold onto it because
it's<00:03:06.230> self<00:03:06.440> topping<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.070> don't<00:03:07.280> have<00:03:07.370> to

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
it's self topping so you don't have to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.680 
it's self topping so you don't have to
worry<00:03:07.550> about<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.700> bolt<00:03:07.940> on<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.180> back<00:03:08.300> end<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.570> it

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
worry about a bolt on the back end of it

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.290 
worry about a bolt on the back end of it
or<00:03:08.840> anything<00:03:09.050> I<00:03:09.410> think<00:03:10.130> it's<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.370> bolt<00:03:10.610> it's<00:03:11.150> a

it's a bolt with the thread on it kind

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.890 
it's a bolt with the thread on it kind
of<00:03:13.640> like<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.880> screw<00:03:14.120> but<00:03:14.330> without<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.570> screw<00:03:14.870> put

like this and it's on there on another

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.000 
like this and it's on there on another
clip<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.910> pull<00:03:32.180> that<00:03:32.330> up<00:03:32.390> out<00:03:32.830> of<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.890> way

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
clip and you pull that up out of the way

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.530 
clip and you pull that up out of the way
and<00:03:34.190> then<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:34.760> push<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:34.970> up<00:03:35.150> out<00:03:35.270> of<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.420> way

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
and then you push it up out of the way

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.780 
and then you push it up out of the way
and<00:03:35.750> then<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.380> can<00:03:36.620> move<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:37.190> breather<00:03:37.520> box

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
and then you can move the breather box

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.520 
and then you can move the breather box
you<00:03:38.180> finagle<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.810> all<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.080> wiggling<00:03:39.410> and

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
you finagle it all the wiggling and

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.530 
you finagle it all the wiggling and
squiggle<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:39.950> they're<00:03:40.100> most<00:03:40.340> moving<00:03:41.270> things

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
squiggle and they're most moving things

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.940 
squiggle and they're most moving things
that<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.720> hard<00:03:41.870> place<00:03:42.050> it's<00:03:42.260> involved<00:03:42.650> with<00:03:42.709> you

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
that a hard place it's involved with you

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.620 
that a hard place it's involved with you
do<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.370> then<00:03:43.489> you<00:03:43.580> get<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.880> breather<00:03:44.209> box<00:03:44.420> out

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
do and then you get the breather box out

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.910 
do and then you get the breather box out
by<00:03:44.840> lifting<00:03:44.989> it<00:03:45.200> up<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.350> over<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.650> starter

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
by lifting it up and over the starter

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.070 
by lifting it up and over the starter
motor<00:03:46.420> because<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.600> won't<00:03:47.720> come<00:03:47.840> out<00:03:47.900> any

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
motor because it won't come out any

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.060 
motor because it won't come out any
other<00:03:48.170> way<00:03:48.290> cuz<00:03:48.470> there's<00:03:48.620> all<00:03:48.709> this<00:03:48.800> stuff<00:03:48.890> in

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
other way cuz there's all this stuff in

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.370 
other way cuz there's all this stuff in
the<00:03:49.160> way<00:03:49.750> such<00:03:50.750> as<00:03:50.780> other<00:03:51.020> parts<00:03:51.230> of<00:03:51.290> the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
the way such as other parts of the

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.780 
the way such as other parts of the
wiring<00:03:51.590> harness<00:03:51.890> in<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.070> steering<00:03:52.670> column

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
wiring harness in the steering column

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.150 
wiring harness in the steering column
and<00:03:53.350> all<00:03:54.350> that<00:03:54.560> good<00:03:54.709> stuff<00:03:55.570> so<00:03:56.950> yeah<00:03:57.950> but<00:03:58.070> this

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
and all that good stuff so yeah but this

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.530 
and all that good stuff so yeah but this
is<00:03:58.310> really<00:03:58.430> just<00:03:58.520> an<00:03:58.730> intro<00:03:59.030> I'm<00:03:59.090> not<00:03:59.239> gonna<00:03:59.420> do

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
is really just an intro I'm not gonna do

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.720 
is really just an intro I'm not gonna do
a<00:03:59.660> caught<00:04:00.290> on<00:04:00.410> our<00:04:00.739> screen<00:04:01.370> come<00:04:01.519> to<00:04:01.640> the

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
a caught on our screen come to the

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.650 
a caught on our screen come to the
camera<00:04:02.000> I'm<00:04:02.510> not<00:04:02.570> going<00:04:02.900> to<00:04:03.019> do<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.170> real

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
camera I'm not going to do a real

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.520 
camera I'm not going to do a real
in-depth<00:04:05.660> thing<00:04:05.840> about<00:04:06.019> it<00:04:06.170> right<00:04:06.380> now

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
in-depth thing about it right now

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.640 
in-depth thing about it right now
because<00:04:07.360> actually<00:04:08.360> it's<00:04:08.870> pretty<00:04:09.230> expensive

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
because actually it's pretty expensive

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.280 
because actually it's pretty expensive
but<00:04:10.420> yeah<00:04:11.420> I<00:04:11.450> didn't<00:04:11.750> know<00:04:11.810> what<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:11.989> PCV

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
but yeah I didn't know what the PCV

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.540 
but yeah I didn't know what the PCV
system<00:04:12.500> was<00:04:12.770> when<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:12.980> first<00:04:13.220> started<00:04:13.460> with

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
system was when I first started with

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.150 
system was when I first started with
this<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:13.940> I<00:04:14.030> was<00:04:14.240> like<00:04:14.450> oh

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
this and I was like oh

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.800 
this and I was like oh
my<00:04:15.250> god<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.430> changed<00:04:15.850> my<00:04:15.910> PCB<00:04:16.330> system<00:04:16.630> out<00:04:16.780> and

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
my god I changed my PCB system out and

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.130 
my god I changed my PCB system out and
all<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:17.739> but<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.519> say<00:04:18.850> I<00:04:19.120> recommend<00:04:19.870> that<00:04:19.959> if

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
all that but I say I recommend that if

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.540 
all that but I say I recommend that if
your<00:04:20.320> PCB<00:04:20.620> system<00:04:20.980> hasn't<00:04:21.130> had<00:04:21.310> maintenance

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.550 
your PCB system hasn't had maintenance

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.500 
your PCB system hasn't had maintenance
done<00:04:21.820> in<00:04:23.430> 20<00:04:24.430> years<00:04:24.700> or<00:04:24.880> however<00:04:25.030> old<00:04:25.240> your

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
done in 20 years or however old your

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.940 
done in 20 years or however old your
Volvo<00:04:25.810> is<00:04:26.700> and<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.870> just<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.350> disassemble

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
Volvo is and you just you disassemble

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.500 
Volvo is and you just you disassemble
the<00:04:30.250> entire<00:04:30.520> system<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.060> buy<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.210> whole

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
the entire system and you buy a whole

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.170 
the entire system and you buy a whole
new<00:04:31.660> one<00:04:31.840> first<00:04:32.110> you<00:04:32.230> buy<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.410> parts<00:04:33.030> which<00:04:34.030> I

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
new one first you buy the parts which I

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.240 
new one first you buy the parts which I
will<00:04:34.390> um<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.170> think<00:04:35.230> I've<00:04:35.560> outlined<00:04:35.920> for<00:04:36.160> you

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
will um so I think I've outlined for you

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.750 
will um so I think I've outlined for you
it's<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.580> breather<00:04:36.790> box<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.870> flame<00:04:38.110> trap<00:04:38.760> the

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
it's the breather box the flame trap the

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.160 
it's the breather box the flame trap the
breather<00:04:40.270> hose<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:41.290> flame<00:04:41.590> trap<00:04:41.860> hose<00:04:42.100> and

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
breather hose the flame trap hose and

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.580 
breather hose the flame trap hose and
then<00:04:44.170> some<00:04:44.500> more<00:04:44.530> vacuum<00:04:45.010> line<00:04:45.190> for<00:04:45.370> that<00:04:45.430> PCB

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
then some more vacuum line for that PCB

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.040 
then some more vacuum line for that PCB
orifice<00:04:47.590> because<00:04:48.040> watch<00:04:48.310> I'll<00:04:48.430> call<00:04:48.640> it<00:04:49.050> the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
orifice because watch I'll call it the

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.140 
orifice because watch I'll call it the
old<00:04:50.200> vacuum<00:04:50.590> line<00:04:50.770> gets<00:04:51.010> old<00:04:51.220> craft<00:04:51.640> up<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:52.030> it

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
old vacuum line gets old craft up and it

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.720 
old vacuum line gets old craft up and it
doesn't<00:04:52.330> seal<00:04:52.720> quite<00:04:53.020> as<00:04:53.140> good<00:04:53.260> anymore<00:04:53.730> the

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
doesn't seal quite as good anymore the

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.040 
doesn't seal quite as good anymore the
old<00:04:54.820> breather<00:04:55.090> hose<00:04:55.240> actually<00:04:55.630> works<00:04:55.840> pretty

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
old breather hose actually works pretty

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.350 
old breather hose actually works pretty
well<00:04:56.170> but<00:04:56.320> I<00:04:56.850> recommend<00:04:57.850> to<00:04:58.030> do<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.300> I<00:04:58.330> just

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
well but I recommend to do and I just

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.680 
well but I recommend to do and I just
couldn't<00:04:58.690> get<00:04:59.290> my<00:04:59.350> hands<00:04:59.770> on<00:04:59.830> a<00:04:59.890> new<00:05:00.040> one<00:05:00.690> so

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
couldn't get my hands on a new one so

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.880 
couldn't get my hands on a new one so
you<00:05:01.840> replace<00:05:02.110> all<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.380> parts<00:05:02.620> now<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:02.800> then

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
you replace all the parts now and then

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:03.960 
you replace all the parts now and then
your<00:05:03.010> next<00:05:03.190> oil<00:05:03.280> change<00:05:03.490> what<00:05:03.760> you're<00:05:03.850> going

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
your next oil change what you're going

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.770 
your next oil change what you're going
to<00:05:04.000> do<00:05:04.090> is<00:05:04.180> you're<00:05:04.270> going<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.420> take<00:05:04.540> the<00:05:04.660> entire

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
to do is you're going to take the entire

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.580 
to do is you're going to take the entire
PC<00:05:05.170> P<00:05:05.320> system<00:05:05.710> well<00:05:06.280> apart<00:05:07.000> again<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:07.630> then

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
PC P system well apart again and then

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.350 
PC P system well apart again and then
you're<00:05:08.710> just<00:05:08.800> going<00:05:08.980> to<00:05:09.010> clean<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.120> out<00:05:10.210> with

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
you're just going to clean it out with

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.340 
you're just going to clean it out with
the<00:05:10.480> greaser<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:12.660> then<00:05:13.660> you're<00:05:13.780> gonna<00:05:13.870> let<00:05:14.230> it

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
the greaser and then you're gonna let it

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.840 
the greaser and then you're gonna let it
dry<00:05:14.590> make<00:05:14.920> sure<00:05:15.010> the<00:05:15.100> snow<00:05:15.280> degreaser<00:05:15.700> that's

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
dry make sure the snow degreaser that's

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.620 
dry make sure the snow degreaser that's
in<00:05:15.940> there<00:05:16.030> because<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.300> don't<00:05:16.420> want<00:05:16.540> that

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
in there because you don't want that

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.880 
in there because you don't want that
stuff<00:05:16.750> going<00:05:16.960> back<00:05:17.200> into<00:05:17.470> your<00:05:17.560> engine

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
stuff going back into your engine

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.190 
stuff going back into your engine
because<00:05:18.580> oil<00:05:18.880> vapors<00:05:19.540> come<00:05:19.750> up<00:05:19.870> into<00:05:20.020> the

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
because oil vapors come up into the

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.420 
because oil vapors come up into the
bottom<00:05:20.410> of<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:20.560> breather<00:05:20.800> box<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:21.220> then<00:05:21.340> the

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
bottom of the breather box and then the

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.280 
bottom of the breather box and then the
vapors<00:05:21.850> accumulate<00:05:22.510> into<00:05:22.660> droplets<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:23.170> then

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
vapors accumulate into droplets and then

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.860 
vapors accumulate into droplets and then
go<00:05:23.380> down<00:05:23.500> through<00:05:23.740> a<00:05:23.770> sump<00:05:24.130> oh<00:05:24.720> there's<00:05:25.720> also

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
go down through a sump oh there's also

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.450 
go down through a sump oh there's also
the<00:05:26.050> sump<00:05:26.260> outside<00:05:26.650> of<00:05:27.100> it

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
the sump outside of it

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.240 
the sump outside of it
that's<00:05:27.790> something<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:28.090> worry<00:05:28.270> about<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:29.250> yeah

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
that's something to worry about and yeah

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.470 
that's something to worry about and yeah
they<00:05:30.400> go<00:05:30.490> back<00:05:30.640> into<00:05:30.790> the<00:05:30.880> sump<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.300> they<00:05:31.360> go

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
they go back into the sump and they go

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.360 
they go back into the sump and they go
back<00:05:31.600> into<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.930> engine<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:34.980> and<00:05:35.980> they<00:05:36.250> go

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
back into the engine and and they go

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.420 
back into the engine and and they go
back<00:05:36.490> into<00:05:36.640> the<00:05:36.820> engine<00:05:36.940> and<00:05:37.180> all<00:05:37.360> that<00:05:38.400> so<00:05:39.400> you

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
back into the engine and all that so you

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.620 
back into the engine and all that so you
don't<00:05:39.730> want<00:05:39.850> any<00:05:39.880> grease<00:05:40.210> you're<00:05:40.330> going<00:05:40.510> into

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
don't want any grease you're going into

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.970 
don't want any grease you're going into
your<00:05:40.780> engine<00:05:40.900> because<00:05:41.200> when<00:05:41.380> I<00:05:41.530> would<00:05:41.680> not<00:05:41.830> be

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
your engine because when I would not be

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.510 
your engine because when I would not be
good<00:05:42.100> for<00:05:42.160> this<00:05:43.260> but<00:05:44.260> I'm<00:05:44.380> uh<00:05:44.530> yeah<00:05:45.190> when

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
good for this but I'm uh yeah when

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.500 
good for this but I'm uh yeah when
you're<00:05:45.640> taking<00:05:45.880> the<00:05:45.940> breather<00:05:46.150> box<00:05:46.360> out

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
you're taking the breather box out

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.270 
you're taking the breather box out
there's<00:05:46.900> this<00:05:47.050> hose<00:05:47.230> which<00:05:47.680> will<00:05:47.830> be<00:05:47.919> probably

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
there's this hose which will be probably

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.380 
there's this hose which will be probably
to<00:05:48.340> your<00:05:48.460> left<00:05:48.669> if<00:05:48.820> you're<00:05:48.910> working<00:05:49.090> from<00:05:49.270> the

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
to your left if you're working from the

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.210 
to your left if you're working from the
driver's<00:05:49.720> side<00:05:49.750> on<00:05:50.620> the<00:05:50.800> bottom<00:05:51.070> of<00:05:51.130> the

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
driver's side on the bottom of the

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.550 
driver's side on the bottom of the
breather<00:05:51.669> box<00:05:51.910> do<00:05:52.270> not<00:05:52.450> mess<00:05:52.870> with<00:05:53.110> it<00:05:53.290> you

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
breather box do not mess with it you

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.140 
breather box do not mess with it you
keep<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.950> in<00:05:54.160> the<00:05:54.220> block<00:05:54.580> it<00:05:54.850> probably

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
keep it in the block it probably

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.050 
keep it in the block it probably
shouldn't<00:05:55.480> come<00:05:55.630> up<00:05:55.810> but<00:05:56.440> if<00:05:56.560> you<00:05:57.040> I<00:05:57.400> don't

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
shouldn't come up but if you I don't

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.240 
shouldn't come up but if you I don't
know<00:05:58.270> for<00:05:58.480> some<00:05:58.510> reason<00:05:58.930> it<00:05:59.050> melted<00:05:59.770> itself<00:06:00.070> on

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
know for some reason it melted itself on

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.659 
know for some reason it melted itself on
to<00:06:00.430> the<00:06:00.520> bottom<00:06:00.760> of<00:06:00.820> the<00:06:00.910> breather<00:06:01.090> box<00:06:01.360> and

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
to the bottom of the breather box and

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.470 
to the bottom of the breather box and
something<00:06:03.669> other<00:06:03.820> you're<00:06:04.090> gonna<00:06:04.210> need<00:06:04.330> to

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
something other you're gonna need to

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.820 
something other you're gonna need to
hold<00:06:04.690> it<00:06:04.810> down<00:06:04.900> because<00:06:05.230> if<00:06:05.380> you<00:06:05.470> take<00:06:05.620> out

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
hold it down because if you take out

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.670 
hold it down because if you take out
that<00:06:05.950> some<00:06:06.280> pose<00:06:06.780> I'll<00:06:07.780> see<00:06:08.169> if<00:06:08.260> I<00:06:08.320> can<00:06:08.440> find<00:06:08.620> a

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
that some pose I'll see if I can find a

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.590 
that some pose I'll see if I can find a
diagram<00:06:08.980> of<00:06:09.160> this<00:06:09.220> stuff<00:06:09.430> for<00:06:09.669> you<00:06:09.760> you<00:06:09.940> could

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
diagram of this stuff for you you could

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.710 
diagram of this stuff for you you could
take<00:06:10.720> out<00:06:10.840> that<00:06:10.990> some<00:06:11.260> hose<00:06:11.470> you<00:06:12.220> will<00:06:12.370> um<00:06:12.720> have

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
take out that some hose you will um have

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.100 
take out that some hose you will um have
two<00:06:13.840> ricci<00:06:14.140> your<00:06:14.290> oil<00:06:14.470> pan<00:06:14.650> which<00:06:14.860> involves

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
two ricci your oil pan which involves

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.530 
two ricci your oil pan which involves
lifting<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.410> entire<00:06:17.620> engine<00:06:17.980> out<00:06:18.220> of<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:18.370> car

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
lifting the entire engine out of the car

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.000 
lifting the entire engine out of the car
from<00:06:19.540> the<00:06:19.570> transmission

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
from the transmission

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.800 
from the transmission
so<00:06:21.370> you<00:06:21.790> wouldn't<00:06:21.970> want<00:06:22.060> to<00:06:22.150> do<00:06:22.300> that<00:06:24.660> well<00:06:25.660> me

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
so you wouldn't want to do that well me

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.030 
so you wouldn't want to do that well me
