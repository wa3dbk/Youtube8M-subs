Fisher<00:00:09.590> gainsay<00:00:10.280> series<00:00:10.940> so<00:00:11.210> my<00:00:11.650> 60<00:00:12.650> memorable

Fisher gainsay series so my 60 memorable
games<00:00:13.760> and<00:00:14.180> I<00:00:14.870> had<00:00:14.990> stumbled<00:00:15.289> before<00:00:15.860> looking

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
games and I had stumbled before looking

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.990 
games and I had stumbled before looking
at<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.550> game

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
at the game

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.730 
at the game
Edgar<00:00:17.330> Walter<00:00:17.720> versus<00:00:18.080> Fisher<00:00:18.410> because<00:00:18.619> it

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
Edgar Walter versus Fisher because it

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.490 
Edgar Walter versus Fisher because it
was<00:00:18.860> like<00:00:19.010> 63<00:00:19.640> moves<00:00:19.880> I<00:00:20.180> couldn't<00:00:21.020> fit<00:00:21.200> it<00:00:21.320> into

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
was like 63 moves I couldn't fit it into

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.430 
was like 63 moves I couldn't fit it into
11<00:00:21.950> minute<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:22.310> I<00:00:22.400> tried<00:00:23.150> that<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:23.840> sometimes

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
11 minute so I tried that and sometimes

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.520 
11 minute so I tried that and sometimes
on<00:00:24.950> my<00:00:25.280> previous<00:00:25.490> operating<00:00:26.060> system<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:26.570> when

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530 
on my previous operating system the when

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.230 
on my previous operating system the when
I<00:00:27.590> was<00:00:27.620> using<00:00:27.830> Rybka<00:00:28.400> it<00:00:28.490> froze<00:00:28.850> the<00:00:29.060> whole

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
I was using Rybka it froze the whole

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.740 
I was using Rybka it froze the whole
machine<00:00:29.690> and<00:00:30.140> it<00:00:30.500> made<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:30.950> video<00:00:31.750> unusable

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
machine and it made the video unusable

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.020 
machine and it made the video unusable
so<00:00:33.020> it's<00:00:33.500> a<00:00:33.649> big<00:00:33.860> game<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.670> was<00:00:34.730> only<00:00:34.910> a

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
so it's a big game and it was only a

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.600 
so it's a big game and it was only a
draw<00:00:35.360> as<00:00:35.570> well<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:36.140> it<00:00:36.500> kind<00:00:36.710> of<00:00:36.770> demotivating

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
draw as well and it kind of demotivating

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.460 
draw as well and it kind of demotivating
he<00:00:37.820> took<00:00:38.329> out<00:00:38.480> on<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.660> series<00:00:38.930> I<00:00:39.020> wanted<00:00:39.380> to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
gets a massive disadvantage the second

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.609 
gets a massive disadvantage the second
scene<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:04.909> managed<00:01:05.329> to<00:01:05.449> get<00:01:05.810> into<00:01:05.990> an<00:01:06.409> endgame

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
scene is managed to get into an endgame

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.770 
scene is managed to get into an endgame
position<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:07.250> material<00:01:07.640> down<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:08.119> the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
position that material down and the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.010 
position that material down and the
first<00:01:09.080> thing<00:01:09.290> is<00:01:09.409> is<00:01:09.560> holding<00:01:10.040> draw<00:01:10.540> so<00:01:11.540> it

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
first thing is is holding draw so it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.750 
first thing is is holding draw so it
might<00:01:12.260> be<00:01:12.409> split<00:01:12.650> into<00:01:12.740> three<00:01:13.010> videos<00:01:13.370> this<00:01:13.580> in

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
might be split into three videos this in

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.000 
might be split into three videos this in
the<00:01:13.850> first<00:01:14.090> part<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:15.170> let's<00:01:15.380> say<00:01:15.620> this<00:01:15.799> game

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
the first part so let's say this game

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.330 
the first part so let's say this game
Zurich<00:01:16.540> 1959<00:01:17.570> how<00:01:18.380> did<00:01:18.620> Fisher<00:01:18.860> gets<00:01:19.070> such<00:01:19.310> a

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
Zurich 1959 how did Fisher gets such a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.510 
Zurich 1959 how did Fisher gets such a
terrible<00:01:19.970> position<00:01:20.210> out<00:01:21.140> of<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.409> opening<00:01:21.770> so

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
terrible position out of the opening so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.680 
terrible position out of the opening so
we're<00:01:22.580> going<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.790> focus<00:01:22.970> here<00:01:23.150> on<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:23.450> first

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
we're going to focus here on the first

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:32.340 
we're going to focus here on the first
27<00:01:24.500> or<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.100> moves<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.990> II<00:01:27.290> for<00:01:27.619> Fisher<00:01:28.580> plays<00:01:29.590> c5

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
27 or so moves so II for Fisher plays c5

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.570 
27 or so moves so II for Fisher plays c5
so<00:01:33.350> Knight<00:01:33.830> f3<00:01:35.049> Knight<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:36.200> endi<00:01:36.650> six<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:37.400> this

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
so Knight f3 Knight and endi six so this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.030 
so Knight f3 Knight and endi six so this
is<00:01:37.729> fishes<00:01:38.090> um<00:01:38.330> you<00:01:39.200> know<00:01:39.320> he<00:01:39.470> he<00:01:39.680> analyzed

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
is fishes um you know he he analyzed

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.539 
is fishes um you know he he analyzed
this<00:01:40.189> death<00:01:40.549> of<00:01:40.760> knights<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.270> stuff<00:01:41.479> so<00:01:42.549> often

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
this death of knights and stuff so often

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.399 
this death of knights and stuff so often
I<00:01:43.640> see<00:01:43.850> if<00:01:43.909> he<00:01:44.060> plays<00:01:44.299> a<00:01:44.570> six<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.140> this<00:01:45.260> was

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
I see if he plays a six and this was

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.060 
I see if he plays a six and this was
also<00:01:46.090> favors<00:01:47.090> by<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.330> sparf<00:01:47.780> over<00:01:48.140> d6<00:01:48.860> because

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
also favors by to sparf over d6 because

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.800 
also favors by to sparf over d6 because
it<00:01:49.159> avoids<00:01:49.430> Bishop<00:01:50.060> b5<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:50.990> it's<00:01:51.740> an<00:01:51.890> improved

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
it avoids Bishop b5 so it's an improved

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.410 
it avoids Bishop b5 so it's an improved
shave<00:01:53.810> Lincoln<00:01:54.259> if<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:55.490> one's<00:01:55.700> played<00:01:55.939> a<00:01:56.119> six

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
shave Lincoln if that one's played a six

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.020 
shave Lincoln if that one's played a six
all<00:01:56.689> black<00:01:57.110> could<00:01:57.200> just<00:01:57.380> play<00:01:57.500> e5<00:01:57.799> if<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:58.820> want

all black could just play e5 if you want

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.210 
all black could just play e5 if you want
but<00:01:59.869> actually<00:02:00.200> Fisher<00:02:00.409> goes<00:02:00.680> off<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:00.979> Bishop

square<00:03:52.120> but<00:03:53.120> why<00:03:53.359> it's<00:03:53.540> still<00:03:53.810> very

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
square but why it's still very

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.259 
square but why it's still very
aggressively<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:54.950> carrying<00:03:55.940> out<00:03:56.060> his

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
strategy so f6 why it's got a big

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.550 
strategy so f6 why it's got a big
advantage<00:03:59.299> now<00:04:00.220> bishop<00:04:01.220> f8<00:04:01.660> now<00:04:02.660> on<00:04:02.780> Knight<00:04:03.049> d5

so prepares a sac unlight interest the
chair<00:04:06.349> you<00:04:06.829> know<00:04:06.859> black<00:04:07.220> King<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.609> shreds

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
chair you know black King to shreds

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.949 
chair you know black King to shreds
which<00:04:08.510> is<00:04:08.660> still<00:04:08.870> on<00:04:08.989> e8<00:04:10.209> so<00:04:11.209> Fischer<00:04:11.480> took<00:04:11.720> on

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
which is still on e8 so Fischer took on

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.029 
which is still on e8 so Fischer took on
d5<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.810> now<00:04:14.989> played<00:04:15.260> King<00:04:15.500> d8

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
d5 and now played King d8

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.759 
d5 and now played King d8
so<00:04:16.639> this<00:04:16.940> really<00:04:17.299> isn't<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.989> pleasant<00:04:18.169> position

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
so this really isn't a pleasant position

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.610 
so this really isn't a pleasant position
at<00:04:18.950> all<00:04:19.190> for<00:04:20.180> Fischer<00:04:20.570> Knight<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.620> c6<00:04:22.159> check

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
at all for Fischer Knight and c6 check

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.409 
at all for Fischer Knight and c6 check
maybe<00:04:24.620> this<00:04:24.890> this<00:04:25.340> I'm<00:04:25.700> not<00:04:25.969> sure<00:04:26.240> I<00:04:26.270> don't

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
maybe this this I'm not sure I don't

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.029 
maybe this this I'm not sure I don't
really<00:04:26.810> want<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.140> check<00:04:27.289> with<00:04:27.440> vengeance<00:04:27.800> this

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
really want to check with vengeance this

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.300 
really want to check with vengeance this
this<00:04:28.669> was<00:04:28.909> a<00:04:28.940> scary<00:04:29.360> continuation<00:04:30.310> this

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
this was a scary continuation this

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.070 
this was a scary continuation this
continuation<00:04:31.760> maybe<00:04:32.390> there's<00:04:32.599> more<00:04:32.630> accurate

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
continuation maybe there's more accurate

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.050 
continuation maybe there's more accurate
one<00:04:33.229> so<00:04:33.469> white<00:04:33.650> sacrificed<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.340> pawn<00:04:34.550> to

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
one so white sacrificed a pawn to

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.219 
one so white sacrificed a pawn to
increase<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.539> dominance<00:04:35.990> of<00:04:36.110> the

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
increase the dominance of the

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.260 
increase the dominance of the
LightSquared<00:04:36.590> Bishop<00:04:37.039> over<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.789> dark<00:04:38.000> square

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
LightSquared Bishop over the dark square

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.450 
LightSquared Bishop over the dark square
one<00:04:38.419> which<00:04:38.570> is<00:04:38.690> imprisoned<00:04:39.260> my<00:04:39.919> Fisher's<00:04:40.219> pawn

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
one which is imprisoned my Fisher's pawn

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.909 
one which is imprisoned my Fisher's pawn
on<00:04:40.640> d6

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
on d6

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.980 
on d6
now<00:04:42.919> Queen<00:04:43.310> h5<00:04:43.700> so<00:04:43.940> starting<00:04:44.450> to<00:04:44.570> probe<00:04:44.840> all

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
now Queen h5 so starting to probe all

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.240 
now Queen h5 so starting to probe all
these<00:04:45.140> light<00:04:45.349> squares<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:45.919> look<00:04:46.039> at<00:04:46.159> these

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
these light squares and look at these

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.520 
these light squares and look at these
rooks<00:04:46.550> totally<00:04:47.030> uncoordinated<00:04:47.390> look<00:04:48.380> at

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
rooks totally uncoordinated look at

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.100 
rooks totally uncoordinated look at
white<00:04:49.099> strokes<00:04:49.430> just<00:04:49.550> blasting<00:04:50.210> down<00:04:50.330> the

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
white strokes just blasting down the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.649 
white strokes just blasting down the
center<00:04:51.500> so<00:04:51.530> every<00:04:51.950> one<00:04:52.099> of<00:04:52.130> White's<00:04:52.940> pieces<00:04:53.450> is

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659 
center so every one of White's pieces is

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.800 
center so every one of White's pieces is
superior<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:54.440> Fisher's<00:04:55.340> and<00:04:55.700> this<00:04:56.659> is

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
superior to Fisher's and this is

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.060 
superior to Fisher's and this is
probably<00:04:57.020> why<00:04:57.260> it<00:04:57.289> was<00:04:57.469> a<00:04:57.530> memorable<00:04:57.740> game

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
probably why it was a memorable game

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.950 
probably why it was a memorable game
because<00:04:58.280> he<00:04:58.370> was<00:04:58.400> getting<00:04:58.580> done<00:04:58.880> in<00:04:58.940> from<00:04:59.840> the

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
because he was getting done in from the

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.870 
because he was getting done in from the
opening<00:05:00.229> it<00:05:00.770> was<00:05:00.890> really<00:05:01.159> on<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.370> back<00:05:01.550> foot

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
opening it was really on the back foot

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.770 
opening it was really on the back foot
and<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:03.550> think<00:05:04.550> he<00:05:04.640> cited<00:05:04.969> as<00:05:05.090> an<00:05:05.210> experience<00:05:05.690> of

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
and I think he cited as an experience of

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.180 
and I think he cited as an experience of
his<00:05:05.870> opponent<00:05:06.200> to<00:05:06.320> let<00:05:06.469> his<00:05:06.560> King<00:05:06.830> out<00:05:06.979> in<00:05:07.099> the

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
his opponent to let his King out in the

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.339 
his opponent to let his King out in the
end<00:05:07.310> game<00:05:07.550> which<00:05:08.150> were<00:05:08.330> bouncing<00:05:08.750> in<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.110> same

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
end game which were bouncing in the same

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.500 
end game which were bouncing in the same
frame<00:05:09.740> this<00:05:10.280> is<00:05:10.460> still<00:05:10.669> see<00:05:10.849> one<00:05:11.060> so<00:05:11.210> this<00:05:11.330> is

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
frame this is still see one so this is

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.570 
frame this is still see one so this is
this<00:05:11.690> I<00:05:11.990> think<00:05:12.260> we're<00:05:12.919> coming<00:05:13.070> to<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.340> end<00:05:13.430> the

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
this I think we're coming to the end the

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.750 
this I think we're coming to the end the
same<00:05:13.610> on<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.030> disaster<00:05:14.599> from<00:05:14.690> Loeb<00:05:14.960> thing<00:05:15.200> I

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
same on the disaster from Loeb thing I

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.950 
same on the disaster from Loeb thing I
think<00:05:16.760> you'll<00:05:16.849> have<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.150> agree<00:05:17.180> this<00:05:17.719> this

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
think you'll have to agree this this

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.140 
think you'll have to agree this this
isn't<00:05:18.260> Pleasant<00:05:18.669> so<00:05:19.669> Bishop<00:05:20.090> f5<00:05:20.599> and<00:05:22.060> you<00:05:23.060> know

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
isn't Pleasant so Bishop f5 and you know

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.630 
isn't Pleasant so Bishop f5 and you know
the<00:05:23.270> rooks<00:05:23.539> can<00:05:23.810> can<00:05:24.169> also<00:05:24.469> threaten<00:05:25.039> to<00:05:25.340> swing

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
the rooks can can also threaten to swing

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.390 
the rooks can can also threaten to swing
in<00:05:25.820> for<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.330> attack<00:05:26.599> as<00:05:26.780> well<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:27.289> f7<00:05:28.190> is

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
in for the attack as well and f7 is

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.190 
in for the attack as well and f7 is
still<00:05:28.640> loose<00:05:28.960> so<00:05:29.960> if<00:05:30.650> someone's<00:05:31.099> taken<00:05:32.200> Queen

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
still loose so if someone's taken Queen

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.649 
still loose so if someone's taken Queen
e6<00:05:33.650> and<00:05:33.890> now<00:05:34.490> look<00:05:34.669> at<00:05:34.789> this<00:05:34.880> pawn<00:05:35.180> you<00:05:35.570> know

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
e6 and now look at this pawn you know

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.050 
e6 and now look at this pawn you know
this<00:05:35.840> pawns<00:05:36.110> dangerous<00:05:36.650> as<00:05:36.800> well<00:05:37.010> there's<00:05:37.940> one

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
this pawns dangerous as well there's one

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.520 
this pawns dangerous as well there's one
of<00:05:38.150> things<00:05:38.330> about<00:05:38.450> rook<00:05:38.750> c5

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
of things about rook c5

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.129 
of things about rook c5
if<00:05:39.590> that's<00:05:40.490> not<00:05:40.700> defending<00:05:41.539> the<00:05:41.630> rook<00:05:41.810> who<00:05:41.990> is

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
if that's not defending the rook who is

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.959 
if that's not defending the rook who is
Queen<00:05:43.840> rook<00:05:44.840> III<00:05:45.380> so<00:05:46.099> we'll<00:05:46.400> leave<00:05:46.550> this<00:05:46.760> at

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:46.969 
Queen rook III so we'll leave this at

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:48.459 
Queen rook III so we'll leave this at
the<00:05:47.090> first<00:05:47.300> scene<00:05:47.630> I<00:05:47.870> want<00:05:48.050> to<00:05:48.139> split<00:05:48.349> this

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
the first scene I want to split this

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:49.990 
the first scene I want to split this
kind<00:05:48.740> of<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:48.889> effort<00:05:49.250> when<00:05:49.400> I<00:05:49.490> said<00:05:49.669> it<00:05:49.789> into

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
kind of the effort when I said it into

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.510 
kind of the effort when I said it into
three<00:05:50.240> parts<00:05:50.479> so<00:05:50.870> this<00:05:51.710> is<00:05:51.889> move<00:05:52.159> 28<00:05:54.520> looking

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
three parts so this is move 28 looking

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.940 
three parts so this is move 28 looking
free<00:05:55.760> let's<00:05:56.510> just<00:05:56.750> review<00:05:57.110> these<00:05:57.289> first<00:05:57.620> 28

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
free let's just review these first 28

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.690 
free let's just review these first 28
moves<00:05:58.310> and<00:05:59.860> then<00:06:00.860> look<00:06:01.159> at<00:06:01.250> the<00:06:01.340> next<00:06:01.580> thing

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
moves and then look at the next thing

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.500 
moves and then look at the next thing
the<00:06:01.820> next<00:06:01.880> video<00:06:02.389> so<00:06:03.340> after<00:06:04.340> move<00:06:04.490> 28<00:06:04.940> it<00:06:05.360> was

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
the next video so after move 28 it was
