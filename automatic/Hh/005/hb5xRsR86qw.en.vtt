00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.320
 ok so now we've set our 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.340
 wrist of a wallet 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.440
 I fixed the party cache 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.030
 minel so who is who and saleh who is 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.410
 now well dry since we will have more 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.410
 need this part there is completely 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.950
 now what we are going to do is that 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.880
 before hitting the rings at the 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.000
 ligature etc 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.220
 we still have the ring that will come 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.050
 put here so we're going to slide so we're going 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.630
 go fix with a glue point and 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.640
 an ear the text ring we're going 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.960
 also leave with coccyx data but 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.700
 it will be necessary to pay attention to 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.550
 the orientation of the readers of the white 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.910
 merck i will come back to this later on 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.910
 the parties 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.450
 no 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.879
 m 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.690
 and 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 and 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.610
 that's what I 'm going to do now 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.340
 that the ring is positioned I'm going 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.840
 try to put pressure on the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.310
 cork so that with a small 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 reflex so that the glue 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.080
 during the drying time take 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.080
 well 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.890
 really tight on the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.110
 So here is my circle settled I 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.409
 will be able to let dry in all 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.409
 serenity 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.780
 good now last step 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.310
 we're going to fix the tip top on the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.080
 last strand of the cam 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.080
 so that's very important 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.000
 so I'm going to put it on clean 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.700
 as I explained to you earlier 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.170
 you can place it either on the pine 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.910
 or then on the reverse side 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.440
 I decided to put on the pine 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.080
 to have an action 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.920
 a little bit faster so first I 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.140
 will take the measure 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.590
 know how far I need to 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.250
 the time is sure but on my shoe 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:38.459
 in bank 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:43.050
 so no, then I know I have to 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:46.950
 put epoxy so far so we're going 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.400
 start so my little epoxy mix gets 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.400
 Located 20 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.060
 here I present myself to remove a 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:06.560
 over and so we pay attention 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:14.840
 to have his floor and kim down to 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:19.310
 I'm gone so here I'm not bad 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.770
 de j pal so extra deposit so 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:30.050
 I will be able to show all that we are 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:32.420
 so gone luc laprise of the epoxy is 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.760
 slow case no problem you can 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.570
 so the saiem the test rigs 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:42.410
 I will be able to position my 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.620
 ring compared to my team so the 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:50.200
 monuc premium 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:53.420
 the ag declines up on which occupies 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.380
 now up if so it takes 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.380
 better mail down 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.569
 so here is once you have your 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:10.349
 thorns that is well positioned could 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:11.940
 to be good between us to our verses 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.690
 down and you just have to wait 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.690
 that it dries 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.340
