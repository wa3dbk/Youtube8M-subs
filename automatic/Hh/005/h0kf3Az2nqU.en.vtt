00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the halfway mark Winfield and you had to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.860

make<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> really<00:00:40.829> tough<00:00:40.920> decision<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.969> not<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
make the really tough decision to not to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.540 
make the really tough decision to not to
continue<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.710> honest<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.070> don't<00:00:44.129> think

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
continue but to be honest I don't think

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.670 
continue but to be honest I don't think
I<00:00:45.149> would<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.600> been<00:00:45.780> able<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.079> make<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.500> back

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
I would have been able to make it back

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.130 
I would have been able to make it back
or<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> did<00:00:47.910> get<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.660> back<00:00:48.840> i<00:00:48.870> think<00:00:49.020> i

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
or if I did get all the back i think i

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.510 
or if I did get all the back i think i
would<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.320> caused<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:50.280> serious

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
would have caused a really serious

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.830 
would have caused a really serious
injury<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.059> probably<00:00:51.300> would<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.510> put<00:00:51.690> me

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
injury that probably would have put me

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.630 
injury that probably would have put me
up<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.020> foot<00:00:52.559> running<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> rest<00:00:53.579> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
up to foot running for for the rest of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520 
up to foot running for for the rest of
the<00:00:53.730> year<00:00:53.910> yeah<00:00:54.629> you've<00:00:54.809> dealt<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
as much as possible see why my my hip

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.670 
as much as possible see why my my hip
flexor<00:02:32.520> seems<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:33.030> tightening<00:02:33.870> up<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:34.260> much

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
flexor seems to be tightening up so much

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.290 
flexor seems to be tightening up so much
and<00:02:34.980> maybe<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.400> was<00:02:35.580> just<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.150> high

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
and maybe it was just that the high

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.750 
and maybe it was just that the high
altitude<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:37.170> obviously<00:02:38.130> breathing<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.640> lot

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
altitude and obviously breathing a lot

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.180 
altitude and obviously breathing a lot

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
deeper so Mercer Leah's seems to be

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.070 
deeper so Mercer Leah's seems to be
talking<00:02:41.790> up<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:42.209> as<00:02:42.300> soon<00:02:42.390> as<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.630> can<00:02:42.780> get<00:02:42.870> that
