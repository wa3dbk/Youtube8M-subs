00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.390
 many beginners often ask themselves 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.110
 how are we doing for 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.090
 improvise 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.590
 concretely who what is it 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.809
 must think that is what happens in 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.610
 the head of an improvisers it's this 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.230
 which we will discuss in this part the 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.060
 different theoretical tools and 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.640
 harmonic same techniques that one 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.960
 can learn and exploit to create 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.660
 beautiful solos 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.480
 the first tool is probably the most 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.140
 important is the inspiration 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.000
 inspiration is simply 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.250
 listen to an accompaniment and be 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.900
 able to imagine a melody that will 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.039
 stick pretty well on it and played it 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.480
 right after I just thought about that I 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.680
 played them here not Y'avait 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.600
 accompaniment and accompaniment 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.140
 it can go well or not but it's the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.030
 concept 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.890
 so all this is already a huge 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.510
 part of the improvisation does it 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.500
 to imagine things and toys 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.670
 also all work at once purely 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.980
 spiritual we will say find ideas 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.149
 find original ideas and a 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.190
 also technical work to be 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.359
 able to play them immediately his 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.780
 white cloth to reflect for 10 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.129
 minutes 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.380
 where do I place my fingers and 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.240
 it's another thing that we can 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.799
 to learn there is harmonic work 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.229
 this is the concept we call the 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.000
 target notes as I say in the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.520
 previous part very briefly 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.640
 we have an accompaniment and we must play 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.439
 compared to the harmonic context of 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.329
 this accompaniment means we're going 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.220
 have a suite of agreements these agreements 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.870
 are formed of notes 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.130
 you have to learn which notes compose 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.750
 agreements in the case in the minor 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.660
 for example I have the notes 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.430
 the teen is put and his notes there are going to us 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.680
 serve as our target of very notes 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.390
 important fundamental really around 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.640
 which we have to turn our 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.430
 melodies our improvisation so if I 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.470
 am on a lamination 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.470
 aim the notes the noÃ©mie 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.560
 esm arranged so that my melodies puts 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.840
 well forward his notes 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.100
 this concept there is a little bit more 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.240
 complex than that in truth there it is 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.679
 really an extremely example 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.060
 simplistic since in real 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.000
 accompaniment chandon chords 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.860
 that we have to adapt our target to 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.720
 chords that change and we can also do 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.710
 not voluntarily aim the notes if 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.830
 my toys things a little bit 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.510
 wrong precisely to get out a little 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.730
 preconceived stuff and a little stuff 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.069
 little repetitive but nevertheless it remains a 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.379
 essential tool to learn especially 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.269
 when we start our analyzes and the 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.420
 chord grid and find the notes 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.980
 important targeted in your melodies that 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.920
 will help you find ideas that 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.090
 sounds good on the accompaniment 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.920
 all that is something pretty 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.470
 difficult to learn that requires 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.360
 a lot a lot of experience and early or 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.370
 late when we improvise a moment ago 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.560
 given we have more ideas we have more 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.690
 of inspiration we know more really 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.269
 what target targets we know more 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.470
 what to do with all of this so there is a 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.819
 another tool that we can learn 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.440
 this is called leaks in 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.609
 English are musical phrases 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.900
 short of the little things of the kind of 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.030
 little sentences like that we learn 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.350
 by heart that have already been used 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.870
 hundreds and hundreds and 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.489
 hundreds of times and that sounds good and 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.810
 that we can simply use in 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.980
 the solo when you're a little bit 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.780
 inspiration breakdown 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.160
 so there are people who will say to each other 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.200
 yeah but it's a bit cheated that is 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.519
 no more really improvisation it's 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.720
 true it's no longer really improvisation 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.690
 since age is by something I have 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.760
 imagined but still it's very 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.190
 used all the guitarists who 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.170
 improvise have already used it a day or 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.310
 the other there is still a big job 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.810
 to do that it's not fair 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.950
 case-based learning because it takes 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.930
 learn to play them 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.609
 a technical work but it is also necessary 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.739
 learn to play them at the right time at 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.889
 good place on the good accompaniment this 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.650
 little book I made on a blues 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.760
 it goes nickel if I play good time if 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.500
 I play on a blues that is in the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.900
 bad quality it will sound wrong if I 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.959
 play under metal it will be completely 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.430
 So ridiculous learning leaks 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.930
 is not so obvious it seems there 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.630
 must be learned by heart but also 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.400
 learn to use them 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.840
 in addition to all that there are still some 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.579
 times when we have more inspiration has 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.850
 public in mind unless replaying the 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:56.930
 even 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.540
 ten thousand times in a row but it becomes 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.920
 quickly boring and there are two other three 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.000
 tips that can be learned for 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.560
 fill a little a solo the concept it's 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.880
 to learn small techniques that 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.830
 are going to play tight range watch 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.850
 an example that I can show you everything 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.010
 right now it's called 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.510
 broken ranges I will not go into 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.370
 the details because we will do everything one 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.050
 short this topic but we take a range 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.620
 for example the pentatonic range of the 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.270
 minor instead of playing it like that 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.130
 all the way down or up and down we go 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:30.620
 change places and notes to do that 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.750
 for example it's not very very 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.570
 hard to learn but it's a 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.980
 very useful tool when you want 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.270
 start sentences or we want 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.770
 lengthen a little bit a sentence 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.270
 concept too much to do one's part and to 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.150
 to link sentences together 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.070
 to fill a little bit a solo and that 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.360
 usually sounds pretty good so 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.130
 it's another thing to learn these 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.710
 business a bit of filling like that 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.510
 using the small techniques 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.370
 of arrangement note in ranges in 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.750
 more of that we can also react to 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.340
 the accompaniment that is to say that 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.050
 accompaniment are musicians who 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.880
 are going to play a suite of chords we can 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.130
 join them playing too disagree on 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.440
 can enrich the adore play them 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.420
 arpeggios of these chords if we want a 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.610
 generally put a little side 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.240
 the melodies to rather strengthen the 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.010
 harmonic side of the accompaniment and 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.630
 to finish one last thing that we 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.570
 can do when we improvise in 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.530
 some cases it is to answer a 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.000
 other musician 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.770
 so that's the case where you improvise 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.970
 at two it can be two guitarists or 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.620
 a pianist a guitarist a 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.540
 saxophonist a guitarist following the 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.760
 training that you have is actually 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.430
 each musician will improvise in turn 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.200
 role and you can reuse 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.830
 the improvisation of the other musician for 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.200
 answer to 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.240
 so if the first musician plays a 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.650
 sentence that you have that you have 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.270
 a good queen a good technique you 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.440
 replay that sentence and you tour 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.670
 a little bit else you turn a 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.170
 little bit around you make some more 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.880
 and after the price is musician is going 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.980
 maybe answer back to your 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.690
 improvisation and would create a 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.770
 dialogue between the musicians it's 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.630
 something that is done very often 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.430
 between guitarist if you look at 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.440
 concerts with two solo guitarists 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.390
 it's a safe bet that a roll but 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.280
 they will improvise who will establish this 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.870
 kind of dialogue between your 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.540
 will recognize right away 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.090
 so all that is pretty much the tools 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.980
 we can learn and teach 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.510
 exploit to improvise 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.400
 that's what's going on in the head of a 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.650
 improvisers we have an accompaniment 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.320
 the improviser will think about the agreements 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.040
 will define another target in his head 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.740
 after a while it becomes 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.660
 instinctively he will imagine melodies 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.280
 who exploit or not enough our target 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.930
 he will play his melodies when he has a 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.400
 little bit stuck and to do a little bit of 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.560
 filling or use one or two 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.330
 small x to fill a few holes 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.500
 if there is another musician he goes there 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.360
 answer and sometimes he's just going to 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.260
 content to reinforce or play a 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.670
 little with the accompaniment it's basically 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.100
 99% of the solos that are built as 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.930
 that's all I can 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.360
 show you the wise goal knows what we 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.770
 wants to know how to learn how to do
