00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.880
 the photos record all the moments 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.259
 Funny life yet that 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.000
 it leaves us memories that last for 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.210
 always that's why we want to see each other 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.739
 photogenic in this video we are going to 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.079
 show two looks to make them look 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:34.329
 beautiful in your photos one focused on 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.329
 the lips and another focused on the eyes 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.870
 let's start with our pigment 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.550
 school tries to shrink from the aggression 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.620
 here it has a little bit of pigment and 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.730
 I have videos is a little humid 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.010
 normally as you are with the brush 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.329
 Let 's go with the little finger, let 's take the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.460
 complement and you can take it from here 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.100
 as he talks about chips after pressing the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.980
 what you want and what I'm going to do is with 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.620
 videos concentrate it in the center of my 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.710
 part and moistened with donuts so that 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.230
 will fix this shadow well because the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.580
 shadows that are so loose are set 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.680
 better 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.680
 and I'm just focused on being 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.890
 to my mother 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.020
 I was four months old and all right and without 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.700
 take shadow wang go over the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.229
 corners and taking nothing else like the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.390
 little point where my shadow ends 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.890
 apply with your finger and out the web 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.920
 the universe in this way I will stay 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.140
 much more about the color at the edges 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.119
 that in the center and so the light goes to 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.119
 bounce is the center of the shadows 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.960
 now he's going to take the video in the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.810
 abstraction and I will pass it for the part 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.820
 upper eyelid and only by the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.740
 internal part premiered to lengthen 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.590
 my eyelashes but I do not want it to look 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.180
 it's nothing for an illusion and nothing else what 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.180
 you notice this eyeliner 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.520
 Now I'm here to highlight those 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.530
 tabs to use the masks 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.360
 throw them only the feet so 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.230
 higher this part I think it's super 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.230
 clear and fresh 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.520
 these are the eyes now for this look 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.140
 photogenic focused on the lips and that 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.420
 it's a lot before your photos so 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.910
 we will use the expressly the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.310
 I hope it is very fuchsia super super 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.410
 beautiful and stella vial is also going to 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.180
 last a lot because it's from the line 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.670
 extra time so you're not going to have to 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.670
 worry if you're in a day and this one 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.560
 want to apply 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.959
 so we make our looks 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.580
 photogenic but not only there is a 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.380
 makeup to look great and she 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.770
 keep the photos so why not 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.720
 we make your against 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.400
 now even knowing that more focused on 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.640
 the costs starting behind these 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.710
 pigments 420 I have the celebration let's go 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.390
 to take an angled brush and this 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.160
 it's wet too that what I did 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.140
 the droplets of water was going to take a 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.390
 little bit can be from here and it can be 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.510
 I repeat where I want and we will go over what 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.270
 The inner lower part of the eye 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.560
 has begun with the tear 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.560
 the like halfway around 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.000
 machado 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.900
 and now they define their country 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.900
 feel 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.349
 ready to make sure I clean is brush and 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.519
 I will take with the mind in heaven and 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.590
 the trachea in my capital and it goes 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.200
 just take a little bit and this is 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.200
 then apply on the outside of 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.060
 lopez give me some super color 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.859
 unexpected because it's nobody expects that 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.230
 have that on this side of our eyes 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.030
 internal or in different places so 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.459
 is going to be the striking part in the 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.459
 parts that can simply review 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.639
 like her usually with water 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:36.350
 so that this one is very very happy 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.510
 the missions 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.550

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.780
 apply in the institute inclusive and what 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.000
 applied at the top I want to be 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.350
 a black line either if also if 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.350
 Now I hope so it looks 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:01.949
 ok with the knobs now we use this 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:04.399

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.399
 give him kisses 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:11.930

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.930
 that the pink color so intense 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:24.419

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.160

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.880
