soldier so my first load out is the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.330 
soldier so my first load out is the
rocket<00:00:15.420> launcher<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:16.410> shotgun<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
rocket launcher the shotgun on the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.420 
rocket launcher the shotgun on the
market<00:00:17.670> gardener<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.390> pretty<00:00:19.260> basic<00:00:19.800> loader

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
market gardener a pretty basic loader

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.200 
market gardener a pretty basic loader
and<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:22.140> reason<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:23.039> because<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
and the reason for that is because the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.230 
and the reason for that is because the
rocket<00:00:24.720> won't<00:00:24.840> should<00:00:25.199> just<00:00:25.550> know<00:00:26.550> there's<00:00:27.090> no

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
rocket won't should just know there's no

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.330 
rocket won't should just know there's no
really<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:28.199> isn't<00:00:28.439> really<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.710> rocket

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
really that isn't really a rocket

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.299 
really that isn't really a rocket
launcher<00:00:29.640> that's<00:00:29.820> better<00:00:30.300> than<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.869> mean

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
launcher that's better than it I mean

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.970 
launcher that's better than it I mean
four<00:00:32.309> shots<00:00:32.640> good<00:00:33.239> damage<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.530> know<00:00:34.649> there's

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
four shots good damage you know there's

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.270 
four shots good damage you know there's
no<00:00:35.100> gimmick<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.780> good<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.230> works<00:00:38.040> if

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
no gimmick to it it's good it works if

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.369 
no gimmick to it it's good it works if
you<00:00:38.430> need<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> rocket<00:00:38.940> launcher<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:40.140> pretty

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
you need a rocket launcher for pretty

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.290 
you need a rocket launcher for pretty
much<00:00:40.440> every<00:00:40.829> situation<00:00:41.489> you've<00:00:41.730> got<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> on

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
much every situation you've got it on

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.270 
much every situation you've got it on
the<00:00:42.710> shotgun<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.460> only<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.850> four<00:00:45.030> rockets

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
the shotgun you only have four rockets

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.229 
the shotgun you only have four rockets
and<00:00:47.280> they<00:00:47.370> fire<00:00:47.610> quite<00:00:47.940> slowly<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:49.789> which<00:00:50.789> I'm

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
and they fire quite slowly and which I'm

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.490 
and they fire quite slowly and which I'm
I<00:00:51.510> don't<00:00:51.690> think<00:00:51.809> there's<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.989> rocket<00:00:52.260> launcher

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
I don't think there's a rocket launcher

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.139 
I don't think there's a rocket launcher
which<00:00:52.620> fires<00:00:52.860> faster<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.699> know<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
which fires faster but you know the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.270 
which fires faster but you know the
rocket<00:00:54.480> launcher<00:00:54.590> doesn't<00:00:55.590> fire<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.010> fast

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
rocket launcher doesn't fire that fast

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.510 
rocket launcher doesn't fire that fast
so<00:00:56.699> if<00:00:56.940> you've<00:00:57.090> not<00:00:57.420> done<00:00:57.480> too<00:00:58.020> much<00:00:58.320> damage

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
so if you've not done too much damage

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.069 
so if you've not done too much damage
let's<00:00:59.520> save<00:00:59.699> only<00:00:59.850> done<00:01:00.090> chip<00:01:00.390> damage<00:01:00.840> but

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
let's save only done chip damage but

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.900 
let's save only done chip damage but
they're<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.410> pretty<00:01:01.680> low<00:01:01.890> health<00:01:02.129> just

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
they're on pretty low health just

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.409 
probably just through spam and you know
accidental<00:04:25.139> luck<00:04:25.620> so<00:04:26.490> yeah<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:26.880> they're<00:04:27.120> the

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
accidental luck so yeah and they're the

basically<00:04:31.229> airborne<00:04:31.770> enemies<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:32.610> shoot

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
basically airborne enemies you shoot

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.450 
basically airborne enemies you shoot
them<00:04:33.090> and<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:34.169> do<00:04:34.320> mini<00:04:34.500> quit<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:34.949> basically

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
them and you do mini quit it's basically

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.750 
them and you do mini quit it's basically
the<00:04:35.580> shotgun<00:04:36.210> version<00:04:36.570> of<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.720> direct<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.289> and

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
the shotgun version of the direct it and

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.029 
the shotgun version of the direct it and
although<00:04:38.760> you<00:04:38.940> get<00:04:39.120> less<00:04:39.300> shot<00:04:39.630> your<00:04:40.289> it's

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
although you get less shot your it's

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.770 
although you get less shot your it's
kind<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.340> just<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.580> back<00:04:41.820> up<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.270> direct<00:04:42.630> it

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
kind of just to back up the direct it

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.770 
kind of just to back up the direct it
because<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.410> has<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.919> air<00:04:44.120> you<00:04:45.120> know<00:04:45.240> smaller

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
because it has the air you know smaller

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.180 
because it has the air you know smaller
blast<00:04:46.229> radius<00:04:46.850> so<00:04:47.850> you<00:04:48.449> know<00:04:49.070> aiming<00:04:50.070> your

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
blast radius so you know aiming your

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.860 
blast radius so you know aiming your
shots<00:04:50.490> are<00:04:50.699> important<00:04:51.180> but<00:04:51.419> if<00:04:51.570> your<00:04:51.720> aim

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
shots are important but if your aim

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.469 
shots are important but if your aim
isn't<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.320> best<00:04:52.500> like<00:04:52.860> mine<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.850> shotgun<00:04:54.120> can

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
isn't the best like mine the shotgun can

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.080 
isn't the best like mine the shotgun can
come<00:04:54.690> really<00:04:55.199> really<00:04:55.350> handy<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:56.550> last<00:04:56.940> the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
come really really handy and last the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.930 
come really really handy and last the
escape<00:04:57.479> plan<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:58.190> since<00:04:59.190> you<00:04:59.400> are<00:04:59.430> going<00:04:59.880> to

escape plan and since you are going to

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.400 
escape plan and since you are going to
be<00:05:00.030> dealing<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.660> lot<00:05:00.690> of<00:05:00.900> damage<00:05:01.080> you're
