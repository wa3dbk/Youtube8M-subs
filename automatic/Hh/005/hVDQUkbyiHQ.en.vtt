close<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.100> ending<00:02:34.520> I<00:02:34.580> feel<00:02:34.850> like<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.180> will<00:02:35.480> do<00:02:35.660> it

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
close to ending I feel like I will do it

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.500

but I really hate that scan and I much

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.330 
but I really hate that scan and I much
prefer<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.810> compass<00:02:39.230> puzzle<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.739> feel<00:02:40.220> like

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
prefer the compass puzzle I feel like

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.979 
prefer the compass puzzle I feel like
that's<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.700> lot<00:02:40.880> more<00:02:41.090> doable<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.840> don't

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
that's a lot more doable and you don't

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.540 
that's a lot more doable and you don't
have<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.230> it's<00:02:42.470> not<00:02:42.590> like<00:02:42.650> trial<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.430> error

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
have to it's not like trial and error

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.430 
have to it's not like trial and error
it's<00:02:43.970> more<00:02:44.270> just<00:02:44.300> pinpointing<00:02:45.050> where<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.350> is

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
it's more just pinpointing where it is

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.130 
it's more just pinpointing where it is
on<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.709> map<00:02:45.980> instead<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.670> having<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.570> random

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
on a map instead of having that random

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.020 
on a map instead of having that random
chance<00:02:48.410> of<00:02:48.620> scanning<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.400> right<00:02:49.550> area<00:02:49.850> you

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030

didn't<00:03:04.730> really<00:03:04.820> get<00:03:05.060> any<00:03:05.120> super<00:03:05.750> awesome<00:03:06.320> rare

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
didn't really get any super awesome rare

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.699 
didn't really get any super awesome rare
loot<00:03:06.769> my<00:03:07.370> best<00:03:07.760> rare<00:03:08.510> drop<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.080> feel<00:03:09.290> like<00:03:09.440> is

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
loot my best rare drop I feel like is

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.220 
loot my best rare drop I feel like is
the<00:03:09.980> bandos<00:03:10.489> play<00:03:11.060> body<00:03:11.330> which<00:03:11.660> i<00:03:11.840> think<00:03:11.900> is

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
the bandos play body which i think is

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.590 
the bandos play body which i think is
like<00:03:12.440> only<00:03:12.650> 70k<00:03:13.100> so<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.640> wasn't<00:03:14.000> anything

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
like only 70k so that wasn't anything

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.170 
like only 70k so that wasn't anything
spectacular<00:03:14.900> but<00:03:15.530> again<00:03:15.920> each<00:03:16.220> clue<00:03:16.610> roughly

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
spectacular but again each clue roughly

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.620 
spectacular but again each clue roughly
averages<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.870> be<00:03:17.959> around<00:03:18.200> death<00:03:18.769> 250<00:03:19.610> 300<00:03:20.239> k

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
averages to be around death 250 300 k

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.130 
averages to be around death 250 300 k
for<00:03:21.410> elites<00:03:21.680> at<00:03:21.890> least<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.660> yeah<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:23.690> did<00:03:23.959> like

items that you get from the KU scrolls

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.219 
items that you get from the KU scrolls
and<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.180> can't<00:04:28.449> get<00:04:28.599> these<00:04:28.720> pretty<00:04:29.110> much

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
and you can't get these pretty much

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.080 
and you can't get these pretty much
anywhere<00:04:29.590> else<00:04:29.770> now<00:04:30.280> it's<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.490> lot<00:04:30.639> less<00:04:30.849> than

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
anywhere else now it's a lot less than

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.219 
anywhere else now it's a lot less than
it<00:04:31.210> looks<00:04:31.389> like<00:04:31.539> if<00:04:31.720> you're<00:04:31.840> not<00:04:31.870> familiar

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
it looks like if you're not familiar

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.320 
it looks like if you're not familiar
with<00:04:32.680> these<00:04:32.770> items<00:04:32.949> like<00:04:33.610> for<00:04:33.759> example<00:04:33.819> these

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
with these items like for example these

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.749 
with these items like for example these
ancient<00:04:34.990> vampires<00:04:35.349> are<00:04:35.590> only<00:04:35.710> like<00:04:35.860> 2<00:04:36.099> K<00:04:36.310> and

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
ancient vampires are only like 2 K and

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.189 
ancient vampires are only like 2 K and
they<00:04:36.819> probably<00:04:37.000> don't<00:04:37.180> even<00:04:37.330> sell<00:04:37.599> and<00:04:37.840> then

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
they probably don't even sell and then

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.409 
they probably don't even sell and then
these<00:04:38.439> uh<00:04:38.500> kits<00:04:39.400> are<00:04:39.580> not<00:04:39.759> worth<00:04:40.030> anything

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
these uh kits are not worth anything

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.709 
these uh kits are not worth anything
either<00:04:40.719> 5k<00:04:41.379> and<00:04:41.530> 4k<00:04:41.740> so<00:04:42.240> yeah<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.509> most

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:43.719 
either 5k and 4k so yeah the most

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:45.719 
either 5k and 4k so yeah the most
profitable<00:04:44.319> part<00:04:44.680> of<00:04:44.770> this<00:04:44.889> is<00:04:45.189> probably<00:04:45.550> the

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
profitable part of this is probably the

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.619 
profitable part of this is probably the
purple<00:04:46.300> sweets<00:04:46.569> and<00:04:47.189> probably<00:04:48.189> the<00:04:48.789> rune

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:49.629 
purple sweets and probably the rune

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:51.600 
purple sweets and probably the rune
armor<00:04:49.990> because<00:04:50.199> of<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:50.680> elk<00:04:50.830> values<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.460> it

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
armor because of the elk values and it

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.749 
armor because of the elk values and it
turns<00:04:51.759> out<00:04:51.879> to<00:04:51.969> be<00:04:52.090> only<00:04:52.300> 400<00:04:53.169> k<00:04:53.379> that<00:04:54.159> is<00:04:54.189> quite

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
turns out to be only 400 k that is quite

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.760 
turns out to be only 400 k that is quite
sad<00:04:55.090> it's<00:04:55.629> understandable<00:04:56.349> though<00:04:56.469> because

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
sad it's understandable though because

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.249 
sad it's understandable though because
of<00:04:57.250> how<00:04:57.370> old<00:04:57.759> these<00:04:58.000> items<00:04:58.240> are<00:04:58.509> and<00:04:58.780> a<00:04:59.020> lot<00:04:59.050> of

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
of how old these items are and a lot of

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.330 
of how old these items are and a lot of
them<00:04:59.469> they're<00:04:59.740> really<00:05:00.129> not<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:01.180> cool<00:05:01.509> I<00:05:01.569> mean

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
them they're really not that cool I mean

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.770 
them they're really not that cool I mean
who<00:05:03.340> really<00:05:03.520> wants<00:05:03.699> to<00:05:04.060> wear<00:05:04.270> a<00:05:04.300> ban<00:05:04.599> those

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
who really wants to wear a ban those

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.439 
who really wants to wear a ban those
platebody<00:05:05.110> not<00:05:05.949> many<00:05:06.129> people<00:05:06.219> even<00:05:06.639> wear<00:05:07.030> rune

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
platebody not many people even wear rune

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.469 
platebody not many people even wear rune
in<00:05:07.719> the<00:05:07.840> first<00:05:08.080> place<00:05:08.229> and<00:05:09.210> honestly<00:05:10.210> it's

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
in the first place and honestly it's

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.499 
in the first place and honestly it's
kind<00:05:10.569> of<00:05:10.780> useless<00:05:10.990> items<00:05:11.349> so<00:05:11.879> that's<00:05:12.879> that<00:05:13.120> but

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
kind of useless items so that's that but

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.050 
kind of useless items so that's that but
you<00:05:13.659> know<00:05:13.690> adds<00:05:13.990> another<00:05:14.199> 400<00:05:14.919> k<00:05:15.069> to<00:05:15.460> my<00:05:15.610> price

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
you know adds another 400 k to my price

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.149 
you know adds another 400 k to my price
check<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:16.599> that<00:05:16.629> means<00:05:16.930> i<00:05:17.110> am<00:05:17.139> at<00:05:17.500> nine<00:05:17.800> point

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
check and that means i am at nine point

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.600 
check and that means i am at nine point
five<00:05:18.400> mil<00:05:18.729> in<00:05:18.969> just<00:05:19.779> 34<00:05:20.379> elites<00:05:20.889> so<00:05:21.310> i<00:05:21.340> am

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
five mil in just 34 elites so i am

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.189 
five mil in just 34 elites so i am
pretty<00:05:21.909> happy<00:05:22.090> about<00:05:22.270> that<00:05:22.599> and<00:05:22.750> hopefully

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
pretty happy about that and hopefully

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.350 
pretty happy about that and hopefully
furthering<00:05:23.979> in<00:05:24.099> the<00:05:24.189> series<00:05:24.550> i<00:05:24.759> can<00:05:25.210> maybe

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
furthering in the series i can maybe

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.439 
furthering in the series i can maybe
strike<00:05:26.169> it<00:05:26.349> big<00:05:26.650> and<00:05:26.979> get<00:05:27.370> a<00:05:27.550> nice<00:05:27.789> drop<00:05:28.180> like

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
strike it big and get a nice drop like

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.209 
strike it big and get a nice drop like
maybe<00:05:28.689> a<00:05:28.779> shadow<00:05:29.110> die<00:05:29.349> or<00:05:29.529> something<00:05:29.710> i<00:05:30.039> know

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:30.219 
maybe a shadow die or something i know

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:32.550 
maybe a shadow die or something i know
the<00:05:30.460> chances<00:05:30.789> of<00:05:30.909> that<00:05:31.029> are<00:05:31.090> so<00:05:31.509> low<00:05:31.750> that<00:05:31.990> i'm

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
the chances of that are so low that i'm

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.680 
the chances of that are so low that i'm
not<00:05:32.590> really<00:05:33.069> gonna<00:05:33.400> hope<00:05:33.969> for<00:05:34.000> it<00:05:34.330> but<00:05:34.599> you

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
not really gonna hope for it but you

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.290 
not really gonna hope for it but you
never<00:05:34.900> know<00:05:35.080> so<00:05:35.469> let's<00:05:35.830> move<00:05:36.099> on<00:05:36.250> to<00:05:36.669> the<00:05:36.879> slide

types and then how many hours is taken
so<00:05:48.339> far<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:48.879> the<00:05:49.629> best<00:05:49.870> clue<00:05:50.110> i've<00:05:50.259> had<00:05:50.440> so<00:05:50.650> far

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
so far and the best clue i've had so far

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.189 
so far and the best clue i've had so far
and<00:05:51.250> of<00:05:51.639> course<00:05:51.669> the<00:05:52.089> final<00:05:52.419> money<00:05:52.599> value<00:05:52.930> so

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
and of course the final money value so

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.930 
and of course the final money value so
of<00:05:53.500> course<00:05:53.800> we're<00:05:54.039> at<00:05:54.129> nine<00:05:54.279> point<00:05:54.520> five<00:05:54.669> mil

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
of course we're at nine point five mil

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.579 
of course we're at nine point five mil
we<00:05:55.089> just<00:05:55.330> went<00:05:55.449> over<00:05:55.569> that<00:05:55.810> and<00:05:56.050> that's<00:05:56.440> for

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:56.589 
we just went over that and that's for

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.860 
we just went over that and that's for
the<00:05:56.620> time<00:05:56.919> i<00:05:56.949> am<00:05:57.279> not<00:05:57.520> including<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.300> time<00:05:58.599> of

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
the time i am not including the time of

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.540 
the time i am not including the time of
getting<00:05:59.500> the<00:05:59.650> elites<00:05:59.919> because<00:06:00.250> it's<00:06:00.400> so

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
getting the elites because it's so

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.670 
getting the elites because it's so
variable<00:06:01.029> and<00:06:01.300> i<00:06:01.360> have<00:06:01.839> no<00:06:02.169> way<00:06:02.319> of<00:06:02.469> tracking

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
variable and i have no way of tracking

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.249 
variable and i have no way of tracking
that<00:06:03.069> i<00:06:03.279> could<00:06:03.490> randomly<00:06:03.759> go<00:06:04.060> to<00:06:04.120> a<00:06:04.360> sarah<00:06:04.930> trip

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259 
that i could randomly go to a sarah trip

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.140 
that i could randomly go to a sarah trip
and<00:06:05.440> get<00:06:05.560> one<00:06:05.770> and<00:06:06.009> i<00:06:06.610> really<00:06:06.849> don't<00:06:07.000> know<00:06:07.060> how

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
and get one and i really don't know how

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.820 
and get one and i really don't know how
to<00:06:07.180> measure<00:06:07.479> that<00:06:07.750> do<00:06:08.139> i<00:06:08.169> measure<00:06:08.409> that<00:06:08.620> from

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
to measure that do i measure that from

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.499 
to measure that do i measure that from
the<00:06:08.949> start<00:06:09.129> of<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.310> trip<00:06:09.550> do<00:06:09.699> i<00:06:09.729> measure<00:06:10.270> that

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509 
the start of the trip do i measure that

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.689 
the start of the trip do i measure that
from<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:11.620> start<00:06:11.889> of<00:06:12.009> that<00:06:12.099> kill<00:06:12.279> count<00:06:12.490> or

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
from the start of that kill count or

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.300 
from the start of that kill count or
what<00:06:12.909> so<00:06:13.210> there<00:06:13.389> really<00:06:13.509> isn't<00:06:13.960> any<00:06:14.310> specific

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
what so there really isn't any specific

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.100 
what so there really isn't any specific
way<00:06:15.430> i<00:06:15.460> can<00:06:15.729> measure<00:06:15.969> how<00:06:16.300> long<00:06:16.360> it<00:06:16.599> takes<00:06:16.990> to

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
way i can measure how long it takes to

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.529 
way i can measure how long it takes to
get<00:06:17.440> a<00:06:17.500> clue<00:06:17.860> so<00:06:18.250> those<00:06:18.400> hours<00:06:18.759> are<00:06:19.000> just<00:06:19.270> me

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
get a clue so those hours are just me
