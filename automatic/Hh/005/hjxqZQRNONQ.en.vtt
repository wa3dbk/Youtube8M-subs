00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.359
 you're fine so today we get 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.980
 find for game express is that 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.570

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.429
 with an assault rifle tell us yeah 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.440
 blackburn did you say yeah you did 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.540
 to have the miter is actually it's the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.390
 thing is I have more of what guy 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.630
 will limit is and saw that I did not play the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.109
 week so I can not climb 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.449
 so 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.710
 and here I am not going to crack badly on myself 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.330
 this is it seems logical 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.039
 so I said to myself I'm going to do the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.670
 assault rifles too bad we will do everything 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.019
 in a mess 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.149
 in fact I wanted to start with 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.660
 mistresses for that to be more how 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.800
 to say for that to be clearer in your 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.090
 heads like I start with them 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.680
 mistresses like that learns do not forget 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.950
 submachine gun and all to learn not 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.360
 that of the seals for that is no longer there 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.710
 for that to be clearer in my head I 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.780
 wanted to start with the mistresses that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.160
 I 'm saying here we're going to do that but in 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.350
 I can not do that I can not do 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.690
 second week plan so I 'm so 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.710
 and we will continue the series with 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.239
 assault rifles so today this 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.949
 we go with the rx guys 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.000
 eric 160 so today I will not put 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.379
 of this class crime since I 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.549
 prepare my ideas in advance but in fact 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.960
 I do not have too much business rate of 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.150
 videos to prepare them 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.369
 how to say the work and especially so 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.350
 do the little blue planet la escrinet 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.180
 the class that I have no time here it is 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.890
 is on the week there is the taf all that I 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.140
 not too much time so I hope that 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.549
 Pascal happy anyway because 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.890
 frankly I'm killing myself doing videos 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.840
 in full week 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.340
 so while I have a lot of fingers 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.509
 but I said to myself 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.829
 even make a video for subscribers 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.930
 otherwise it's not enough so we'll say I 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.490
 force me a bit for my channel I 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.790
 really want to put a video by 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.409
 day 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.180
 an everyday life while 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.799
 simply and so today 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.189
 as I say it mixes precedes all 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.970
 the weapons is episode 4 6 games sum 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.920
 where the 5th I know more I'll see 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.600
 gerard later start but I believe 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.680
 that these four or five so that's it 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.210
 I hope you will like it so a 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.650
 cam really express it's clear he 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.940
 this is really chained to a 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.130
 monumental joke 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.020

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.200

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.680
