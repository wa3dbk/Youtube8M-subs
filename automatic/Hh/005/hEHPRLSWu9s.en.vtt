00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.450
 hi friends as well as venezuela de obama on this occasion should 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.490
 present the homeland 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.320
 really 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.030
 batteries this eclipse have been working in our aspe market 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:13.999
 many years 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.529
 and that this time they are surprising us with a new flame model 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.199
 master flavor 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.250
 which 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.900
 etienne very similar benefits 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.989
 And it is 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.909
 the closest thing to an acoustic drum 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.079
 per cent within this benefit we can not find 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.240
 with the current weather 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.450
 with which they are working 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.020
 this 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.850
 who have a patch 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 which is a patch where we 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.380
 we have a bounce 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.100
 this very natural and at the same time adjustable sa that has a ring and towers 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.230
 as if it were an acoustic drum 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.730
 through this we can decide on what tension ikea 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.410
 realism we give to the battery 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.940
 in the case of an acoustic drummer it happens that many times the tomes 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.010
 per cent usually are usually in with tuning is a little lower 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.390
 then the patch tends to be more tense this time we can achieve what 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.760
 same 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.110
 for the all located as standing 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.600
 and in the case of the drum 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.220
 tune in some way 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.300
 at the same height previously very original tip beyond the likes and that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.640
 As everyone wants to end their artery 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.020
 in this battery we find that advantage 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.260
 it is not little I took many batteries this lie 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.229
 and they work through rubber bread which is not bad but 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.470
 why this battery somehow differs from the rest 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.630
 then percent at a time 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.950
 parents 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.260
 which entails double zone asÃ³n 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.410
 then we can find the sound of the real hoop 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.030
 more the sound of what this would be 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.320
 everyone gets 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.200
 percent 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.530
 the dishes 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.790
 they work mostly usually in double zone where we can find two years 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.219
 different in each dish as we have it 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.809
 percent in the case of recognition a bell 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.819
 and about the standard sound of the cymbal in general 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:27.729
 In the case of cases, we will not find a system made 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:33.009
 which is known as the plate of old cordenons 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.249
 let's find what we can for the dishes 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:40.369
 and that's a very important breakthrough is he that the drummer's problem 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.950
 high quality of electronics has a lot to do with the sensation of the dishes and 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.079
 the environment and climate that generates 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.750
 so we still have it well resolved 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.660
 I'll be showing you more or less as a sonata in a little while 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.229
 drums 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:03:00.619
 One of the advantages that also has this comfort that you have if you 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:05.789
 they are seeing inside this four-piece playpen how we can ride 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:09.049
 right away battery and how can we have it 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.889
 in our home how can we take it 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.859
 on tour to dawn the concerts or just have it as a way of 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:17.869
 study 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.529
 of anyone in any way loves 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:23.059
 is blind in what way this battery 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.509
 it yields spectacularly 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:30.099
 then we are not going to put aa to play the instrument a little 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:34.369
 and then I'm going to talk a little bit about the module also so they can see the 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:35.609
 efficient provision has
