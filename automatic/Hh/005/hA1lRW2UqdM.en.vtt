00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
because I like small beads so this is

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.610

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the pattern and this is an even count

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.910

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.720 
make even if you are a beginner and also
I'm<00:00:59.670> trying<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.770> beading<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.280> beading

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
I'm trying this beading this beading

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.109 
I'm trying this beading this beading
needle<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.570> they<00:01:03.840> are<00:01:03.989> from<00:01:04.409> India<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.220> inside

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
needle so they are from India and inside

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.420 
needle so they are from India and inside
you<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.720> find<00:01:07.250> six<00:01:08.250> needles<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.979> I<00:01:10.979> bought

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
you can find six needles and I bought

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
you can find six needles and I bought
them<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:12.500> 85<00:01:13.500> cents<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.180> they

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
them for 85 cents so I think that they

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.679 
them for 85 cents so I think that they
are<00:01:15.479> cheap<00:01:16.670> comparing<00:01:17.670> with<00:01:17.880> John<00:01:18.390> James

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
are cheap comparing with John James

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.600 
are cheap comparing with John James
asides<00:01:19.229> twelve<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:22.610> this

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
asides twelve and I think that this

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.280 
asides twelve and I think that this
needle<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.330> very<00:01:24.780> good<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.430> look<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:27.509> the

needle is very good because look the the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.830 
needle is very good because look the the
shape<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.829> my<00:01:29.070> needle<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:30.150> worked<00:01:30.570> with

Bozell is a to bigger for these small

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.040 
Bozell is a to bigger for these small
sides<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.890> pizza<00:02:27.580> then<00:02:28.090> there<00:02:28.600> was<00:02:28.810> another

sides of pizza then there was another

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.340 
sides of pizza then there was another
problem<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.750> color<00:02:31.990> the

few<00:02:38.680> colors<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.190> Charlotte<00:02:39.670> besides<00:02:40.480> 15<00:02:41.020> so<00:02:41.650> I

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
few colors of Charlotte besides 15 so I

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.860 
few colors of Charlotte besides 15 so I
wanted<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.590> be<00:02:44.740> zealous<00:02:45.280> um<00:02:45.520> of<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.270> Barsky

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
wanted to be zealous um of this Barsky

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.990 
wanted to be zealous um of this Barsky
crystals<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:48.100> showed<00:02:48.490> you<00:02:48.520> in<00:02:48.970> the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
crystals that I showed you in the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.630 
crystals that I showed you in the
previous<00:02:49.600> video<00:02:49.990> but<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.800> didn't<00:02:51.220> like<00:02:51.400> the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
previous video but I didn't like the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.120 
previous video but I didn't like the
matches<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.270> color<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:52.960> I<00:02:53.320> decided<00:02:53.830> to

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
matches of the color so I decided to

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.460 
matches of the color so I decided to
stop<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.580> work<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.240> I<00:02:55.780> want<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.200> try<00:02:56.410> to

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
stop this work and I want to try to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.460 
stop this work and I want to try to
bozell<00:02:56.920> another<00:02:57.400> thing<00:02:58.270> maybe<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.810> polymer

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
bozell another thing maybe a polymer

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.390 
bozell another thing maybe a polymer
clay<00:02:59.650> cap<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:01.210> have<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.290> maybe<00:03:02.890> in<00:03:03.220> the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
clay cap that I have and maybe in the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.510 
clay cap that I have and maybe in the
case<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.120> polymer<00:03:04.540> clay<00:03:04.720> cap<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:06.190> colors

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
case of the polymer clay cap the colors

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.790 
case of the polymer clay cap the colors
of<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.910> polymer<00:03:07.240> clay<00:03:07.420> cap<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.960> different<00:03:08.500> so

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
of the polymer clay cap is different so

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.580 
of the polymer clay cap is different so
maybe<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.220> can<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:10.030> can<00:03:10.480> create<00:03:10.780> something<00:03:11.110> that

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
maybe I can I can create something that

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.490 
maybe I can I can create something that
I<00:03:11.710> really<00:03:12.190> like<00:03:12.400> as<00:03:13.030> always<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.840> will<00:03:13.960> make<00:03:14.290> some

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
I really like as always I will make some

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.130 
I really like as always I will make some
tries<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:15.310> then<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:16.090> will<00:03:16.540> let<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.840> know<00:03:16.870> what

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
tries and then I will let you know what

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.010 
tries and then I will let you know what
I<00:03:17.170> think<00:03:17.470> about<00:03:17.590> this<00:03:18.370> particular<00:03:19.150> way<00:03:19.720> of

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
I think about this particular way of

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.560 
I think about this particular way of
making<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:21.040> pass<00:03:21.250> el<00:03:21.459> I<00:03:21.730> think<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.270> works

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
making a pass el I think it works

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.590 
making a pass el I think it works
because<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.590> Charlotte<00:03:24.070> pizza<00:03:24.700> close<00:03:25.240> the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
because the Charlotte pizza close the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.490 
because the Charlotte pizza close the
work<00:03:25.810> as<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.440> can<00:03:26.470> see<00:03:26.860> so<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:28.120> think<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:28.930> the

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
work as you can see so I think that the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.760 
work as you can see so I think that the
idea<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:30.100> good<00:03:30.370> but<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:31.480> must<00:03:32.050> choose<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.410> right

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
idea is good but I must choose the right

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.550 
idea is good but I must choose the right
component<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:34.090> put<00:03:34.300> inside<00:03:34.630> my<00:03:34.900> beaded<00:03:35.350> bezel

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
component to put inside my beaded bezel

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.690 
component to put inside my beaded bezel
beadwork<00:03:36.280> okay<00:03:36.820> so<00:03:37.780> for<00:03:38.500> now<00:03:38.620> that's<00:03:38.980> all<00:03:39.220> I

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
beadwork okay so for now that's all I

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.270 
beadwork okay so for now that's all I
hope<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:39.970> enjoyed<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.630> pattern<00:03:41.380> for<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.950> the

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
hope you enjoyed the pattern for the the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.760 
hope you enjoyed the pattern for the the
flat<00:03:42.520> even<00:03:42.700> count<00:03:42.820> peyote<00:03:43.209> stitch<00:03:43.630> I'm<00:03:44.140> not

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
flat even count peyote stitch I'm not

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.140 
flat even count peyote stitch I'm not
very<00:03:45.010> fun<00:03:45.280> yet<00:03:45.520> as<00:03:45.760> you<00:03:45.790> can<00:03:46.000> hear<00:03:46.810> by<00:03:47.260> my<00:03:47.440> voice
