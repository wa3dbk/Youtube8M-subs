we're<00:00:00.810> doing<00:00:01.530> so<00:00:02.600> it's<00:00:04.040> predicted

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.990 

where'd<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.160> tell<00:00:32.369> them<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:32.580> we're<00:00:32.760> doing

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
where'd you tell them what we're doing

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.180 
where'd you tell them what we're doing
so<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.810> need<00:00:34.080> someone<00:00:34.350> speaking<00:00:34.680> there<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
so we need someone speaking there to the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:01:10.090 
so we need someone speaking there to the
consumer

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:19.740 

that's<00:01:10.760> all

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.620 

Laurie<00:01:20.650> are<00:01:20.830> you<00:01:20.950> gonna<00:01:21.040> be<00:01:21.190> there

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.870 

I<00:01:24.689> think<00:01:25.079> so

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.210 

all<00:01:28.880> right<00:01:29.030> okay<00:01:29.270> we're<00:01:29.420> gonna<00:01:29.510> start<00:01:29.810> at<00:01:30.220> 1550

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
all right okay we're gonna start at 1550

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:52.180 
all right okay we're gonna start at 1550

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.940 

hey<00:03:46.670> I<00:03:47.090> think<00:03:47.540> what<00:03:47.629> we<00:03:47.689> should<00:03:47.719> do<00:03:47.959> is<00:03:48.109> get<00:03:48.290> the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
hey I think what we should do is get the

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.629 
hey I think what we should do is get the
one<00:03:49.099> that<00:03:49.280> we<00:03:49.370> made<00:03:50.889> loaded<00:03:51.889> if<00:03:52.189> we<00:03:52.280> can<00:03:52.459> beat

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
one that we made loaded if we can beat

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:59.559 
one that we made loaded if we can beat
202<00:03:53.209> while<00:03:53.510> she's<00:03:53.750> not<00:03:53.959> one<00:03:54.139> is<00:03:54.260> not<00:03:58.389> we<00:03:59.389> know

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569

202 while she's not one is not we know
