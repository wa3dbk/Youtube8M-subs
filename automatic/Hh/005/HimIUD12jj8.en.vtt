00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
500 it is a bidding method now this

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
method will work especially well a team

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.560 
method will work especially well a team
in<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> year<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.520> following<00:01:11.970> reasons

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
in the year for the following reasons

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.260 
in the year for the following reasons
now<00:01:13.200> packs<00:01:13.560> were<00:01:13.860> already<00:01:14.070> influenced<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.939> too

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
now packs were already influenced it too

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.660 
now packs were already influenced it too
much<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.810> mean<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.799> silver<00:01:17.400> players

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
much I mean you can get silver players

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.999 
much I mean you can get silver players
impact<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.600> guess<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.259> will<00:01:19.350> influence<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
impact so I guess it will influence it a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.890 
impact so I guess it will influence it a
bit<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.580> too<00:01:20.610> much<00:01:20.850> because<00:01:21.060> you're<00:01:21.720> most

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
bit but not too much because you're most

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.510 
bit but not too much because you're most
likely<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.380> really<00:01:22.680> good<00:01:22.830> pack<00:01:22.979> too<00:01:23.220> many

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
likely not really good pack too many

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
likely not really good pack too many
silvers<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:23.970> gold<00:01:24.210> packs<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.110> seen

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
