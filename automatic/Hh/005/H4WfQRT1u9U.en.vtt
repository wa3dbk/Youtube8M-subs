fun<00:03:02.050> thing<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.350> do<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:02.830> it's<00:03:03.630> it's<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.870> well

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
fun thing to do but it's it's a well

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.610 
fun thing to do but it's it's a well
worth<00:03:05.950> your<00:03:05.980> time<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.900> study<00:03:07.900> up<00:03:08.110> on<00:03:08.230> how<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.470> be

worth your time to study up on how to be

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.990 
worth your time to study up on how to be
a<00:03:08.650> better<00:03:08.800> communicator<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:09.640> that<00:03:09.790> when<00:03:09.910> you

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
a better communicator so that when you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.290 
a better communicator so that when you
are<00:03:10.210> in<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.480> room<00:03:10.660> like<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:10.960> you<00:03:11.440> can<00:03:11.650> kind<00:03:11.860> of

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
are in a room like that you can kind of

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.180

learn<00:03:13.300> how<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.720> turn<00:03:14.320> people's<00:03:14.740> heads<00:03:14.950> and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
learn how to turn people's heads and

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.040 
learn how to turn people's heads and
maybe<00:03:15.310> pique<00:03:15.820> their<00:03:16.000> interest<00:03:17.280> with

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
maybe pique their interest with

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.420 
maybe pique their interest with
something<00:03:20.050> worthwhile<00:03:20.260> for<00:03:20.770> them<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.100> hear

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430

skills<00:03:52.620> on<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.159> tour<00:03:53.519> like<00:03:53.879> I<00:03:54.150> started

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
skills on this tour like I started

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.390 
skills on this tour like I started
standing<00:03:55.139> up<00:03:55.260> with<00:03:55.409> my<00:03:55.560> keyboard<00:03:56.010> instead<00:03:56.159> of

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
standing up with my keyboard instead of

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.970 
standing up with my keyboard instead of
sitting<00:03:56.790> down<00:03:56.819> and<00:03:57.239> just<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.659> one<00:03:57.930> thing

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
sitting down and just that one thing

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.319 
sitting down and just that one thing
freed<00:03:58.980> me<00:03:59.129> up<00:03:59.250> so<00:03:59.579> much<00:03:59.790> to<00:04:00.030> be<00:04:00.060> more

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
freed me up so much to be more

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.119 
freed me up so much to be more
expressive<00:04:00.689> and<00:04:01.049> have<00:04:01.290> more<00:04:01.500> fun<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.859> move

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
expressive and have more fun and move

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.399 
expressive and have more fun and move
around<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.549> little<00:04:02.669> more<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.540> saw<00:04:04.379> a

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
around a little more and I saw a

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.649 
around a little more and I saw a
significant<00:04:05.280> difference<00:04:05.669> in<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:05.969> response<00:04:06.239> I

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
significant difference in the response I

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.270 
significant difference in the response I
think<00:04:07.099> I'm<00:04:08.099> really<00:04:08.870> just<00:04:09.870> trying<00:04:10.139> so<00:04:10.919> simple

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
think I'm really just trying so simple

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.280 
think I'm really just trying so simple
as<00:04:11.400> little<00:04:11.700> things<00:04:11.909> sometimes<00:04:12.329> can<00:04:12.599> change<00:04:12.930> an

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
as little things sometimes can change an

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.909 
as little things sometimes can change an
experience<00:04:13.829> and<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.370> dynamic<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.829> can<00:04:16.829> be

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
experience and a dynamic that can be

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.289 
experience and a dynamic that can be
really<00:04:17.099> helpful<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.609> live<00:04:17.820> show<00:04:18.060> so
