00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
in over the whole season and basically

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.140 
in over the whole season and basically
we're<00:01:33.920> taking<00:01:34.190> it<00:01:34.280> nice<00:01:34.370> and<00:01:34.580> slow<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.790> start

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
we're taking it nice and slow to start

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.580 
we're taking it nice and slow to start
but<00:01:35.480> we<00:01:35.570> don't<00:01:35.780> want<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:35.990> be<00:01:36.110> peaking<00:01:36.560> too

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
but we don't want to be peaking too

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.810 
but we don't want to be peaking too
early<00:01:37.010> we<00:01:37.130> want<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.340> actually<00:01:37.400> bring<00:01:37.670> them

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
early we want to actually bring them

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.610 
early we want to actually bring them
through<00:01:37.940> preseason<00:01:38.420> use<00:01:38.750> of<00:01:38.930> preseason<00:01:39.230> games

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
through preseason use of preseason games

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.590 
through preseason use of preseason games
as<00:01:39.860> as<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.280> training<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:40.850> physical<00:01:41.180> exercise

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
as as a training and physical exercise

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.630 
as as a training and physical exercise
so<00:01:41.680> everything<00:01:42.680> we<00:01:42.800> do<00:01:42.950> will<00:01:43.130> be<00:01:43.280> geared<00:01:43.490> up<00:01:43.580> to

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
so everything we do will be geared up to

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.480 
so everything we do will be geared up to
make<00:01:43.880> them<00:01:44.030> fitter<00:01:44.330> faster<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:45.020> stronger

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
make them fitter faster and stronger

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.770 
make them fitter faster and stronger
it's<00:01:46.490> fair<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.730> say<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.030> there's<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.480> long<00:01:47.630> way

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
it's fair to say that there's a long way

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.000 
it's fair to say that there's a long way
for<00:01:47.990> some<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.260> players<00:01:48.410> to<00:01:48.590> go<00:01:48.740> in<00:01:48.890> terms

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
for some of the players to go in terms

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.650 
for some of the players to go in terms
of<00:01:49.160> their<00:01:49.280> fitness<00:01:49.460> levels<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.120> you<00:01:50.180> compete

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
of their fitness levels and you compete

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.150 
of their fitness levels and you compete
professionally<00:01:50.780> they've<00:01:51.350> got<00:01:51.620> to<00:01:51.800> be<00:01:51.830> at

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
professionally they've got to be at

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.490 
professionally they've got to be at
their<00:01:52.370> absolute<00:01:52.550> maximum<00:01:53.300> and<00:01:53.480> as<00:01:54.170> the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
their absolute maximum and as the

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.250 
their absolute maximum and as the
preseason<00:01:54.890> evolved<00:01:55.580> I<00:01:55.730> need<00:01:55.940> to<00:01:56.120> see<00:01:56.360> really

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
preseason evolved I need to see really

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.800 
preseason evolved I need to see really
exceptional<00:01:57.920> levels<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.610> stamina<00:01:59.570> of

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
exceptional levels of stamina of

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.440 
exceptional levels of stamina of
endurance<00:02:00.680> of<00:02:00.950> power<00:02:01.280> base<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.000> this<00:02:02.240> group

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
endurance of power base and this group

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.060 
endurance of power base and this group
probably<00:02:02.720> more<00:02:03.050> than<00:02:03.290> a<00:02:03.380> professional<00:02:03.560> group

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
probably more than a professional group

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.680 
probably more than a professional group
need<00:02:04.490> that<00:02:04.700> support<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.180> get<00:02:05.330> there<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.630> a

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
need that support to get there and a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.330
