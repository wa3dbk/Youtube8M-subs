it's unnecessary I think if you're if
you're<00:01:20.760> building<00:01:21.270> muscle<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:22.250> aesthetics

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
this and calculators online check this

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.460 
this and calculators online check this
shit<00:01:58.020> out

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
shit out

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.410 
shit out
and<00:01:58.560> they're<00:01:59.039> fairly<00:01:59.250> accurate<00:01:59.729> right<00:02:00.390> I

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and they're fairly accurate right I

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.109 
and they're fairly accurate right I
wouldn't<00:02:00.840> had<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.259> tested<00:02:01.890> by<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.729> guy<00:02:02.910> and

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
wouldn't had this tested by this guy and

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.150 
wouldn't had this tested by this guy and
this<00:02:03.180> big<00:02:03.420> contraption<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.289> breathing<00:02:04.830> into

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
this big contraption was breathing into

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.730 
this big contraption was breathing into
it<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:05.520> measuring<00:02:06.420> my<00:02:06.570> body<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.320> give<00:02:07.470> me<00:02:07.590> this

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
it and measuring my body to give me this

basal<00:02:08.280> metabolic<00:02:08.399> rate<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.030> think

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
basal metabolic rate I don't think

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.249 
basal metabolic rate I don't think
that's<00:02:09.300> necessary<00:02:09.690> because<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> number<00:02:10.140> he

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
that's necessary because the number he

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.930 
that's necessary because the number he
gave<00:02:10.440> me<00:02:10.590> was<00:02:11.100> pretty<00:02:11.310> damn<00:02:11.459> close<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> the
