00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.410
 good morning to the world of change 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.080
 or I will present a small work 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.940
 specifically to draw the portrait 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.070
 of the new Pope Francis having 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.810
 they see me is precisely you and 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.880
 writing and I'm going to do it precisely 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.470
 in this opportunity but that I 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.030
 accompany in this little while because 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.030
 they gave hard very little 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.920
 in this first part of the drawing of 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.449
 dad francisco you have to make a deal 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.489
 as we saw in the first part with the 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.769
 2b pencil and a soft stroke to give 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.219
 shape the face now in this part and 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.239
 with the pencil 3b we are giving it shape as 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.430
 must be 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.340
 putting the pencil that is ever more 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.830
 strong to be able to achieve exactly those 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.770
 dark tones and that contrasts with 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.740
 white clear parts of the paper always 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.530
 we continue using 3b even in step 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.319
 earlier and still in this we continue 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.060
 with clear 3d pencil pressing strong 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.340
 in the parts where it is seen that it is dark 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.509
 like the mouth for example in this in this 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.250
 case using those and the pencil 4 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.979
 pressing hard so that we can 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.130
 capture exactly the dark tone that 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.789
 requires the strong stroke with the pencil 4b 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.950
 allows that precisely that we achieve the 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.090
 dark tone in both the eyes and the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.860
 mouth and that you go seeing well defined 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.530
 the contrasts between the skin with tones 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.400
 clear and those very dark parts 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.460
 We continue with the pencil 4 ve 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.009
 here you are already seeing practically 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.180
 finished all dad's portrait 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.850
 francisco first and what is left is with 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.440
 the pencil 6 sees and with a firm stroke 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.810
 strong the darkest parts of this 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.700
 portrait of the new dad francisco first 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.090
 the first Latin American dad in the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.090
 history 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.239
 in the realization of the video of the drawing 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.609
 from dad francisco first power 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.200
 actively easy plus all the short 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.370
 time we were doing the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.930
 recording 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.770
 I thank you very much and remember that 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.310
 there is always a little time to draw 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.310
 ah
