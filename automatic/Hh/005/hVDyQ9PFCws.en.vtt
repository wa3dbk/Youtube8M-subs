00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.630 
that it's completely different also I do
think<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.439> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> discipline<00:01:35.189> should<00:01:35.220> be

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
think that kind of discipline should be

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.920 
think that kind of discipline should be
different<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.180> males<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.600> females

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
different for males and females

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.440 
different for males and females
obviously<00:01:37.490> you're<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.700> gonna<00:01:38.850> beat<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> shit

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
if there is a difference a male is

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.200

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
easier than a female

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.740
