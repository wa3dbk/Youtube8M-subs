00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.650
 tells crowd had love is nothing new 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.540
 bringing you another video 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.050
 in a video of today in another video of 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.220
 thunder humor and author playing there with a 6 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:28.019
 m 5 car né that the raising store is a 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.400
 Japanese prize remembered 4 before speaking 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.380
 a little bit of the video here 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.380
 I just want to tell the guys there that 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.980
 yesterday I posted a video about the mustang 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.460
 and I ended up making a comment about 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:48.030
 another player and such ends up generating 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:50.309
 a bit of controversy, let's say the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.949
 In the video comments I just want 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.550
 Make it clear what I do not have 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.859
 nothing against players in the encore is me 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.820
 I consider myself a video player here 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.059
 example of this 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.659
 I'm not used to playing with planes. 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.260
 are fighters have right spirit # 10 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.020
 fire and I'm having to relearn the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.880
 play the style attacker in a style 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.960
 totally different than I am 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.140
 used that are obese and right and thus a 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.619
 world it can always evolve to be 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.840
 a good player right now when the guy 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.250
 fool will be stupid for the rest of life 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.229
 he will not change 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.420
 So it 's like this everybody has been in a 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.740
 No one's born knowing how to play. 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.049
 No one was born knowing the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.470
 ability to do well in all 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.770
 games at any time and not at any 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.570
 person did not know how to play so it 's just 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.369
 to make it very clear I have nothing 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.799
 against who does not know how to play the game 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.320
 right and I have yes with another face 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:03.090
 that enters a game that is totally 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.299
 reoriented winning a game of tim play and 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.670
 I just want to get the game. 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.580
 whole type go dane I'll leave the team 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.500
 there turning and what if I can get 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.820
 the marquinhos there at the end 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.650
 Beauty're so right one is that just to 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.750
 people closed the subject here and did not 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.070
 create more controversy beauty guys 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.310
 good come the docomo Diverging 10 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:34.709
 I'm not used to flying with airplanes. 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.840
 so it's like 10 and the spotify on the screen 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.540
 you will see the completely lost 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.010
 Metelo turned black, I came to that side. 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.070
 there was a goal that hurt us finding né op 63 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.600
 and I'm completely lost so are 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.260
 things that happen 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.050
 and I just tried to give one of evanil 01 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.690
 It's unfortunately not a good plane to 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:02.780
 walking and no one even because he did not 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:06.570
 energy and not 11 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.730
 does not have the potential of much 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.640
 big does not retain power and not in it 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.130
 can fly speed are high is 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.670
 there our friend being pursued by a 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.500
 spirit and fai already have some hits it 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.620
 not yet has no rhythm 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.920
 I just took it to scare the spotify away 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.110
 he from the back of my ally does not always 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.890
 trying to help those who need it 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.769
 help in the game and here I already realized that the 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.530
 enemy team most of them were 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.690
 flying very loud in them not beat 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.880
 were appearing on our radar not 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.750
 I speak I'm going down and going up to 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.209
 of the enemies there and so much guaranteed 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.850
 or two that a game that is enough 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:55.860
 thing, and unfortunately the zeros are not 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.010
 least in my opinion it has disadvantage 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.560
 against airplanes that are airplanes of butt 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.840
 common is the case of pt 63 there that people 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.840
 just saw against the fire spirit 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.860
 I do not see much difference because 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.010
 spotify also has no potential to 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.320
 energy retention and is also not a 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.209
 The plane that can pick up is the speed 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.930
 very high I have already seen that it has a 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.500
 103 is high right then I do not want to give 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.000
 chance to take but now the bug 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.130
 and I saw that he was not coming up 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.750
 I was not in the wet then 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:35.510
 I'll try to get on the pv 63 to get the 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.120
 my look on him I'll tell him 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.640
 in chat it 's the second time I notice 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.650
 this focus I will talk about the percentage 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.310
 out of 35 the guy looked like he was with 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.860
 blood in the eye to kill the new fire is 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.980
 so be warned he could do 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.890
 an evasive maneuver managed to get out, and I 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.100
 I'm there trying to target my speed. 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:01.910
 and how it does not grow is not unfortunately 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:05.090
 The problem you sacrifice speed 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.480
 nor the speed potential to have a 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:12.710
 great potential for maneuverability right 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.540
 here I got to stay at 363 and the guy who 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.400
 did not care for me it is 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.350
 wanting to kill a little of any 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.900
 way 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.720
 oh my God I 'm trying to give some 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.910
 hits on it is a problem from zero is also 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.010
 in my opinion is that it carries too much 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.640
 the municipality has to take a lot of 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.800
 be careful when you take your foot off because 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.180
 Stupid you end up with ammo and you do not 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.740
 kill nobody, right? 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.750
 here some hits was nothing is critical 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.570
 was no critical damage but already 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.290
 served to cause damage and gain a 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.120
 bit of lions ale and now that he 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.970
 decided to stay in a straight line 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.590
 how to do the job of giving a critic 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.870
 Do not worry, I'll tell you what you asked for. 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:07.490
 I 'm seeing there the focus of a new problem 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:09.320
 is not sinking dive he is the guy without 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.520
 notion of what is going on around 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.010
 it right 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.200
 and then I go up until I smoke and 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.660
 cut broke on me then 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.900
 total redon but funk and mine 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.310
 mustang mark 1 cannons and I 'm not 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.150
 in order to stay in front of four 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:28.160
 cannons is 4 hispanic hand in my face 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.330
 then I will not take because it was already 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.039
 far from me and I already had nothing in the 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.760
 The marker of ammunition was somewhat 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:39.420
 ammunition for new year 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.240
 is to sacrifice ammunition so as not to 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.070
 shot to be sure you're there and 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.820
 speech fire did you enter the 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:51.270
 aim of some hits was not critical 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:56.300
 and then he then he already saw that he was 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:07:02.370
 Lost, I had no chance of leaving. 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:03.770
 unfortunately what happens is just my 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.240
 did not fall 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.110
 the ammunition cannonballs the bladders 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.690
 Snows are not strong enough 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.340
 to cause any critical damage but 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:18.990
 Enter another fae sport in my 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:22.590
 thanksgiving and I ended up accepting 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:30.390
 there are some hits or anything very serious and 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:34.830
 It's a maneuver that runs away from me, that's it. 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:39.630
 That's it, folks. It's really silly. This is it. 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:41.610
 but it was worth it happens I'm in 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.740
 low altitude I've already seen that I'm surrounded 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.710
 of enemies last face of the team 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.840
 Then I took a critic and I'm already dead. 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:51.120
 I'll even try to earn a little 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.070
 lions are accepting street fighter 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:58.920
 there was not much more than I could 

00:07:53.070 --> 00:08:03.240
 I did it then I ended up being destroyed 

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:04.530
 by mister group 63 beauty galera 

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.260

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:09.330

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.860

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.660
