by fifteen to twenty percent and it also

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.400 
by fifteen to twenty percent and it also
has<00:04:58.920> a<00:04:59.130> special<00:04:59.910> effect<00:05:00.150> that<00:05:00.930> reduced<00:05:01.290> the

resource costs of fire skills by thirty

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.290 
resource costs of fire skills by thirty
percent<00:05:04.290> this<00:05:05.100> greatly<00:05:05.400> helps<00:05:05.760> explosive

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
percent this greatly helps explosive
