00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.080 
under it and just spry up a little bit
just<00:02:27.510> kind<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.780> move<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.319> little<00:02:28.530> bit<00:02:28.739> and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
just kind of move it a little bit and

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.650 
just kind of move it a little bit and
then<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.239> can<00:02:30.269> get<00:02:30.569> in<00:02:30.690> for<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.049> back<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:32.660> it

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
then you can get in for the back and it

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.479 
then you can get in for the back and it
just<00:02:33.840> pops<00:02:34.049> right<00:02:34.170> out<00:02:34.319> let's<00:02:35.069> make<00:02:35.220> sure<00:02:35.250> it

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
just pops right out let's make sure it

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.009 
just pops right out let's make sure it
doesn't<00:02:35.730> fly<00:02:35.940> onto<00:02:36.180> your<00:02:36.299> carpet<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.840> you

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
doesn't fly onto your carpet and you

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.240 
doesn't fly onto your carpet and you
lose<00:02:37.200> track<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:38.299> but<00:02:39.470> here's<00:02:40.470> our<00:02:40.799> slide

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
lose track of it but here's our slide

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.490 
lose track of it but here's our slide
lock<00:02:41.489> spring<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.930> part<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.380> goes

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
lock spring this is the part that goes

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.660 
lock spring this is the part that goes
into<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:44.160> frame<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:46.069> it's<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.280> part<00:02:47.519> that

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
into the frame and it's the part that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.710 
into the frame and it's the part that
actually<00:02:47.930> pushes<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.319> slide<00:02:50.040> lock<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.510> it

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
actually pushes on the slide lock and it

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.229 
actually pushes on the slide lock and it
would<00:02:51.840> be<00:02:51.989> just<00:02:52.410> like<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:53.099> inside<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239

would be just like this inside of the
frame<00:02:54.680> just<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.799> that<00:02:57.290> now<00:02:58.290> if<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:58.650> broken

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
frame just like that now if it's broken

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.500 
frame just like that now if it's broken
you're<00:02:59.489> probably<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.910> might<00:03:00.060> not<00:03:00.239> only<00:03:00.390> have

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510

they're<00:03:20.040> just<00:03:20.160> here<00:03:20.639> you<00:03:20.790> try<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.090> just<00:03:21.359> get<00:03:21.510> at

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
they're just here you try to just get at

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.590 
they're just here you try to just get at
