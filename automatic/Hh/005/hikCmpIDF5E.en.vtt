00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 the origins of the American man about 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.740
 the origin of the American man we will say 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.420
 that the settlement of america stopped 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.700
 through immigration 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.230
 that is to say the man came to our 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.050
 territory 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.640
 the regions or continents 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.190
 indeed there are some opinions 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.770
 that indicate a short date for the 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.660
 American man's arrival of makes 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.660
 about 12,000 years BC 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.610
 others indicate long listened 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.550
 for the arrival of the first 100 of 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.380
 America 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.200
 probable is that the American settlement 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.260
 started about 50 thousand years ago before 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.260
 Christ 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.630
 the main immigration that he made for 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.530
 the same duty and today narrow must do 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.180
 approximately 40,000 years 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.960
 more recent hypotheses say that this 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.790
 It happened about 50 thousand years ago 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.399
 because human remains have been found 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.760
 in san diego california with a 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.570
 approximate age of 25,000 years and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.290

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.050
 years 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.510
 the first men were located in 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.550
 North America and subsequently little 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.659
 little by little they were displaced by the 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.969
 continent to South America 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.929
 so for example we have the following

 men and animals went from Asia to 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.830
 America in several waves of migration

 agriculture, livestock and handicrafts 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.400
 other places where they have been found 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.270

 we also have items for falcon and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.680
 the evidence tried to be eminently 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.849
 physical anthropo is worth saying was sought 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.730
 exclusively the finding of remains 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.819
 humans so we could locate two groups 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.540
 genetic the only ones the head ones 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.090

 the rich are sticks but the men more 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.440
 old and the 315 sticks the most 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.440
 recent 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.489
 currently it's not just about locating 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.530
 certain sites based solely on 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.629
 the reference of the presence of man 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.969
 but it is resorted to the vestiges 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.969
 physical or the technology that the 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:46.370
 man to procedurally dominate the 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:47.750
 nature in other words it 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.230
 interrelate the evidences 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.629
 anthropological with the archeological 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.250
 man of technology and nature 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.019
 they make up a unity and struggle that they do

 Andean in a particular way 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.360
 within this characterization we locate 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.160
 several archaeological sites among the 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.850
