00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
from that event and I'm going to be

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.069 
from that event and I'm going to be
talking<00:00:35.640> specifically<00:00:36.180> about<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> Fang

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
talking specifically about the Fang

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.680 
talking specifically about the Fang
fusillade<00:00:37.800> mod<00:00:38.070> which<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.700> four<00:00:39.030> times<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
fusillade mod which is four times the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.180 
fusillade mod which is four times the
percentage<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.410> terms<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.710> slash<00:00:40.920> damage

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
percentage in terms of slash damage

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.010 
percentage in terms of slash damage
compared<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> regular<00:00:42.000> saw<00:00:42.360> tooth<00:00:42.629> clip

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
compared to the regular saw tooth clip

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.360 
compared to the regular saw tooth clip
and<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.469> most<00:00:43.590> obvious<00:00:44.070> thing<00:00:44.219> you've

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and the most obvious thing you've

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.979 
and the most obvious thing you've
probably<00:00:44.550> realized<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.329> because<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> dread

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
probably realized is because the dread

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.630 
probably realized is because the dread
is<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> really<00:00:46.350> high<00:00:46.469> slash<00:00:46.770> writing<00:00:47.100> take<00:00:47.399> full

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
is a really high slash writing take full

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.979 
is a really high slash writing take full
advantage<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.239> mod<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.600> actually

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
advantage of this mod and actually

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.660 
advantage of this mod and actually
results<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> huge<00:00:49.620> damage<00:00:50.039> increase<00:00:50.399> upon

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
results in a huge damage increase upon

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.069 
results in a huge damage increase upon
equipping<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.629> much<00:00:51.809> more<00:00:51.840> than

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
equipping it but it's much more than

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.110 
equipping it but it's much more than
that<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.379> how<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.620> somato<00:00:53.219> my<00:00:53.489> bows<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.000> I

put on a heavy caliber on either Mac so

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.590 
put on a heavy caliber on either Mac so

close or if I want to hit some of those
longer<00:00:59.460> range<00:00:59.640> shots<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.059> would<00:01:00.149> put<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.390> three

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
longer range shots I would put it three

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.450 
longer range shots I would put it three
from<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> top<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.199> help<00:01:01.379> mitigate<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.010> AXI

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.369 
from the top to help mitigate the AXI
loss<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> definitely<00:01:03.600> wasn't<00:01:03.809> perfect

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
loss but it definitely wasn't perfect

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.870 
loss but it definitely wasn't perfect
there's<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> huge<00:01:04.949> split<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.460> was<00:01:05.549> maxed

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
there's a huge split when it was maxed

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.460 
there's a huge split when it was maxed
out<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.180> three<00:01:06.630> from<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.810> top<00:01:07.049> there's<00:01:07.260> still

out and three from the top there's still

out and three from the top there's still
a<00:01:07.500> split<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:07.979> some<00:01:08.220> targets<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.670> still<00:01:08.939> hard<00:01:09.210> to

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
a split so some targets is still hard to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
it is slightly less but the main thing

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.570 
it is slightly less but the main thing
is<00:01:18.570> it'll<00:01:18.960> keep<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.560> pinpoint<00:01:20.130> actually

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
is it'll keep the pinpoint actually

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.800 
is it'll keep the pinpoint actually
while<00:01:20.759> zooming<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.509> will<00:01:21.659> obviously

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
while zooming in which will obviously

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810 
while zooming in which will obviously
make<00:01:22.110> hitting<00:01:22.710> longer<00:01:23.009> range<00:01:23.130> targets<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> lot

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
make hitting longer range targets a lot

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.789 
make hitting longer range targets a lot
easier<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> main<00:01:24.900> thing<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.200> hitting

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
easier but the main thing is hitting

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.380 
easier but the main thing is hitting
those<00:01:25.950> headshots<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.790> both<00:01:27.000> arrows

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
those headshots with both arrows

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
those headshots with both arrows
consistently<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.470> offer<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> lot<00:01:29.159> of

consistently can offer you a lot of

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.039 
consistently can offer you a lot of
damage<00:01:29.759> potential<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.630> other<00:01:30.810> really

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
percent status which is mainly going to

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:49.770

be for that slash damage product like I
already<00:02:49.870> mentioned<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.290> video<00:02:50.590> does<00:02:51.189> that<00:02:51.430> 35

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
already mentioned the video does that 35

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.759 
already mentioned the video does that 35
percent<00:02:51.909> of<00:02:52.359> your<00:02:52.480> weapon<00:02:52.930> base<00:02:53.169> damage<00:02:53.620> that

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
percent of your weapon base damage that

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.679 
percent of your weapon base damage that
goes<00:02:53.889> through<00:02:54.099> armor<00:02:54.489> and<00:02:54.669> shields<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.269> it

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
goes through armor and shields and it

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.569 
goes through armor and shields and it
ticks<00:02:55.930> seven<00:02:56.290> times<00:02:56.530> over<00:02:56.680> six<00:02:57.099> seconds<00:02:57.489> so

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
ticks seven times over six seconds so

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.189 
ticks seven times over six seconds so
that's<00:02:57.639> a<00:02:57.790> lot<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.180> bonus<00:02:58.510> damage<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:58.959> can<00:02:59.049> get

that's a lot of bonus damage you can get

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.349 
that's a lot of bonus damage you can get
just<00:02:59.409> wipe<00:02:59.650> rockin<00:03:00.099> that<00:03:00.219> slash<00:03:00.579> especially

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
just wipe rockin that slash especially

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.240 
just wipe rockin that slash especially

I mean running corrosive which is really

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.960 
I mean running corrosive which is really
good<00:03:35.379> damage<00:03:35.739> against<00:03:35.949> the<00:03:36.189> ancients<00:03:36.790> that's

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
good damage against the ancients that's

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.969 
good damage against the ancients that's
electric<00:03:37.449> plus<00:03:37.659> toxic<00:03:38.290> they're<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.829> high

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:38.979 
electric plus toxic they're the high

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.349 
electric plus toxic they're the high
priority<00:03:39.370> targets<00:03:39.699> and<00:03:39.849> it's<00:03:39.970> actually<00:03:40.269> going

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
priority targets and it's actually going

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.729 
priority targets and it's actually going
to<00:03:40.419> be<00:03:40.509> corrosive<00:03:40.750> for<00:03:41.079> the<00:03:41.169> voids<00:03:41.379> too

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
to be corrosive for the voids too

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.920 
to be corrosive for the voids too
because<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.340> toughest<00:03:42.759> tanki's<00:03:43.479> enemy<00:03:43.810> in

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
because the toughest tanki's enemy in

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.179 
because the toughest tanki's enemy in
there's<00:03:44.169> the<00:03:44.379> heavy<00:03:44.530> gunners<00:03:44.859> they're

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:45.189 
there's the heavy gunners they're

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:46.800 
there's the heavy gunners they're
usually<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.549> most<00:03:45.729> problematic<00:03:46.209> so

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
usually the most problematic so

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.059 
usually the most problematic so
corrosive<00:03:47.079> is<00:03:47.290> really<00:03:47.500> good<00:03:47.620> damage<00:03:47.859> against

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
corrosive is really good damage against

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.969 
corrosive is really good damage against
them<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.430> when<00:03:48.549> it<00:03:48.669> procs<00:03:48.939> it'll<00:03:49.569> basically

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
them and when it procs it'll basically

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.710 
them and when it procs it'll basically
degrade<00:03:50.979> their<00:03:51.129> armor<00:03:51.310> by<00:03:51.430> 25%<00:03:52.359> which<00:03:52.540> can

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
degrade their armor by 25% which can

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.420 
degrade their armor by 25% which can
stack<00:03:53.049> so<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.769> conclusion<00:03:54.129> this<00:03:54.370> is

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
stack so in conclusion this is

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.589 
stack so in conclusion this is
definitely<00:03:54.879> good<00:03:55.000> news<00:03:55.030> for<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.389> players

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
definitely good news for the players

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.089 
definitely good news for the players
that<00:03:55.780> preferred<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.229> longer<00:03:56.590> range<00:03:56.739> approach

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
that preferred the longer range approach

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.619 
that preferred the longer range approach
with<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.400> bows<00:03:57.609> and<00:03:57.639> mechanically<00:03:58.359> just

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
with the bows and mechanically just

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.300 
with the bows and mechanically just
feels<00:03:58.810> better<00:03:59.079> and<00:03:59.290> it's<00:03:59.379> a<00:03:59.439> lot<00:03:59.469> more<00:03:59.650> fun<00:04:00.069> so

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310
