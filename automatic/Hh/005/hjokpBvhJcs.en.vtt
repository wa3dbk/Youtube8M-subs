00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
this way Melissa Dixon now the all-time

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.260

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910 
pointers I think the example that our
classes<00:01:33.030> left<00:01:33.360> behind<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.320> work<00:01:34.439> hard<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
classes left behind is to work hard and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.980 
classes left behind is to work hard and
anything<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.760> you<00:01:35.970> do<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.689> never<00:01:36.840> give

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
anything that you do and to never give

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.920 
anything that you do and to never give
