you drive a front-wheel drive car and
you<00:01:32.250> tend<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.729> push<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.180> exit<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.600> corner

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
you tend to push the exit of a corner

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.780 
you tend to push the exit of a corner
it's<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.860> make<00:01:35.130> some<00:01:35.310> assumptions

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
it's going to make some assumptions

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.160 
it's going to make some assumptions
about<00:01:35.909> how<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.210> drive<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.750> front<00:01:37.049> wheel

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
about how you drive all front wheel

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.140 
about how you drive all front wheel
drive<00:01:37.200> cars<00:01:37.710> or<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.009> complex<00:01:38.549> series<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.850> turns

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
drive cars or a complex series of turns

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.420 
drive cars or a complex series of turns
you're<00:01:39.659> slow<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.560> fast<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:41.100> it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you're slow in so you can be fast out it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.530 
you're slow in so you can be fast out it
can<00:01:41.549> make<00:01:41.670> some<00:01:41.850> other<00:01:41.970> assumptions<00:01:42.450> about

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
can make some other assumptions about

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.850 
can make some other assumptions about
how<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.780> might<00:01:42.960> drive<00:01:43.170> other<00:01:43.380> tracks<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
how you might drive other tracks and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.679 
how you might drive other tracks and
that's<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> magic<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.729> drivatar<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
that's really the magic of drivatar is

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.749 
that's really the magic of drivatar is
that<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.290> ghost<00:01:46.619> or<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.920> replay<00:01:47.340> it's

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
that it's not a ghost or a replay it's

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.700 
that it's not a ghost or a replay it's
actually<00:01:47.909> human<00:01:48.420> behavior<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.229> watches<00:01:49.590> how

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
actually human behavior it watches how

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.710 
actually human behavior it watches how
you<00:01:49.799> drive<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.820> predict<00:01:51.180> how<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
you drive and it can predict how you

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.600 
you drive and it can predict how you
would<00:01:51.960> drive<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.649> car<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.220> track<00:01:53.579> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
would drive in a car on a track that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.130 
would drive in a car on a track that
you've<00:01:53.909> never<00:01:54.090> raced<00:01:54.360> before<00:01:54.479> which<00:01:55.020> is

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you've never raced before which is

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.209 
you've never raced before which is
pretty<00:01:55.259> cool<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:55.950> are<00:01:56.040> some<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
pretty cool what are some of the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.039 
pretty cool what are some of the
challenges<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.820> bringing<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.210> idea<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.869> life

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
challenges in bringing that idea to life

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.110 
challenges in bringing that idea to life
an<00:01:58.259> actual<00:01:58.560> working<00:01:58.740> order<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> Xbox<00:01:59.640> one

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
an actual working order on the Xbox one

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.790 
an actual working order on the Xbox one
well<00:02:01.660> there's<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:01.960> many<00:02:02.080> challenges<00:02:02.380> when

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
well there's so many challenges when

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.900 
well there's so many challenges when
you're<00:02:02.920> when<00:02:03.160> you're<00:02:03.220> trying<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.520> develop<00:02:03.730> a

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
you're when you're trying to develop a

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.330 
you're when you're trying to develop a
game<00:02:04.180> at<00:02:04.480> the<00:02:04.660> same<00:02:04.870> time<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.380> console<00:02:05.800> think

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
game at the same time of a console think

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.100 
game at the same time of a console think
of<00:02:06.430> it<00:02:06.520> like<00:02:06.700> building<00:02:07.510> your<00:02:07.630> house<00:02:07.810> on

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
of it like building your house on

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.560 
of it like building your house on
quicksand<00:02:08.410> if<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.490> sand<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:09.880> changing<00:02:10.330> out

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
quicksand if the sand is changing out

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.240 
quicksand if the sand is changing out
from<00:02:10.810> underneath<00:02:11.050> of<00:02:11.320> you<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.740> takes<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.070> lot

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
from underneath of you so it takes a lot

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.920 
from underneath of you so it takes a lot
of<00:02:12.280> collaboration<00:02:13.120> with<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.330> platform<00:02:13.780> team

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
of collaboration with the platform team

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.750 
of collaboration with the platform team
to<00:02:14.080> really<00:02:14.290> understand<00:02:14.770> where<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.310> platform

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
to really understand where the platform

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.340 
to really understand where the platform
is<00:02:15.910> where<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.210> game<00:02:16.240> is<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.840> as<00:02:16.900> we<00:02:17.020> bring<00:02:17.260> all

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
is where the game is and as we bring all

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.020 
is where the game is and as we bring all
these<00:02:17.530> new<00:02:17.710> technologies<00:02:18.070> together<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.940> it's

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
these new technologies together and it's

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.730 
these new technologies together and it's
really<00:02:19.330> just<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.780> beginning<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.560> as<00:02:20.650> we

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
really just the beginning of it as we

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.720 
really just the beginning of it as we
start<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:20.980> think<00:02:21.160> about<00:02:21.370> what<00:02:21.520> cloud

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
start to think about what cloud

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.460 
start to think about what cloud
computing<00:02:22.240> can<00:02:22.360> mean<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.050> power<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.410> the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
computing can mean and the power of the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.320 
computing can mean and the power of the
box<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:24.280> saw<00:02:24.460> how<00:02:24.640> we<00:02:24.700> were<00:02:24.880> able<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.180> evolve

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
box you saw how we were able to evolve

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.720 
box you saw how we were able to evolve
for<00:02:25.660> it's<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.930> over<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.470> lifespan<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.070> 360

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
for it's a over the lifespan of the 360

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.430 
for it's a over the lifespan of the 360
we're<00:02:28.420> really<00:02:28.630> just<00:02:28.720> getting<00:02:29.020> familiar<00:02:29.410> with

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
we're really just getting familiar with

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.780 
we're really just getting familiar with
the<00:02:29.590> hardware<00:02:29.800> now<00:02:30.100> but<00:02:30.340> we're<00:02:30.460> super<00:02:30.760> excited

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790
