complicated<00:00:26.960> it's<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.079> a<00:00:28.320> matter<00:00:28.559> of

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
complicated it's just a matter of

now<00:00:55.929> doing<00:00:56.170> audio<00:00:56.530> scrubbing<00:00:56.949> is<00:00:57.250> one<00:00:57.430> of

now doing audio scrubbing is one of

now doing audio scrubbing is one of
those<00:00:57.670> things<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.239> can<00:00:58.809> show<00:00:59.019> you<00:00:59.079> and<00:00:59.379> go

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
those things I can show you and go

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.649 
those things I can show you and go
through<00:00:59.769> it<00:00:59.800> with<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.280> now<00:01:00.489> but<00:01:01.149> it<00:01:01.239> is<00:01:01.390> one<00:01:01.539> of

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
through it with you now but it is one of

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:02.759 
through it with you now but it is one of
those<00:01:01.750> things<00:01:02.019> that<00:01:02.109> you<00:01:02.260> just<00:01:02.469> have<00:01:02.649> to

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
those things that you just have to

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.619 
those things that you just have to
practice<00:01:02.979> on<00:01:03.430> practice<00:01:03.940> so<00:01:04.119> it<00:01:04.180> visually

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
practice on practice so it visually

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.620 
practice on practice so it visually
looks<00:01:04.930> right<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.470> it<00:01:05.979> sounds<00:01:06.369> right<00:01:06.630> there's

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
looks right and it sounds right there's

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.570 
looks right and it sounds right there's
no<00:01:07.869> easy<00:01:08.080> way<00:01:08.290> around<00:01:08.439> this<00:01:08.830> one<00:01:08.979> apart<00:01:09.310> from<00:01:09.460> a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
no easy way around this one apart from a

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.100 
no easy way around this one apart from a
hard<00:01:09.789> work<00:01:10.030> obviously<00:01:10.330> that's<00:01:10.720> why<00:01:10.869> people

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
hard work obviously that's why people

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.080 
hard work obviously that's why people
that<00:01:11.380> have<00:01:11.470> got<00:01:11.590> lots<00:01:11.770> of<00:01:11.890> money<00:01:12.100> can<00:01:12.850> pay<00:01:12.880> for

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
that have got lots of money can pay for

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.789 
that have got lots of money can pay for
a<00:01:13.240> system<00:01:13.539> that<00:01:13.570> locks<00:01:13.869> everything<00:01:14.500> together

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
a system that locks everything together

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.340 
a system that locks everything together
in<00:01:15.220> one<00:01:15.340> go<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.119> it<00:01:16.420> makes<00:01:16.630> life<00:01:16.899> a<00:01:16.990> lot<00:01:17.110> easier

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
in one go and it makes life a lot easier

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.850 
in one go and it makes life a lot easier
but<00:01:18.340> for<00:01:18.759> us<00:01:19.360> we've<00:01:20.020> got<00:01:20.289> to<00:01:20.380> do<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.649> hard

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
but for us we've got to do it the hard

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.639 
but for us we've got to do it the hard
way<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:22.420> it's<00:01:22.570> very<00:01:22.810> very<00:01:23.080> effective<00:01:23.500> and

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
way and but it's very very effective and

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.499 
way and but it's very very effective and
it<00:01:23.799> works<00:01:24.009> and<00:01:24.340> nobody<00:01:25.090> out<00:01:25.119> there<00:01:25.390> will

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
it works and nobody out there will

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.690 
it works and nobody out there will
really<00:01:25.780> know<00:01:25.929> now<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:26.979> first<00:01:27.250> thing<00:01:27.399> you<00:01:27.520> do

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
really know now the first thing you do

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.190 
really know now the first thing you do
is<00:01:27.940> go<00:01:28.149> into<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.420> timeline

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
is go into the timeline

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.870 
is go into the timeline
and<00:01:29.289> this<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.130> first<00:01:30.340> bit<00:01:30.610> you're<00:01:30.729> going

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
and this is the first bit you're going

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.809 
and this is the first bit you're going
to<00:01:30.940> start<00:01:31.179> scrubbing<00:01:31.590> now<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:33.310> audio<00:01:33.580> track

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
to start scrubbing now the audio track

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.219 
to start scrubbing now the audio track
as<00:01:33.970> I<00:01:34.060> said<00:01:34.210> we've<00:01:34.360> already<00:01:34.509> put<00:01:34.869> in<00:01:34.960> there<00:01:35.200> so

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
as I said we've already put in there so

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.770 
as I said we've already put in there so
we've<00:01:35.470> got<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.619> master<00:01:36.009> audio<00:01:36.159> track<00:01:36.610> now<00:01:37.479> it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
we've got a master audio track now it

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.660 
we've got a master audio track now it
sounds<00:01:38.049> odd<00:01:38.500> but<00:01:38.710> there<00:01:38.979> are<00:01:39.220> reference

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
sounds odd but there are reference

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:50.419 
sounds odd but there are reference
points<00:01:40.090> are<00:01:40.299> for<00:01:40.479> many<00:01:40.720> times<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.259> will<00:01:41.380> hear

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.010 

they<00:01:51.429> can<00:01:51.610> hear<00:01:51.819> that<00:01:51.970> pitch<00:01:52.209> going<00:01:52.600> up<00:01:52.750> that's

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
they can hear that pitch going up that's

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.809 
they can hear that pitch going up that's
what<00:01:53.170> we're<00:01:53.319> looking<00:01:53.590> for<00:01:59.340> obviously<00:02:00.340> this<00:02:00.640> is

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
what we're looking for obviously this is

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.490 
what we're looking for obviously this is
the<00:02:00.849> clip<00:02:01.090> that<00:02:01.239> we're<00:02:01.390> looking<00:02:01.479> for<00:02:04.500> mark

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
the clip that we're looking for mark

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.180 
the clip that we're looking for mark
you're<00:02:05.679> in<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:05.979> out<00:02:06.069> points<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.890> now<00:02:08.890> drop

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
you're in and out points and now drop

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.119 
you're in and out points and now drop
that<00:02:09.220> into<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.610> timeline<00:02:10.560> now<00:02:11.560> play<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:12.010> to

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
that into the timeline now play it to

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.130 
that into the timeline now play it to
see<00:02:12.280> if<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.489> works<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.970> if<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.209> doesn't<00:02:13.540> just

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
see if it works and if it doesn't just

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:25.310 
see if it works and if it doesn't just
delete<00:02:14.500> it

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.330 

obviously<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:26.410> could<00:02:26.560> see<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.860> audio<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.250> a

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
obviously you could see the audio is a

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.200 
obviously you could see the audio is a
bit<00:02:27.490> faster<00:02:27.690> than<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:29.620> actual<00:02:29.890> video<00:02:30.220> so<00:02:30.820> just

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
bit faster than the actual video so just

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.050 
bit faster than the actual video so just
to<00:02:31.360> go<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.570> edit<00:02:32.050> undo<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.770> then<00:02:33.430> do<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.880> whole

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
to go to edit undo and then do the whole

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.930 
to go to edit undo and then do the whole
procedure<00:02:34.360> again<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:36.250> know<00:02:36.370> double-check

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
procedure again you know double-check

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.770 
procedure again you know double-check
right<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.540> on<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.840> timeline<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:40.570> then

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
right it is on the timeline and then

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.810 
right it is on the timeline and then
just<00:02:41.080> nudge<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.470> back<00:02:41.850> in<00:02:42.850> your<00:02:43.240> bin<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.640> there
