while<00:00:26.610> I<00:00:26.640> was<00:00:26.760> at<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.090> good<00:00:27.960> thing<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.230> did<00:00:28.610> you

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
while I was at it good thing I did you

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.479 
while I was at it good thing I did you
hear<00:00:29.790> it

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489

rattle<00:00:32.489> rattle<00:00:32.989> every<00:00:33.989> time<00:00:34.199> you<00:00:34.320> let<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:34.589 
rattle rattle every time you let the

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:37.270 
rattle rattle every time you let the
clutch<00:00:34.829> out<00:00:35.390> tension<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.539> on<00:00:36.570> these<00:00:36.839> Springs

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
clutch out tension is on these Springs

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.060 
clutch out tension is on these Springs
and<00:00:38.329> they<00:00:39.329> kind<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.320> start<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.559> collapse<00:00:40.859> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and they kind of start to collapse a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.040 
and they kind of start to collapse a
little<00:00:41.309> bit<00:00:41.460> they<00:00:41.699> get<00:00:41.909> weak<00:00:42.179> over<00:00:42.420> time<00:00:42.780> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
little bit they get weak over time and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.739 
little bit they get weak over time and
then<00:00:43.230> they<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.620> play<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.449> did<00:00:45.449> some<00:00:45.600> research

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:45.749 
then they have play I did some research

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:48.110 
then they have play I did some research
on<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> forums<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.949> looks<00:00:47.159> like<00:00:47.399> even<00:00:47.909> if<00:00:48.030> I

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
on the forums it looks like even if I

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.639 
on the forums it looks like even if I
were<00:00:48.269> to<00:00:48.300> purchase<00:00:48.569> a<00:00:48.870> new<00:00:49.079> one<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.319> these

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.840 

depending<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.739> your<00:00:52.859> riding<00:00:53.100> five<00:00:53.550> ten

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
depending on your riding five ten

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.849 
depending on your riding five ten
thousand<00:00:54.269> miles<00:00:54.449> it'll<00:00:55.350> get<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.769> point

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
thousand miles it'll get to the point

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.270 
thousand miles it'll get to the point
where<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.219> making<00:00:56.579> noise<00:00:56.760> again<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> this

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
where it's making noise again so this

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.609 
where it's making noise again so this
this<00:00:59.609> allows<00:01:00.800> your<00:01:01.800> clutch<00:01:02.159> to<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> softer

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
this allows your clutch to have a softer

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.550 
this allows your clutch to have a softer
engagement<00:01:05.329> I'm<00:01:06.329> not<00:01:06.540> too<00:01:06.719> concerned<00:01:07.320> with

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
engagement I'm not too concerned with

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.770 
engagement I'm not too concerned with
that<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.979> I'm<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.759> is<00:01:12.060> actually

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that so what I'm going to do is actually

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.300 
that so what I'm going to do is actually
weld<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:14.759> spring<00:01:15.149> in<00:01:15.329> place<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:16.110> both<00:01:16.920> sides

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
weld the spring in place on both sides

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.999 
weld the spring in place on both sides
here<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.939> lot<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.930> people<00:01:19.170> might<00:01:19.350> frown<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
here a lot of people might frown on that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.370 
here a lot of people might frown on that
however<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.329> good<00:01:21.570> weld<00:01:21.899> on<00:01:22.110> there

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
however if you get a good weld on there

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.840 
however if you get a good weld on there
you<00:01:22.530> won't<00:01:22.649> have<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.070> worry<00:01:23.310> about<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you won't have to worry about it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.490 
you won't have to worry about it
breaking<00:01:24.509> apart<00:01:24.630> or<00:01:25.259> anything<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
breaking apart or anything like that

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.010 
breaking apart or anything like that
I've<00:01:28.500> seen<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.039> few<00:01:29.640> people<00:01:29.670> also<00:01:30.060> shim<00:01:30.689> these

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
I've seen a few people also shim these

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.580 
I've seen a few people also shim these
Springs<00:01:31.969> but<00:01:32.969> I<00:01:33.030> don't<00:01:33.270> want<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> worry<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.990> have

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
Springs but I don't want to worry I have

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130 
Springs but I don't want to worry I have
to<00:01:34.740> worry<00:01:34.920> about<00:01:35.039> a<00:01:35.159> piece<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.789> shim<00:01:36.570> popping

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
to worry about a piece of shim popping

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.770 
to worry about a piece of shim popping
out<00:01:37.520> inside<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.579> my<00:01:38.789> crank<00:01:39.119> case<00:01:39.329> or<00:01:39.630> anything

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
out inside of my crank case or anything

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.170 
out inside of my crank case or anything
like<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.250> I'm<00:01:41.490> gonna<00:01:41.640> weld<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
like that so I think I'm gonna weld it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.800 
like that so I think I'm gonna weld it
up<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:43.579> it'll<00:01:44.579> probably<00:01:44.850> give<00:01:45.270> my<00:01:45.479> clutch<00:01:45.780> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
up and it'll probably give my clutch a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.010 
up and it'll probably give my clutch a
little<00:01:45.960> bit<00:01:46.259> firmer<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.119> of<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.299> feel<00:01:48.570> or<00:01:48.600> of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
little bit firmer of a of a feel or of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.069 
little bit firmer of a of a feel or of
an<00:01:49.170> engagement<00:01:49.679> but<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.909> should<00:01:51.689> get<00:01:51.840> rid<00:01:51.899> of

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
an engagement but that should get rid of

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.969 
an engagement but that should get rid of
all<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> noise<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.840> annoying<00:01:55.200> noise<00:01:55.590> at

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
all of that noise that annoying noise at

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.999 
all of that noise that annoying noise at
idle<00:01:57.020> don't<00:01:58.020> want<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> hear<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.499> while<00:01:58.829> my

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
idle don't want to hear that while my

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.940 
idle don't want to hear that while my
bikes<00:01:59.249> sitting<00:01:59.640> there<00:01:59.789> idling<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:01.499> kind<00:02:01.890> of

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
bikes sitting there idling so it kind of

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.370 
bikes sitting there idling so it kind of
makes<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.219> feel<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.640> your<00:02:02.899> your<00:02:03.899> bikes<00:02:04.170> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
makes you feel like your your bikes a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.070 
makes you feel like your your bikes a
piece<00:02:04.649> of
