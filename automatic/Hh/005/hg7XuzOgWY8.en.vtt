00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
and you can see this is why I highlight

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.280 
and you can see this is why I highlight
at<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.519> square<00:03:58.999> it<00:03:59.510> would<00:03:59.840> have<00:03:59.989> prevented

at the square it would have prevented

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.150 
at the square it would have prevented
this<00:04:02.079> so

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
this so

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.660 
this so
as<00:04:04.880> a<00:04:05.290> game<00:04:06.290> goes<00:04:06.620> on<00:04:06.980> to<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.400> next<00:04:07.640> move

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
as a game goes on to the next move

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.010 
as a game goes on to the next move
another<00:04:10.670> bad<00:04:11.030> move<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:11.930> this<00:04:12.770> one<00:04:13.070> I<00:04:13.100> put<00:04:13.520> in

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
another bad move and this one I put in

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.390 
another bad move and this one I put in
dark<00:04:15.020> red<00:04:15.410> because<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:15.980> is<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.880> major<00:04:17.180> blunder

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
dark red because that is a major blunder

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.260 
dark red because that is a major blunder
I<00:04:19.400> don't<00:04:20.269> know<00:04:20.420> why<00:04:20.750> he<00:04:21.080> captured<00:04:21.620> that<00:04:21.830> pawn

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
I don't know why he captured that pawn

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.360 
I don't know why he captured that pawn
now<00:04:23.270> this<00:04:23.660> just<00:04:23.990> creates<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:24.530> lot<00:04:24.770> of<00:04:24.800> problems

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
now this just creates a lot of problems

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.450 
now this just creates a lot of problems
for<00:04:25.430> black<00:04:26.230> you<00:04:27.230> should<00:04:27.410> have<00:04:27.530> just<00:04:27.650> left<00:04:27.980> the
