 red beard that regenerates this is the 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.040
 engine for heating or not so 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.890

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.500
 good by cons how you want a little 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.120
 because we do not see too much coming into me 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.010

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.860

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:48.260
 who had already started one pretty fact 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:51.650
 rare to break the trains so there we are 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.200
 by train with like tool sees us 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.110
 not but it was a little 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.350
 like persona to the right you see when 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.630
 you know an agent you can have a 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.440
 radar that show all the dead we 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.660
 let's win them 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.400
 yeah so what would I know when I 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.500
 taken back the dear you will have all the modes 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.860
 already so there is no address 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.710
 ip 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.420
 there is general hunter he settles but 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.760
 very aggressive I will lead an address on 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.830
 the moment of destruction for versions 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.410
 cracked a flight to this country you 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.260
 result launch it to make it very suspicious 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.910
 and launched minecraft and it's good as 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.820
 that it downloads the rice packets that 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.040
 connect you here and enzo succeeded this 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:34.800
 radar top left 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.800
 that's all you need 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:45.100
 oulala so the two tooth which at 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.870
 less than 30 seconds we arrive it's 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.830
 further behind in the process anyway 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.630
 stone but less dense 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:56.190
 ok you put a lot more time to 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.190
 about 15 minutes knowing that at the water 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.620
 and do not worry the driver if he 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.310
 there is a problem or if that big they will have to 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.310
 repay at the end
