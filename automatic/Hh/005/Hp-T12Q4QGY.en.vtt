other than just my heritage and it was

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.250 
other than just my heritage and it was
instantaneous<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.700> know<00:01:24.790> that<00:01:25.150> dr.<00:01:25.360> pn<00:01:25.930> had

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
instantaneous I know that dr. pn had

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.870 
instantaneous I know that dr. pn had
told<00:01:26.560> me<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:26.920> i<00:01:26.950> would<00:01:27.220> probably<00:01:27.400> get<00:01:27.850> a

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
told me that i would probably get a

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.760 
told me that i would probably get a
result<00:01:28.270> in<00:01:28.450> two<00:01:28.720> or<00:01:28.810> three<00:01:29.050> days<00:01:29.200> but<00:01:29.590> i

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
result in two or three days but i

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.460 
result in two or three days but i
actually<00:01:30.070> saw<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:30.610> result<00:01:31.090> as<00:01:31.270> i<00:01:31.720> left<00:01:32.110> the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
actually saw the result as i left the

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.220 
actually saw the result as i left the
office<00:01:32.760> so<00:01:33.760> that<00:01:33.910> was<00:01:34.060> very<00:01:34.090> effective<00:01:34.870> for<00:01:35.080> me

what<00:01:36.220> is<00:01:36.340> actually<00:01:36.790> going<00:01:36.970> on<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.660> that<00:01:38.260> the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
what is actually going on is that the

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.100 
what is actually going on is that the

hemoglobin inside your blood is what's

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.110 
hemoglobin inside your blood is what's
