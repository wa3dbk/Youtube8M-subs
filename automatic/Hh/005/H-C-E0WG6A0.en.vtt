00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
okay so the first thing we're going to

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.959 
okay so the first thing we're going to
tie<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.499> a<00:00:07.559> variation<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.460> slim<00:00:08.670> Beauty

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:08.969 
tie is a variation to the slim Beauty

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.759 
tie is a variation to the slim Beauty
now<00:00:09.660> we're<00:00:09.750> going<00:00:09.839> to<00:00:09.900> use<00:00:09.990> rope<00:00:10.230> today<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:10.559> you

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
now we're going to use rope today so you

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.230 
now we're going to use rope today so you
can<00:00:10.889> see<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.219> bit<00:00:11.250> easier<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.790> camera

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
can see it a bit easier on the camera

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.990 
can see it a bit easier on the camera
but<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.349> as<00:00:13.469> simple<00:00:13.709> as<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.790> black

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
but this is as simple as it is the black

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.050 
but this is as simple as it is the black
line<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.360> going<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.540> be<00:00:15.599> our<00:00:15.749> main<00:00:15.959> line<00:00:16.170> and

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
line is going to be our main line and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.359 
line is going to be our main line and
the<00:00:18.060> white<00:00:18.300> one<00:00:18.480> will<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.840> our<00:00:18.990> leader<00:00:19.230> line<00:00:19.470> so

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the white one will be our leader line so

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.250 
the white one will be our leader line so
all<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.670> do<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.180> grab<00:00:21.449> our<00:00:21.570> leader<00:00:21.810> first<00:00:22.080> or

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
all we do is grab our leader first or

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.509 
all we do is grab our leader first or
whichever<00:00:22.560> line<00:00:22.769> sticker<00:00:23.130> which<00:00:23.400> will

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
whichever line sticker which will

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.390 
whichever line sticker which will
normally<00:00:23.640> be<00:00:23.939> our<00:00:24.060> leader<00:00:24.410> all<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.010> make

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
normally be our leader all we do is make

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.499 
normally be our leader all we do is make
an<00:00:26.550> overhand<00:00:26.939> knot<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:28.429> pull<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:29.670> until<00:00:30.240> it

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
an overhand knot and pull it up until it

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.290 
an overhand knot and pull it up until it
forms<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.109> figure<00:00:31.589> of<00:00:31.710> eight<00:00:31.969> and<00:00:32.969> all<00:00:33.120> we're

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
forms a figure of eight and all we're

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.860 
forms a figure of eight and all we're
doing<00:00:33.629> with<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.500> braided<00:00:35.250> end<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.870> following

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
doing with the braided end is following

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.500 
doing with the braided end is following
this<00:00:37.110> tag<00:00:37.410> back<00:00:38.040> through<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.610> then<00:00:39.120> out<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
this tag back through and then out the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.950 
this tag back through and then out the
other<00:00:39.629> side<00:00:44.239> give<00:00:45.239> yourself<00:00:45.539> plenty<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.840> room

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
other side give yourself plenty of room

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.200 
other side give yourself plenty of room
to<00:00:46.199> work<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.829> then<00:00:47.460> nip<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.879> figure<00:00:48.180> of

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
to work with and then nip that figure of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.090 
to work with and then nip that figure of
eight<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:48.570> tight<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.620> doesn't<00:00:49.829> slide

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
eight up tight so that it doesn't slide

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430 
eight up tight so that it doesn't slide
and<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.789> lot<00:00:50.940> easier<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.329> work<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and it's a lot easier to work with and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
and it's a lot easier to work with and
all<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.699> union<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.449> it's

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
all we have to do is a union on so it's

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.950 
all we have to do is a union on so it's
just<00:00:54.809> making<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.980> loop<00:00:56.660> pinching<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.809> your

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
just making a loop pinching it in your

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.290 
just making a loop pinching it in your
fingers<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.440> doesn't<00:00:58.710> move<00:00:58.800> anywhere

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
fingers so it doesn't move anywhere

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.060 
fingers so it doesn't move anywhere
wrapping<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.390> tag<00:01:00.660> across<00:01:01.620> both<00:01:01.829> those

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
wrapping your tag across both those

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.760 
wrapping your tag across both those
lines<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> bottom<00:01:02.879> side<00:01:03.290> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.410> do<00:01:04.590> that

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
lines on the bottom side you can do that

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.760 
lines on the bottom side you can do that
for<00:01:05.070> six<00:01:05.940> times<00:01:06.270> whatever<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.080> we're

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
for six times whatever you can do we're

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.490 
for six times whatever you can do we're
going<00:01:07.980> to<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.190> three<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.730> the<00:01:08.850> rope

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
going to get three there with the rope

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.070 
going to get three there with the rope
pull<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.620> up<00:01:11.480> I'm<00:01:12.480> going<00:01:12.690> to<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> help

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
pull that up I'm going to have to help

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.290 
pull that up I'm going to have to help
it<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.260> bit<00:01:13.380> because<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.680> rope<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:15.000> all<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.180> do

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
it a bit because it's rope and all we do

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.500 
it a bit because it's rope and all we do
is<00:01:15.650> slide<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.730> we<00:01:17.820> slide<00:01:18.090> nice<00:01:18.300> and

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
is slide up so that we slide nice and

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.130 
is slide up so that we slide nice and
easily<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.930> don't<00:01:19.170> burn<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.620> knot<00:01:20.930> as<00:01:21.930> as

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
easily and we don't burn the knot as as

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.330 
easily and we don't burn the knot as as
simple<00:01:22.260> as<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.680> now<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.980> can<00:01:23.160> pull<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
simple as that now you can pull that

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.860 
simple as that now you can pull that
knot<00:01:23.640> as<00:01:23.790> tight<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.210> want<00:01:24.480> all<00:01:24.660> that's

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
knot as tight as you want all that's

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.990 
knot as tight as you want all that's
going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.050> happen<00:01:25.260> is<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.250> Union<00:01:26.730> it's<00:01:26.880> just

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
going to happen is that Union it's just

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.220 
going to happen is that Union it's just
going<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:27.210> bite<00:01:27.390> harder<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.900> harder<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
going to bite harder and harder and

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.500 
going to bite harder and harder and
harder<00:01:28.320> into<00:01:29.160> that<00:01:29.340> figure<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.150> eight<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.390> we

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
harder into that figure of eight that we

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.440 
harder into that figure of eight that we
form<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.870> start<00:01:31.050> with<00:01:32.150> best<00:01:33.150> thing<00:01:33.300> about

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
form to start with best thing about

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.420 
form to start with best thing about
these<00:01:33.630> knots<00:01:33.900> when<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.620> cut<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:34.920> tag<00:01:35.130> ends

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
these knots when you cut the tag ends

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.819 
these knots when you cut the tag ends
off

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.160 

it's<00:01:40.829> very<00:01:41.130> flat<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.240> casting<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.810> will<00:01:43.079> be

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
it's very flat so casting that will be

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.160 
it's very flat so casting that will be
an<00:01:43.259> absolute<00:01:43.680> breeze<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> second<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
an absolute breeze so the second that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.389 
an absolute breeze so the second that
we're<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.590> through<00:01:46.829> today<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
we're going to go through today is the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.429 
we're going to go through today is the
Albright<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:48.479> quite<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> very<00:01:48.899> simple<00:01:49.290> knot

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
Albright it's quite a very simple knot

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.510 
Albright it's quite a very simple knot
to<00:01:49.590> tie<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.580> it<00:01:50.729> right<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.840> key

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
to tie but to get it right is the key

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.139 
to tie but to get it right is the key
take<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.700> leader<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:56.159> give<00:01:56.549> yourself<00:01:56.909> a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
take your leader and give yourself a

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.169 
take your leader and give yourself a
fair<00:01:57.899> fairly<00:01:58.590> big<00:01:58.770> double<00:01:59.130> piece<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.460> line<00:01:59.640> so

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
fair fairly big double piece of line so

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.279 
fair fairly big double piece of line so
we're<00:02:00.270> not<00:02:00.360> tying<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.780> off<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.020> nothing

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
we're not tying that off and nothing

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.669 
we're not tying that off and nothing
we're<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.530> leaving<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.830> as<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.220> for<00:02:02.429> now

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
we're just leaving that as is for now

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.429 
we're just leaving that as is for now
grab<00:02:04.679> your<00:02:04.799> braided<00:02:05.280> end<00:02:05.429> pass<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.750> through

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
grab your braided end pass it up through

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.830 
grab your braided end pass it up through
that<00:02:07.470> loop<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.239> again<00:02:09.239> give<00:02:09.450> yourself<00:02:09.720> plenty

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
that loop and again give yourself plenty

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.210 
that loop and again give yourself plenty
of<00:02:09.989> tag<00:02:10.519> drag<00:02:11.519> it<00:02:11.670> across<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.950> you've<00:02:14.069> got

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
of tag drag it across so you've got

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.890 
of tag drag it across so you've got
essentially<00:02:15.030> three<00:02:15.269> pieces<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.750> line

essentially three pieces of the line

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.770 
essentially three pieces of the line
that<00:02:16.080> run<00:02:16.290> parallel<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.190> each<00:02:17.430> other<00:02:17.780> with

that run parallel to each other with
your<00:02:18.989> tag<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.940> want<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.180> run<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:22.470> back

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
your tag you want to run that back

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.640 
your tag you want to run that back
around<00:02:23.130> all<00:02:23.370> three<00:02:23.610> pieces<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.090> line<00:02:24.590> now<00:02:25.590> you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
around all three pieces of line now you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.390 
around all three pieces of line now you
can<00:02:25.830> do<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.190> as<00:02:26.459> many<00:02:26.730> times<00:02:27.239> as<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.569> like<00:02:28.400> 6

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
can do this as many times as you like 6

way that it's going through the loop so

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.890 
way that it's going through the loop so
we<00:02:38.940> pass<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.360> through<00:02:41.390> hold<00:02:42.390> onto<00:02:42.569> the

doubled piece of line and pull that
tight

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.270

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
tag that hangs out anyway just so it's

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.410

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
nice and tight and again you can cut the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.200 
nice and tight and again you can cut the
tag<00:03:04.660> ends<00:03:04.870> off<00:03:05.080> nice<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.680> close

not<00:03:07.210> number<00:03:07.390> three<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:08.230> just<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.650> simple<00:03:08.950> back

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
not number three is just the simple back

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
to back uni knot this is probably one of

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.930 
to back uni knot this is probably one of
the<00:03:11.170> easiest<00:03:11.560> knots<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:11.980> tie<00:03:12.010> especially<00:03:12.850> if

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
the easiest knots to tie especially if

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.790 
the easiest knots to tie especially if
it's<00:03:13.090> dark<00:03:13.420> because<00:03:14.080> you<00:03:14.170> can<00:03:14.290> actually<00:03:14.410> feel

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
it's dark because you can actually feel

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.950 
it's dark because you can actually feel
the<00:03:14.980> knot<00:03:15.130> rather<00:03:15.340> than<00:03:15.610> look<00:03:15.820> at<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.810> all

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
the knot rather than look at it so all

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.160 
the knot rather than look at it so all
we<00:03:17.080> need<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.260> do<00:03:17.530> is<00:03:17.770> grab<00:03:18.040> both<00:03:18.340> our<00:03:18.550> tag<00:03:18.790> ends

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
we need to do is grab both our tag ends

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.990 
we need to do is grab both our tag ends
pass<00:03:20.170> them<00:03:20.350> across<00:03:20.500> each<00:03:20.740> other<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.820> give

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
pass them across each other and give

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.220 
pass them across each other and give
ourselves<00:03:22.120> plenty<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:22.720> room<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:22.900> work<00:03:23.050> with

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
ourselves plenty of room to work with

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.890 
ourselves plenty of room to work with
each<00:03:23.560> tag<00:03:23.890> end<00:03:24.210> all<00:03:25.210> you<00:03:25.330> need<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.540> do<00:03:25.660> is<00:03:25.750> hold

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
each tag end all you need to do is hold

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.640 
each tag end all you need to do is hold
them<00:03:26.050> in<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.200> middle<00:03:26.820> make<00:03:27.820> our<00:03:28.030> loop<00:03:28.650> and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
them in the middle make our loop and

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.590 
them in the middle make our loop and
then<00:03:29.770> it's<00:03:29.860> just<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:30.070> matter<00:03:30.100> of<00:03:30.550> passing<00:03:31.540> the

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
then it's just a matter of passing the

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.940 
then it's just a matter of passing the
tag<00:03:31.840> across<00:03:32.740> those<00:03:32.950> bottom<00:03:33.370> lines<00:03:34.680> three<00:03:35.680> four

tag across those bottom lines three four
five<00:03:36.280> six<00:03:36.550> times<00:03:36.820> depending<00:03:37.420> on<00:03:37.510> how<00:03:37.660> thick

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
five six times depending on how thick

five six times depending on how thick
your<00:03:38.020> line<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.760> slide<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.880> up<00:03:41.190> like<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:42.490> and

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
your line is slide it up like so and

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.150 
your line is slide it up like so and
then<00:03:43.510> just<00:03:43.540> repeat<00:03:43.810> exactly<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.680> same<00:03:44.770> thing

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
then just repeat exactly the same thing

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.180 
then just repeat exactly the same thing
on<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.430> opposite<00:03:45.790> side<00:03:47.400> we<00:03:48.400> make<00:03:48.610> our<00:03:48.790> loop

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
on the opposite side we make our loop

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.980 
on the opposite side we make our loop
three<00:03:51.190> four<00:03:51.520> five<00:03:51.880> six<00:03:52.210> times<00:03:52.510> whatever<00:03:52.720> we

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
three four five six times whatever we

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.820 
three four five six times whatever we
can<00:03:53.140> do<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:56.500> pull<00:03:56.980> that<00:03:57.070> up<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.780> again<00:03:58.830> wet

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
can do and pull that up and again wet

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.050 
can do and pull that up and again wet
they're<00:03:59.980> not<00:04:00.070> always<00:04:00.250> wet<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.880> knot

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
they're not always wet the knot

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.460 
they're not always wet the knot
otherwise<00:04:01.780> you're<00:04:01.990> going<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.140> get<00:04:02.260> friction

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
otherwise you're going to get friction

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.830 
otherwise you're going to get friction
on<00:04:02.680> your<00:04:02.800> line<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.160> burns<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.580> line<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:03.940> weakens

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
on your line it burns a line and weakens

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.190 
on your line it burns a line and weakens
it<00:04:05.040> slide<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.160> together<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.880> that's<00:04:10.030> it<00:04:10.330> again

it slide it together and that's it again

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.420 
it slide it together and that's it again
trim<00:04:11.500> your<00:04:11.590> tag<00:04:11.800> off

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.600 

like<00:04:18.430> so<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:19.200> again<00:04:20.200> with<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.950> units<00:04:21.370> all

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
like so and again with the units all

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.190 
like so and again with the units all
they're<00:04:21.790> doing<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.240> pulling<00:04:22.720> against<00:04:23.110> each

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
they're doing is pulling against each

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.580 
they're doing is pulling against each
other

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
other

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.500 
other
so<00:04:23.710> they<00:04:23.860> won't<00:04:24.040> go<00:04:24.250> past<00:04:24.460> each<00:04:24.730> other<00:04:24.910> so<00:04:25.420> the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
so they won't go past each other so the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.580 
so they won't go past each other so the
fourth<00:04:25.720> month<00:04:25.870> we're<00:04:25.990> going<00:04:26.110> to<00:04:26.170> tie<00:04:26.290> today

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
fourth month we're going to tie today

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.590 
fourth month we're going to tie today
guys<00:04:26.770> is<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.370> five<00:04:27.580> turn<00:04:27.820> surgeon's<00:04:28.390> knot

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
guys is the five turn surgeon's knot

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.900 
guys is the five turn surgeon's knot
these<00:04:29.530> are<00:04:29.650> not<00:04:29.770> so<00:04:29.890> perfect<00:04:30.550> if<00:04:30.640> we're<00:04:30.790> going

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
these are not so perfect if we're going

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.550 
these are not so perfect if we're going
to<00:04:30.970> be<00:04:31.030> fishing<00:04:31.300> really<00:04:31.750> light<00:04:31.960> lewis<00:04:32.320> and

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
to be fishing really light lewis and

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.340 
to be fishing really light lewis and
light<00:04:33.010> lines<00:04:33.600> first<00:04:34.600> off<00:04:34.810> we<00:04:34.960> need<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.140> measure

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
light lines first off we need to measure

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.680 
light lines first off we need to measure
out<00:04:35.590> how<00:04:36.160> much<00:04:36.340> leader<00:04:37.120> we're<00:04:37.330> going<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.510> want

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
out how much leader we're going to want

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.180 
out how much leader we're going to want
and<00:04:38.170> cut<00:04:38.950> that<00:04:39.070> off<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.910> all<00:04:43.150> we<00:04:43.240> need<00:04:43.420> to<00:04:43.450> do

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
and cut that off and all we need to do

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.680 
and cut that off and all we need to do
pass<00:04:45.190> them<00:04:45.400> across<00:04:45.580> each<00:04:45.850> other<00:04:46.060> like<00:04:46.390> we<00:04:46.540> did

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
pass them across each other like we did

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.340 
pass them across each other like we did
on<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.870> double<00:04:47.140> Union<00:04:47.410> on<00:04:48.000> make<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.240> loop<00:04:50.140> in

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
on the double Union on make a loop in

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.010 
on the double Union on make a loop in
the<00:04:50.380> middle<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:52.600> all<00:04:52.750> we<00:04:52.930> do<00:04:53.790> is<00:04:54.790> grab<00:04:55.120> our<00:04:55.450> tag

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
the middle and all we do is grab our tag

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.320 
the middle and all we do is grab our tag
in<00:04:56.230> from<00:04:56.500> our<00:04:56.620> main<00:04:56.830> line<00:04:57.040> and<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.340> whole

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
in from our main line and the whole

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.170 
in from our main line and the whole
piece<00:04:58.540> of<00:04:58.720> our<00:04:58.840> leader<00:04:59.080> and<00:05:00.070> pass<00:05:00.970> that

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
piece of our leader and pass that

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.270 
piece of our leader and pass that
through<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.570> loop<00:05:01.720> like<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.800> five<00:05:03.010> turn

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
through the loop like the five turn

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.100 
through the loop like the five turn
surgeon<00:05:03.760> not<00:05:03.880> since<00:05:04.180> it's<00:05:04.480> five<00:05:04.780> turns

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
surgeon not since it's five turns

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.070 
surgeon not since it's five turns
through<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.530> loop<00:05:06.240> now<00:05:07.240> I've<00:05:07.420> got<00:05:07.630> rope<00:05:07.870> today

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
through the loop now I've got rope today

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.680 
through the loop now I've got rope today
so<00:05:08.230> I'm<00:05:08.380> not<00:05:08.440> going<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:08.740> be<00:05:08.830> able<00:05:08.950> to<00:05:09.010> do<00:05:09.100> five

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
so I'm not going to be able to do five

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.560 
so I'm not going to be able to do five
but<00:05:10.690> we'll<00:05:10.840> get<00:05:11.050> what<00:05:11.440> was<00:05:11.560> that<00:05:11.710> three<00:05:12.570> hold

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
but we'll get what was that three hold

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.590 
but we'll get what was that three hold
all<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:14.260> tag<00:05:14.530> ins<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:15.150> pull<00:05:16.150> them<00:05:16.300> all<00:05:16.390> at<00:05:16.510> the

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
all the tag ins and pull them all at the

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.180 
all the tag ins and pull them all at the
same<00:05:16.780> time<00:05:18.210> so<00:05:19.210> they<00:05:19.330> form<00:05:19.630> up<00:05:19.780> and<00:05:20.710> as<00:05:20.890> you<00:05:21.040> get

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
same time so they form up and as you get

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.670 
same time so they form up and as you get
not<00:05:21.640> formed<00:05:22.150> let<00:05:22.630> go<00:05:22.780> off<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.020> tags<00:05:23.290> and<00:05:23.530> just

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
not formed let go off the tags and just

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.130 
not formed let go off the tags and just
grab<00:05:23.860> the<00:05:24.010> two<00:05:24.160> main<00:05:24.400> pieces<00:05:24.660> pull<00:05:25.660> tight<00:05:25.930> and

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
grab the two main pieces pull tight and

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.390 
grab the two main pieces pull tight and
then<00:05:27.040> do<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.700> same<00:05:27.880> thing<00:05:27.940> with<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:28.870> tags

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
then do the same thing with the tags

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.490 
then do the same thing with the tags
just<00:05:30.400> like<00:05:30.669> that<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:31.600> again

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
just like that and again

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.270 
just like that and again
cut<00:05:34.130> your<00:05:34.250> tag<00:05:34.460> ins<00:05:34.700> off

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.690 

as<00:05:39.790> with<00:05:40.060> any<00:05:40.210> not<00:05:40.420> guys<00:05:41.400> lubricate<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.520> knot

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
as with any not guys lubricate the knot

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.060 
as with any not guys lubricate the knot
otherwise<00:05:43.120> it<00:05:43.360> is<00:05:43.480> going<00:05:43.600> to<00:05:43.720> burn<00:05:43.960> and<00:05:44.200> weaken

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
otherwise it is going to burn and weaken

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.420 
otherwise it is going to burn and weaken
it

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
it

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.850 
it
so<00:05:45.640> not<00:05:45.880> number<00:05:46.120> 5<00:05:46.330> we've<00:05:46.540> got<00:05:46.720> it's<00:05:47.620> going<00:05:47.800> to

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
so not number 5 we've got it's going to

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.630 
so not number 5 we've got it's going to
be<00:05:48.010> a<00:05:48.250> doubled<00:05:48.970> over<00:05:49.270> loop<00:05:49.690> knot<00:05:49.930> so<00:05:50.650> reason

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
be a doubled over loop knot so reason

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.120 
be a doubled over loop knot so reason
why<00:05:51.760> we'd<00:05:51.940> tie<00:05:52.150> this<00:05:52.210> if<00:05:52.690> we've<00:05:53.200> got<00:05:53.380> a<00:05:53.620> really

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
why we'd tie this if we've got a really

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.250 
why we'd tie this if we've got a really
fine<00:05:54.310> braid<00:05:54.700> tying<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.450> a<00:05:55.480> thicker<00:05:55.750> mono

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
fine braid tying to a thicker mono

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.900 
fine braid tying to a thicker mono
it<00:05:56.530> just<00:05:56.740> helps<00:05:56.950> get<00:05:57.070> a<00:05:57.100> better<00:05:57.310> hold<00:05:57.580> on<00:05:57.820> the

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
it just helps get a better hold on the

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.220 
it just helps get a better hold on the
mono<00:05:58.090> so<00:05:58.360> we're<00:05:58.480> not<00:05:58.540> pulling<00:05:58.780> knots<00:05:59.080> through

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
mono so we're not pulling knots through

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.130 
mono so we're not pulling knots through
all<00:05:59.410> the<00:05:59.560> time<00:05:59.770> it's<00:06:00.700> very<00:06:00.910> simple<00:06:01.300> all<00:06:01.750> you<00:06:01.990> do

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
all the time it's very simple all you do

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.850 
all the time it's very simple all you do
is<00:06:02.260> double<00:06:02.440> our<00:06:02.830> braid<00:06:03.100> over<00:06:03.210> like<00:06:04.210> so<00:06:04.860> give

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
is double our braid over like so give

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.460 
is double our braid over like so give
yourself<00:06:06.130> plenty<00:06:06.250> of<00:06:06.400> room<00:06:06.610> to<00:06:06.640> work<00:06:06.880> with

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
yourself plenty of room to work with

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.990 
yourself plenty of room to work with
make<00:06:08.470> a<00:06:08.500> loop<00:06:08.830> in<00:06:09.010> the<00:06:09.100> doubled<00:06:09.580> over<00:06:09.820> line

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
make a loop in the doubled over line

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.370 
make a loop in the doubled over line
like<00:06:10.570> so<00:06:10.930> and<00:06:11.640> all<00:06:12.640> it<00:06:12.790> is<00:06:12.940> is<00:06:13.150> passing<00:06:13.840> our

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
like so and all it is is passing our

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.860 
like so and all it is is passing our
doubled<00:06:14.680> over<00:06:14.890> piece<00:06:15.570> through<00:06:16.570> the<00:06:16.690> loop
