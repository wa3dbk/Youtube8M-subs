rinse<00:01:48.009> it<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:49.420> way<00:01:49.570> you're<00:01:49.750> going<00:01:49.869> to<00:01:49.930> cook<00:01:50.079> it

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
rinse it the way you're going to cook it

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.639 
rinse it the way you're going to cook it
is<00:01:50.470> you're<00:01:50.649> gonna<00:01:50.710> do<00:01:51.009> one<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:52.060> two<00:01:52.329> so<00:01:53.110> 1<00:01:53.409> cup

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
is you're gonna do one to two so 1 cup

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.149 
is you're gonna do one to two so 1 cup
of<00:01:53.829> quinoa<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.850> 2<00:01:55.000> cups<00:01:55.210> of<00:01:55.420> water<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:57.040> way

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
of quinoa to 2 cups of water is the way

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.530 
of quinoa to 2 cups of water is the way
that<00:01:57.310> I<00:01:57.340> like<00:01:57.549> to<00:01:57.700> cook<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:58.390> is

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
that I like to cook it and this is

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.350 
that I like to cook it and this is
enough<00:01:58.840> probably<00:01:59.560> 1<00:02:00.399> cup<00:02:00.579> of<00:02:00.729> quinoa<00:02:00.909> would

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
enough probably 1 cup of quinoa would

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.219 
enough probably 1 cup of quinoa would
probably<00:02:01.840> feed<00:02:02.170> about<00:02:03.000> 4<00:02:04.000> people<00:02:04.450> three

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
probably feed about 4 people three

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.940 
probably feed about 4 people three
quarters<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:06.100> cup<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:07.360> completed<00:02:08.079> quinoa<00:02:08.380> so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
quarters of a cup of completed quinoa so

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.859 
quarters of a cup of completed quinoa so
to<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.250> 1<00:02:09.399> cup<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.850> had<00:02:10.119> my<00:02:10.269> two<00:02:10.329> cups<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.810> water

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
to the 1 cup I had my two cups of water

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.350 
to the 1 cup I had my two cups of water
and<00:02:11.400> you'll<00:02:12.400> see<00:02:12.579> that's<00:02:12.760> all<00:02:12.880> we're<00:02:13.030> gonna<00:02:13.150> do

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
and you'll see that's all we're gonna do

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.870 
and you'll see that's all we're gonna do
didn't<00:02:14.110> rinse<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.530> it's<00:02:14.769> dry<00:02:15.160> straight<00:02:15.700> out<00:02:15.850> of

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
didn't rinse it it's dry straight out of

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.910 
didn't rinse it it's dry straight out of
the<00:02:16.000> bag<00:02:16.150> and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
the bag and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.520 
the bag and
then<00:02:18.069> I<00:02:18.550> turn<00:02:18.910> my<00:02:19.090> stove<00:02:19.390> on<00:02:19.599> too<00:02:19.840> high<00:02:20.080> because

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
then I turn my stove on too high because

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.830 
then I turn my stove on too high because
I'm<00:02:20.770> gonna<00:02:20.860> bring<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.550> rapid<00:02:21.940> boil<00:02:22.150> the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
I'm gonna bring that to a rapid boil the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.570 
I'm gonna bring that to a rapid boil the
one<00:02:22.989> thing<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.319> do<00:02:23.380> do<00:02:23.739> and<00:02:24.099> this<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.550> think

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
one thing I do do and this is I think

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.910 
one thing I do do and this is I think
just<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.330> don't<00:02:25.870> know<00:02:26.020> I<00:02:26.200> have<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.680> have

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
just I don't know I have it that I have

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.250 
just I don't know I have it that I have
is<00:02:27.099> I<00:02:27.190> do<00:02:27.250> like<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.819> make<00:02:28.090> sure<00:02:28.599> that<00:02:28.750> all<00:02:28.959> of

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
is I do like to make sure that all of

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.080 
is I do like to make sure that all of
the<00:02:29.380> quinoa<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:29.890> moistened<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:30.880> I<00:02:30.910> just

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
the quinoa is moistened and so I just

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.729 
the quinoa is moistened and so I just
take<00:02:31.270> my<00:02:31.330> fork<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:31.989> I<00:02:32.050> kind<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.290> mix<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.590> in

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
take my fork and I kind of mix it in

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.860 
take my fork and I kind of mix it in
like<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.790> I'm<00:02:34.270> gonna<00:02:34.420> leave<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.720> uncovered

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
like that I'm gonna leave it uncovered

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.590 
like that I'm gonna leave it uncovered
bring<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.709> rapid<00:02:36.040> boil<00:02:36.250> one<00:02:37.180> thing<00:02:37.420> also

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
bring it to a rapid boil one thing also

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.150 
bring it to a rapid boil one thing also
that<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:38.050> will<00:02:38.080> notice<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.770> probably

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
that you will notice that is probably

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.530 
that you will notice that is probably
different<00:02:39.459> than<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> lot<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.120> other<00:02:40.239> things

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
different than a lot of other things

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.670 
different than a lot of other things
that<00:02:40.630> you've<00:02:40.840> read<00:02:40.989> about<00:02:41.110> how<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.440> cook

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
that you've read about how to cook

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.229 
that you've read about how to cook
quinoa<00:02:41.920> if<00:02:42.130> you've<00:02:42.340> if<00:02:42.580> you've<00:02:42.610> done<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> little

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
quinoa if you've if you've done a little

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.270 
quinoa if you've if you've done a little
research<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:44.050> lot<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.620> times<00:02:44.800> people<00:02:45.160> will

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
research is a lot of times people will

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.000 
research is a lot of times people will
say<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.550> use<00:02:46.120> chicken<00:02:46.510> broth<00:02:46.660> in<00:02:47.050> your<00:02:47.739> quinoa

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
say to use chicken broth in your quinoa

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.460 
say to use chicken broth in your quinoa
to<00:02:48.310> give<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.550> some<00:02:48.700> flavor<00:02:48.819> I<00:02:49.209> actually<00:02:49.870> do<00:02:50.319> not

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
to give it some flavor I actually do not

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.110 
to give it some flavor I actually do not
do<00:02:50.769> that<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:50.950> believe<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.519> just<00:02:51.670> using<00:02:51.970> plain

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
do that I believe in just using plain

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.259 
do that I believe in just using plain
water<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.959> reason<00:02:53.290> is<00:02:53.680> because<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.850> can

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
water and the reason is because I can

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.330 
water and the reason is because I can
now<00:02:55.420> use<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.959> batch<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.470> quinoa<00:02:56.709> for<00:02:57.100> things

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
now use this batch of quinoa for things

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.890 
now use this batch of quinoa for things
that<00:02:57.489> are<00:02:57.610> sweet<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.120> things<00:02:58.600> that<00:02:58.690> are

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
that are sweet and things that are

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.740 
that are sweet and things that are
savory<00:02:59.110> if<00:02:59.530> you<00:03:00.130> choose<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.670> cook<00:03:00.819> quinoa<00:03:01.150> with

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
savory if you choose to cook quinoa with

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.360 
savory if you choose to cook quinoa with
chicken<00:03:02.230> broth<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.590> kind<00:03:02.769> of<00:03:02.860> limits<00:03:03.190> how<00:03:03.310> you

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
chicken broth it kind of limits how you

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.699 
chicken broth it kind of limits how you
can<00:03:03.640> use<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.819> if<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.120> want<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.470> put<00:03:05.470> something

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
can use it if you want to put something

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.770 
can use it if you want to put something
sweet<00:03:06.069> in<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.220> for<00:03:06.370> example<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:07.239> this<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.630> just

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
sweet in it for example so this is just

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.979 
sweet in it for example so this is just
a<00:03:07.930> very<00:03:08.230> basic<00:03:08.730> water-based<00:03:09.730> no<00:03:10.450> flavoring

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
a very basic water-based no flavoring

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.960 
a very basic water-based no flavoring
way<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.530> cook<00:03:11.769> quinoa<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.519> have<00:03:12.670> had<00:03:12.850> it

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
way to cook quinoa so I have had it

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.729 
way to cook quinoa so I have had it
going<00:03:13.299> now<00:03:13.450> I'm<00:03:13.660> in<00:03:13.780> about<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:13.959> nine<00:03:14.290> which<00:03:14.709> is

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
going now I'm in about a nine which is

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.680 
going now I'm in about a nine which is
right<00:03:14.980> under<00:03:15.100> high<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.670> it's<00:03:16.120> now<00:03:16.269> coming<00:03:16.540> to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
right under high and it's now coming to

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.539 
right under high and it's now coming to
a<00:03:16.750> rapid<00:03:17.080> boil<00:03:17.230> about<00:03:17.440> three<00:03:17.799> minutes<00:03:17.950> into<00:03:18.400> it

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
a rapid boil about three minutes into it

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.610 
a rapid boil about three minutes into it
so<00:03:19.120> now<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.360> it's<00:03:19.600> rapidly<00:03:19.930> boiling<00:03:20.440> I'm

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
so now that it's rapidly boiling I'm

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.050 
so now that it's rapidly boiling I'm

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
earlier in the video is that this batch

earlier in the video is that this batch
of<00:06:29.259> quinoa<00:06:29.440> would<00:06:29.770> probably<00:06:30.130> feed<00:06:30.340> about<00:06:30.460> 4

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:30.849 
of quinoa would probably feed about 4

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.810 
of quinoa would probably feed about 4
people<00:06:31.169> 3/4<00:06:32.169> of<00:06:32.199> a<00:06:32.380> cup<00:06:32.409> so<00:06:32.860> I<00:06:33.370> bet<00:06:33.520> you<00:06:33.639> that's
