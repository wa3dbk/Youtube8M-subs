00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.320
 I made this choice for one of those I 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.290
 I chose myself what I was looking for a long time and nothing 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.440
 don't change everything as it is leave them yours 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.650
 my eyes are like a prisoner I'm ready for you 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.590
 pray to heaven spitting on all sentries 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.070
 belt with you I started the way and I will be up 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.989
 end and change nothing no way back 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.170
 it's not difficult for me to remember what year it was 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.510
 back from here I can easily say what will happen 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.239
 tomorrow you never know who 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.610
 expect and where is which doll from which 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.120
 theater and difficult to retreat and take a step 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.280
 back start your new journey much 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.550
 harder and never too late to click on 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.460
 brakes but my freedom is the pedal to the right 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.250
 I am sure that all dreams come true 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.920
 all that is past and leave that 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.979
 most sacred in our lives and the life 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.350
 the worst enemy is our memory but in 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.630
 one road drive two lines of fate 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.330
 one love goddess for a day nobody 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.550
 power if not see the white light in the distance 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.710
 remembers the one who believes happiness then you 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.830
 will you be happy made this choice on 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.950
 one of 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.680
 Well, that was looking for a long time and do not change anything 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.530
 leave it as it is in your eyes 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.310
 as if I'm a prisoner, I'm ready to pray to you 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.040
 Heaven spat on all time zones with 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.860
 by you I started the journey until the end and 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.960
 nothing has changed there is no turning back on 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.750
 twelve o'clock in the night but not verbally 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.180
 eyes I draw a silhouette that I will only remember 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.870
 Once I have not met this you only one 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.510
 out of a hundred 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.300
 and all that in the head to put down the paper 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.180
 one day you will understand that it is all in vain 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.400
 that all my words had weight once but 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.760
 all that was said was only yesterday 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.130
 and you will fall asleep and about snow only tomorrow and 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.920
 appeared for a moment that it was only a dream 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.410
 the head is full of emotions and the eyes of sadness 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.660
 line under the pillow and find the phone 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.270
 there with good morning sunshine i'm already 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.360
 I miss after a cup of tea that has long been 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.300

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.360
 Appreciate those who are not among this vanity 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.540
 looking not at what will be forever near me 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.659

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.390

 change nothing there is no turning back I 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.340
 I hope this track is not worse than all these 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.310
 songs that play daily VKontakte on 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.709
 hundreds can hear it to the wall but they will understand 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.200
 who shared pain rhodes smile 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.689
 every day love knows no measure for it 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.709
 no boundaries and so far where they go 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.319
 the trains 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.959
 so hard all the time to see these faces and 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.659

 as if I'm a prisoner, I'm ready to pray to you 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.360
 Heaven spat on all time zones with 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.520
