00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.199
 caught 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.719
 yes yes 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.340
 thank you panda a bandit but you want 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.149
 that with this is going to happen to me no longer 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.780
 it's going to hurt 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.780
 OK 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.550
 Many 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.380
 to make panda dragon head 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.430
 we need different green cardboards 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.280
 shades of green dark green light green 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.200
 we also need white cardboard 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.619
 colored markers glue scissors 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.680
 bar and a stapler first 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.100
 panda we are going to mark the head of 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.100
 dragon 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.370
 ah 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.890
 as we need it in duplicate we are going 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.360
 to cut these two cards together is 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.100
 important that we make a mouth very 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.990
 big panda because the dragons have 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.990
 teeth and fire 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.470
 we also need two straight strips of 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.470
 about 10 centimeters 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.700
 these two strips back we folded them 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.800
 this way making a flap to each 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.800
 side and the same with this other 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.709
 we cut a few teeth to the line 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.069
 that we have marked on both sides 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.069
 bands 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.530
 d 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.610
 panda attention because now we're going to 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.700
 make two very big eyes with cardboard 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.700
 white 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.210
 He drew a circle and cut it 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.210
 duplicate 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.460
 ah 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.680
 now we have to draw those eyes from 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.680
 dragon we go over them in black 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.570
 we expose a point in the center 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.959
 and with red we draw some veins 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.569
 so that it seems more bad we paste the 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.290
 eyes in the face of the dragon we give a 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.290
 little bit of glue 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.939
 and here another and now with a marker 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.569
 let's draw the scales of the dragon 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:28.340
 like honditas all over the head 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.340
 band helps me with this other 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.730
 we join these two strips because 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.080
 we need it to be a very long strip and 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.360
 we stick them 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.220
 and now let's start giving volume 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.960
 the head of our dragon we will begin 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.260
 by one of the sides and we will apply 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.500
 glue all the way to the 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.500
 mouth 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.360
 and 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:07.390
 when we reach the mouth we cut the 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.880
 piece that remains and now we continue 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.250
 the other piece 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.910
 seating 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.910
 my child 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.910
 mmm 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.360
 now send we have to put the other 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:26.969
 part of the head as if it were a 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.310
 top we apply bar glue for 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:31.530
 all around - inside the mouth 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.129
 so that super fun to play 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:38.539
 costumes and a dragon is a disguise 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.539
 super super nice 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.240
 because he still has missing teeth and 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.910
 last retouches panda vente for here 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.400
 to make the teeth I'm going to cut a 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.410
 long strip of white cardboard looks 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.410
 panda if we make triangles like that 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.620
 Y 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:12.350
 and we cut it to the measure of the mouth 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.160
 and we're hitting them inside with a 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.160
 little bit of glue 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.410
 with this light green card we are going to 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.410
 make two snouts 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.169
 and now let's decorate the head 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.290
 making green quills all over the 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:03.350
 outline with a piece of cardboard what 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.699
 we doubled in half cut like a 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.699
 kind of little door 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.879
 well and we have to make two folds 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.879
 one like this 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.660
 and paste it on the top 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.860
 i 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.860
 two 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.889
 the skirt is almost finished 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.070
 something is missing I do not know what we could 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.630
 put panda to make it more is 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.430
 we can really do 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.490
 some eyebrows so you have one more look 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.949
 expressive we draw a funny eyebrow 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:52.970
 for example in the form of s like 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:56.430

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:15.389
 We use cards of other colors 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.639
 for example lilac and pink we can make 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:20.399
 a fantastic female version 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:23.069
