00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.660
 welcome to info Video what to do against thread algae in the garden pond 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.819
 Amen this video 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.580
 the causes of rides algae growth 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.419
 but they are coalition partners 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.159
 can do well against it 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.470
 they can also take precautions against colors algae growth 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.089
 String algae are a big problem for many pond owners 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.369
 Not only do not look ugly but you can also play the game Ogi too 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.760
 seriously harm 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.010
 From a biological point of view, thread algae cause three problems firstly 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.370
 Their photosynthesis produces so much oxygen during the daytime 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.210
 poisonous that is only the least known because normally you say yes 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.690
 the oxygen is good for the pond 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.220
 Secondly 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.160
 8 2 Ortmann drove albums the vital oxygen and can 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.410
 thus bring the garden pond to the point of tilt 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.110
 a big problem because at night they are just consumers and not producers 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.200
 such as aquatic plants and algae at work 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.450
 third, to build more biomass 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.570
 The colors require old carbon to pick them from the water 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.250
 How well available Cologne never solved it are carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.630
 quickly used up 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.410
 After that, algae crack open the carbonate hardness that is so important for the pond 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.920
 significantly reduce the water becomes unstable 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.820
 the ph value fluctuates and the part is it's topics is in great danger 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.600
 Filamentous algae are particularly welcome in ponds with clear water on them 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.270
 then have a lot of light for their metabolism 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.420
 This is a bad thing for many pond owners 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.370
 I hold so suspended the green water was fought and shortly thereafter 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.830
 the colors start to grow old 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.120
 the most important nutrient of the colors sacred is exit already slight 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.740
 Quantities can 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 Lying around the questions old book even in the winter 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.340
 After a few nice sunny days, the exit and the light suffice 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.479
 Filamentous algae grow at temperatures as low as two degrees Celsius 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.329
 The mechanical removal of filamentous algae makes little hope for success than that 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.959
 Colors keep life in a symbiosis with mucus mushrooms and bacteria takes 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.139
 one out of the albums so the symbiosis partners stay in the pond and grow 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.559
 continue with the albums fragments again 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:28.389
 better is the targeted biological control of colors keeping up with the 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.439
 Thread algae Annihilator Algo reward 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.530
 while the product is scattered on the old decomposes itself there 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.010
 hydrogen peroxide 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.339
 and reacts with the old cells 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:41.469
 to learn the algae as well as the slime molds and bacteria 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:46.959
 literally burned in front of the product only water and oxygen remain 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.640
 even during the application it is absolutely safe for the ponds Piloti 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.129
 Aldo Lohn Fadenalgen Annihilator destroys string algae within one 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.659
 week 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.049
 look for yourself 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.049
 String algae with still intact count 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.469
 worth a minute after using Euro 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.459
 after five minutes, the reaction is in full swing 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.389
 String algae count 15 minutes after treatment 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.219
 three hours around 24 hours later 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.999
 one week after the treatment, the colors are old completely replacing them 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.949
 pay attention again to the difference 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.269
 here the original condition 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.640
 and here the same place in the pond 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.429
 one week after treatment with euro wage 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:42.029
 keeping the colors completely gone is the part supplied 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:44.969
 crystal clear 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:49.829
 now to prevent the taz and prevent further filamentous algae growth 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.609
 because caution filamentous algae have a small meanness in stock how many 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.119
 Part owner brings to despair because they do not know this 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:02.829
 When dying, the colors give algae stored in their connective tissue 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.140
 Phosphate back to the pond water 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.150
 and thus immediately lay the foundation for the next algae plague 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:13.719
 important now is the binding of the Voss father through the frost ribbons 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:14.989
 Seydoux 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.559
 this product reacted with the almost rides for six weeks 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:21.989
 and turns into apathy romp so the phosphates for that 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.349
 Algae growth is no longer available 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.640
 you can not say enough 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.290
 that nutrient binding is key to long-term success 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.430
 The old avoidance is when traveling but also in the old age 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.930
