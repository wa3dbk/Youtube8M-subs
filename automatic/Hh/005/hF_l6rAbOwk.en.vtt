00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 currently pursuing a specialization 

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.600
 has become a fundamental prerequisite of 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.919
 new generation of dentists who are 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.929
 entering the labor market 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.750
 Many colleagues now leave for the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.160
 masters to have a differential and 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.740
 try to stand out in the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.869
 increasingly saturated work is like 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.320
 if there was a kind of inflation 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.939
 there is confusion in the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.539
 Master's concept 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.000
 what is the basic objective of the master's degree 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.990
 master's and master's degree is to train 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.930
 teachers 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.910
 that is to train teachers are each 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.219
 more in common to find 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.829
 Masters which included however in 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.030
 academic part parents practice account 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.500
 clinic 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.480
 I had the opportunity to involve 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.450
 my surgical technique in the masters 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.399
 which I performed, however, it was optional 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.110
 main focus is not this 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.420
 the main objective quality is 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.760
 being increasingly teaching only 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.379
 so much that most programs only 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.460
 are admitting professionals already 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.199
 specialists 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.780
 summarizing the expert he knows how to do 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.799
 the master of who has master's degree beyond 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.890
 know how to do 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.880
 he knows how to teach what he does and 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.430
 doctorate degree 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.369
 if you know how to do and how to teach 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.400
 you also want to produce knowledge 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.280
 or you want to do searches 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.560
 So you're a doctoral candidate. 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.259
 your best business card my friend 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.590
 it is not your academic title to your 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.299
 result and this does not necessarily 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.200
 is related to performance 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.030
 never hide behind the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.170
 academic titles to this will not 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.780
 take you nothing 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.810
 they are important yes the title has the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.329
 their quality but in isolation and we 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.880
 do nothing for you and the market 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.909
 work by making a headline analogy 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.799
 academic is how you get a 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.009
 driver your habilitation 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.210
 You took your driver's license now. 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.399
 knowing driving is another thing 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.729
 to become Michael Schumacher is 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.970
 another completely different there we are 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.620
 speaking of high performance where the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.440
 Technical abilities 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.690
 to be associated with other types of 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.840
 skills and these other skills 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.909
 not part of the academic world what 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.760
 This means that your success 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.530
 professional as a dentist is 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.269
 When I speak to a dentist surgeon, I 'm 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.720
 speaking from the market point of view of 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.340
 work is in the office or clinic is the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.150
 your success can not be attributed 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.030
 only to their academic performance 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.390
 You have to understand that there are many 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.609
 non-academic skills that are 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.190
 professional gifts of success and 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.980
 What are the elton talking skills? 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.650
 of any kind of gift of genius but 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.959
 of skills that are seldom 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.810
 mentioned in our 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.560
 there are truths like knowing how to communicate 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.099
 effective ability to maintain 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.769
 motivated despite the difficulties have 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:14.010
 resilience to deal with their 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.389
 frustrations set goals for your life 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.940
 professional staff have self-discipline 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:23.370
 keep the focus empathic with the 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.380
 people that is very different from being 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.440
 nice people confuse this 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.919
 concept to be nice is nothing more than 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.069
 that pretend you like everybody 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:37.769
 to empathize is to put yourself in the shoes of 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.319
 others is to have a genuine interest in 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.000
 others want to help someone else 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.919
 This is being nice so that you 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.569
 understand these concepts better, I suggest 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:48.209
 strongly reading the book 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.449
 psychologist's emotional intelligence 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.790
 daniel now you will understand the power 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.669
 this type of intelligence in your 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.799
 personal and professional development 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:01.079
 there are several masters and very 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:05.069
 well positioned in the labor market 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:07.980
 are those who expand your mind and 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.739
 realizes the power of these other forms of 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.260
 intelligence and reconciled 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.139
 fantastic both academic career 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.370
 as for the part his clinical career 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.849
 toilet 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.469
 but on the other hand it is also full 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.870
 of masters and doctors with their 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:26.550
 empty offices passing through some 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.710
 difficulties including final 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.870
 I'm not saying at all that 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.710
 academic knowledge it is not 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.590
 important 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.470
 no we mean it is yes a lot 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.350
 important thing I'm saying is that 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.300
 it alone in relation to performance 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.930
 market is not enough. 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.890
 but finally it is worth doing the masters 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.260
 yes it's worth it since if you 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.390
 enjoy sharing knowledge 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.320
 if you want to teach if you want to be 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.320
 teacher 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.690
 yes it's worth it now if you 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.450
 is doing masters only by states 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.710
 or by trying to leverage your office 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.950
 clinic 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.310
 you may not have the expected result 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.020
 the master's degree is no guarantee of anything and this 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.660
 that most are doing right now 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.870
 I think that the teacher should 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.000
 encourage your students to think differently 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.270
 is to think outside the box not following the 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.580
 herd do what everyone does not 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.050
 it will lead nowhere to the mere fact 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.750
 you understand that this type of 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:35.140
 knowledge is neither taught nor 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.870
 neither in the masters degree nor much less 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.760
 the doctorate is enough for the 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.520
 your radar stays on 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.190
 in this way the possibility of 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.260
 learning increases a lot in my 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.120
 opinion these are the knowledge 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.490
 essential for you to enter the 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.230
 the labor market and can make all the 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.260
 difference in your career 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.940
 when you look at dentists who 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.280
 making the difference that they are 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.900
 having success today 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.600
 You profile is you notice a 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.210
 methodology different from that taught in 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.300
 academic world that we see is a 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:14.550
 much more practical technology much more 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:18.610
 objective much more creative much more 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.320
 entrepreneur is a 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.630
 anthology will transform the very 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.520
 dentist surgeon transforms the life of 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.980
 their patients and consequently 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.360
 transform society, I hope that these 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.220
 concepts can somehow 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.210
 impact your life both personally and 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.190
 professional 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.190
 a big hug and until the next video
