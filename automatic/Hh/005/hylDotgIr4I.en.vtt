ruler and I will make four markings at
every<00:01:34.340> quarter<00:01:34.700> inch<00:01:35.229> you<00:01:36.229> cannot<00:01:36.530> do<00:01:36.710> this

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
every quarter inch you cannot do this

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.080 
every quarter inch you cannot do this
with<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.190> other<00:01:37.310> ones<00:01:37.550> because<00:01:37.729> they<00:01:37.909> will

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
with the other ones because they will

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:50.170 
with the other ones because they will
not<00:01:38.180> fit<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:40.360> one<00:01:42.340> two<00:01:44.560> three<00:01:46.810> four<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.970> I<00:01:49.970> will

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180
