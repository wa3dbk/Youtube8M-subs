this<00:00:03.840> sport<00:00:04.170> is<00:00:04.350> not<00:00:04.470> about<00:00:04.680> ego<00:00:04.890> for<00:00:05.250> me

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
this sport is not about ego for me

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.080 
this sport is not about ego for me
to<00:00:06.540> me<00:00:06.690> it's<00:00:06.870> about<00:00:07.020> being<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.589> very<00:00:08.010> best<00:00:08.370> at

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
to me it's about being the very best at

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.830 
to me it's about being the very best at
what<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.360> do

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.299 

it's<00:00:12.840> about<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> work<00:00:13.469> ethic<00:00:13.710> it's<00:00:14.070> about

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
it's about a work ethic it's about

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.189 
it's about a work ethic it's about
working<00:00:14.730> hard<00:00:14.910> every<00:00:15.299> day<00:00:15.330> because<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:15.960> can't

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
working hard every day because you can't

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:40.940 
working hard every day because you can't
be<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> champion<00:00:17.990> every<00:00:18.990> single<00:00:19.289> day<00:00:19.439> out

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.250 

I<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.700> machines<00:00:42.180> occasionally<00:00:42.840> because<00:00:43.110> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
I like machines occasionally because you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.040 
I like machines occasionally because you
can<00:00:43.379> change<00:00:43.559> angles<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.370> maybe<00:00:44.969> fill<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
can change angles and maybe fill in the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.590 
can change angles and maybe fill in the
blanks<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.530> more<00:00:46.770> detail<00:00:47.190> work<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.300> that's

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
blanks like more detail work so that's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510 
blanks like more detail work so that's
really<00:00:49.260> great<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.739> cuz<00:00:50.100> changing

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
really great for that cuz changing

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.770 
really great for that cuz changing
angles<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.940> want<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> hit<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> muscle<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
angles you want to hit the muscle in a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
angles you want to hit the muscle in a
different<00:00:52.079> way<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.230> always<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.430> basics

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
different way but always the basics

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.720 
different way but always the basics
that's<00:00:54.480> work<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:58.309> always<00:00:59.309> talked<00:00:59.609> about

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that's work I always talked about

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.729 
that's work I always talked about
training<00:01:00.180> heavy<00:01:00.480> especially<00:01:01.289> women<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:01.710> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
training heavy especially women if you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.560 
training heavy especially women if you
want<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.219> nice<00:01:02.430> muscle<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.420> lift

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
want to get nice muscle you have to lift

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.080 
want to get nice muscle you have to lift
heavy<00:01:03.809> however<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> depleted<00:01:05.309> State<00:01:05.790> I'm

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
heavy however in a depleted State I'm

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.330 
heavy however in a depleted State I'm
really<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.840> strong<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.590> feel<00:01:07.860> like

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
really not that strong and I feel like

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.270 
really not that strong and I feel like
weak<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.350> my<00:01:10.830> strength<00:01:11.159> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
weak so you know my strength is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.609 
weak so you know my strength is
decreased<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.260> fifty<00:01:13.590> or

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
decreased like and it's like fifty or

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.130 
decreased like and it's like fifty or
sixty<00:01:13.830> percent<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.840> lower<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
sixty percent so I have to lower the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.289 
sixty percent so I have to lower the
weights<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:17.220> bit<00:01:17.340> higher<00:01:17.490> reps<00:01:17.790> 12<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
weights a little bit higher reps 12 to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.530 
weights a little bit higher reps 12 to
15<00:01:18.979> sometimes<00:01:19.979> more<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.240> about

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
15 sometimes more really it's just about

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
15 sometimes more really it's just about
keeping<00:01:21.720> blood<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> muscle<00:01:22.640> letting<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
keeping blood in the muscle letting the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.179 
keeping blood in the muscle letting the
muscles<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:24.180> hey<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.600> still<00:01:25.200> need<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.710> stick

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
muscles know hey we still need you stick

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.880 
muscles know hey we still need you stick
around<00:01:26.780> but<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.930> not<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
around but it's not like going to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.700 
around but it's not like going to
failure<00:01:29.280> definitely<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.240> no<00:01:30.390> failure<00:01:30.750> this
