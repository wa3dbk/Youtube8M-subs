00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:40.740 

and<00:00:32.509> what's<00:00:32.719> gonna

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.819 

also<00:00:41.379> you<00:00:41.440> get<00:00:42.309> four<00:00:42.640> steaks<00:00:43.149> that<00:00:43.829> basically

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
also you get four steaks that basically

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.470 
also you get four steaks that basically
just<00:00:45.100> hammer<00:00:45.370> into<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.699> ground<00:00:46.030> at<00:00:46.269> each

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
just hammer into the ground at each

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:55.910 
just hammer into the ground at each
quarter<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.620> hold<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.890> trap<00:00:48.129> in<00:00:48.430> place

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.560 

has<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.070> trim<00:00:57.250> mechanism<00:00:57.850> down<00:00:57.970> here<00:00:58.270> this<00:00:58.450> is

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
has the trim mechanism down here this is

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.170 
has the trim mechanism down here this is
where<00:00:58.720> you're<00:00:58.840> going<00:00:58.930> to<00:00:58.990> place<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.500> cord<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
where you're going to place the cord to

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.060 
where you're going to place the cord to
attract<00:01:01.600> them<00:01:01.840> in<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.809> just<00:01:05.470> imagine<00:01:05.770> this

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
attract them in and so just imagine this

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.340 
attract them in and so just imagine this
area<00:01:06.400> here<00:01:06.610> is<00:01:06.640> covered<00:01:07.030> in<00:01:07.300> corn<00:01:07.600> because<00:01:08.260> the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
area here is covered in corn because the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.840 
area here is covered in corn because the
hog<00:01:08.500> walks<00:01:08.830> in<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.190> starts<00:01:09.460> rooting<00:01:09.640> around

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
hog walks in and starts rooting around

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.440 
hog walks in and starts rooting around
he's<00:01:10.180> going<00:01:10.270> to<00:01:10.360> pump<00:01:10.570> this<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:12.190> was<00:01:13.150> going<00:01:13.390> to

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
he's going to pump this and was going to

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.109 
he's going to pump this and was going to
shut<00:01:13.690> behind<00:01:13.869> him<00:01:14.170> now<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:15.250> is<00:01:15.400> a<00:01:15.430> this<00:01:15.820> trap

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
shut behind him now this is a this trap

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.070 
shut behind him now this is a this trap
here<00:01:16.390> has<00:01:17.490> been<00:01:18.490> able<00:01:18.610> to<00:01:18.790> trap<00:01:19.060> well<00:01:19.360> over<00:01:19.570> 400

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
here has been able to trap well over 400

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.270 
here has been able to trap well over 400
pounds<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:22.350> again<00:01:23.350> it's<00:01:23.500> extremely<00:01:23.619> easy<00:01:24.070> to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
pounds and again it's extremely easy to

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.410 
pounds and again it's extremely easy to
use<00:01:24.400> if<00:01:25.119> you<00:01:25.270> have<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.450> feed<00:01:25.780> plot<00:01:26.110> or<00:01:27.149> for<00:01:28.149> deer

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
use if you have a feed plot or for deer

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.410 
use if you have a feed plot or for deer
or<00:01:28.660> turkey<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:30.550> logs<00:01:30.759> are<00:01:30.940> coming<00:01:31.180> in<00:01:31.270> and

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
or turkey and the logs are coming in and

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.050 
or turkey and the logs are coming in and
just<00:01:31.479> destroying<00:01:31.960> it<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:33.490> will<00:01:33.640> give<00:01:33.820> you<00:01:33.910> an

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
just destroying it this will give you an

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.330 
just destroying it this will give you an
opportunity<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:35.500> get<00:01:35.649> rid<00:01:35.680> of<00:01:35.920> those<00:01:36.040> hogs

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
opportunity to to get rid of those hogs

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.030 
opportunity to to get rid of those hogs
not<00:01:37.270> having<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.630> go<00:01:37.750> out<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.020> do<00:01:38.170> hunting<00:01:38.920> at

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
not having to go out and do hunting at

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.520 
not having to go out and do hunting at
night<00:01:39.070> looking<00:01:39.729> for<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.910> hogs<00:01:40.090> and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
night looking for the hogs and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.749 
night looking for the hogs and
fortunately<00:01:41.530> hogs<00:01:41.800> are<00:01:42.039> nocturnal<00:01:42.460> animals

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
fortunately hogs are nocturnal animals

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.010 
fortunately hogs are nocturnal animals
so<00:01:43.119> they're<00:01:43.210> very<00:01:43.450> difficult<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:45.130> hunt

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
so they're very difficult to to hunt

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.130 
so they're very difficult to to hunt
especially<00:01:47.020> if<00:01:47.110> you're<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:49.330> know<00:01:49.390> not<00:01:49.930> able

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
especially if you're you know not able

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.070 
especially if you're you know not able

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
to be out in the location that the odds

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:01.069 
to be out in the location that the odds
are<00:01:53.369> rooting<00:01:54.369> around

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.179 

so<00:02:02.079> next<00:02:02.290> time<00:02:02.500> you're<00:02:02.710> having<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:03.009> problem
