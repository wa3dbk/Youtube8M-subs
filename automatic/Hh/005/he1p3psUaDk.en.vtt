00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
interesting indeed anyway now let's look

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.360 
interesting indeed anyway now let's look
at<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:47.000> actual<00:01:47.330> design<00:01:47.870> update<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.040> I'm<00:01:49.220> gonna

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
at the actual design update so I'm gonna

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.100 
at the actual design update so I'm gonna
sum<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.790> all<00:01:49.940> up<00:01:50.000> for<00:01:50.210> you<00:01:50.420> instead<00:01:50.750> of<00:01:50.870> reading

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
sum it all up for you instead of reading

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.720 
sum it all up for you instead of reading
the<00:01:51.350> entire<00:01:51.470> thing<00:01:51.800> but<00:01:52.190> I<00:01:52.250> do<00:01:52.310> recommend

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
the entire thing but I do recommend

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.460 
the entire thing but I do recommend
checking<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.270> out<00:01:53.360> for<00:01:53.630> yourself<00:01:53.990> if<00:01:54.200> you're

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
checking it out for yourself if you're

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.780 
checking it out for yourself if you're
actually<00:01:54.650> playing<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.220> game<00:01:55.310> right<00:01:55.520> now

anything<00:03:50.610> of<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.880> sorts<00:03:51.270> but<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.810> do<00:03:51.930> think

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
anything of the sorts but I do think

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.630 
anything of the sorts but I do think
that<00:03:52.319> people<00:03:52.650> are<00:03:52.709> freaking<00:03:53.099> out<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.430> little

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
that people are freaking out a little

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.610 
that people are freaking out a little
bit<00:03:53.730> more<00:03:53.970> than<00:03:54.150> they<00:03:54.300> should<00:03:54.330> I<00:03:54.930> mean<00:03:55.440> people

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
bit more than they should I mean people

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.559 
bit more than they should I mean people
did<00:03:56.010> ask<00:03:56.250> for<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.640> game<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.940> be<00:03:56.970> difficult<00:03:57.209> and

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
did ask for the game to be difficult and

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.390 
did ask for the game to be difficult and
now<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:57.989> is<00:03:58.020> actually<00:03:58.650> too<00:03:58.920> difficult

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
now that it is actually too difficult

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.850 
now that it is actually too difficult
they<00:04:00.120> don't<00:04:00.300> like<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.660> sadly<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.319> guess<00:04:01.620> that's

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
they don't like it sadly I guess that's

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.530 
they don't like it sadly I guess that's
just<00:04:01.950> how<00:04:02.099> things<00:04:02.220> are<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.910> most<00:04:03.360> of<00:04:03.480> the
