to end up heating to that hundred and
seventy-five<00:00:57.879> degrees<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.350> right<00:00:59.530> now<00:00:59.680> we're

seventy-five degrees so right now we're

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.380 
seventy-five degrees so right now we're
going<00:00:59.920> to<00:00:59.980> stretch<00:01:00.160> it<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.489> right<00:01:00.640> way<00:01:00.820> you're

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
going to stretch it the right way you're

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.810 
going to stretch it the right way you're
going<00:01:01.510> to<00:01:01.539> tent<00:01:02.410> the<00:01:02.829> material<00:01:03.280> across<00:01:03.579> the

area<00:01:04.210> another<00:01:04.899> post<00:01:05.170> heat<00:01:05.500> right<00:01:06.190> after<00:01:06.580> you

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
area another post heat right after you

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.459 
area another post heat right after you
put<00:01:06.759> it<00:01:07.060> down

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:16.870 

as<00:01:12.469> you<00:01:12.679> can<00:01:12.859> see<00:01:13.039> the<00:01:13.189> lines<00:01:13.429> went<00:01:13.729> away<00:01:15.880> we're

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
as you can see the lines went away we're

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.590 
as you can see the lines went away we're
going<00:01:16.969> to<00:01:17.060> go<00:01:17.210> one<00:01:17.600> smooth<00:01:18.200> motion<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:20.450> is

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
going to go one smooth motion that is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.809 
going to go one smooth motion that is
why<00:01:20.750> we<00:01:20.960> use<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.259> torch<00:01:21.530> because<00:01:22.009> we<00:01:22.250> used<00:01:22.700> a

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:22.819 
why we use the torch because we used a

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.190 
why we use the torch because we used a
little<00:01:23.060> bit<00:01:23.149> more<00:01:23.270> heat<00:01:23.750> than<00:01:23.990> what's

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
little bit more heat than what's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.459 
little bit more heat than what's
considered<00:01:24.560> normal<00:01:24.850> from<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:25.909> heat<00:01:26.090> gun<00:01:26.469> now

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
considered normal from a heat gun now

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.260 
considered normal from a heat gun now
you're<00:01:27.619> taking<00:01:27.799> this<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.850> you're<00:01:29.000> making

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
you're taking this and you're making

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.719 
you're taking this and you're making
sure<00:01:29.299> that<00:01:29.630> all<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.929> bubbles<00:01:30.259> are<00:01:30.469> out<00:01:30.729> and

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
sure that all the bubbles are out and

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.330 
sure that all the bubbles are out and
that<00:01:31.939> way<00:01:32.179> this<00:01:32.810> area<00:01:33.259> will<00:01:33.950> make<00:01:34.100> sure<00:01:34.280> to

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
that way this area will make sure to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.480 
that way this area will make sure to
stack<00:01:34.700> I'm<00:01:35.689> going<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.899> show<00:01:36.079> you<00:01:36.140> how<00:01:36.619> this
