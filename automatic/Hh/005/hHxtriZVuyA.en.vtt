00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
that's like a big thing I think I'm

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.250 
that's like a big thing I think I'm
almost<00:03:35.489> up<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.849> five<00:03:36.120> thousand<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:36.989> ten

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
almost up to five thousand so ten

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.680 
almost up to five thousand so ten
thousand<00:03:37.769> that's<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:38.040> big<00:03:38.700> number<00:03:39.299> but<00:03:39.480> I

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
thousand that's a big number but I

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.319 
thousand that's a big number but I
figured<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.769> know<00:03:40.859> it<00:03:41.069> why<00:03:41.370> not<00:03:41.549> strive<00:03:42.000> for

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
figured you know it why not strive for

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:51.410 
figured you know it why not strive for
higher<00:03:42.540> but<00:03:49.069> so<00:03:50.069> that<00:03:50.099> was<00:03:50.549> about<00:03:50.700> getting<00:03:51.150> to

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420
