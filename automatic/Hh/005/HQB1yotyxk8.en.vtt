00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.200
 and friend recite how are gentlemen I am 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.760
 brand bon and welcome to the review of 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.980
 a new very welcome to the appointment 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.540
 we are here in this beautiful world recites 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.760
 and what I 'm going to teach you today 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.080
 is these god 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.970
 ah 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.680
 He did not tell me how to tell true 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.070
 rasa good welcome to the appointment I'm going 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.050
 to teach how to do this little thing that 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.200
 called this mode is very interesting is 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.930
 a mountain that is not as complicated as 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.730
 like many others but it does its function or 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.410
 which is already a very good function and is a 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.790
 so I think it's worth it 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.890
 he teaches them rasa but welcome that 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.019
 this amount is called the wireless redstone 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.420
 ok for lovers of networks take 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.309
 now in this way for those who are not 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.290
 well because it's always a chaos 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.210
 how many others have not been put there 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.460
 I want you to know a little name goes 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.989
 they are putting this rest for two 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.970
 pinches sides until you reach and you want 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.260
 is that it opens I do not know a German house 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.909
 wikis that lights a light that is 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.500
 this house of the chinga exists to the capon 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.570
 Perez who could not turn on I need a 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.100
 chingo of subtracting a cable I need 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.309
 put this 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.689
 the repeaters so that the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.189
 tourist signals of all bug 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.600
 chaos 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.820
 I do not want that you may need 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.740
 loans one of these is called saving 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.649
 this does not give you two things gives you what 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.170
 it's been a transmitter 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.530
 wireless transmit that is a transmitter 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.119
 from the reston wirelessly ok 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.190
 What do you think of yourself in the following way? 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.119
 this meeting of 'iron develops it 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.970
 with rest of a candle is the krafft eo 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.190
 It is normal do not say that nor 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.310
 Do not take advantage of it or let it fall 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.020
 slowly do not be at all good with this 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.569
 is the transmitter and with this you do the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.220
 Hall that can not be a stage 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.569
 had turned upside down be it like the 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.789
 received to the lever and the 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.890
 transmitter is the one of the remaining 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.810
 but when he presses here and so I 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.380
 who fucking today not to say this 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.270
 As is ok as is every thing that Peruvian 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.190
 is the idea was the only thing that changes the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.899
 character is the lever not then 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.619
 good the capÃ³n to see explain me explain me 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.180
 what but with what you sell or what 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.400
 this plaintiffs is done but we are going to 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.470
 take some 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.720
 some things around here so that you 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.000
 see this and let's see what is the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.710
 theory within the myth that stop 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.200
 put this in peace and well we are in 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.740
 peaceful how good is the transmitter ok 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.740
 of the candle remember this transmitter 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.540
 is what is going to make this active 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.110
 our resident who is going to send the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.330
 signal here is the one that will send the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.660
 signal in the end to this which is the 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.150
 receiver let's put it by ok see 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.620
 then it's very simple let's put 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.790
 this here for you to see how it 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.459
 activate 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.250
 you want me to pour you the milk oil 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.079
 or the oil my dear cow you remove from 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.049
 hungry 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.790
 well that's this I saw well saying that 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.129
 everything is a lever and what it does 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.780
 well let's activate with this active 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.849
 of this products to capon but what hair 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.569
 and so I want another system and I want 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.269
 put another 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.950
 another another different transmitter that is 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.719
 with which I have to do what I 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.700
 I want good for our fortune 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.049
 gentlemen this can be set you 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.999
 have seen have been present in you 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.590
 faces that we use once a 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:15.749
 wireless transmitter that comes in a 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.499
 engine that is called advance reston or something 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.810
 A) Yes 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:20.069
 this or some bullshit so good if 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.540
 you give him right click on the 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.969
 block they will see that they can configure 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.159
 very many frequencies shown in this 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.349
 they bring so that you configure frequencies 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.239
 this so that things arrive 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.249
 wireless from one place to another 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.659
 the same brings this then you by means 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.639
 the frequent ones like the portals that 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.680
 they use in motorland and you average the 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.049
 frequencies you can make it arrive 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.840
 a signal to one or another for example here 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.510
 if I put the frequency 1 and here you 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.079
 I put frequency 1 ok 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.359
 this because good but if it is still 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.819
 at zero for example and it is at zero and 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.639
 here what I'm going to give you is going to give 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.739
 power to these two ok but if this one what 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.780
 change here I put one you are not going to 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.500
 give energy this if I explain what 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.360
 suppose that we are going to put 2 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.330
 then this we can change it 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.890
 we put 1 ok we turn it off and well if you 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.010
 we put one no longer is going to light 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.080
 that has frequency 1 if this one what 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.150
 We pay and order they carry intruder 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.919
 we put 2 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.560
 is going to learn the one that has the 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.139
 frequency 2 and good in this way is 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.810
 how is it that you can do something 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.039
 something simple reston da in all 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:34.340
 directions ok and it's not necessary do not be 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.470
 after putting other things uncle ok 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.600
 the truth is that is quite simple 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.139
 but as I said, this is pretty 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.930
 functional 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:46.319
 many times you do not know what 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.749
 with the network is a and you know that this is that 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.060
 I do not want to put repeaters or I do not know or 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:53.040
 the distances things from those do not we 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.550
 allow 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.950
 give him everything and then he does not 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.500
 I know it's worth mother we can not 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.850
 then racist really put the 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.440
 world is very simple is very easy 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.140
 learn before they have one thing that they 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.910
 called to control or something like that and this 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.410
 and this thing what it does is control the 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.110
 direction in which the ton networks 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.150
 but hey they do not bring it anymore 322 and 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.440
 I think it's pretty pretty useful reza 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.450
 I do not know if they want to put it in their 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.670
 pay or whatever I think it's a 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.230
 good bunch very simple easy to use and 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.900
 that solves many things then 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.160
 here for example I what I did that 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.530
 you also in mind is already 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.900
 notice the distance that comes the truth 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.820
 I think it has a limit of 64 frames 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.870
 but to me in the distance that arrives 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:39.210
 from there to here ok to be able to 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.560
 increase a rocket uncle can only be 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.120
 A) Yes 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.560
 I can not make us leave 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.020
 hardware on the drawers 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.120
 to egg and then something is something 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.950
 relatively simple simple and easy to 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.120
 use do not have a complication for 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.710
 those who like to build do not 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.419
 get in trouble or good with this 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.040
 this is a solution for your 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.750
 constructions who go and for example 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.580
 if they want to open a door of their 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.130
 you know they can put the 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.440
 lever in your room and open it from 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.730
 from your bed but good recite I am 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.750
 bad capon is what he liked this 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:14.150
 review and see you 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:19.400
 chivas that I can beat you let's go to andrew 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.400
 Lord today is to enjoy anything
