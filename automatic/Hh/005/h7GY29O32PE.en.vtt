so just need one egg and about less than

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.320 
so just need one egg and about less than
half<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.130> cup<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.340> butter<00:00:17.060> then<00:00:18.060> you're<00:00:18.180> just

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
half a cup of butter then you're just

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.640 
half a cup of butter then you're just
going<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.480> cut<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.750> up<00:00:18.810> into<00:00:18.990> pieces<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.410> put

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
going to cut it up into pieces and put

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.519 
going to cut it up into pieces and put
it<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> bowl<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.029> will<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:22.050> softer

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
it to a bowl so that it will be softer

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.240 
it to a bowl so that it will be softer
faster<00:00:23.449> and<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.630> waited<00:00:24.930> about<00:00:25.380> half<00:00:26.039> an<00:00:26.160> hour

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
faster and I waited about half an hour

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.839 
faster and I waited about half an hour
so<00:00:27.740> then<00:00:28.740> whenever<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.279> soft<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.730> add

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
so then whenever it's soft you can add

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.330 
so then whenever it's soft you can add
half<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.179> cup<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.359> cornstarch<00:00:30.890> 1<00:00:31.890> teaspoon<00:00:32.250> of

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
then you can need a rolling a circular

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.660 
then you can need a rolling a circular
cookie<00:02:59.170> cutter<00:02:59.500> but<00:02:59.739> I<00:02:59.799> didn't<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.310> just<00:03:00.519> use

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
cookie cutter but I didn't so I just use

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.699 
cookie cutter but I didn't so I just use

a little container and then a smaller

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.430 
a little container and then a smaller
circle<00:03:03.639> so<00:03:03.849> I<00:03:03.910> used<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.239> cap<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:05.079> toothpick

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
circle so I used a cap and a toothpick

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.229 
circle so I used a cap and a toothpick
so<00:03:06.069> you're<00:03:06.160> going<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.310> set<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.519> oven<00:03:06.609> to<00:03:07.000> 325

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
so you're going to set the oven to 325

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.339 
so you're going to set the oven to 325
and<00:03:10.239> then<00:03:10.389> you're<00:03:10.599> gonna<00:03:10.690> take<00:03:10.930> out<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.169> dough

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
and then you're gonna take out the dough

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.930 
and then you're gonna take out the dough

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.720 
and then using the smaller circle
YouTube<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.900> smaller<00:03:32.290> part<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:33.070> don't<00:03:33.610> push

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.470 
cut the dough we just want to make an
indent<00:03:38.040> then<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.190> took<00:03:39.520> off<00:03:39.670> all<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.850> extra

indent then a took off all the extra
dough<00:03:40.600> and<00:03:41.020> I<00:03:41.080> put<00:03:41.260> them<00:03:41.380> aside<00:03:41.500> so<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.920> could<00:03:42.100> be

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
dough and I put them aside so I could be

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.070 
dough and I put them aside so I could be
roll<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.580> and<00:03:42.700> make<00:03:42.850> more<00:03:48.690> then<00:03:49.690> using<00:03:49.990> the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
roll it and make more then using the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.520 
roll it and make more then using the
toothpick<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.980> poked<00:03:51.670> four<00:03:52.090> holes<00:03:52.420> like<00:03:53.320> a

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
toothpick I poked four holes like a

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:06.150 
toothpick I poked four holes like a
button<00:03:53.740> usually<00:03:54.100> has

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.470 

then<00:04:07.160> I<00:04:07.250> put<00:04:07.400> them<00:04:07.490> on<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.730> baking<00:04:08.060> sheet<00:04:08.090> you

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
then I put them on the baking sheet you

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.730 
then I put them on the baking sheet you
can<00:04:08.600> put<00:04:08.750> them<00:04:08.900> pretty<00:04:09.140> close<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:09.500> each<00:04:09.560> other

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
can put them pretty close to each other

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.140 
can put them pretty close to each other
because<00:04:09.950> we<00:04:10.190> don't<00:04:10.340> spread<00:04:10.670> our<00:04:10.820> grow<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:14.120> I

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
because we don't spread our grow so I

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.640 
because we don't spread our grow so I
went<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.540> rolled<00:04:14.750> out<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:15.020> rest<00:04:15.200> and<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.470> put

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
went and I rolled out the rest and I put

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:32.920 
went and I rolled out the rest and I put
them<00:04:15.740> all<00:04:15.890> on<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:19.250> put<00:04:19.670> them<00:04:19.820> in<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.030> oven<00:04:31.930> and

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970
