00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.020 
loved and then the French kiss so much
it<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.049> good<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.280> wasn't<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.729> good<00:01:41.970> I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it just so good so this wasn't as good I

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.130 
it just so good so this wasn't as good I
actually<00:01:42.210> liked<00:01:42.540> them<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> order<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
actually liked them in the order that

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.899 
actually liked them in the order that
she<00:01:43.259> wrote<00:01:43.560> them<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.460> French<00:01:44.670> kiss

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
she wrote them so and in the French kiss

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.539 
she wrote them so and in the French kiss
obviously<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.320> number<00:01:46.590> one<00:01:46.829> space<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
obviously in the number one space and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.190 
obviously in the number one space and
then<00:01:48.060> alone<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.659> boy<00:01:48.780> next<00:01:48.960> door

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
then alone the boy next door

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.380 
then alone the boy next door
and<00:01:49.409> then<00:01:49.590> Isla<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.520> happily<00:01:50.579> ever<00:01:51.000> after

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
and then Isla and the happily ever after

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.090 
and then Isla and the happily ever after
but<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.720> was<00:01:51.899> definitely<00:01:52.079> still<00:01:52.799> worth<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
but this was definitely still worth the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.800 
but this was definitely still worth the
read<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.729> if<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.060> liked<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.420> first<00:01:54.450> two

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
read and if you liked the first two

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.260 
read and if you liked the first two
books<00:01:55.049> definitely<00:01:56.040> read<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.729> book<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.090> next

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270

books definitely read this book the next
two<00:01:57.390> books<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.659> don't<00:01:57.840> actually<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.409> me

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
blue envelopes by Maureen Johnson I

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.350 
blue envelopes by Maureen Johnson I
listened<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.649> as<00:02:04.860> an<00:02:05.310> audiobook<00:02:05.700> when<00:02:06.119> we

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
listened to this as an audiobook when we

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.150 
listened to this as an audiobook when we
were<00:02:06.509> driving<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.110> New<00:02:07.350> Orleans

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
were driving to New Orleans

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.880 
were driving to New Orleans
and<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.550> got<00:02:08.910> really<00:02:09.510> really<00:02:09.990> bored<00:02:10.440> listening

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
and I got really really bored listening

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.040 
and I got really really bored listening
to<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.430> actually<00:02:11.580> fell<00:02:11.910> asleep<00:02:12.330> listening

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
to it I actually fell asleep listening

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.030 
to it I actually fell asleep listening
to<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.690> didn't<00:02:16.290> listen<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.560> all<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
to it so I I didn't listen to all the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.190 
to it so I I didn't listen to all the
audiobook<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.760> really<00:02:18.180> enjoyed<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.750> beginning

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
audiobook I really enjoyed the beginning

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.590 
audiobook I really enjoyed the beginning
of<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.410> book<00:02:19.620> but<00:02:20.220> then<00:02:20.520> she<00:02:20.850> got<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.180> Paris

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
of the book but then she got to Paris

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.300 
of the book but then she got to Paris
and<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.410> just<00:02:22.590> thought<00:02:22.710> that<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.950> book<00:02:23.130> should

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
and I just thought that the book should

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.570 
and I just thought that the book should
end<00:02:23.520> right<00:02:23.640> there<00:02:23.850> but<00:02:24.060> no<00:02:24.270> there<00:02:24.630> were<00:02:24.750> like

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
end right there but no there were like

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.460 
end right there but no there were like
3,000<00:02:26.580> more<00:02:26.940> countries<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.840> she<00:02:28.020> traveled

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
3,000 more countries that she traveled

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.230 
3,000 more countries that she traveled
to<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.310> just<00:02:29.340> felt<00:02:29.700> like<00:02:29.790> they<00:02:29.970> were

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
to and I just felt like they were

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.180 
to and I just felt like they were
superfluous<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:31.380> they<00:02:31.530> didn't<00:02:31.980> really<00:02:32.100> have

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
superfluous like they didn't really have

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.150 
superfluous like they didn't really have
any<00:02:32.900> purpose<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.170> was<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.680> really<00:02:34.860> bored

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
any purpose I was just really bored

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.590 
any purpose I was just really bored

thrilling and there was always that

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.490 
thrilling and there was always that
sliver<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.120> doubt<00:03:48.390> if<00:03:48.660> she<00:03:48.810> would<00:03:48.930> actually

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
sliver of doubt if she would actually

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.010

the<00:04:45.290> video<00:04:45.410> where<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.710> talk<00:04:45.919> about<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.250> down

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
the video where I talk about it down

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.120 
the video where I talk about it down
