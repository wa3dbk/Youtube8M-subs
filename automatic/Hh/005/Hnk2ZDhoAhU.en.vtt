I'm sure you've all had a pair of
headphones<00:00:04.130> that's<00:00:04.549> stopped<00:00:05.000> working

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:05.359 
headphones that's stopped working

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:06.789 
headphones that's stopped working
because<00:00:05.450> the<00:00:05.720> wiring<00:00:05.990> at<00:00:06.229> the<00:00:06.319> jack<00:00:06.499> just

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
because the wiring at the jack just

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.339 
because the wiring at the jack just
starts<00:00:07.339> to<00:00:07.430> fall<00:00:07.580> apart<00:00:07.609> on<00:00:07.939> you<00:00:07.999> and<00:00:08.349> these

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.349 
starts to fall apart on you and these

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.920 
starts to fall apart on you and these
are<00:00:09.500> a<00:00:09.530> pair<00:00:09.740> of<00:00:09.770> cost<00:00:10.130> kcs<00:00:10.670> 75<00:00:11.300> s<00:00:11.480> is<00:00:11.600> still<00:00:11.840> an

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:11.930 
are a pair of cost kcs 75 s is still an

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.780 
are a pair of cost kcs 75 s is still an
excellent<00:00:12.170> sound<00:00:12.530> quality<00:00:12.860> so<00:00:12.890> it<00:00:13.640> just

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
excellent sound quality so it just

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.800 
excellent sound quality so it just
seemed<00:00:13.880> like<00:00:14.030> a<00:00:14.060> waste<00:00:14.270> to<00:00:14.420> throw<00:00:14.450> them<00:00:14.750> out

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:14.810 
seemed like a waste to throw them out

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.410 
seemed like a waste to throw them out
because<00:00:15.460> sound<00:00:16.460> on<00:00:16.580> the<00:00:16.699> left<00:00:16.880> worn<00:00:17.269> just

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
because sound on the left worn just

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.510 
because sound on the left worn just
totally<00:00:17.990> stopped<00:00:18.200> working<00:00:18.500> on<00:00:18.590> me<00:00:18.740> one<00:00:19.370> time

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
totally stopped working on me one time

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.070 
totally stopped working on me one time
when<00:00:19.580> I<00:00:19.700> was<00:00:19.789> running<00:00:19.970> so<00:00:20.570> I<00:00:20.600> thought<00:00:20.960> it'd<00:00:21.050> be

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
when I was running so I thought it'd be

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.720 
when I was running so I thought it'd be
cool<00:00:21.260> if<00:00:21.440> I<00:00:21.530> gave<00:00:21.680> these<00:00:21.860> a<00:00:21.890> totally<00:00:22.369> new<00:00:22.520> look

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
cool if I gave these a totally new look

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.000 
cool if I gave these a totally new look
and<00:00:22.910> redid<00:00:23.420> the<00:00:23.480> wiring<00:00:23.840> because<00:00:24.590> I've<00:00:24.860> never

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
and redid the wiring because I've never

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.260 
and redid the wiring because I've never
liked<00:00:25.190> the<00:00:25.250> wire<00:00:25.400> in<00:00:25.550> these<00:00:25.670> things<00:00:25.850> as<00:00:26.090> you

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
liked the wire in these things as you

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.800 
liked the wire in these things as you
can<00:00:26.390> see<00:00:26.539> it's<00:00:26.690> very<00:00:26.770> just<00:00:27.770> stiff<00:00:28.430> and<00:00:28.580> rigid

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
can see it's very just stiff and rigid

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.380 
can see it's very just stiff and rigid
I<00:00:29.869> like<00:00:30.350> headphone<00:00:31.220> wires<00:00:31.369> it<00:00:31.699> just<00:00:31.850> a<00:00:32.029> little

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
I like headphone wires it just a little

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.290 
I like headphone wires it just a little
more<00:00:32.509> flexible<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.820> anyways<00:00:34.820> what<00:00:35.060> I'm<00:00:35.180> going

there<00:01:39.979> are<00:01:40.070> three<00:01:40.400> metal<00:01:41.060> bands<00:01:41.240> here<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.869> top

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
there are three metal bands here the top

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.109 
there are three metal bands here the top
on<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.320> largest<00:01:42.560> one<00:01:42.799> is<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:43.040> common<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.490> it

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
on the largest one is the common and it

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.210 
on the largest one is the common and it
goes<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:44.450> both<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.869> right<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.350> left<00:01:45.560> speaker

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
goes to both the right and left speaker

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.819 
goes to both the right and left speaker
of<00:01:46.430> your<00:01:46.610> headphones<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.780> middle<00:01:48.409> one<00:01:48.560> is<00:01:48.590> the

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
of your headphones the middle one is the

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.710 
of your headphones the middle one is the
right-hand<00:01:49.189> band<00:01:49.850> it<00:01:50.180> only<00:01:50.299> goes<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
right-hand band it only goes to the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.630 
right-hand band it only goes to the
right-hand<00:01:51.079> speaker<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.310> bottom<00:01:52.549> was

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
right-hand speaker and the bottom was

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.980 
right-hand speaker and the bottom was
the<00:01:52.670> left-hand<00:01:53.090> band<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.479> only<00:01:53.630> goes<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.960> the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
the left-hand band it only goes to the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.899 
the left-hand band it only goes to the
left-hand<00:01:54.320> speaker<00:01:54.770> on<00:01:55.189> an<00:01:55.340> actual<00:01:55.640> pair<00:01:55.820> of

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
left-hand speaker on an actual pair of

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.179 
left-hand speaker on an actual pair of
drivers<00:01:56.270> you'll<00:01:56.540> notice<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:56.930> both<00:01:57.740> my<00:01:57.950> left

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
drivers you'll notice that both my left

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.710 
drivers you'll notice that both my left
hand<00:01:58.399> tabs<00:01:58.610> have<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.060> same<00:01:59.240> color<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.570> copper

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
hand tabs have the same color of copper

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.600 
hand tabs have the same color of copper
wire<00:02:00.020> going<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.439> them<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:01.189> means<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.490> these

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
wire going to them that means that these

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.950 
wire going to them that means that these
are<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.909> common<00:02:02.240> tabs<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.750> they're<00:02:02.869> actually

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
are the common tabs and they're actually

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.810 
are the common tabs and they're actually
joined<00:02:03.259> together<00:02:03.380> further<00:02:03.740> down<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.549> cord

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
joined together further down the cord

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.389 
joined together further down the cord
and<00:02:05.060> then<00:02:05.390> both<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.110> my<00:02:06.350> right<00:02:06.680> hand<00:02:06.710> tabs<00:02:07.100> are

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
and then both of my right hand tabs are

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.639 
and then both of my right hand tabs are
the<00:02:08.269> sort<00:02:08.599> of<00:02:08.659> the<00:02:08.780> unique<00:02:09.049> left<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:09.499> right

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
the sort of the unique left and right

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.670 
the sort of the unique left and right
hand<00:02:09.969> wires<00:02:10.969> so<00:02:11.419> in<00:02:12.019> other<00:02:12.139> words<00:02:12.379> the<00:02:12.529> two

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
hand wires so in other words the two

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.730 
hand wires so in other words the two
bottom<00:02:13.010> metal<00:02:13.999> bands<00:02:14.359> on

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
bottom metal bands on

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.040 
bottom metal bands on
headphone<00:02:15.010> jack<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.000> should<00:02:16.540> just<00:02:16.660> make<00:02:16.990> a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
headphone jack so you should just make a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.440 
headphone jack so you should just make a
note<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.530> which<00:02:18.100> tabs<00:02:18.400> or<00:02:18.580> common<00:02:18.880> tabs<00:02:19.090> that's

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
note of which tabs or common tabs that's

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.700 
note of which tabs or common tabs that's
all<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.720> need<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.930> really<00:02:20.110> remember<00:02:20.470> with

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
all you need to really remember with

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.370 
all you need to really remember with
your<00:02:21.060> headphone<00:02:22.060> jack<00:02:22.090> take<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.960> multimeter

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
your headphone jack take a multimeter

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.380 
your headphone jack take a multimeter
and<00:02:23.620> just<00:02:24.190> check<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.550> see<00:02:24.730> which<00:02:25.030> one<00:02:25.210> of<00:02:25.240> these

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
and just check to see which one of these

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.060 
and just check to see which one of these
soldering<00:02:25.810> tabs<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.350> connected<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.860> which

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
soldering tabs is connected to which

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:38.780 
soldering tabs is connected to which
band<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.960> then<00:02:28.960> you<00:02:28.990> should<00:02:29.110> be<00:02:29.260> good<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.470> go

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.550 

so<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.360> tore<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.689> wires<00:02:39.840> apart<00:02:40.019> so<00:02:40.409> they're

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
so I tore the wires apart so they're

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.289 
so I tore the wires apart so they're
just<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.010> these<00:02:41.129> individual<00:02:41.760> strands<00:02:42.180> and

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
just in these individual strands and

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.220 
just in these individual strands and
then<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.930> cut<00:02:43.140> two<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.349> them<00:02:43.500> down<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:45.019> 44<00:02:46.019> inches

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
then I cut two of them down to 44 inches

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.229 
then I cut two of them down to 44 inches
long<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.890> other<00:02:47.040> two<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.579> cut<00:02:47.879> down<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.209> a

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
long and the other two I cut down to a

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.569 
long and the other two I cut down to a
length<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.629> believe<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.959> was<00:02:49.049> around<00:02:49.579> would

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
length of I believe it was around would

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.369 
length of I believe it was around would
be<00:02:50.849> 56<00:02:51.360> inches<00:02:51.599> because<00:02:51.870> I'm<00:02:52.019> going<00:02:52.200> with<00:02:52.290> an

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
be 56 inches because I'm going with an

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.170 
be 56 inches because I'm going with an
asymmetrical<00:02:53.040> sort<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.610> around<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:53.970> neck

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
asymmetrical sort of around the neck

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.800 
asymmetrical sort of around the neck
wiring<00:02:55.170> design<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.299> two<00:02:57.420> red<00:02:57.599> ones

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
wiring design and so the two red ones

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.420 
wiring design and so the two red ones
will<00:02:58.200> be<00:02:58.379> my<00:02:58.500> common<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.099> way<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.250> don't<00:02:59.310> have

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
will be my common that way I don't have

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.680 
will be my common that way I don't have
to<00:02:59.549> worry<00:02:59.730> about<00:02:59.819> telling<00:03:00.090> them<00:03:00.239> apart<00:03:00.360> and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
to worry about telling them apart and

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.380 
to worry about telling them apart and
then<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.530> white<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:01.829> black<00:03:02.220> ones<00:03:02.519> will<00:03:03.209> go<00:03:03.299> to

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
then the white and black ones will go to

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.690 
then the white and black ones will go to
the<00:03:03.629> left<00:03:03.930> hand<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.530> right<00:03:04.590> hand<00:03:04.980> headphone

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
the left hand and right hand headphone

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.349 
the left hand and right hand headphone
so<00:03:06.510> yeah<00:03:07.200> that's<00:03:07.980> my<00:03:08.129> basic<00:03:08.549> wiring<00:03:08.849> setup<00:03:09.239> I

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
so yeah that's my basic wiring setup I

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.369 
so yeah that's my basic wiring setup I
think<00:03:09.599> I'm<00:03:09.659> just<00:03:09.750> going<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.989> try<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.230> twist

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
think I'm just going to try and twist

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.589 
think I'm just going to try and twist
them<00:03:10.590> together<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.269> then<00:03:12.269> I'll<00:03:12.359> have<00:03:12.480> them

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
them together and then I'll have them

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:22.540 
them together and then I'll have them
separate<00:03:13.079> up<00:03:13.440> here<00:03:14.000> about<00:03:15.000> 36<00:03:15.510> inches<00:03:15.750> up

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.000 

so<00:03:23.550> here's<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.060> finished<00:03:24.270> product<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:25.020> have<00:03:25.290> my

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
so here's the finished product I have my

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.590 
so here's the finished product I have my
wire<00:03:26.220> just<00:03:26.460> starts<00:03:26.670> at<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.850> end<00:03:26.970> here<00:03:27.120> goes

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
wire just starts at the end here goes

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.500 
wire just starts at the end here goes
off<00:03:27.750> about<00:03:28.020> 36<00:03:28.920> inches<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.910> branches<00:03:30.330> off

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
off about 36 inches and branches off

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.930 
off about 36 inches and branches off
with<00:03:30.720> an<00:03:30.840> 8<00:03:31.020> inch<00:03:31.200> branch<00:03:31.740> and<00:03:32.100> approximately

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
with an 8 inch branch and approximately

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.570 
with an 8 inch branch and approximately
20<00:03:33.570> inches<00:03:33.600> or<00:03:33.960> so<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.770> second<00:03:35.130> branch<00:03:35.310> so

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
20 inches or so the second branch so

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.760 
20 inches or so the second branch so
this<00:03:35.700> would<00:03:35.820> be<00:03:35.880> for<00:03:36.030> your<00:03:36.120> left<00:03:36.360> hand

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
this would be for your left hand

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.620 
this would be for your left hand
headphone<00:03:37.770> this<00:03:37.980> one<00:03:38.100> will<00:03:38.190> be<00:03:38.340> for<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.700> right

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
headphone this one will be for the right

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.540 
headphone this one will be for the right
hand<00:03:39.810> headphone<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.200> guess<00:03:40.410> just<00:03:41.220> before<00:03:41.520> I

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
hand headphone I guess just before I

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.890 
hand headphone I guess just before I
start<00:03:41.850> soldering<00:03:42.090> I'm<00:03:42.480> going<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.660> put<00:03:42.780> this

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
start soldering I'm going to put this

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.290 
start soldering I'm going to put this
plastic<00:03:43.380> mesh<00:03:43.740> over<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:43.980> wire<00:03:44.160> because<00:03:44.550> once

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
plastic mesh over the wire because once

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.880 
plastic mesh over the wire because once
I<00:03:45.480> solder<00:03:46.020> everything<00:03:46.380> up<00:03:46.500> it's<00:03:46.650> going<00:03:46.740> to<00:03:46.800> be

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
I solder everything up it's going to be

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.250 
I solder everything up it's going to be
literally<00:03:47.220> impossible<00:03:47.490> to<00:03:48.090> fit<00:03:49.020> the<00:03:49.110> mesh

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
literally impossible to fit the mesh

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.420 
literally impossible to fit the mesh
over<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.530> wire<00:03:49.740> because<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.070> won't<00:03:50.190> be<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.370> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
over the wire because it won't be in the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.980 
over the wire because it won't be in the
end<00:03:50.520> of<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.700> ends<00:03:50.910> of<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.090> wire<00:03:51.210> left<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:51.960> I

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
end of the ends of the wire left so I

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.870 
end of the ends of the wire left so I
found<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.350> easiest<00:03:52.380> way<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:52.830> insert<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.730> wire

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
found the easiest way to insert the wire

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.400 
found the easiest way to insert the wire
into<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.300> mesh<00:03:54.480> just<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.900> use<00:03:55.020> some<00:03:55.050> sort<00:03:55.320> of

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
into the mesh just to use some sort of

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.980 
into the mesh just to use some sort of
straw<00:03:56.160> or<00:03:56.520> just<00:03:56.700> plastic<00:03:57.180> or<00:03:57.360> wooden<00:03:57.630> stick

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
straw or just plastic or wooden stick

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.080 
straw or just plastic or wooden stick
like<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.440> tape<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.400> onto<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.670> wire<00:03:59.820> using

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
like this tape it onto the wire using

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.600 
like this tape it onto the wire using
some<00:04:00.420> electrical<00:04:01.050> tape<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.920> just<00:04:02.280> this

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
some electrical tape and just this

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.760 
some electrical tape and just this
should<00:04:02.850> feed<00:04:03.090> right<00:04:03.840> into<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.230> sleeve<00:04:04.440> pretty

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
should feed right into the sleeve pretty

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.310 
should feed right into the sleeve pretty
easily<00:04:05.600> there<00:04:06.600> we<00:04:06.690> go<00:04:06.780> just<00:04:06.930> like<00:04:07.080> that

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
easily there we go just like that

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.020 
easily there we go just like that
then<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:07.950> should<00:04:08.100> be<00:04:08.190> able<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.370> just<00:04:08.640> work<00:04:08.880> it

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
then you should be able to just work it

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:17.539 
then you should be able to just work it
along<00:04:09.120> like<00:04:09.770> so<00:04:15.769> what<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:16.830> also<00:04:16.980> did<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.310> same

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
along like so what I also did the same

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.400 
along like so what I also did the same
thing<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.910> be<00:04:18.060> two<00:04:18.239> shorter<00:04:18.750> ends<00:04:18.900> as<00:04:18.989> well<00:04:19.140> and

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
thing to be two shorter ends as well and

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.050 
thing to be two shorter ends as well and
on<00:04:19.739> my<00:04:19.890> cap<00:04:20.070> things<00:04:20.310> they're<00:04:20.519> really<00:04:20.700> fun<00:04:20.970> to

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
on my cap things they're really fun to

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.570 
on my cap things they're really fun to
play<00:04:21.150> with<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.770> so<00:04:22.770> now<00:04:22.890> as<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.070> had<00:04:23.220> three<00:04:23.490> of

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
play with and so now as I had three of

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.790 
play with and so now as I had three of
the<00:04:23.870> plastic<00:04:24.870> chunks<00:04:25.230> of<00:04:25.320> plastic<00:04:25.590> mesh

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
the plastic chunks of plastic mesh

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.230 
the plastic chunks of plastic mesh
joining<00:04:26.220> together<00:04:26.430> here<00:04:26.640> wrapped<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:27.210> with

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
joining together here wrapped it with

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.790 
joining together here wrapped it with
electrical<00:04:27.690> tape<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:27.990> I'm<00:04:28.080> going<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.320> trace

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
electrical tape and I'm going to trace

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.440 
electrical tape and I'm going to trace
it<00:04:28.950> with<00:04:29.370> some<00:04:29.580> my<00:04:29.730> heat<00:04:29.910> shrink<00:04:30.120> tubing<00:04:30.330> as

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
it with some my heat shrink tubing as

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:37.669 
it with some my heat shrink tubing as
well

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:37.679 

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:40.200 

so<00:04:38.679> I<00:04:38.710> slid<00:04:39.039> back<00:04:39.159> the<00:04:39.339> plastic<00:04:39.520> mesh<00:04:39.879> and<00:04:40.089> held

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
so I slid back the plastic mesh and held

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.730 
so I slid back the plastic mesh and held
it<00:04:40.330> in<00:04:40.389> place<00:04:40.569> with<00:04:40.809> some<00:04:40.839> electrical<00:04:41.679> tape

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
it in place with some electrical tape

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.799 
it in place with some electrical tape
for<00:04:42.039> now<00:04:42.129> and<00:04:42.369> I'm<00:04:43.149> also<00:04:43.300> going<00:04:43.449> to<00:04:43.539> slip<00:04:43.689> on

00:04:43.799 --> 00:04:43.809 
for now and I'm also going to slip on

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:45.600 
for now and I'm also going to slip on
some<00:04:44.050> four<00:04:44.379> millimeter<00:04:44.559> heat<00:04:45.189> shrink<00:04:45.399> tubing

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
some four millimeter heat shrink tubing

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.579 
some four millimeter heat shrink tubing
on<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:45.819> end<00:04:45.969> and<00:04:46.179> I'll<00:04:46.990> deal<00:04:47.169> with<00:04:47.199> this<00:04:47.409> stuff

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:47.589 
on the end and I'll deal with this stuff

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:48.119 
on the end and I'll deal with this stuff
later<00:04:47.709> on

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
later on

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.219 
later on
I've<00:04:48.759> also<00:04:49.179> stripped<00:04:49.719> and<00:04:49.869> tinned<00:04:50.020> about

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
I've also stripped and tinned about

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.689 
I've also stripped and tinned about
three<00:04:50.409> millimeters<00:04:50.889> of<00:04:51.069> the<00:04:51.279> wires<00:04:51.459> at<00:04:51.669> the

back together I'm just going to trim off
the<00:05:20.540> excess<00:05:21.130> plastic<00:05:22.130> mesh<00:05:22.340> here<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:22.790> then

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
the excess plastic mesh here and then

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.760 
the excess plastic mesh here and then
use<00:05:23.420> that<00:05:23.600> BC<00:05:23.900> heat<00:05:24.020> shrink<00:05:24.200> tubing<00:05:24.470> to<00:05:24.590> just

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
use that BC heat shrink tubing to just

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:36.549 
use that BC heat shrink tubing to just
hold<00:05:25.010> it<00:05:25.130> in<00:05:25.190> place

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:36.559 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:38.689 

so<00:05:37.559> I<00:05:37.619> put<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:37.889> back<00:05:37.949> together<00:05:38.159> and<00:05:38.339> it<00:05:38.520> looks

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
so I put it back together and it looks

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:39.919 
so I put it back together and it looks
pretty<00:05:38.939> good<00:05:39.059> out<00:05:39.210> but<00:05:39.569> the<00:05:39.659> heat<00:05:39.809> shrink

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:39.929 
pretty good out but the heat shrink

00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:42.409 
pretty good out but the heat shrink
tubing<00:05:40.229> on<00:05:40.349> there<00:05:40.499> and<00:05:40.699> yeah<00:05:41.699> I<00:05:41.909> also<00:05:42.089> did<00:05:42.330> the

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
tubing on there and yeah I also did the

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.850 
tubing on there and yeah I also did the
same<00:05:42.719> thing<00:05:42.899> to<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.139> other<00:05:43.169> one<00:05:43.409> as<00:05:43.499> well

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
same thing to the other one as well

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.879 
same thing to the other one as well
so<00:05:44.699> yeah<00:05:45.149> with<00:05:45.539> that<00:05:45.689> it's<00:05:45.929> on<00:05:46.199> to<00:05:46.349> the<00:05:46.379> jack

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
so yeah with that it's on to the jack

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.169 
so yeah with that it's on to the jack
so<00:05:47.129> just<00:05:47.339> like<00:05:47.429> with<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.639> headphone<00:05:47.939> part

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:48.179 
so just like with the headphone part

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:49.879 
so just like with the headphone part
I've<00:05:48.389> taped<00:05:48.839> back<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.199> plastic<00:05:49.559> mesh<00:05:49.709> with

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
I've taped back the plastic mesh with

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.379 
I've taped back the plastic mesh with
some<00:05:50.039> electrical<00:05:50.849> tape<00:05:50.909> and<00:05:51.179> I've<00:05:51.240> also

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
some electrical tape and I've also

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:52.159 
some electrical tape and I've also
stripped<00:05:51.719> and<00:05:51.869> tinned

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
stripped and tinned

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.109
