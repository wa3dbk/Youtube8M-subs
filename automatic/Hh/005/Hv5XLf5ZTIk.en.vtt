00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.740 
Maryland zone 7 it's a mild climate even
though<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:47.969> get<00:00:48.120> freeze<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.079> frost<00:00:50.449> it's<00:00:51.449> mild

though we get freeze and frost it's mild
enough<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.320> if<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.500> were<00:00:52.590> up<00:00:52.770> north<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
enough to do it if you were up north you

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.160 
enough to do it if you were up north you
probably<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> go<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.360> Hartnett<00:00:54.870> garlic

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
probably have to go with Hartnett garlic

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.840 
probably have to go with Hartnett garlic
I've<00:00:55.289> never<00:00:55.500> grown<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:55.890> before<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.760> have

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
I've never grown up before so you have

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.330 
I've never grown up before so you have
to<00:00:56.969> check<00:00:57.149> out<00:00:57.270> another<00:00:57.510> video<00:00:57.949> garlic<00:00:58.949> really

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to check out another video garlic really

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.760 
to check out another video garlic really
wants<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.879> get<00:01:00.059> growing<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.780> March<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.559> then

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
wants to get growing in March and then

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.380 
wants to get growing in March and then
you<00:01:01.859> pick<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.160> sometime<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.730> mid-june<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
you pick it sometime in mid-june and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.359 
you pick it sometime in mid-june and
again<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.930> said<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.350> Maryland<00:01:04.500> zone<00:01:04.920> 7

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
again like I said I'm in Maryland zone 7

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.670 
again like I said I'm in Maryland zone 7
first<00:01:06.180> key<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.600> let's<00:01:06.780> get<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.080> growing<00:01:07.380> inside

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
first key is let's get it growing inside

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.560 
first key is let's get it growing inside
and<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> second<00:01:09.000> step<00:01:09.119> would<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.330> just

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and then the second step would be just

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.080 
and then the second step would be just
getting<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.900> into<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> ground<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:11.090> know

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
getting it into the ground you know

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.840 
getting it into the ground you know
hopefully<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.810> couple<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.140> weeks<00:01:13.850> it's

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
hopefully in a couple of weeks it's

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.980 
hopefully in a couple of weeks it's
pretty<00:01:15.150> easy<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.600> set<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:17.299> these<00:01:18.299> containers

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
pretty easy to set up these containers

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.070 
pretty easy to set up these containers
are<00:01:19.290> about<00:01:19.979> 3<00:01:20.310> inch<00:01:20.430> containers<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.299> packed<00:01:21.810> in

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
are about 3 inch containers I packed in

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.649 
are about 3 inch containers I packed in
the<00:01:22.770> soil<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.340> about<00:01:23.549> an<00:01:23.700> inch<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.150> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
the soil to about an inch and that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.859 
the soil to about an inch and that
leaves<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.920> under<00:01:26.280> two<00:01:26.490> inches<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.720> use

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
leaves just under two inches you can use

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.929 
leaves just under two inches you can use
a<00:01:27.900> plastic<00:01:28.200> container<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.430> want<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.729> plant

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
a plastic container if you want to plant

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.560 
a plastic container if you want to plant
it<00:01:30.060> deeper<00:01:31.549> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> Styrofoam

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
it deeper you can go with a Styrofoam

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.330 
it deeper you can go with a Styrofoam
cup<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.259> about<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> four<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.009> half<00:01:35.040> inch

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
cup this is about a four and a half inch

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.149 
cup this is about a four and a half inch
Styrofoam<00:01:35.820> cup<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.450> think<00:01:36.920> maybe<00:01:37.920> at

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
Styrofoam cup this is I think maybe at

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.310 
Styrofoam cup this is I think maybe at
12<00:01:38.430> ounce<00:01:38.610> or<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> 16<00:01:39.240> ounce<00:01:39.390> cup<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.170> don't

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
12 ounce or a 16 ounce cup you don't

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.569 
12 ounce or a 16 ounce cup you don't
have<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.530> worry<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:40.799> much<00:01:41.009> about<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.549> just

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
