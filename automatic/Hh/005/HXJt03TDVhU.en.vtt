right<00:02:01.970> here's<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.270> answer<00:02:03.520> this<00:02:04.810> is<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.869> trap

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
right here's the answer this is a trap

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.320 
right here's the answer this is a trap
in<00:02:06.590> dirt<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:10.160> makes<00:02:10.310> in<00:02:10.519> this<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.850> used<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.180> be

in dirt it makes in this is used to be

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.800 
in dirt it makes in this is used to be
