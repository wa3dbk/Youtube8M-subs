00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:18.820 
about the performance we'll find it out
now<00:00:54.780> by<00:00:55.079> taking<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> look<00:00:55.739> at<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> benchmarks

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
so there you have it

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.010

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
temperatures but actually you can say it

temperatures but actually you can say it
runs<00:03:38.170> hotter<00:03:38.470> because<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.340> fan<00:03:39.670> speed<00:03:40.030> was<00:03:40.210> a

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
runs hotter because the fan speed was a

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.140 
runs hotter because the fan speed was a
lot<00:03:40.480> lower<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.110> therefore<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.340> card<00:03:42.640> itself

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
lot lower and therefore the card itself

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.170
