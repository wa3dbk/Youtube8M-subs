again<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.780> best<00:01:52.079> way<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
again this is the best way to do the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.230 
again this is the best way to do the
mission<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.520> how<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> play<00:01:54.060> it

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
again don't worry about her tilt or tilt

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.950 
again don't worry about her tilt or tilt
