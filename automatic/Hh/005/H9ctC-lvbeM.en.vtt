anywhere next we'll cover two capacities
on<00:01:08.810> this<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.230> I<00:01:09.290> say<00:01:09.440> it<00:01:09.500> capacities<00:01:10.130> because

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
on this and I say it capacities because

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.000 
on this and I say it capacities because
this<00:01:10.610> has<00:01:10.760> two<00:01:11.030> sizes<00:01:11.990> available<00:01:12.110> with<00:01:12.620> it<00:01:12.830> as

you see it right now the capacity is 9.5
cubic<00:01:15.950> feet<00:01:16.160> with<00:01:16.880> an<00:01:16.970> expansion<00:01:17.330> feature<00:01:17.750> you

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
cubic feet with an expansion feature you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.930 
cubic feet with an expansion feature you
can<00:01:18.110> actually<00:01:18.290> increase<00:01:18.979> that<00:01:19.010> up<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.400> 11<00:01:19.850> and

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
can actually increase that up to 11 and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.850 
can actually increase that up to 11 and
a<00:01:20.000> half<00:01:20.030> cubic<00:01:20.780> feet<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.470> we'll<00:01:21.590> show<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.740> how

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
a half cubic feet and we'll show you how

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.310 
a half cubic feet and we'll show you how
that's<00:01:22.100> done<00:01:22.310> next<00:01:22.760> to<00:01:23.420> expand<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.930> bag<00:01:24.110> you

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
that's done next to expand the bag you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.740 
that's done next to expand the bag you
have<00:01:24.440> to<00:01:24.530> use<00:01:25.040> its<00:01:25.280> zipper<00:01:25.760> right<00:01:25.940> here<00:01:26.000> it

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
have to use its zipper right here it

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.210 
have to use its zipper right here it
looks<00:01:27.020> like<00:01:27.170> this<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.410> a<00:01:27.440> zipper<00:01:27.680> for<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.950> top

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
looks like this is a zipper for a top

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.240 
looks like this is a zipper for a top
it's<00:01:28.760> actually<00:01:29.180> it's<00:01:29.330> not<00:01:29.510> this<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.530> zipper

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
it's actually it's not this is a zipper

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.830 
it's actually it's not this is a zipper
for<00:01:31.400> itself<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:31.910> don't<00:01:32.180> think<00:01:32.390> that<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.690> water

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
for itself so don't think that the water

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.999 
for itself so don't think that the water
is<00:01:32.960> going<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.140> come<00:01:33.200> through<00:01:33.470> here<00:01:33.530> because

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
is going to come through here because

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.499 
is going to come through here because
why<00:01:34.780> why<00:01:35.780> not<00:01:36.070> is<00:01:37.070> because<00:01:37.250> this<00:01:38.060> is<00:01:38.300> all

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
why why not is because this is all

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.420 
why why not is because this is all
sealed<00:01:38.840> still<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.500> outside<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.190> still

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
sealed still to the outside you still

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.660 
sealed still to the outside you still
water<00:01:40.640> cannot<00:01:40.910> get<00:01:41.090> on<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.330> inside<00:01:41.570> here<00:01:42.670> we

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
water cannot get on the inside here we

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.710 
water cannot get on the inside here we
used<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:43.910> do<00:01:44.030> that<00:01:44.180> zipper<00:01:44.360> all<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.600> way

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
used to do that zipper all the way

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.249 
used to do that zipper all the way
around<00:01:45.080> and<00:01:45.290> we<00:01:45.350> can<00:01:45.440> actually<00:01:45.619> pop<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.160> up<00:01:50.259> as

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
around and we can actually pop it up as

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.260 
around and we can actually pop it up as
you<00:01:51.440> can<00:01:51.590> see<00:01:51.740> here<00:01:51.950> again<00:01:51.979> try<00:01:52.610> approximately

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
you can see here again try approximately

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.510 
you can see here again try approximately
five<00:01:53.479> inches<00:01:53.530> of<00:01:54.530> expansion<00:01:55.160> right<00:01:55.310> there

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
five inches of expansion right there

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.940 
five inches of expansion right there
alone<00:01:55.780> there<00:01:56.780> now<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.020> have<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.200> capacity<00:01:57.770> up

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
alone there now you have a capacity up

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.120 
alone there now you have a capacity up
to<00:01:57.979> 11<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.490> half<00:01:58.520> cubic<00:01:58.910> foot<00:01:59.860> move<00:02:00.860> on<00:02:00.979> to

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
to 11 and a half cubic foot move on to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.560 
to 11 and a half cubic foot move on to
the<00:02:01.220> zipper<00:02:01.460> ves<00:02:01.610> on<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:01.880> inside<00:02:02.240> here<00:02:02.450> it

the zipper ves on the inside here it

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.940 
the zipper ves on the inside here it
actually<00:02:02.840> gets<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.440> inside<00:02:03.830> of<00:02:03.860> the
