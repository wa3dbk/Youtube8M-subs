00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.700
BUT WHEN WE LOOK MORE CLOSELY
AT THE BEHAVIORAL PHARMACOLOGY

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.360
OR THE BIOLOGY OF
ADDICTION, WE SEE

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.369
THAT THERE'S A BIOLOGICAL
ABNORMALITY TO IT.

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:11.380
NARRATOR: EXPERTS HAVE
LEARNED THAT ADDICTION

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.470
TO DRUGS OR ALCOHOL IS A
DISEASE THAT HAS GENETIC AS WELL

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.350
AS ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGERS.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.440
WE FOUND THAT A GENE INVOLVED
IN DOPAMINE METABOLISM

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.430
IS IMPORTANT.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.180
DOPAMINE IS THE BRAIN'S
PLEASURE CHEMICAL.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.560
IT'S WHAT MAKES YOU
FEEL GOOD IF YOU

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.010
HAVE A PLEASURABLE EXPERIENCE.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.710
AND FOR HIGH NOVELTY SEEKERS,
DOING SOMETHING NEW--

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.230
LIKE BUNGEE JUMPING OR
HAVING A NEW DRUG OR EVEN

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.660
A NEW SEXUAL PARTNER--
RELEASES DOPAMINE

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.310
AND MAKES PEOPLE FEEL GOOD.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.020
WHAT THIS GENE
DOES IS IT CONTROLS

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.900
HOW THE BRAIN
RESPONDS TO DOPAMINE.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.270
SO PEOPLE WITH ONE
VERSION OF THE GENE

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.990
DON'T GET MUCH OF A THRILL
FROM DOING SOMETHING NEW.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.040
THEY TEND TO BE LOW
NOVELTY SEEKERS.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.170
PEOPLE WITH A VERY SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE GENE

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.480
RESPOND MUCH MORE
POSITIVELY TO DOPAMINE,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.010
AND THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE LIKELY TO BE JUMPING OUT

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.615
OF AN AIRPLANE OR
TRYING A NEW DRUG.

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:03.120
THERE CLEARLY ARE GENETIC RISKS.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.120
PEOPLE DO DIFFER AS A
FUNCTION OF SOMETHING

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.630
THAT'S BEING TRANSMITTED
GENETICALLY FROM FAMILY

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.830
TO FAMILY.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.550
WHEN YOU LOOK AT CERTAIN
FAMILY COMPLEXES,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.940
YOU CAN SEE THESE
MULTI-GENERATIONAL,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.720
MULTI-AFFECTED FAMILIES
WHERE THE RISK IS JUST

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.930
SO HIGH FOR THE PEOPLE
BECOMING ALCOHOL OR DRUG USERS

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.100
OR ABUSERS.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.590
CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT
IN THE ALCOHOLISM AREA,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.466
CHILDREN OF ALCOHOLICS ARE
AT ABOUT A THREEFOLD RISK

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.110
OF BECOMING
ALCOHOLICS THEMSELVES,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.600
COMPARED TO CHILDREN
OF NON-ALCOHOLICS.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.490
AND APPROPRIATE
CONTROL STUDIES HAVE

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.150
BEEN DONE WITH
ADOPTEES AND WITH TWINS

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.050
TO INDICATE THAT
THIS IS A GENETICALLY

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.290
DETERMINED VULNERABILITY.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.860
THERE HAD BEEN VERY
ELEGANT STUDIES

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.640
SHOWING THAT, FOR
EXAMPLE, IF ONE

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.680
OF THE PAIR OF IDENTICAL
TWINS IS A CIGARETTE SMOKER,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.160
THE CO-TWIN IS MORE LIKELY
TO BE A HEAVY DRINKER.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.640
AND THAT SUGGESTED THAT
IT'S THE SAME GENES THAT

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.030
ARE INVOLVED IN SMOKING AND
ALCOHOL DRINKING JUST BEING

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.020
EXPRESSED DIFFERENTLY
IN DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.080
SO THIS CO-OCCURRENCE
MAY REPRESENT

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.550
A GENERAL VULNERABILITY
FACTOR THAT

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.780
MAY BE REFLECTED IN PERSONALITY
CHARACTERISTICS THAT

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.580
ARE GENETICALLY DETERMINED.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.360
PEOPLE WITH FAMILY
HISTORIES, PEOPLE

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.850
WITH CO-MORBID PSYCHIATRIC
DISORDERS, ARE AT HIGHER RISK.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.830
PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, ANOTHER
EMOTIONAL ILLNESS, DEPRESSION,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.920
ANXIETY, ARE HIGHLY
ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG USE.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.880
I'VE NEVER MET ANYBODY
WHO WAS ABUSING ANYTHING

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.016
THAT DOESN'T HAVE SOME SMALL
UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE.

00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:47.890
BECAUSE BEFORE YOU PICKED
UP THE FIRST DRINK,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.040
YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T FEEL
GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.840
BEFORE YOU TOOT IT OR EVEN
SMOKE THE FIRST CIGARETTE.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.461
LOW SELF-ESTEEMS TAKE YOU LOW.

00:02:57.461 --> 00:02:59.015
YOU DON'T FEEL GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF.

00:02:59.015 --> 00:03:00.120
YOU FEEL DIFFERENT.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.661
AND THAT'S ONE OF
THE CHARACTERISTICS

00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:06.790
OF MOST ADDICTS.
