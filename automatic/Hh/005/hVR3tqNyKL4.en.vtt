for Beauty Blender is different than
other<00:00:49.149> sponges<00:00:49.690> because<00:00:49.870> it<00:00:50.290> has<00:00:50.500> no<00:00:50.649> edges

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
other sponges because it has no edges

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.630 
other sponges because it has no edges
when<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.059> use<00:00:52.329> triangular<00:00:53.200> or<00:00:53.230> edged<00:00:53.710> sponges
