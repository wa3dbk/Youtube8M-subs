the amount of animations that Batman has
in<00:00:35.650> his<00:00:35.800> maneuvers<00:00:36.309> are<00:00:36.600> breathtaking<00:00:37.600> by

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
in his maneuvers are breathtaking by

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.150 
in his maneuvers are breathtaking by
comparison<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.410> first<00:00:38.620> game<00:00:38.830> it<00:00:39.010> really

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
comparison to the first game it really

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.950 
comparison to the first game it really
flows<00:00:39.730> together<00:00:40.000> well<00:00:40.420> it's<00:00:40.660> just<00:00:40.840> an

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
flows together well it's just an

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.410 
flows together well it's just an
exciting<00:00:41.230> fun<00:00:41.650> fun<00:00:42.340> game<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.580> play<00:00:42.699> it<00:00:43.180> feels

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
exciting fun fun game to play it feels

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.610 
exciting fun fun game to play it feels
much<00:00:43.570> more<00:00:43.720> alive<00:00:43.960> than<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.230> first<00:00:44.410> one<00:00:44.559> I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
much more alive than the first one I

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.100 
much more alive than the first one I
think<00:00:44.680> I<00:00:44.890> just<00:00:45.239> people<00:00:46.239> have<00:00:46.329> questioned

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
think I just people have questioned

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.060 
think I just people have questioned
whether<00:00:47.140> or<00:00:47.320> not<00:00:47.380> it's<00:00:47.500> gonna<00:00:47.590> be<00:00:47.710> like<00:00:47.829> linear

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
whether or not it's gonna be like linear

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.590 
whether or not it's gonna be like linear
gameplay<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.730> it's<00:00:49.000> kind<00:00:49.180> of<00:00:49.210> hard<00:00:49.360> to<00:00:49.390> say<00:00:49.570> at

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
gameplay and it's kind of hard to say at

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.630 
gameplay and it's kind of hard to say at
this<00:00:49.720> point<00:00:49.840> but<00:00:50.230> I<00:00:50.649> think<00:00:51.520> there's

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
this point but I think there's

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.340 
this point but I think there's
definitely<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:52.000> be<00:00:52.120> like<00:00:52.360> you<00:00:52.989> can<00:00:53.140> run<00:00:53.260> around

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
definitely to be like you can run around

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.410 
definitely to be like you can run around
and<00:00:53.530> do<00:00:53.649> stuff<00:00:53.860> oh<00:00:54.100> absolutely<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.120> the
