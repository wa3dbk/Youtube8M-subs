there<00:00:04.290> when<00:00:04.410> its<00:00:04.560> market<00:00:04.950> Earth<00:00:05.040> led<00:00:05.520> today

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
there when its market Earth led today

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.460 
there when its market Earth led today
we're<00:00:06.180> talking<00:00:06.420> about<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.930> brand<00:00:07.350> new

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
we're talking about a brand new

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.110 
we're talking about a brand new
technology<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:08.400> we're<00:00:08.520> starting<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.879> see<00:00:08.940> on

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
technology that we're starting to see on

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.660 
technology that we're starting to see on
a<00:00:09.210> couple<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.719> different<00:00:10.190> LED<00:00:11.190> bulbs<00:00:11.520> out

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
a couple of different LED bulbs out

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.620 
a couple of different LED bulbs out
there<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:13.050> color<00:00:13.650> temperature

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
there and it's a color temperature

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.330 
there and it's a color temperature
adjustment<00:00:15.630> as<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:16.470> dim<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.710> bulb<00:00:17.070> so

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
adjustment as you dim the bulb so

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.310 
adjustment as you dim the bulb so
currently<00:00:18.210> two<00:00:18.420> products<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:19.110> this

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
currently two products have this

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.130 
currently two products have this
technology<00:00:19.680> on<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> market<00:00:20.550> there's<00:00:20.849> the

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
technology on the market there's the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.120 
technology on the market there's the
philips<00:00:23.149> BR<00:00:24.149> 30<00:00:24.480> with<00:00:25.050> air<00:00:25.259> flux<00:00:25.529> technology

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
to show you how it works we have a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.710 
to show you how it works we have a

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
plugged in to the left side here and

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.170 
plugged in to the left side here and
watch<00:00:39.570> very<00:00:39.870> closely<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.040> LED<00:00:41.400> versus<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
watch very closely at the LED versus the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.380 
watch very closely at the LED versus the
incandescent<00:00:42.570> as<00:00:43.050> i<00:00:43.230> dim<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.620> bulbs

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.350 

as<00:00:49.930> you<00:00:50.140> can<00:00:50.260> see<00:00:50.530> unlike<00:00:50.770> most<00:00:51.489> other<00:00:51.760> LEDs<00:00:52.180> on

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
as you can see unlike most other LEDs on

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.650 
as you can see unlike most other LEDs on
the<00:00:52.450> market<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.829> LED<00:00:54.460> innovation<00:00:55.030> is

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
the market the LED innovation is

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.860 
the market the LED innovation is
starting<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.260> warm<00:00:56.739> as<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.460> dim<00:00:57.730> and<00:00:58.600> it's

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
starting to warm as I dim and it's

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.810 
starting to warm as I dim and it's
matching<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.710> condesa

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
matching the condesa

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.420 
matching the condesa
almost<00:01:01.120> exactly<00:01:04.050> even<00:01:05.050> as<00:01:05.170> we<00:01:05.290> go<00:01:05.410> very<00:01:05.680> low<00:01:05.979> in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
almost exactly even as we go very low in

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.510 
almost exactly even as we go very low in
the<00:01:06.550> dimming<00:01:06.880> range<00:01:07.030> it<00:01:08.020> gets<00:01:08.229> even<00:01:08.470> warmer<00:01:08.740> so

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
the dimming range it gets even warmer so

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.550 
the dimming range it gets even warmer so
it's<00:01:09.700> actually<00:01:09.850> dims<00:01:10.210> down<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.540> 2200<00:01:11.350> Kelvin

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
it's actually dims down to 2200 Kelvin

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:22.490 
it's actually dims down to 2200 Kelvin
as<00:01:11.979> we<00:01:12.400> dim<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.700> bowl

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.410 

just<00:01:23.500> like<00:01:23.649> most<00:01:23.799> LEDs<00:01:24.219> the<00:01:24.399> range<00:01:24.640> isn't<00:01:25.030> as

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
just like most LEDs the range isn't as

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.410 
just like most LEDs the range isn't as
great<00:01:25.630> as<00:01:25.930> a<00:01:26.259> standard<00:01:26.710> incandescent<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:28.090> you

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
great as a standard incandescent but you

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.029 
great as a standard incandescent but you
can<00:01:28.570> see<00:01:28.780> it's<00:01:28.930> warmed<00:01:29.200> quite<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.409> bit<00:01:29.649> as<00:01:29.860> we

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
can see it's warmed quite a bit as we

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.210 
can see it's warmed quite a bit as we
dimmed<00:01:30.220> it<00:01:30.369> down<00:01:31.470> I'll<00:01:32.470> plug<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:32.710> in<00:01:32.920> next<00:01:33.070> to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
dimmed it down I'll plug it in next to

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.240 
dimmed it down I'll plug it in next to
the<00:01:33.310> Philips<00:01:33.700> so<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:34.509> can<00:01:34.659> see<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.100> effect<00:01:36.100> on

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
the Philips so you can see the effect on

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:45.539 
the Philips so you can see the effect on
both<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.670> LED<00:01:36.909> bulbs<00:01:37.210> at<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.390> same<00:01:37.570> time

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.899 

oh<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:47.500> both<00:01:47.710> are<00:01:47.979> at<00:01:48.070> full<00:01:48.250> brightness<00:01:48.399> now

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
oh they both are at full brightness now

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.260 
oh they both are at full brightness now
the<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.899> Philips<00:01:50.200> is<00:01:50.320> an<00:01:50.439> 85<00:01:50.979> CRI<00:01:51.399> versus

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
daily innovation it's actually at 94 CRI

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.080 
daily innovation it's actually at 94 CRI
and<00:01:55.679> you'll<00:01:56.679> notice<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.070> as<00:01:57.219> we<00:01:57.399> dim<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:57.850> the

and you'll notice that as we dim it the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.459 
and you'll notice that as we dim it the
Phillip<00:01:58.450> starts<00:01:58.719> to<00:01:58.810> look<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.049> little<00:01:59.229> bit
