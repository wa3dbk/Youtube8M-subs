00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.340
 such friends but I still very well in this 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.950
 new video I'll show you how we're doing 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.200
 to repair the heating of our 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.640
 vehicle in this case can be a 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.500
 Form 950 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.779
 This what we are going to repair is going to 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.189
 be the steps of heating this 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:34.430
 this failure is very common these vans 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:38.250
 ford f-150 efe 250 350 expedition 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.809
 navigator let's show what the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.230
 it fails well here I will show you the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.620
 failure that presents this one being with the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.510
 open switch 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.790
 and we are going to turn on the manual heating 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.590
 that is on as we see is in the 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:57.060
 first step does not work 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.060
 the second step does not work 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.260
 until the third 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.260
 and the fourth step 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.040
 first and the second have no function 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.370
 some then we are going to do what they 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.020
 I'm going to show 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.390
 and there are going to be some vehicles in the 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.510
 that no step will work only 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.440
 the last one then we're going to review the 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.180
 resistance that I am going to comment 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.400
 next hortal I will show 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.040
 where is located good and then this 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.830
 the resistance is housed in the part of 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.440
 below I am going to show you 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.280
 so you can see it 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:41.270
 and they are watching him is that they have 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.040
 the two screws that let's proceed 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.290
 first to disconnect the plug and 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.080
 check that you have a current of 12 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.950
 good volts I have already disconnected this 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.140
 here we have 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.060
 plugged in must be with the switch open 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.799
 very open and heating on 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.840
 at any step and here we can be 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.490
 Seeing that 12 volts arrive 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.240
 these disappear when we 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.160
 we remove the heating 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.320
 as we can see there are 12 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.840
 volts present I'm going to review the 12 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.870
 volts really only have to 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.310
 do when the last one does not work 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.070
 step that does not work then 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.830
 you have to check that they are present 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.360
 the 12 volts if the 12 volts this one does not 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.420
 are present and it would be a matter of 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.280
 follow the diagram and see where it is going 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.320
 our line if it goes to a fuse or 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.370
 some relay and repair first that 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.960
 circuit 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.540
 me since we see that there are 12 volts 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.790
 present we are going to proceed to remove the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.680
 good resistance we have already removed the 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.540
 resistance here is how you can see it 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.180
 is the connector the two screws that 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.310
 show them and how can we see here 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.310
 clearly the problem is seen 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.349
 and nothing all rusty is by the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.280
 humidity for everything that everything 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.569
 enter this 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.930
 and here they look good 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.180
 this was the pin that 's sun and so 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.299
 and does not work steps 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.180
 our air conditioning is what 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.810
 We can replace with an expedition 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.909
 of higuey all of 150 as I told you 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.360
 they are all the same 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.520
 this 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.520
 it is not very difficult to make this little 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.350
 repair and he is to replace it 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.060
 I'm going to show you how our 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.590
 vehicle one friends and I'll show you 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.220
 how was our vehicle finally 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.220
 let's open the switch 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.670
 so you can listen 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.770
 appreciate but she works the first 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.800
 He passed 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.920
 second 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.700
 third 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.700
 quarter 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.480
 and this and all the steps to 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:11.570
 our heating this video was short 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.290
 in this I hope it will be useful and we 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.290
 We see you next time
