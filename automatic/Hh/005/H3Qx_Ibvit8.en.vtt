00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello everyone one more week I bring you 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.140
 this time a recipe that is not 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.600
 exactly a recipe because you can 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.390
 vary a lot it's about the recipe for 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.160
 make a perfume dissolving alcohol the 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.170
 problem with this recipe is that clear 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.060
 It depends a lot on the tastes of each one 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.800
 that I'm going to make an aroma depending on 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.600
 my tastes clear but that does not have 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.119
 why everyone likes it at the time 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.340
 to choose another type of aromas you have to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.529
 have a very good smell finding the aroma 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.600
 that goes with each one of course we can 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.630
 make a standard recipe for something that 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:38.220
 it smells good but perfume is a thing 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.020
 very personal I consider then I do not know 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.170
 it's just about doing something that smells good 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.309
 it's also about making a 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.950
 aroma with which we feel 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.719
 identified is my judgment there are people to 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.790
 which will suffice that it smells good 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.890
 Well, let's start 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.050
 we need alcohol of course that goes 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.989
 to be it's going to be maybe some hydro 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.390
 lato and essential oils or aromas 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.790
 that we want to use every I am going to do 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.449
 one 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.610
 a little exotic as you already know 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.090
 other videos I love the vanilla I 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.940
 made to all god to the aroma of vanilla and 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.390
 I'm going to combine it with essential oil 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.490
 sandalwood and patchouli and I'm going to use a 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.520
 Rose water to give a soft base 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.430
 for this I have here my little bottle of 30 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.010
 milliliters with sprayer we have to 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.090
 use alcohol or good the truth is that 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.550
 there are people who use vodka but alcohol 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.450
 about two thirds of the amount 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.450
 total that we want to do 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.579
 depends on the intensity of the oils 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.329
 essentials we will need more than one thing 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.369
 of other 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.860
 the recipe really is not a recipe 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.659
 because it is not can not be very precise 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.670
 worth this is more than anything a guide for 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.590
 that you learn to do it and you experience 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.649
 you until you find the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.479
 mix that works and that satisfies you 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.899
 but there is rose water but it does not 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.899
 I'm going to throw 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.939
 I'm going to use a term that always 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.700
 in the face of chefs and it is the measure 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.090
 of a trickle because we are going to take a 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.090
 trickle 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.959
 it is a very soft very sweet base and about 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.720
 this we are going to throw the oils 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.180
 essentials I will start 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.420
 with the vanilla that I want it to be the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.420
 dominant odor 30 drops 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.150
 in sandalwood and patchouli are aromas 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.400
 pretty strong then you have to take 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.400
 a little bit for five drops of sandalwood 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.379
 patchouli is extremely strong and 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.700
 I just want a little touch like that 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.700
 I'm going to take two drops 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.010
 we close shake well 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.400
 and we check how the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.400
 half 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.520
 I like it but I'm going to use a little 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.970
 more of the vanilla and I'll do 10 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.970
 drops more 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.040
 we shake well well well we check that 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.040
 we have stayed 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.660
 It's not about throwing me flowers but it has 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.720
 perfect 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.590
 first of all let's check the ph 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.590
 yes 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.090
 25 perfect well very well then now there 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.700
 have to keep it in the fridge for 24 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.439
 better it's 48 hours taking it out once in 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.689
 when to take away a little more and 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.459
 then there is the perfect to be able 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:45.640
 leave it together with our others 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.189
 cosmetic products hygiene and power 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.810
 use it every day, well, nothing else 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.730
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.150
 although good as I said is a 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.579
 tutorial a bit ambiguous because it depends 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.069
 100% of your nose and your 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.349
 likes to find the point when you 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.840
 two droplets of these two droplets are missing 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.239
 of that is not about removing him 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.400
 merit to the perfumer's profession by 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.200
 course but good to learn to 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.470
 make our all our products 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.180
 at home is a system that works 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.910
 perfectly almost takes me to effort 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.739
 it's very economical so you can see that the 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.750
 the vast majority is alcohol and I think two 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.610
 thirds of the substance is an alcohol 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.319
 I assure you that it does not smell like alcohol 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.419
 a basis for when we apply it 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:31.270
 the alcohol is vapor that remains 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.699
 impregnated to our skin for no smell 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.950
 to alcohol nothing else I hope you have 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.260
 enjoyed 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.050

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.270

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.950

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.220
 to keep making these videos and 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.760
