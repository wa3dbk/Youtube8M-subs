00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
you to change and then the action is

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.410 
you to change and then the action is
when<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.979> when<00:01:20.790> somebody's<00:01:21.210> pushing

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
when you have when somebody's pushing

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.630 
when you have when somebody's pushing
your<00:01:21.689> buttons<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.350> you've<00:01:22.860> reacted<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.549> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
your buttons and you've reacted in a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.350 
your buttons and you've reacted in a
certain<00:01:23.850> way<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.920> action<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.400> now<00:01:26.580> having

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
certain way the action is now having

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.660 
certain way the action is now having
it's<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.470> compilation<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> awareness

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
it's the compilation of the awareness

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.179 
it's the compilation of the awareness
and<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.450> acceptance<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.500> action<00:01:31.979> is

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
and the acceptance and now the action is

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.880 
and the acceptance and now the action is
making<00:01:33.180> new<00:01:33.360> decisions<00:01:33.900> making<00:01:34.320> new<00:01:34.560> choices

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
making new decisions making new choices

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.609 
making new decisions making new choices
so<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.720> had<00:01:37.020> combative

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
so if you have had combative

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.340 
so if you have had combative
relationships<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> past<00:01:38.840> then<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
relationships in the past then the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.050 
relationships in the past then the
important<00:01:40.799> step<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.340> change<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:44.060> perhaps

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
important step and change is to perhaps

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.990 
important step and change is to perhaps
it's<00:01:45.540> more<00:01:45.750> about<00:01:46.220> how<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.460> respond

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
it's more about how do you respond

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.450 
it's more about how do you respond
instead<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> react<00:01:49.110> how<00:01:49.890> do<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.040> take<00:01:50.310> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
instead of react how do you take that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.480 
instead of react how do you take that
moment<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:50.970> breathe<00:01:51.470> okay<00:01:52.470> take<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> moment<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
moment and breathe okay take a moment to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.359 
moment and breathe okay take a moment to
breathe<00:01:53.520> before<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.450> react<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.369> recognize

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
breathe before you react and recognize

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.730 
breathe before you react and recognize
that<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.299> about<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:58.469> not<00:01:58.710> a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that it's not about you it's not a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.620 
that it's not about you it's not a
judgment<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.939> about<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.450> other

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
judgment of you it's about the other

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.170 
judgment of you it's about the other
person<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.380> their<00:02:01.619> own<00:02:01.799> issues<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
person and their own issues so if you

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.020 
person and their own issues so if you

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
one okay it is but it's really about not

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460
