00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.200
 lashed out on the goal of Javier Klimowicz to make it worse 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.479
 the mega header 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.449
 I do not know 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.539
 emelec walls clung 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.349
 to be able to have a driver that opens the roads to reach the arc of 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.609
 klimowicz 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.609
 then you can pay 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.989
 disalvo klimowicz 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.460
 that ball without work 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.020
 what a great cover of klimowicz 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.300
 it was the first of his three notable interventions in the first half 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.810
 will prevail 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.810
 the idea is that it will hit later failures 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.680
 let's see the free throw of aguirre or another great stop of the account keeper 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.320
 what .. here 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.320
 where is klimowicz moored 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.320
 selina field 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.320
 how the figure of your team 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.790
 and he knows who I'm going to tell him 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.390
 Now that I remember 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.980
 a device 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.320
 world fini the bridge moved him 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.690
 Argentine archer coach 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.550
 go they have to support has what was complaining klimowicz and the archers 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.899
 because you have to put a professional so that 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.790
 already without a job different from the rest 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.540
 some users also stressed 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.270
 immaculate vitier ista and everyone is watching and living in 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.120
 Archer coach in both basin and sports league 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.870
 wants this to happen 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.870
 they are professionals were archer 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.080
 let's see the auction of vega 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 and another one from klimowicz 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.860
 that's how the first time was going 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.860
 Algeria is improvised 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.569
 tadeo vega but it was weak second time of the emelec 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.439
 no longer had the level of production the first part came by little and these 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:14.209
 things 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.260
 advanced and in that first shareholder of the half and in the second play equal 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:20.959
 and in the second flight 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.569
 sometimes one to be reviewed by tomorrow fellow dark-haired guy checking in 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.169
 london at home 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:28.989
 He also said that Murray can be 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.989
 denies that sir 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.799
 the comment 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.549
 that was the good interventions also from 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.549
 the Argentine cante leg that lacks soccer because this one 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.319
 also emelec could not 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.119
 against klimowicz and the defense of the basin that is 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.919
 the most solid room of the tournament has that in 14 matches 8 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.269
 tower defense and less beaten archer 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.039
 everyone against that you have to fight 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.539
 the skinny free kick here 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.539
 and the sensational flutter of javier 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.209
 and what it does for the finish line 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.349
 it's fantastic xavier queipo 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.349
 but impeccably to the ball 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:20.229
 this good analysis of the local scene 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.569
 for the other strike matches 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.879
 because the poor neighborhood the stick where the akaba activity is thrown 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.329
 another the intuition ability of the formell archer 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.419
 lowered from barbarian 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.829
 so he welcomed the date
