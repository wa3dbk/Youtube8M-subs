 we go to the external memory and what 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.180
 I have the files there, let's hope that 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.500
 load and we go in the part of 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.500
 down not because that's version 1 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.040
 we select and we give in yes 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.820
 let's hope that 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.330
 finish the whole process does not last more than 3 a 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.330
 4 minutes and as you see, you are already 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.960
 starting to install that is all the 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.460
 process there is not this aroma here for 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.840
 choose applications that we want nothing 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.539
 it's just the rom in a single file 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.620
 zip that is installed in this way not a little 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:44.350

 I'm installing it, I'm doing it 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.820

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.820
 same they can do it in a way 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.860
 correct and based on that I will work 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.919

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.500
 of clear captain's applications 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.990
 America, not the subject of the one that withdraws from 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:10.060
 a rom if experience 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:13.900

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.880
 the color keyboard the splashes of color 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.480
 and all that to save battery like 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.980
 you can see the process is over 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.570
 we simply give in return 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.570
 let's hart install sip 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.949
 external memory we look for the next 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:35.280
 file that is the fix fort s 6 for the 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:38.090
 gene 900 m as you can see there and 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.780
 We give in install, we hope it ends 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.210
 we come back and we give in reboot up 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.700
 and let's hope they catch the project 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.450
 lasts for 10 12 minutes undertake not to 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.510
 despair 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.250
 while leaving the samsung logo and the 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.470

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.710
 turning on and off 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.630
 the mobile will turn them will recommend 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.720
 if they do all the processes just as they 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.900
 indicated I will not have any good problem 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.190
 let's wait for him to pledge and we continue 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.190
 to the configuration 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.580

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.630
 your pleasure 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.960

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.410
