00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
margaritas this way because I just think

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.349

is<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.590> gross<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.370> sugar<00:01:02.550> syrup

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
is just it's gross it's just sugar syrup

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.369 
is just it's gross it's just sugar syrup
and<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.210> completely<00:01:03.539> takes<00:01:03.629> away<00:01:03.989> from<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and it completely takes away from the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.590 
and it completely takes away from the
flavor<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.799> fresh<00:01:05.070> lime<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.670> beautiful

as its forming up like this I'm going to

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.300 
as its forming up like this I'm going to
measure<00:02:12.780> out<00:02:12.900> two<00:02:13.290> tablespoons<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.860> simple

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
agave or honey but I just found that the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.040 
agave or honey but I just found that the
meringue<00:02:20.940> works<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.360> lot<00:02:21.480> better<00:02:21.540> when<00:02:21.930> you

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
meringue works a lot better when you

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.809 
meringue works a lot better when you
actually<00:02:22.260> use<00:02:22.650> real<00:02:22.890> sugar<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.640> I'm<00:02:23.700> just

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
actually use real sugar so I'm just

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.400 
actually use real sugar so I'm just
going<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.060> take<00:02:24.239> two<00:02:24.450> tablespoons<00:02:24.599> of<00:02:24.959> simple

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.440 
going to take two tablespoons of simple
syrup<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:27.860> as<00:02:28.860> as<00:02:29.220> I'm<00:02:29.760> blending<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.299> I'm

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
syrup and as as I'm blending this I'm

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.330 
syrup and as as I'm blending this I'm
going<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.629> slowly<00:02:30.870> incorporate<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.799> into<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
going to slowly incorporate it into the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:45.589
