do not want to face on the next day

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.260 
do not want to face on the next day
because<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:24.540> come<00:01:24.780> out<00:01:24.930> strong<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:27.240> I

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
because they will come out strong so I

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.210 
because they will come out strong so I
don't<00:01:27.509> want<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.200> disrespectful<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:29.100> anyone

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.969 
don't want to be disrespectful to anyone
but<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.960> think<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.380> millennium<00:01:31.890> is

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
but I think that millennium is

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.969 
but I think that millennium is
underperforming<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.790> lot<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.770> like

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
underperforming a lot and it is like

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.859 
underperforming a lot and it is like
when<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:35.520> playing<00:01:35.820> against<00:01:36.329> worse<00:01:36.540> team

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
when you're playing against worse team

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.780 
when you're playing against worse team
it's<00:01:37.110> easier<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.829> shine<00:01:38.130> than<00:01:38.430> playing

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
it's easier to shine than playing

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.880 
it's easier to shine than playing
against<00:01:39.119> stronger<00:01:39.420> team<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.500> hope

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
against stronger team so I hope

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.679 
against stronger team so I hope
millennium<00:01:41.490> will<00:01:41.700> step<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.420> their<00:01:42.659> game

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
millennium will step up their game

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.690 
millennium will step up their game
because<00:01:43.290> they're<00:01:43.530> really<00:01:43.799> good<00:01:43.950> players<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
because they're really good players and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.170 
because they're really good players and
I<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.820> them<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> lot<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:46.500> i<00:01:47.040> think<00:01:47.939> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I know them a lot so I i think that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.130 
I know them a lot so I i think that
overall<00:01:49.610> we<00:01:50.610> played<00:01:50.820> really<00:01:51.000> good<00:01:51.119> today<00:01:51.420> did

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
overall we played really good today did

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.389 
overall we played really good today did
some<00:01:52.350> mistakes<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:54.140> think<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:56.159> we

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
some mistakes but I think that if we

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
some mistakes but I think that if we
play<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:57.240> yesterday<00:01:57.719> maybe<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.380> would

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
play like this yesterday maybe it would

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.859 
play like this yesterday maybe it would
be<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.680> bit<00:01:58.860> better<00:01:59.299> now<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> beginning<00:02:00.840> of

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
be a bit better now in the beginning of

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.389 
be a bit better now in the beginning of
the<00:02:00.960> season<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.320> couple<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.649> times<00:02:01.860> I'd<00:02:02.070> ask<00:02:02.250> you

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the season a couple of times I'd ask you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.830 
the season a couple of times I'd ask you
to<00:02:02.460> maybe<00:02:02.700> make<00:02:02.909> some<00:02:03.149> predictions<00:02:03.270> about<00:02:03.719> how

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
to maybe make some predictions about how

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.420 
to maybe make some predictions about how
the<00:02:03.990> season<00:02:04.320> would<00:02:04.619> go<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.070> couldn't<00:02:05.280> say

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
the season would go and you couldn't say

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.679 
the season would go and you couldn't say
anything<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> beginning<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.509> just

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
anything in the beginning but you just

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.639 
anything in the beginning but you just
mentioned<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.140> millennium<00:02:07.560> is

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
mentioned that millennium is

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.440 
mentioned that millennium is
underperforming<00:02:08.039> right<00:02:08.520> now<00:02:08.670> where<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:09.420> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
underperforming right now where do you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.910 
underperforming right now where do you
kind<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.780> think<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.140> guys<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.500> realistically

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
kind of think you guys can realistically

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.740 
kind of think you guys can realistically
end<00:02:11.250> up

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
end up

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.890 
end up
I<00:02:12.520> think<00:02:13.520> that<00:02:13.580> we're<00:02:14.090> aiming<00:02:14.300> for<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.720> first

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
I think that we're aiming for the first

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.380 
I think that we're aiming for the first
place<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.710> I<00:02:16.580> think<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.850> will<00:02:17.000> be<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.240> best

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
place and I think it will be the best

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.090 
place and I think it will be the best
and<00:02:17.870> what<00:02:18.110> would<00:02:18.350> be<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.530> best<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.950> finish

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
and what would be the best to finish

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.180 
and what would be the best to finish
even<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:20.180> schedule<00:02:20.540> stop<00:02:20.780> too<00:02:20.960> so<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.980> won't

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
even the schedule stop too so you won't

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.800 
even the schedule stop too so you won't
be<00:02:22.340> afraid<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.670> get<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.000> out<00:02:23.120> or<00:02:23.450> get<00:02:23.660> into

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
be afraid to get it out or get into

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.140 
be afraid to get it out or get into
relegation<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.040> think<00:02:25.190> dr.<00:02:25.640> would<00:02:25.820> be<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
relegation so I think dr. would be the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.449 
relegation so I think dr. would be the
best<00:02:26.300> before<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.110> playoffs<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.980> how's<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
best before the playoffs and how's the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.430 
best before the playoffs and how's the
preparation<00:02:29.180> gone<00:02:29.420> for<00:02:29.720> coming<00:02:30.170> into<00:02:30.350> this

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
preparation gone for coming into this

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.230 
preparation gone for coming into this
obviously<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:30.860> had<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.160> super<00:02:31.490> weak<00:02:31.670> intel

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
obviously you had the super weak intel

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.610 
obviously you had the super weak intel
extreme<00:02:32.360> masters<00:02:32.600> now<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.140> straight<00:02:33.500> into

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
extreme masters now you straight into

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.980 
extreme masters now you straight into
this<00:02:33.770> week<00:02:34.070> going<00:02:34.820> one-on-one<00:02:35.060> this<00:02:35.480> weekend

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
this week going one-on-one this weekend

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.110 
this week going one-on-one this weekend
you<00:02:36.290> got<00:02:36.440> what<00:02:36.770> two<00:02:36.980> more<00:02:37.190> match<00:02:37.430> weeks<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.910> go

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
you got what two more match weeks to go

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.880 
you got what two more match weeks to go
how's<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.870> preparation<00:02:39.380> going<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.740> in

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
how's the preparation going to you in

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.500 
how's the preparation going to you in
the<00:02:39.980> gaming<00:02:40.190> house<00:02:40.490> now<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:40.820> settled

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
the gaming house now you settled

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.590 
the gaming house now you settled
anywhere<00:02:41.830> so<00:02:42.830> we<00:02:43.400> were<00:02:43.520> in<00:02:43.700> gaming<00:02:44.030> house<00:02:44.239> I

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
anywhere so we were in gaming house I

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.510 
anywhere so we were in gaming house I
think<00:02:45.050> we<00:02:45.170> will<00:02:45.290> go<00:02:45.470> home<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.950> get<00:02:46.070> like<00:02:46.340> our

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
think we will go home to get like our

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.810 
think we will go home to get like our
staff<00:02:47.300> with<00:02:47.780> us<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.230> we'll<00:02:49.160> come<00:02:49.400> back<00:02:49.430> to

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
staff with us and we'll come back to

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.590 
staff with us and we'll come back to
gaming<00:02:50.180> house<00:02:50.450> before<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.520> LA<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:53.150> last<00:02:53.360> week

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
gaming house before the LA the last week

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.800 
gaming house before the LA the last week
the<00:02:53.810> playoffs<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:56.290> think<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:57.410> too<00:02:57.770> we

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
the playoffs and I think that too we

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.560 
the playoffs and I think that too we
like<00:02:59.810> preparing<00:03:00.260> pretty<00:03:00.560> much<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.970> hope

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
like preparing pretty much and I hope

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.479 
like preparing pretty much and I hope
that<00:03:02.630> our<00:03:03.260> preparation<00:03:04.070> will<00:03:04.250> get<00:03:04.370> even

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
that our preparation will get even

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.620 
that our preparation will get even
better<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.290> because<00:03:06.670> everyone<00:03:07.670> will<00:03:07.940> focus

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
better and because everyone will focus

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.690 
better and because everyone will focus
more<00:03:08.989> on<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.470> preparing<00:03:10.130> because<00:03:10.459> we<00:03:10.580> think

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
more on the preparing because we think

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.820 
more on the preparing because we think
that<00:03:10.790> layoffs<00:03:11.209> is<00:03:11.360> more<00:03:11.900> important<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.500> even

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
that layoffs is more important and even

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.150 
that layoffs is more important and even
more<00:03:13.340> important<00:03:13.730> than<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.690> am<00:03:14.900> but<00:03:15.769> not<00:03:15.830> like

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
more important than I am but not like

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.500 
more important than I am but not like
more<00:03:16.340> important<00:03:16.760> but<00:03:16.850> we<00:03:16.970> got<00:03:17.090> more<00:03:17.269> time

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
more important but we got more time

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.690 
more important but we got more time
because<00:03:17.989> before<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.680> am<00:03:19.010> we<00:03:19.130> got<00:03:19.250> around<00:03:19.459> five

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
because before I am we got around five

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.110 
because before I am we got around five
days<00:03:19.940> after<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.230> last<00:03:21.530> LCS<00:03:21.980> week<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.519> here<00:03:23.090> we

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
days after the last LCS week and here we

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.660 
days after the last LCS week and here we
will<00:03:23.390> have<00:03:23.570> around<00:03:23.720> 10<00:03:24.140> days<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.530> think<00:03:24.560> yeah<00:03:25.070> so

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
will have around 10 days I think yeah so

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.650 
will have around 10 days I think yeah so
I<00:03:27.400> really<00:03:28.400> tired<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:28.790> i'm<00:03:28.910> telling<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:29.330> all
