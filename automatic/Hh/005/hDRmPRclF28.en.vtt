00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.549
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.199
 chain easy tutorial France we find ourselves 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.220
 today for a video in 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.590
 exclusiveness 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.270
 I will introduce you to a glitch 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.189
 that I discovered by myself and who 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.890
 will allow you to continue to 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.369
 to make big ramps on the versions 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.340
 old gen ie ps3 and xbox 360 and 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.700
 wii since 2000 up to date on his on these 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.770
 versions so old gen ps3 and xbox 360 on 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.600
 can not really bunk anymore 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.360
 objects as it was possible to the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.520
 do it before and so I showed you 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 a small solution that allowed 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.789
 to tilt the objects and pushing a 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.829
 little further 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.020
 well I found how to make 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.660
 ramps so as you can see at 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.109
 the screen she is not super right 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.699
 but it works it's a ramp and I 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.160
 will show you immediately how 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.989
 we do to make his ramps so with 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.700
 this glitch you will be able to make 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.110
 big rounds as you can see 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.280
 on the screen as well as for the most 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.590
 courageous loops 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.270
 on the other hand, your structure 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.030
 should do it at once 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.229
 because if you test the race where you 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.930
 backup and you will not be able 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.189
 continue to do the curve of your 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.619
 nuclear annuity object are going to get 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.860
 turn into an object or who are no longer 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.710
 stackable so let's go for the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.020
 glitch so for starters it will take 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.020
 place a ramp where you want 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.950
 your structure starts so the first 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.090
 ramp 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.290
 it'll be important to pause 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.600
 exactly where you want your 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.380
 structure starts then you go on 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.470
 put a second take it cleared the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.270
 first is rested the ramp exactly 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.140
 where you put the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.659
 first ramp 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.360
 I'll get you back that so you 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.979
 put a first ramp on the ground the exact 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.290
 exactly where you want 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.979
 that your structure starts so you the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.840
 lay on the ground 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.850
 once you have laid it on the ground 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.729
 you ask a second 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.560
 no matter where you get it from you 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.569
 take them back and you remove the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.579
 first you laid down 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.480
 again exactly at the place 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:18.280
 where you want it to be next 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.409
 and you will have to continue this 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.769
 technique exactly the same for each 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:26.920
 ramp against so small small 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.079
 nuance to be able to lay a ramp on 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.049
 our quenching we must go and use 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.239
 another glitch which consists of so you 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.109
 please, it's the rent on the other 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.609
 first ramp that you have laid and 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:42.189
 you are going for example selected a 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.109
 panel that can be positioned on 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.680
 and once you're on the panel 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.599
 you do 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.659
 back to the ramp while validating 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.480
 for harry trying to get to ask the 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:55.299
 ramp passing an object a valet 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.699
 finally validates an invalid object so in 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.430
 going from the valid panel to the 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:02.139
 invalid ramp and posing for 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.480
 get to the break is actually so 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.609
 to ask you like that a first time to 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.239
 the ramp is pausing you and another one at 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:14.469
 side you resume you delete the 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:20.079
 ramp that you have previously laid 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:25.150
 to rest in the same place as we go 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:27.689
 continue so here I position I try 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.979
 to position a ramp 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.780
 so that was the last I was hungry 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:35.620
 I had asked whose classes from 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.540
 there then we'll have to get a 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.659
 valid position so for example I'm going 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.819
 take the panel here I place myself on 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:46.209
 the right arrow sign while trying 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.359
 to validate tackle up next people posing 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.090
 next I repeat it I erase the 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.040
 last ramp that I put and I try 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.810
 to replace it exactly as before and 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.759
 it becomes fixed we start again so I 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.739
 take the little panel paf I pass 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:05.799
 of a zone validate a zone end of a 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.500
 object valid an invalid object people 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.229
 pose another next I take it back 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.139
 I erase the last ramp that I put 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:17.349
 on the structure and I try to 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:21.400
 always put back by passing from one 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:25.600
 panel simply has the ramp 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.169
 so here we continue I position myself on 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.720
 a sign that is in a valid position 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.289
 hop I go directly on evian the 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.080
 on the ramp 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:41.380
 it validates the ramp people pose another 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.539
 next I take it back I delete the 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.940
 saddle that was all the way to the end 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.759
 the annuity previously laid for 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:54.030
 try to rest it again from 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:56.350
 more from a sign to the ramp 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.970
 and validating at the same time for 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.970
 to arrive to ask to ramp 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.650
 so once you have finished your 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.100
 structure that you are sure that you him 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.919
 is not retouch and well from 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.229
 that moment you can try the 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.990
 simply test or back up 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.000
 when you save ray and you 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.789
 publish your run is well the ramp 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.759
 will remain as is, we will not be as 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:28.150
 right that you could do it but that 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.560
 will remain a ramp and what can be 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.880
 really not bad because we could 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.229
 do more render for the consoles 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:39.190
 old gen which are ps3 and xbox 360 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:41.470
 so if you did not understand my 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.080
 explanations I will do a little tutorial 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.130
 written in the description 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.870
 I hoped that I hope I will arrive 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.820
 to do a written tutorial that is pretty 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.560
 understandable is that it's not 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.560
 obvious explained 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.630
 especially especially if it's a 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.300
 quite simple manipulation but is not 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.970
 obviously obvious explained so here 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.190
 the end result once if you 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.750
 publish it or you finally quit 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.599
 you save that you leave that 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.190
 you come back to have the structure 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:12.010
 final 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.110
 that's what will have to be done and it will have to 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.849
 that like ramp 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.280
 so I'm going to show you is fast 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.930
 done and so that's basically the queue the 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.699
 video she's finished you and show 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.560
 how can we continue to make 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.500
 ramps on old gen consoles 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.020
 I hope this little glitch house you 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.550
 will have pleased and and hoping that the 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.020
 first the next update 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.690
 corrects these problems and that more 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.060
 to redo exactly as one could 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.830
 to do before or why not 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.780
 improve the thing and that allows us 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.970
 to actually make official 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.280
 large in large structures like 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.360
 that with ramps it's big 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.909
 ramps or loops 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.409
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:55.330
 will have rained we will find ourselves very soon 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:55.330
 for a next video hi to all
