00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.540
 vivent berlerode is one of our last 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.040
 new construction projects where we have a number 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.660
 things have been brought under 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.440
 others separating living and care 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.690
 by 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.850
 so to live in apartments and 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.810
 In addition, we have the village feeling 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.520
 try to bring back the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.140
 multifunctional space wherever the 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.410
 activities and other activities that 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.720
 no feeling the uniqueness of vivent 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.650
 Berlerode is that we have the circle of life here 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.870
 brought in through 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.790
 technology and that means the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.930
 the living world of people with those who are demented 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.970
 want in particular 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.500
 have widened when you look at the 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.840
 interpretation of the living circles then 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.940
 it means that we scan 4 summer and 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.910
 that is individually determined to which 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.080
 zone and creamy may come four summers 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.580
 include the property 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.770
 the halls where the houses meet 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.290
 we have had it converted into a kind of 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.760
 neighborhood there comes the living that is 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.290
 a second sons 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.450
 the third will be as we are 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.700
 now so multifunctional part and the 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.920
 fourth son is the outer circle that is 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.990
 just outside 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.280
 everyone who comes to us for care 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.500
 a key band 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.780
 there is a technological shippin and 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.560
 which ensures that the doors are open 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.120
 stay 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.910
 when you have a certain zone market 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.500
 enter and closed lock shoot 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.900
 the moment you are no longer in that 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.550
 but we have the normal 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.170
 want to bring the streets back 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.909
 everyone has their own front door 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.409
 is also characterized by its own color 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.300
 and its own shape so that it is recognizable 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.680
 is for residents we have in the hall 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.450
 have brought the neighborhood back from 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.220
 berlicum, because that's all 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.229
 where most people come from here 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.540
 who have given content by 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.630
 teaches farms to imitate the neighborhood 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.130
 mimics and shopping street 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.210
 the multifunctional part 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.100
 yes you will find things that you like 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.350
 normally also found in a village such as 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.970
 a grand cafÃ© and restaurant and 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.710
 activities space where people find something 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.010
 can do a billiard 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.810
 to become 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.370
 but especially finding the encounter 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.350
 we whole 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.110
 important when people meet 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.060
 meet then interaction takes place 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.310
 and we think that's very important 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.590
 also for people with neoderma 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.540
 but within the care to from out the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.940
 experience-oriented care and we offer and 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.570
 situation as home as possible to that 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.730
 people 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.920
 recognize things everyone recognizes one 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.900
 household everyone recognizes cooking from 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.940
 meals everyone acknowledges doing the laundry 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.500
 and that we do together with residents to 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.830
 also consider the activity as the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.910
 meaningful daytime activities where you work are not 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.530
 with nameplates 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.090
 for the one who that nobody can or with 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.460
 numbers on the door well we have 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.620
 showcases next door hang where 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.240
 recognizable items in front of the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.540
 relevant moonen so you still 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.920
 recognizes hey this is mine 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.440
 We have always spoken in the Netherlands 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.120
 about freedom restricting measure that 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.340
 completely turned over to freedom of 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.140
 generous measure and we find it so 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.510
 important that more freedom foams 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.400
 is so that people are capable of others 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.380
 to meet people and own 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.970
 directing life as much as possible 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.420
 able to retain and also to be able to make choices 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.620
 to make 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.620
 where do I want to be today
