lot of them we're breaking the cycle is

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.910 
lot of them we're breaking the cycle is
difficult<00:01:48.340> or<00:01:48.549> requires<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.840> get<00:01:50.709> one<00:01:50.829> of

can sort of see note that these those
icicles<00:02:11.720> if<00:02:12.350> we<00:02:12.500> go<00:02:12.620> down<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.160> bottom

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
icicles if we go down to the bottom

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.330 
icicles if we go down to the bottom
you'll<00:02:15.170> see<00:02:15.230> those<00:02:15.500> icicles<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:18.920> get<00:02:19.160> the

you'll see those icicles so you get the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.710 
you'll see those icicles so you get the
snow<00:02:19.610> block<00:02:20.050> we<00:02:21.050> go<00:02:21.730> have<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.910> going<00:02:23.120> right<00:02:23.510> and

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
snow block we go have it going right and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.000 
snow block we go have it going right and
we<00:02:23.840> go<00:02:23.959> through<00:02:24.140> those<00:02:24.290> same<00:02:24.500> high<00:02:24.650> schools

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
we go through those same high schools

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.130 
we go through those same high schools
that<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.190> saw<00:02:25.490> when<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.670> bounced<00:02:26.120> up<00:02:26.240> there<00:02:26.450> right

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
that I saw when I bounced up there right

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.290 
that I saw when I bounced up there right
and<00:02:27.470> then<00:02:28.010> we<00:02:28.100> go<00:02:28.220> down<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:28.550> instead<00:02:28.940> we<00:02:29.120> can

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
and then we go down but instead we can

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.690 
and then we go down but instead we can
break<00:02:29.720> through<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.020> barrier<00:02:30.550> break<00:02:31.550> this

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
break through the barrier break this

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.510 
break through the barrier break this
cycle<00:02:33.160> recycle<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:35.239> as<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.780> yet<00:02:36.610> yeah<00:02:37.610> it's

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
cycle recycle is as of yet yeah it's

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
cycle recycle is as of yet yeah it's
it's<00:02:40.520> fascinating<00:02:42.040> entry

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.660 

music<00:02:47.260> is<00:02:47.379> pretty<00:02:47.500> good<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:48.010> make<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.430> good

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
music is pretty good to make it so good

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.759 
music is pretty good to make it so good
I<00:02:49.150> might<00:02:49.540> like<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.900> regular<00:02:50.079> version<00:02:50.290> better

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
I might like the regular version better

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.050 
I might like the regular version better
than<00:02:51.329> depending<00:02:52.329> on<00:02:52.480> how<00:02:52.629> I<00:02:52.659> feel<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:54.060> think

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
than depending on how I feel I think

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.729 
than depending on how I feel I think
it's<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.269> mood<00:02:55.540> thing<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.170> know<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:58.469> this<00:02:59.469> one

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
it's a mood thing you know and this one

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.699 
it's a mood thing you know and this one
very<00:03:00.489> reminiscent<00:03:00.939> of<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.450> boss<00:03:01.780> from<00:03:02.319> sonic

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
very reminiscent of a a boss from sonic

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.250 
very reminiscent of a a boss from sonic
2<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:02.920> think<00:03:03.129> it<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.599> metropolis<00:03:04.900> the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
2 I think it is is the metropolis the

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.229 
2 I think it is is the metropolis the
travel<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.709> early<00:03:05.980> boss<00:03:06.129> it<00:03:06.370> had<00:03:06.700> little<00:03:06.939> use

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
travel is early boss it had little use

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.660 
travel is early boss it had little use
opening<00:03:08.079> it<00:03:08.260> yeah<00:03:08.859> that's<00:03:09.189> it<00:03:09.340> carefully

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
opening it yeah that's it carefully

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.910 
opening it yeah that's it carefully
actually<00:03:12.810> yeah<00:03:13.810> actually<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:14.709> game

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
actually yeah actually in this game

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.220 
actually yeah actually in this game
there's<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.310> version<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:15.969> that<00:03:16.030> boss<00:03:16.299> probably

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
there's a version of that boss probably

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.830 
there's a version of that boss probably
later<00:03:17.950> on<00:03:18.159> and<00:03:18.370> it's<00:03:18.819> trivially<00:03:19.420> easy<00:03:19.510> with

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
later on and it's trivially easy with

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.309 
later on and it's trivially easy with
his<00:03:20.549> instafit<00:03:21.549> double<00:03:22.480> jump<00:03:22.720> with<00:03:22.900> nothing

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
his instafit double jump with nothing

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.309 
his instafit double jump with nothing
you<00:03:24.159> get<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.400> damage<00:03:24.849> sphere<00:03:25.299> you<00:03:25.989> don't<00:03:26.139> have

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
you get the damage sphere you don't have

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:35.089 
you get the damage sphere you don't have
to<00:03:27.840> nice<00:03:28.840> mom<00:03:29.139> it's<00:03:29.829> just<00:03:30.150> your<00:03:31.150> progress<00:03:31.629> yes

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099

doesn't even have the decency to have
treasure<00:03:37.480> exact<00:03:37.930> work<00:03:38.230> all<00:03:38.500> right<00:03:38.650> now<00:03:38.709> I'm

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
treasure exact work all right now I'm

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.470 
treasure exact work all right now I'm
going<00:03:38.889> to<00:03:38.980> take<00:03:39.099> a<00:03:39.159> high<00:03:39.430> road<00:03:39.730> on<00:03:39.760> this<00:03:39.939> this

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
going to take a high road on this this

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.809 
going to take a high road on this this
whole<00:03:40.659> stage<00:03:40.989> here<00:03:41.319> because<00:03:41.739> high<00:03:42.579> road<00:03:42.790> is

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
whole stage here because high road is

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.759 
whole stage here because high road is
better<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.450> it's<00:03:43.989> one<00:03:44.139> that<00:03:44.260> many<00:03:44.439> people

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
better and it's one that many people

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.440 
better and it's one that many people
don't<00:03:44.980> take<00:03:47.250> also<00:03:48.250> i<00:03:48.280> think<00:03:48.549> i<00:03:48.609> could<00:03:48.669> check<00:03:49.150> no

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
don't take also i think i could check no

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.210 
don't take also i think i could check no
that's<00:03:49.629> later<00:03:49.780> on<00:03:49.900> which<00:03:50.620> happens<00:03:50.949> it<00:03:51.040> around

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
that's later on which happens it around

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.569 
that's later on which happens it around
if<00:03:51.609> you<00:03:51.729> want<00:03:51.879> to<00:03:51.940> get<00:03:52.030> more<00:03:52.180> height<00:03:53.459> you're<00:03:54.459> on

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
if you want to get more height you're on

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.439 
if you want to get more height you're on
one<00:03:54.699> of<00:03:54.849> these<00:03:54.909> on<00:03:55.180> rails<00:03:55.540> like<00:03:55.870> spinning<00:03:56.560> like

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
one of these on rails like spinning like

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.360 
one of these on rails like spinning like
loop-de-loops<00:03:58.449> hold<00:03:58.930> down<00:03:59.319> just<00:04:00.069> hold<00:04:00.250> down

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
loop-de-loops hold down just hold down

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.759 
loop-de-loops hold down just hold down
and<00:04:00.819> you'll<00:04:01.510> go<00:04:01.720> really<00:04:01.900> high<00:04:02.019> your

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
and you'll go really high your

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.099 
and you'll go really high your
trajectory<00:04:02.979> will<00:04:03.400> be<00:04:03.519> correct<00:04:03.879> amazing<00:04:04.780> yeah

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
trajectory will be correct amazing yeah

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.500 
trajectory will be correct amazing yeah
it's<00:04:05.729> it's<00:04:06.729> a<00:04:06.849> secret<00:04:07.269> for<00:04:07.449> everyone<00:04:09.510> you

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
it's it's a secret for everyone you

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.449 
it's it's a secret for everyone you
think<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.900> would<00:04:11.260> you<00:04:11.680> be<00:04:11.769> more<00:04:11.919> fiction<00:04:12.250> or

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
think I would you be more fiction or

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.210 
think I would you be more fiction or
something<00:04:12.760> increase<00:04:13.180> your<00:04:13.359> normal<00:04:13.810> force

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
something increase your normal force

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.509 
something increase your normal force
doesn't<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.519> actually<00:04:16.060> uses<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.539> counter

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
doesn't it actually uses to counter

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.940 
doesn't it actually uses to counter
increases<00:04:18.519> your<00:04:18.900> frictional<00:04:19.900> efficiency

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
increases your frictional efficiency

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.640 
increases your frictional efficiency
which<00:04:22.820> is<00:04:23.000> cessation<00:04:23.570> which<00:04:24.200> is<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.470> say<00:04:24.500> you

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
which is cessation which is to say you

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.880 
which is cessation which is to say you
have<00:04:24.830> more<00:04:25.040> friction<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:26.500> you<00:04:27.500> roll<00:04:27.740> without

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
have more friction so you roll without

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.300 
have more friction so you roll without
sticking<00:04:28.870> become<00:04:29.870> more<00:04:30.080> newtonian<00:04:30.740> particle

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
sticking become more newtonian particle

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.780 
sticking become more newtonian particle
like<00:04:31.760> a<00:04:31.790> cue<00:04:32.120> ball<00:04:32.150> or<00:04:32.510> side<00:04:33.220> Rolling<00:04:34.220> slipping

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
like a cue ball or side Rolling slipping

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.350 
like a cue ball or side Rolling slipping
a<00:04:34.850> pebble<00:04:35.210> right<00:04:38.470> which<00:04:39.790> actually<00:04:40.790> does<00:04:41.120> have

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
a pebble right which actually does have

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.710 
a pebble right which actually does have
quite<00:04:41.510> delicious<00:04:41.870> I<00:04:43.540> imagine<00:04:44.540> if<00:04:44.630> you

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
quite delicious I imagine if you

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.470 
quite delicious I imagine if you
inserted<00:04:45.200> a<00:04:45.470> an<00:04:46.220> infusion<00:04:46.820> of<00:04:47.060> different

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
inserted a an infusion of different

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.750 
inserted a an infusion of different
syrups<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.170> were<00:04:48.290> flavor<00:04:48.560> might<00:04:49.310> even<00:04:49.460> taste

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
syrups that were flavor might even taste
