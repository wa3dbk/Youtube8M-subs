00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.120 
the level 12 looks like it's not a lot
different<00:01:21.390> from<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.049> level<00:01:22.380> 11<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:22.950> honest

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.870 
different from the level 11 to be honest
with<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> picture<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:26.759> the

more<00:01:31.380> little<00:01:31.619> tomb<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.250> top<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.729> that's

forty seven level seven Giants and if

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.180 
forty seven level seven Giants and if
you<00:03:35.910> look<00:03:36.090> at<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.450> little<00:03:36.810> thing<00:03:37.049> on<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
you look at the little thing on the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.369 
you look at the little thing on the
Giants<00:03:38.609> like<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.209> little<00:03:39.419> number<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:40.319> says

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
Giants like the little number it says

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.409 
Giants like the little number it says
seven<00:03:40.889> so<00:03:41.040> that's<00:03:41.129> level<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.669> that's<00:03:42.209> kind<00:03:42.389> of

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
seven so that's level and that's kind of

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:43.699 
seven so that's level and that's kind of
part<00:03:42.569> of<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.780> new<00:03:42.900> feature<00:03:43.139> and<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.590> is

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
part of the new feature and it is

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.009 
part of the new feature and it is
flaming<00:03:44.250> which<00:03:44.609> means<00:03:44.849> that<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.209> maxed<00:03:45.840> so

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
flaming which means that it is maxed so

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.710 
flaming which means that it is maxed so
we<00:03:46.139> do<00:03:46.349> have<00:03:46.530> them<00:03:46.680> maxed<00:03:47.069> out<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.430> they<00:03:48.180> do

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
we do have them maxed out and they do

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.720 
we do have them maxed out and they do
look<00:03:48.900> pretty<00:03:48.959> sick<00:03:49.470> actually<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:50.069> little<00:03:50.579> bit

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
look pretty sick actually a little bit

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.490 
look pretty sick actually a little bit
different<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.180> know<00:03:51.299> they<00:03:51.419> do<00:03:51.480> they<00:03:52.379> have

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
different you know they do they have

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.580 
different you know they do they have
like<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.680> little<00:03:52.940> little<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.930> don't<00:03:55.230> know<00:03:55.290> those

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
like a little little I don't know those

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.289 
like a little little I don't know those
little<00:03:55.739> spikes<00:03:56.190> on<00:03:56.459> their<00:03:56.639> shoulders

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
little spikes on their shoulders

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.900 
little spikes on their shoulders
I<00:03:57.329> guess<00:03:58.019> that's<00:03:58.349> that's<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.400> difference<00:03:59.790> a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
I guess that's that's the difference a

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.369 
I guess that's that's the difference a
little<00:04:00.150> like<00:04:00.329> gold<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.930> they<00:04:01.169> look<00:04:01.290> pretty

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
little like gold and they look pretty

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:02.599 
little like gold and they look pretty
sick<00:04:01.709> actually

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
sick actually

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.610 
sick actually
and<00:04:02.940> I've<00:04:03.269> never<00:04:03.449> used<00:04:03.569> Giants<00:04:04.290> well<00:04:04.440> I

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
and I've never used Giants well I

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.780 
and I've never used Giants well I
shouldn't<00:04:04.949> say<00:04:05.010> I've<00:04:05.160> never<00:04:05.370> used<00:04:05.519> giant

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
shouldn't say I've never used giant

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.360 
shouldn't say I've never used giant
spider<00:04:06.000> typically<00:04:06.709> do<00:04:07.709> not<00:04:07.739> attack<00:04:08.220> with

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
spider typically do not attack with

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.170 
spider typically do not attack with
giants<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:08.940> we're<00:04:09.840> gonna<00:04:09.930> go<00:04:10.169> do<00:04:10.410> an<00:04:10.769> all<00:04:11.489> giant

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
giants so we're gonna go do an all giant

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.000 
giants so we're gonna go do an all giant
attack<00:04:12.449> but<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.690> will<00:04:12.870> make<00:04:12.989> that<00:04:13.199> a<00:04:13.470> separate

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
attack but I will make that a separate

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.229 
attack but I will make that a separate
video<00:04:14.220> just<00:04:14.400> kind<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:14.669> wanted<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:14.940> make<00:04:15.090> this

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
video just kind of wanted to make this

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.620 
video just kind of wanted to make this
video<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.919> kind<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:16.979> unlocking<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.090> stuff<00:04:18.359> and

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
video of kind of unlocking the stuff and

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.110 
video of kind of unlocking the stuff and
seeing<00:04:18.900> what<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.410> differences<00:04:19.949> were<00:04:20.099> in<00:04:20.729> the

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
seeing what the differences were in the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.620 
seeing what the differences were in the
look

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
look

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.510 
look
and<00:04:21.780> as<00:04:21.959> you<00:04:22.080> can<00:04:22.170> see<00:04:22.320> here<00:04:22.560> this<00:04:22.680> is<00:04:22.890> not<00:04:23.250> much

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
and as you can see here this is not much

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.270 
and as you can see here this is not much
different<00:04:23.840> but<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.020> gold<00:04:25.350> actually<00:04:25.860> looks<00:04:26.160> a

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
different but the gold actually looks a

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.820
