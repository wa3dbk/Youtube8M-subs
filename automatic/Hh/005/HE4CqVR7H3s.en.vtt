00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.990 

in<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:01.949> video<00:00:02.280> I'll<00:00:02.370> show<00:00:02.520> you<00:00:02.550> how<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.820> can

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
in this video I'll show you how you can

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.450 
in this video I'll show you how you can
use<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.179> uln<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:05.089> 8:03<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.930> drive<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.290> motor<00:00:10.460> so

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
use a uln to 8:03 to drive a motor so

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.900 
use a uln to 8:03 to drive a motor so
here's<00:00:12.210> your<00:00:12.509> input<00:00:13.230> control<00:00:13.650> goes<00:00:14.639> through<00:00:14.880> a

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
here's your input control goes through a

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.150 
here's your input control goes through a
switch<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.599> then<00:00:15.870> branches<00:00:16.379> off<00:00:16.590> two<00:00:16.890> pins

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
switch and then branches off two pins

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.230 
switch and then branches off two pins
one<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.910> two<00:00:22.070> and<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.490> associated<00:00:23.970> outputs

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
one and two and the associated outputs

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.759 
one and two and the associated outputs
are<00:00:24.840> pins<00:00:25.640> 18<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.939> 17<00:00:28.519> and<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.670> would<00:00:29.789> go

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
are pins 18 and 17 and that would go

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.910 
are pins 18 and 17 and that would go
branch<00:00:31.769> back<00:00:32.040> together<00:00:34.520> to<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.579> motor<00:00:35.820> and

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
branch back together to the motor and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.229 
branch back together to the motor and
then<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.930> positive<00:00:39.930> voltage<00:00:40.640> like<00:00:41.640> 5<00:00:41.910> volts

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
then to a positive voltage like 5 volts

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.750 
then to a positive voltage like 5 volts
let's<00:00:42.390> say<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.230> also<00:00:44.160> won't<00:00:44.520> need<00:00:44.670> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
let's say and you also won't need to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.810 
let's say and you also won't need to
make<00:00:44.940> sure<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.690> pin<00:00:45.960> 9<00:00:46.640> tied<00:00:47.640> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
make sure that you have pin 9 tied to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.250 
make sure that you have pin 9 tied to
ground<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.800> when<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.070> hit<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.340> switch<00:00:51.260> it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
ground so when you hit this switch it

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.990 
ground so when you hit this switch it
will<00:00:52.410> turn<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.010> Darlington<00:00:53.640> pair

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
will turn on the Darlington pair

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.200 
will turn on the Darlington pair
transistors<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.899> there<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.910> allow<00:00:56.910> current

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
transistors in there and allow current

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.549 
transistors in there and allow current
to<00:00:57.360> flow<00:00:57.449> through<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:59.520> motor<00:01:00.230> through<00:01:01.230> here

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to flow through the motor through here

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.070 
to flow through the motor through here
down<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.280> ground<00:01:04.700> this<00:01:05.700> second<00:01:06.150> circuit<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.630> so

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
down to ground this second circuit is so

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.539 
down to ground this second circuit is so
that<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> motor<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.890> turn<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.310> both

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that the motor can turn in both

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.800 
that the motor can turn in both
directions<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.830> same<00:01:11.100> input

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
directions so you have the same input

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.030 
directions so you have the same input
going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.990> pins<00:01:13.460> 1<00:01:14.460> &amp;<00:01:14.640> 2<00:01:14.820> comes<00:01:15.689> out<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.830> go

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
going to pins 1 &amp; 2 comes out and we go

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.590 
going to pins 1 &amp; 2 comes out and we go
to<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.840> double<00:01:18.840> pole<00:01:19.170> double<00:01:19.200> throw<00:01:19.680> relay<00:01:23.600> so

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
to a double pole double throw relay so

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.539 
to a double pole double throw relay so
these<00:01:24.750> are<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> columns<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.680> relay<00:01:26.310> so

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
these are the columns on the relay so

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.170 
these are the columns on the relay so
these<00:01:26.670> are<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> fixed<00:01:27.240> points<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:29.180> this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
these are the fixed points and this

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.280 
these are the fixed points and this
would<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> normally<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.020> positions<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
would be the normally on positions so it

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.109 
would be the normally on positions so it
would<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.740> across<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.520> motor<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.939> that

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
would be across the motor in that

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.690 
would be across the motor in that
polarity<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:37.909> when<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.090> turn<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.689> relay

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
polarity and when you turn on the relay

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.880 
polarity and when you turn on the relay
you<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.970> put<00:01:42.600> current<00:01:42.930> through<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.409> inductor

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you a put current through the inductor

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.880 
you a put current through the inductor
and<00:01:43.939> that<00:01:44.939> would<00:01:45.149> magnetize<00:01:45.740> pull<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> switch

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
and that would magnetize pull the switch

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.460 
and that would magnetize pull the switch
it<00:01:49.890> would<00:01:50.040> pull<00:01:50.630> these<00:01:51.630> two<00:01:52.850> throws<00:01:54.439> down<00:01:55.439> to

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
it would pull these two throws down to

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.859 
it would pull these two throws down to
the<00:01:56.009> second<00:01:56.549> positions<00:01:57.000> which<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.570> criss

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
the second positions which is criss

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.690 
the second positions which is criss
cross<00:01:58.200> these<00:01:58.710> are<00:01:58.890> conductors<00:01:59.340> here

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
cross these are conductors here

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.649 
cross these are conductors here
these<00:02:00.450> criss<00:02:00.780> cross<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.149> motor<00:02:03.390> would

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
these criss cross so the motor would

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.100 
these criss cross so the motor would
actually<00:02:04.020> flip<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.649> polarity<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.960> would

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
actually flip in polarity so you would

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.050 
actually flip in polarity so you would
get<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.350> opposite<00:02:07.979> rotation<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.819> did

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
get the opposite rotation that you did

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.300 
get the opposite rotation that you did
initially<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.860> way<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.039> would<00:02:11.220> hook

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
initially and the way you would hook

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.900 
initially and the way you would hook
that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
that

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.060 
that
in<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:13.130> with<00:02:14.130> another<00:02:14.400> switch<00:02:15.800> through<00:02:16.800> pin

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
in is with another switch through pin

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.720 
in is with another switch through pin
four<00:02:17.580> here<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.770> then<00:02:19.770> on<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> output<00:02:20.190> which

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
four here and then on the output which

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:29.330 
four here and then on the output which
is<00:02:20.760> pin<00:02:23.960> 15<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:27.260> when<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.380> flip<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.830> current

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
is pin 15 so when you flip that current

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.380 
is pin 15 so when you flip that current
will<00:02:29.460> flow<00:02:29.580> from<00:02:30.210> here<00:02:30.630> through<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:32.210> duct<00:02:33.210> er

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
will flow from here through this duct er

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.450 
will flow from here through this duct er
and<00:02:33.870> then<00:02:34.290> down<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.940> ground<00:02:37.160> hopefully<00:02:38.160> that

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
and then down to ground hopefully that

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.640 
and then down to ground hopefully that
made<00:02:38.610> sense
