somewhat of a low factor of safety or

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
low confidence on this component so

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.310 
low confidence on this component so
maybe<00:04:17.250> we<00:04:17.459> want<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.760> beef<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.090> up<00:04:18.359> just<00:04:18.810> a

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
maybe we want to beef this up just a

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.140 
maybe we want to beef this up just a
little<00:04:19.530> bit<00:04:19.650> everyone<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.430> thicken<00:04:20.880> up<00:04:21.090> the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
little bit everyone to thicken up the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.510 
little bit everyone to thicken up the
model<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:22.410> ensure<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:22.770> we're<00:04:23.099> at<00:04:23.190> a<00:04:23.250> higher

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
model to ensure that we're at a higher

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.330 
model to ensure that we're at a higher
factor<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.240> safety<00:04:24.419> so<00:04:25.200> very<00:04:25.500> easily<00:04:25.890> we<00:04:26.310> can

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
factor of safety so very easily we can

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.410

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
additional thickness to this geometry so

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.880 
additional thickness to this geometry so
maybe<00:04:33.720> we<00:04:33.840> want<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.050> go<00:04:34.170> ahead<00:04:34.230> and<00:04:34.470> thicken<00:04:34.800> up

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
maybe we want to go ahead and thicken up

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.000 
maybe we want to go ahead and thicken up
