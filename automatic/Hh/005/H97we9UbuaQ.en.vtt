off there we go

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
off there we go
these<00:00:39.840> would<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.079> exactly<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.920> same<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.370> of

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399

these would be exactly the same kind of
figurines<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:42.660> been<00:00:42.809> getting<00:00:42.960> with

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200

figurines that we have been getting with
the<00:00:43.379> marvel<00:00:43.890> style<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:45.680> these<00:00:46.680> would<00:00:46.890> be

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the marvel style and these would be

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.450 
the marvel style and these would be
about<00:00:47.520> two<00:00:47.760> dollars<00:00:48.289> now<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.620> only<00:00:49.829> see<00:00:50.160> two

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
about two dollars now you only see two

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.689 
about two dollars now you only see two
you<00:00:51.030> only<00:00:51.239> see<00:00:51.629> two<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> reason<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.190> that

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
you only see two for a reason and that

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.420 
you only see two for a reason and that
reason<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.420> fact<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.010> these<00:00:56.010> two

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
reason is the fact that these two

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.490 
reason is the fact that these two
figures<00:00:56.699> are<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.780> ones<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> most

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500

more<00:01:07.470> well<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.490> different<00:01:08.939> variety<00:01:09.150> because<00:01:09.750> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
more well a different variety because it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:19.899 
more well a different variety because it
was<00:01:09.990> Kyle<00:01:10.580> there<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.729> Stan<00:01:13.549> Kenny<00:01:18.320> Wendy<00:01:19.320> I

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
was Kyle there was Stan Kenny Wendy I

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.490 
was Kyle there was Stan Kenny Wendy I
think<00:01:20.909> there<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.259> token<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.380> well<00:01:24.020> but<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.229> all

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
think there was token as well but of all

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.640 
think there was token as well but of all
the<00:01:25.740> ones<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.189> kept<00:01:26.490> getting<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:27.090> got<00:01:27.990> myself<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the ones I kept getting I got myself a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.819 
the ones I kept getting I got myself a
dozen<00:01:29.009> again<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:30.030> exaggerating<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.530> I

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
dozen again I'm exaggerating of the I

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.130

the<00:04:48.600> quality<00:04:49.169> on<00:04:49.320> these<00:04:49.470> are<00:04:49.680> as<00:04:49.800> good<00:04:49.889> as<00:04:50.070> the

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
the quality on these are as good as the

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.100 
the quality on these are as good as the
Marvel<00:04:50.820> variety<00:04:51.510> they're<00:04:52.410> just<00:04:52.800> all<00:04:53.010> right

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
Marvel variety they're just all right

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.450 
Marvel variety they're just all right
still<00:04:55.110> though<00:04:55.229> if<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.410> like<00:04:55.590> South<00:04:56.010> Park<00:04:56.039> you

still though if you like South Park you

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.260 
still though if you like South Park you
really<00:04:56.669> can't<00:04:56.850> go<00:04:56.940> wrong<00:04:56.970> with<00:04:57.300> these<00:04:58.910> but<00:04:59.910> do
