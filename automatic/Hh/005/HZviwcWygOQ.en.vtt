of cliff stuff that you can't land on

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.459 
of cliff stuff that you can't land on
he'll<00:04:47.550> know<00:04:47.669> it's<00:04:47.819> used<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.150> lot<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:49.199> lot<00:04:49.259> of

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:49.469 
he'll know it's used a lot and a lot of

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.219 
he'll know it's used a lot and a lot of
the<00:04:49.710> especially<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.280> lot<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.930> player

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
the especially a lot of the the player

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.809 
the especially a lot of the the player
made<00:04:52.469> maps<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:53.870> guess<00:04:54.870> Cena<00:04:55.199> the<00:04:56.009> corners<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.639> a

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
made maps I guess Cena the corners of a

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.610 
made maps I guess Cena the corners of a
scene<00:04:57.060> are<00:04:57.240> just<00:04:57.539> completely<00:04:57.810> that's<00:04:58.409> like

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
scene are just completely that's like

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.939 
scene are just completely that's like
all<00:04:58.800> water<00:04:59.099> and<00:04:59.340> unbuildable<00:04:59.759> stuff<00:05:00.180> so<00:05:00.949> yeah

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
all water and unbuildable stuff so yeah

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.270 
all water and unbuildable stuff so yeah
that's<00:05:02.190> it's<00:05:03.120> kind<00:05:03.419> of<00:05:03.479> like<00:05:03.599> that<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.319> for

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
that's it's kind of like that and for

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.640
