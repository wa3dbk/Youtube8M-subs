even<00:01:35.250> better<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> brand<00:01:36.180> new<00:01:36.240> driving

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
even better this is a brand new driving

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.300 
even better this is a brand new driving
technology<00:01:36.960> inside<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.130> we're

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
technology inside of here that we're

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.800

inside<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.350> headset<00:01:41.210> it's<00:01:42.210> really

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
inside this little headset it's really

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.389 
inside this little headset it's really
lightweight<00:01:42.750> fits<00:01:43.409> nicely<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:43.979> head<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
like I said the best part about it is it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.660 
like I said the best part about it is it
gets<00:01:46.049> loud<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.829> not<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.220> loud<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.549> has<00:01:47.640> a
