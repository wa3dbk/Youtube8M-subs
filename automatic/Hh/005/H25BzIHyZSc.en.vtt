just to give you another insight of a

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.020 
just to give you another insight of a
different<00:03:19.510> raid<00:03:20.400> okay<00:03:21.400> so<00:03:21.459> this<00:03:21.760> is<00:03:21.880> another

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
different raid okay so this is another

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.809 
different raid okay so this is another
one<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.239> found<00:03:23.220> unfortunately<00:03:24.220> in<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.370> one<00:03:24.609> I

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
one I found unfortunately in this one I

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.800 
one I found unfortunately in this one I
didn't<00:03:25.299> realize<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:25.630> ex<00:03:25.989> crossbows<00:03:26.739> were

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
didn't realize that ex crossbows were

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.509 
didn't realize that ex crossbows were
disabled<00:03:28.810> or<00:03:28.989> disarmed<00:03:29.709> which<00:03:30.370> was

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
disabled or disarmed which was

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.660 
disabled or disarmed which was
disappointing<00:03:30.819> but<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:32.400> found<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.519> it

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
disappointing but I found that it

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.590 
disappointing but I found that it
wouldn't<00:03:33.850> made<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.000> difference<00:03:34.359> anyway

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
wouldn't made a difference anyway

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.090 
wouldn't made a difference anyway
because<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:35.109> golems<00:03:35.410> went<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.739> right<00:03:35.859> way<00:03:35.920> so

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
because the golems went the right way so

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.930 
because the golems went the right way so
I've<00:03:36.880> cleared<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.840> outside<00:03:38.319> so<00:03:38.650> they<00:03:39.340> the

I've cleared the outside so they the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.640 
I've cleared the outside so they the
attack<00:03:40.720> troops<00:03:40.959> don't<00:03:41.139> go<00:03:41.319> around<00:03:41.560> the

outside as per my gowipe raids my video

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.150 
outside as per my gowipe raids my video
release<00:03:47.500> of<00:03:47.680> wall<00:03:47.920> breakers<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:50.160> break

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
release of wall breakers to break

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.559 
release of wall breakers to break
through<00:03:51.370> those<00:03:51.519> walls<00:03:51.819> there<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.450> I've

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
through those walls there and I've

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.599 
through those walls there and I've
released<00:03:53.079> another<00:03:53.350> set<00:03:53.769> of<00:03:53.859> wall<00:03:54.010> breakers<00:03:54.370> to

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
released another set of wall breakers to

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.729 
released another set of wall breakers to
go<00:03:54.850> through<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.450> other<00:03:55.750> second<00:03:56.290> layer<00:03:56.440> of

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
go through the other second layer of

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.849 
go through the other second layer of
walls<00:03:57.239> goals<00:03:58.239> went<00:03:58.569> in<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.290> front<00:03:59.530> which<00:03:59.739> is

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
walls goals went in the front which is

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.970 
walls goals went in the front which is
great<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:01.720> crossbows<00:04:02.109> were<00:04:02.139> active

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
great that the crossbows were active

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.009 
great that the crossbows were active
there<00:04:03.280> would<00:04:03.370> have<00:04:03.430> been<00:04:03.750> absorbing<00:04:04.750> those

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
there would have been absorbing those

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.879 
there would have been absorbing those
that<00:04:05.950> fire<00:04:06.280> anyway<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:07.450> I<00:04:07.480> believe<00:04:07.989> it<00:04:08.739> would

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
that fire anyway so I believe it would

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.620 
that fire anyway so I believe it would
have<00:04:09.010> made<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.190> difference<00:04:09.970> if<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.209> crossbows

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
have made a difference if the crossbows

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.850 
have made a difference if the crossbows
were<00:04:10.660> up

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
were up

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.210 
were up
the<00:04:13.370> witches<00:04:13.760> are<00:04:13.790> going<00:04:14.570> around<00:04:14.780> the

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
the witches are going around the

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.430 
the witches are going around the
different<00:04:16.220> layers<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.670> the<00:04:17.180> base<00:04:17.390> or<00:04:17.750> as<00:04:18.140> as

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
different layers of the base or as as

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.550 
different layers of the base or as as
the<00:04:18.920> last<00:04:19.160> raid<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:19.790> as<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:20.840> can<00:04:20.989> see<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.440> was

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
the last raid and as you can see I was
