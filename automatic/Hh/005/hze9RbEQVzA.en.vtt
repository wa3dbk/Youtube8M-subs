you're going to do is just put it into

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.880 
you're going to do is just put it into
sections<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:27.820> clamp<00:00:28.820> them<00:00:28.939> in<00:00:29.269> I<00:00:29.769> don't<00:00:30.769> use

it's being retarded how were the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.089 
it's being retarded how were the
lighting<00:03:40.040> okay<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:41.480> then<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.230> just<00:03:42.290> put<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:42.859> on

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
top like that stout looks experiment

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.599 
top like that stout looks experiment
look<00:03:47.180> fuller<00:03:47.420> which<00:03:48.379> is<00:03:48.530> what<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:48.709> like<00:03:49.129> I<00:03:49.459> like

look fuller which is what I like I like

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.599 
look fuller which is what I like I like
a<00:03:49.969> lapse<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:51.139> you<00:03:51.260> just<00:03:51.469> like<00:03:51.709> separate<00:03:52.310> them

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
a lapse and you just like separate them

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.179 
a lapse and you just like separate them
