you<00:00:30.359> remember<00:00:30.750> how<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.929> always<00:00:31.320> go<00:00:32.189> about<00:00:32.550> trees

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
you remember how I always go about trees

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
now what I try to do is to load map

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.110 
now what I try to do is to load map
which<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> most<00:00:40.649> annoying<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.640> trees

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
which is the most annoying about trees

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.369 
which is the most annoying about trees
in<00:00:42.300> my<00:00:42.559> experience<00:00:43.559> which<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.280> us

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
in my experience which is us

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.380 
in my experience which is us
unfortunately<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.469> seems<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.550> different

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
unfortunately it seems it's a different

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.750 
unfortunately it seems it's a different
map<00:00:48.629> now<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.500> coordinates<00:00:50.010> changed<00:00:50.550> or

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
map now is the coordinates changed or

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.200 
map now is the coordinates changed or
something<00:00:51.210> I'm<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:52.199> sure<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.910> I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
something I'm not sure about it so I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.470 
something I'm not sure about it so I
expected<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.110> forest<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.789> indeed<00:00:56.789> there<00:00:57.360> is

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
expected the forest and indeed there is

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.959 
expected the forest and indeed there is
much<00:00:57.870> less<00:00:58.320> glaring<00:00:59.010> issues<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> whole

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
much less glaring issues like the whole

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.889 
much less glaring issues like the whole
trees<00:01:00.329> big<00:01:01.170> trees<00:01:01.530> disappearing<00:01:02.719> that's<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
trees big trees disappearing that's a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.200 
trees big trees disappearing that's a
huge<00:01:04.439> step<00:01:04.739> forward<00:01:05.280> there<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.000> still

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
huge step forward there is still

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.649 
huge step forward there is still
problems<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:06.930> some<00:01:07.260> trees<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.360> when

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
problems with some trees you see when

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.899 
problems with some trees you see when
they<00:01:09.950> get<00:01:10.950> into<00:01:12.229> exchange<00:01:13.229> 34<00:01:14.189> sprite<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.729> can

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
they get into exchange 34 sprite you can

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.640 
they get into exchange 34 sprite you can
see<00:01:15.119> still<00:01:16.049> see<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.590> huge<00:01:17.100> difference<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:18.650> how

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
see still see a huge difference in how

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.640 
see still see a huge difference in how
it's<00:01:19.920> lightened<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.080> lightning<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it's lightened like a lightning is a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.440 
it's lightened like a lightning is a
huge<00:01:23.070> issue<00:01:24.979> saying<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.340> there<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.970> still

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
huge issue saying that there is still

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.260 
huge issue saying that there is still
another<00:01:28.290> issues<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.920> look<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.820> right

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
another issues like look for this right

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.929 
another issues like look for this right
for<00:01:30.509> example<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.159> something<00:01:32.340> ridiculous

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
for example this is something ridiculous

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.679 
for example this is something ridiculous
you<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.630> how<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.409> 13<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:36.180> i<00:01:36.210> zoom<00:01:36.329> in

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
you can see how this 13 when i zoom in

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.789 
you can see how this 13 when i zoom in
it's<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.500> tree<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.400> normal<00:01:38.670> tree<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.450> i

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
it's a tree it's just normal tree when i

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.830 
it's a tree it's just normal tree when i
get<00:01:40.799> away<00:01:41.130> from<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.909> little<00:01:41.939> bit<00:01:42.180> it's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
get away from it just a little bit it's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.929 
get away from it just a little bit it's
replaced<00:01:43.290> by<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> sprite<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.369> not<00:01:44.579> one

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
replaced by a sprite and it's not one

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.960 
replaced by a sprite and it's not one
sprite<00:01:45.270> i'm<00:01:45.509> not<00:01:45.899> sure<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.710> see<00:01:47.640> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
sprite i'm not sure if you can see it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.420 
sprite i'm not sure if you can see it
properly<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:49.590> actually<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:50.189> tree

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
properly but it's actually one tree

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.090 
properly but it's actually one tree
starting<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.649> all<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> way

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
starting here you see going all the way

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.800 
starting here you see going all the way
up<00:01:53.329> there<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.659> another<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.530> same<00:01:55.860> sprite<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.700> a

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
up there is another the same sprite on a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.660 
up there is another the same sprite on a
on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.079> ground<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.040> when<00:01:59.189> i<00:01:59.219> move

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
on the ground like and when i move

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.270 
on the ground like and when i move
closer<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.079> 3d<00:02:01.740> model<00:02:02.130> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
closer you can see that it's 3d model of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.109 
closer you can see that it's 3d model of
three<00:02:03.210> without<00:02:03.390> any<00:02:03.840> leaves<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.520> problem

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
three without any leaves so the problem

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.900 
three without any leaves so the problem
isn't<00:02:06.840> completely<00:02:07.500> solved<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.009> here<00:02:08.640> it's

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
isn't completely solved and here it's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.059 
isn't completely solved and here it's
easy<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.479> notice<00:02:09.629> like<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.500> example<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:11.009> one

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
easy to notice like for example this one

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.760 
easy to notice like for example this one
three<00:02:11.610> white<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.660> can<00:02:13.050> see<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.260> starts

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
three white you can see it starts

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.640 
three white you can see it starts
you<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.040> goes<00:02:14.280> all<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.550> way<00:02:14.790> up<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.230> now<00:02:16.230> it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
you it goes all the way up and now it

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.150 
you it goes all the way up and now it
completely<00:02:17.640> disappeared<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:19.170> not<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.980> on

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
completely disappeared it's not here on

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.750 
completely disappeared it's not here on
a<00:02:20.220> map<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.960> it's<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.590> same<00:02:22.830> with<00:02:23.100> these<00:02:23.400> three

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
a map and it's the same with these three

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.390 
a map and it's the same with these three
as<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.150> see<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.420> white<00:02:24.720> tree<00:02:25.140> just<00:02:25.980> this

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
as you can see this white tree just this

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.080 
as you can see this white tree just this
simple<00:02:27.090> exact<00:02:28.080> model<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.680> getting<00:02:29.670> replaced

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
simple exact model is getting replaced

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.250 
simple exact model is getting replaced
by<00:02:31.160> two<00:02:32.160> sprites<00:02:32.580> or<00:02:32.850> completely<00:02:33.570> disappear

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
by two sprites or completely disappear

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.440 
by two sprites or completely disappear
as<00:02:34.740> in<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.310> case<00:02:35.520> that<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.820> showed<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.150> and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
as in this case that I showed you and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.820 
as in this case that I showed you and
it's<00:02:36.780> very<00:02:36.990> easy<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.290> find<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.770> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
it's very easy to find in the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.860 
it's very easy to find in the
deployments<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.550> earth<00:02:38.820> map<00:02:39.150> which<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.600> called

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
deployments on earth map which is called

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.030 
deployments on earth map which is called
ours<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.500> there<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.610> lot<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.270> actually

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
ours and there is a lot of it actually

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.420 
ours and there is a lot of it actually
you<00:02:44.040> see<00:02:44.220> again<00:02:44.720> again<00:02:45.720> very<00:02:45.930> easily<00:02:46.740> just

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
you see again again very easily just

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.430 
you see again again very easily just
look<00:02:47.610> at<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.970> particular<00:02:48.480> tree<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.930> wonder<00:02:49.380> if

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
look at this particular tree I wonder if

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.440 
look at this particular tree I wonder if
I<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.620> find<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.040> ok<00:02:50.520> this<00:02:50.820> is<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> very<00:02:51.120> nice

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
I can find it ok this is a very nice

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.650 
I can find it ok this is a very nice
angle<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.230> see<00:02:52.260> 13<00:02:52.830> another<00:02:53.640> tree<00:02:54.030> i<00:02:54.180> zoom<00:02:54.540> in

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
angle you see 13 another tree i zoom in

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.010 
angle you see 13 another tree i zoom in
and<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:55.380> actually<00:02:55.740> one<00:02:55.980> story<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.390> guess

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
and it's actually one story so I guess

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.620 
and it's actually one story so I guess
that's<00:02:58.230> enough<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:59.010> trees<00:02:59.370> the<00:03:00.030> problem<00:03:00.450> is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
that's enough for trees the problem is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.830 
that's enough for trees the problem is
less<00:03:01.380> noticeable<00:03:02.070> than<00:03:02.310> before<00:03:02.640> but<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.630> still

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
less noticeable than before but it still

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.390 
less noticeable than before but it still
remains<00:03:04.200> obviously<00:03:04.440> I'm<00:03:04.740> going<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.190> pause

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
remains obviously I'm going to pause

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.450 
remains obviously I'm going to pause

almost instantly answered the problems

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.070 
almost instantly answered the problems
we<00:03:48.720> found<00:03:48.990> for<00:03:49.500> example<00:03:49.590> if<00:03:50.550> if<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.660> remember

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
we found for example if if you remember

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.440 
we found for example if if you remember
at<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.320> beginning<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.770> patch<00:03:53.010> nine<00:03:53.280> also<00:03:54.270> once

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
at the beginning of patch nine also once

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.010 
at the beginning of patch nine also once
we<00:03:54.600> put<00:03:54.840> out<00:03:55.400> with<00:03:56.400> bonus<00:03:56.790> versus<00:03:57.180> infantry<00:03:57.660> 0

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
we put out with bonus versus infantry 0

we put out with bonus versus infantry 0
if<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.440> remember<00:03:58.890> correctly<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.550> it<00:04:00.090> was<00:04:00.450> fixed

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
if I remember correctly and it was fixed

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.500 
if I remember correctly and it was fixed
so<00:04:01.290> like<00:04:01.560> because<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.430> was<00:04:02.610> intended<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.060> be<00:04:03.209> 10

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
so like because it was intended to be 10

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.840 
so like because it was intended to be 10
no<00:04:03.900> one<00:04:04.080> expected<00:04:04.560> like<00:04:04.740> intended<00:04:05.520> it<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.700> be

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
no one expected like intended it to be

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.810 
no one expected like intended it to be
zero<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:07.440> was<00:04:07.680> just<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:08.010> mistake<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.490> it's

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
zero it was just a mistake and it's

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.010 
zero it was just a mistake and it's
fixed<00:04:09.270> actually<00:04:09.900> let's<00:04:10.080> check<00:04:10.410> Rome<00:04:11.220> now

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
fixed actually let's check Rome now

a video it was 100 they fix name of
legatus<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.530> course<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.130> can<00:04:20.549> say<00:04:20.730> such

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
legatus of course you can say such

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.430 
legatus of course you can say such
problems<00:04:21.390> shouldn't<00:04:21.720> exist<00:04:21.960> on<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.229> first

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
problems shouldn't exist on the first

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.800 
problems shouldn't exist on the first
place<00:04:22.650> but<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:23.310> happens<00:04:23.790> it's<00:04:24.630> more

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
place but it happens it's more

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.300 
place but it happens it's more
importantly<00:04:25.290> that<00:04:25.620> seed

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
importantly that seed

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.450 
importantly that seed
back<00:04:26.460> proceeded<00:04:27.450> correctly<00:04:28.139> and<00:04:28.460> another

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
back proceeded correctly and another

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
how it turns out overall in a balance

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.890 
how it turns out overall in a balance
because<00:05:47.310> none<00:05:47.970> of<00:05:48.000> these<00:05:48.270> numbers<00:05:48.479> actually

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
general direction that it all obviously

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.450 
general direction that it all obviously
requires<00:05:54.270> fine-tuning<00:05:55.050> now<00:05:55.650> which<00:05:55.889> I<00:05:56.160> hope

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
requires fine-tuning now which I hope

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.670 
requires fine-tuning now which I hope
will<00:05:56.490> happen<00:05:56.910> but<00:05:57.660> overall<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.289> speed<00:05:58.590> of

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
will happen but overall the speed of

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.990 
will happen but overall the speed of
