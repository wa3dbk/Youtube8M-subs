conventional bulb but the basically the
fix<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.150> LED<00:00:27.150> bulb<00:00:27.420> from<00:00:27.630> recon<00:00:28.080> this

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
fix for it is a LED bulb from recon this

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.950 
fix for it is a LED bulb from recon this
is<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> direct<00:00:29.789> replacement<00:00:30.300> for<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.660> bulbs

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
what we're going to do is pull down on

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.170 
what we're going to do is pull down on
the<00:00:49.050> stock<00:00:49.559> dome<00:00:49.860> light<00:00:50.039> assembly<00:00:50.489> from<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the stock dome light assembly from the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.400 
the stock dome light assembly from the
front<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.350> pops<00:00:53.280> right<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:54.410> you're

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
front and just pops right out you're

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.819 
front and just pops right out you're
going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:56.059> pull<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.239> actual<00:00:57.629> bulb<00:00:58.079> socket<00:00:58.620> out

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
going to pull the actual bulb socket out

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.189 
going to pull the actual bulb socket out
of<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.129> housing<00:00:59.609> I'm<00:01:00.510> using<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.809> little<00:01:00.930> paper

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
of this housing I'm using a little paper

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.930 
of this housing I'm using a little paper
towel<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.620> put<00:01:01.770> my<00:01:01.890> fingers<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> bulb

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
towel to put my fingers on the bulb

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
towel to put my fingers on the bulb
because<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> bulbs<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:03.629> kind<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.930> warm<00:01:04.140> when

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
because the bulbs are kind of warm when

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.929 
because the bulbs are kind of warm when
they're<00:01:04.890> lit<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:07.520> then<00:01:08.520> we'll<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
they're lit up and then we'll do the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.650 
they're lit up and then we'll do the
same<00:01:09.150> thing<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.869> other<00:01:09.900> side

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.750 

all<00:01:16.660> right<00:01:16.870> and<00:01:17.140> now<00:01:17.950> all<00:01:18.220> we're<00:01:18.400> gonna<00:01:18.520> do<00:01:18.730> is

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
all right and now all we're gonna do is

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.160 
all right and now all we're gonna do is
replace<00:01:19.180> that<00:01:19.510> bulb<00:01:19.780> with<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.590> Recon<00:01:21.550> LED

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
replace that bulb with the Recon LED

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.640 
replace that bulb with the Recon LED
keep<00:01:23.170> in<00:01:23.290> mind

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
keep in mind

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.830 
keep in mind
LEDs<00:01:24.040> are<00:01:24.400> polarity<00:01:24.700> sensitive<00:01:25.120> which<00:01:25.630> means

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
LEDs are polarity sensitive which means

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.330 
LEDs are polarity sensitive which means
if<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.080> plug<00:01:26.290> it<00:01:26.410> into<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.620> socket<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.130> it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
if you plug it into the socket and it

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.160 
if you plug it into the socket and it
doesn't<00:01:27.610> light<00:01:27.730> up<00:01:27.910> you<00:01:28.570> just<00:01:28.720> have<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:28.990> flip

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
doesn't light up you just have to flip

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.610 
doesn't light up you just have to flip
the<00:01:29.290> bulb<00:01:29.470> around<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.610> they'll<00:01:30.940> have<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.620> the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
the bulb around and they'll have a the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.740 
the bulb around and they'll have a the
correct<00:01:32.890> polarity<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.520> light<00:01:33.670> up<00:01:33.850> we're<00:01:34.600> gonna

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
correct polarity to light up we're gonna

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.360 
correct polarity to light up we're gonna
plug<00:01:34.930> that<00:01:35.110> back<00:01:35.170> in<00:01:35.590> this<00:01:35.710> side<00:01:38.250> take<00:01:39.250> the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
plug that back in this side take the

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.440 
plug that back in this side take the
other<00:01:39.490> side<00:01:39.870> and<00:01:40.870> there<00:01:41.260> we<00:01:41.410> go<00:01:42.270> pop<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.420> right

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
other side and there we go pop it right

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.960 
other side and there we go pop it right
back<00:01:43.750> into<00:01:43.990> its<00:01:44.260> housing<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:45.550> then<00:01:45.820> we're

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
back into its housing and then we're

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.030 
back into its housing and then we're
going<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.180> put<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.390> housing<00:01:46.750> back<00:01:46.900> up<00:01:47.140> in<00:01:47.350> the
