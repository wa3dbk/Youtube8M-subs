00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 
I think out of all the decks I believe

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:55.409 
I think out of all the decks I believe
should<00:06:53.500> all<00:06:53.680> may<00:06:53.979> be<00:06:54.039> more<00:06:54.310> of<00:06:54.490> a<00:06:54.610> threat<00:06:54.789> but

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
should all may be more of a threat but

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.439 
should all may be more of a threat but
however<00:06:55.629> just<00:06:56.229> it<00:06:56.949> just<00:06:57.099> makes<00:06:57.400> for<00:06:57.520> smarter

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:58.449
