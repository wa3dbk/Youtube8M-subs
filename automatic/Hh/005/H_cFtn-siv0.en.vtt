 rhizomes 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:01.960

 also freshly picked with names 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.460
 some types of cuttings seeds 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.509
 sow pots 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.500
 contain pretender at a temperature of 20-25 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:31.120
 degrees 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.550
 from time to time put on and stem 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.919
 breeding cuttings harvested 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.190
 early spring and planted for 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.740
 rooting in wet forests 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.680
 covered with glass or film constantly

 four to six weeks 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.650
 cuttings root leaves can
