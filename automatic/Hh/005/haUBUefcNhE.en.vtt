shoe<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.159> puts<00:01:32.310> your<00:01:32.460> team<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.090> slight

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
shoe so that puts your team at a slight

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.510 
shoe so that puts your team at a slight
disadvantage<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.079> can't<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.409> allowed<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
disadvantage it can't be allowed so the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.300 
disadvantage it can't be allowed so the
NBA<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.060> doing<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.329> right<00:01:36.479> thing<00:01:36.689> um<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.530> mean

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
NBA is doing the right thing um I mean

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.469 
NBA is doing the right thing um I mean
sound<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> one-time<00:01:39.030> offense<00:01:39.329> he

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
sound like it's a one-time offense he

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.170 
sound like it's a one-time offense he
did<00:01:39.659> try<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.560> again<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> believe<00:01:40.890> um<00:01:41.549> but

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
did try to do it again I believe um but

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.330 
did try to do it again I believe um but
he<00:01:42.360> wasn't<00:01:42.570> successful<00:01:43.380> that's<00:01:44.100> what<00:01:44.250> I've

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
he wasn't successful that's what I've

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.740 
he wasn't successful that's what I've
heard<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.759> didn't<00:01:45.030> watch<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.210> second<00:01:45.630> one

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
heard I didn't watch the second one

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.980 
heard I didn't watch the second one
though<00:01:45.899> um<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.520> don't<00:01:48.270> think<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.630> okay<00:01:48.960> for

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
though um so I don't think it's okay for

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.670 
though um so I don't think it's okay for
JR<00:01:49.649> smith<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.250> doing<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.049> i<00:01:52.049> think

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
JR smith to be doing that and i think

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.639 
JR smith to be doing that and i think
something<00:01:52.979> needs<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.369> done<00:01:53.460> definitely<00:01:54.000> um

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
something needs to be done definitely um

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.649 
something needs to be done definitely um
so<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.860> $50,000<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> little<00:01:56.880> bit<00:01:57.000> much<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.509> it

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
so if $50,000 a little bit much but it

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.649 
so if $50,000 a little bit much but it
needs<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.200> done<00:01:58.229> i<00:01:58.649> think<00:01:59.399> the<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.240> money

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
needs to be done i think the the money

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.200 
needs to be done i think the the money

there we go I think he has a lot of

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.570 
there we go I think he has a lot of
publicity<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.470> don't<00:02:22.710> think<00:02:22.800> his<00:02:22.950> game<00:02:23.220> is

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.850 
publicity but I don't think his game is
thought<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:24.870> one<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.200> top<00:02:25.230> five

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
thought to be like one of the top five

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.470 
thought to be like one of the top five
players<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.760> league<00:02:27.000> or<00:02:27.210> anything<00:02:27.450> that

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
players in the league or anything that

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.480 
players in the league or anything that

don't<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.490> celtics<00:03:05.670> would<00:03:06.000> want<00:03:06.180> him

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
don't think the celtics would want him

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.230 
don't think the celtics would want him
um<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.920> know<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.070> don't<00:03:08.340> see<00:03:08.550> many<00:03:08.790> teams<00:03:09.090> are

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
um you know I don't see many teams are

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
um you know I don't see many teams are
going<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.420> be<00:03:09.510> interested<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:09.990> them<00:03:10.080> right

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
going to be interested in them right

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.620 
going to be interested in them right
away<00:03:10.410> maybe<00:03:11.070> if<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.520> give<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.730> while<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.480> you

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
away maybe if you give a while and you

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.330 
away maybe if you give a while and you
boost<00:03:13.200> up<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.440> deal<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.740> little<00:03:13.860> bit<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:14.160> throw

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
boost up the deal a little bit you throw

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.040 
boost up the deal a little bit you throw
in<00:03:14.490> another<00:03:14.670> player<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.330> make<00:03:15.600> some<00:03:15.810> draft

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
in another player to make some draft

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.890 
in another player to make some draft
picks<00:03:16.380> which<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.160> don't<00:03:17.340> think<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:18.360> Knicks

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
picks which I don't think the Knicks

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.180 
picks which I don't think the Knicks
want<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.200> be<00:03:19.290> doing<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.739> think<00:03:19.920> they<00:03:20.160> just

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
want to be doing that I think they just

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.130 
want to be doing that I think they just
want<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.700> do<00:03:20.850> like<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.090> one<00:03:21.420> for<00:03:21.660> one<00:03:21.690> type<00:03:22.110> of

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
want to do like a one for one type of

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.240 
want to do like a one for one type of
thing<00:03:23.360> just<00:03:24.360> straight<00:03:24.660> up<00:03:24.690> trade<00:03:25.230> JR<00:03:25.980> smith

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
thing just straight up trade JR smith

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.880 
thing just straight up trade JR smith
for<00:03:26.640> one<00:03:26.880> player<00:03:27.180> or<00:03:27.480> one<00:03:28.200> draft<00:03:28.530> pick<00:03:28.650> you

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
for one player or one draft pick you

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.820 
for one player or one draft pick you
know<00:03:29.040> I'm<00:03:29.220> not<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.450> don't<00:03:31.019> see<00:03:31.230> him<00:03:31.440> going<00:03:31.560> in<00:03:31.769> a

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
know I'm not I don't see him going in a

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.390 
know I'm not I don't see him going in a
multi-player<00:03:32.280> deal<00:03:32.310> but<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.180> do<00:03:33.360> think<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:34.400> he

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
multi-player deal but I do think that he

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.210 
multi-player deal but I do think that he
will<00:03:36.300> eventually<00:03:36.810> get<00:03:36.959> traded<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.560> don't<00:03:38.040> think

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
will eventually get traded I don't think

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.580 
will eventually get traded I don't think
the<00:03:38.340> Knicks<00:03:38.550> will<00:03:38.700> be<00:03:38.790> picking<00:03:39.060> up<00:03:39.239> what<00:03:40.110> we'll

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
the Knicks will be picking up what we'll

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.870 
the Knicks will be picking up what we'll
be<00:03:40.709> dealing<00:03:40.920> with<00:03:41.100> him<00:03:41.340> for<00:03:41.550> too<00:03:41.670> much<00:03:41.820> longer

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
be dealing with him for too much longer

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.150 
be dealing with him for too much longer
I<00:03:42.450> think<00:03:42.810> they've<00:03:43.049> kind<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.380> had<00:03:43.470> enough<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.830> JR

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
I think they've kind of had enough of JR

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.470 
I think they've kind of had enough of JR
smith<00:03:44.400> i<00:03:44.549> think<00:03:44.760> i'm<00:03:44.850> on<00:03:44.910> Shumpert<00:03:45.209> is

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
smith i think i'm on Shumpert is

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.259 
smith i think i'm on Shumpert is
probably<00:03:45.840> better<00:03:46.110> in<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.160> knicks<00:03:47.370> views<00:03:47.970> even

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
probably better in the knicks views even

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.360 
probably better in the knicks views even
though<00:03:48.450> personally<00:03:48.630> i<00:03:48.870> like<00:03:48.989> JR<00:03:49.739> smith<00:03:50.010> better

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
though personally i like JR smith better

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.520 
though personally i like JR smith better
some<00:03:50.700> reason<00:03:51.000> those<00:03:51.269> game<00:03:51.600> it's<00:03:52.170> probably<00:03:52.410> not

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
some reason those game it's probably not

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.860 
some reason those game it's probably not
as<00:03:52.650> good<00:03:52.799> as<00:03:52.950> am<00:03:53.040> on<00:03:53.160> Shumpert<00:03:53.570> you<00:03:54.570> know<00:03:54.660> so

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
as good as am on Shumpert you know so

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.390 
as good as am on Shumpert you know so
they<00:03:54.959> really<00:03:55.230> don't<00:03:55.410> need<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.890> shooting<00:03:56.250> guard

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
they really don't need to shooting guard

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.390 
they really don't need to shooting guard
right<00:03:56.610> there<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:57.780> are<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.170> good<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:58.830> it

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
right there that are that good so it

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.039 
right there that are that good so it
makes<00:03:59.880> sense<00:04:00.030> for<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.390> next<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.690> trade<00:04:00.930> them

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
makes sense for the next to trade them

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.509 
makes sense for the next to trade them
but<00:04:01.709> what<00:04:01.950> teams<00:04:02.160> are<00:04:02.220> going<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.430> be

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
but what teams are going to be

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.000 
but what teams are going to be
interested<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.239> acquiring<00:04:03.750> JR<00:04:04.350> smith<00:04:04.590> you

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
interested in acquiring JR smith you

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.080 
interested in acquiring JR smith you
know<00:04:05.100> I<00:04:05.130> haven't<00:04:05.370> given<00:04:05.489> this<00:04:05.700> tons<00:04:05.970> of

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
know I haven't given this tons of

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.460 
know I haven't given this tons of
thought<00:04:06.239> but<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.480> have<00:04:06.840> thought<00:04:07.049> of<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.260> few

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
thought but I have thought of a few

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.229 
thought but I have thought of a few
different<00:04:07.799> teams<00:04:07.980> maybe<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.760> Clippers<00:04:09.150> would

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
different teams maybe the Clippers would

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.630 
different teams maybe the Clippers would
be<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.420> good<00:04:09.600> potential<00:04:09.930> fit<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.380> think<00:04:10.799> on<00:04:10.950> the

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
be a good potential fit I think on the

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.400 
be a good potential fit I think on the
the<00:04:11.970> Kings<00:04:12.269> would<00:04:12.420> be<00:04:12.570> probably<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.900> best<00:04:13.170> fit

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
the Kings would be probably the best fit

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.780 
the Kings would be probably the best fit
for<00:04:13.440> him<00:04:13.769> you<00:04:14.190> know<00:04:14.250> they're<00:04:14.459> really<00:04:14.670> trying

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
for him you know they're really trying

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.060 
for him you know they're really trying
to<00:04:15.000> rebuild<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.570> team<00:04:15.810> possibly<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.830> denver

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
to rebuild that team possibly the denver

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.159 
to rebuild that team possibly the denver
nuggets<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:18.030> one<00:04:18.299> last<00:04:18.479> team<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:18.840> thought

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
nuggets and one last team that I thought

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.990 
nuggets and one last team that I thought
of<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.979> Detroit<00:04:20.310> Pistons<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.880> know<00:04:20.970> I

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
of is the Detroit Pistons you know I

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.909 
of is the Detroit Pistons you know I
think<00:04:21.269> especially<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:22.140> Kings<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:22.620> think<00:04:22.830> would

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
think especially the Kings I think would

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.110 
think especially the Kings I think would
be<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.039> best<00:04:23.280> fit<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.760> then<00:04:23.910> probably

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
be the best fit and then probably

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.120 
be the best fit and then probably
Clippers<00:04:24.630> on<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.380> Kings<00:04:25.590> are<00:04:25.740> really<00:04:25.950> trying

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
Clippers on the Kings are really trying

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.420 
Clippers on the Kings are really trying
to<00:04:26.310> react<00:04:27.120> that

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
to react that

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.800 
to react that
make<00:04:27.789> it<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:27.970> good<00:04:28.120> team<00:04:28.330> you<00:04:28.360> know<00:04:28.570> they've

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
make it a good team you know they've

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.900 
make it a good team you know they've
been<00:04:28.840> horrible<00:04:29.440> even<00:04:29.710> garbage<00:04:30.039> for<00:04:30.310> many

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
been horrible even garbage for many

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.640 
been horrible even garbage for many
years<00:04:31.240> now<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:32.080> is<00:04:32.110> really<00:04:32.350> trying<00:04:32.560> to

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
years now and that is really trying to

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.650 
years now and that is really trying to
fix<00:04:32.889> that<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:33.370> I<00:04:33.940> think<00:04:34.120> they're<00:04:34.360> gonna<00:04:34.419> have

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
fix that and I think they're gonna have

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.590 
fix that and I think they're gonna have
a<00:04:34.690> little<00:04:34.870> bit<00:04:35.020> of<00:04:35.050> success<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:37.090> think<00:04:37.330> JR

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
a little bit of success and I think JR

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.820 
a little bit of success and I think JR
Smith<00:04:37.870> could<00:04:38.020> definitely<00:04:38.229> help<00:04:38.410> with<00:04:38.560> that<00:04:38.650> so

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
Smith could definitely help with that so

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.040 
Smith could definitely help with that so
I<00:04:38.860> think<00:04:39.100> we<00:04:39.759> uh<00:04:39.789> Kings<00:04:40.570> would<00:04:40.720> be<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.900> best

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
I think we uh Kings would be the best

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.279 
I think we uh Kings would be the best
team<00:04:41.680> for<00:04:42.190> JR<00:04:42.610> smith<00:04:42.880> each<00:04:43.150> rated<00:04:43.509> to<00:04:43.630> but<00:04:44.199> you

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
team for JR smith each rated to but you

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.110 
team for JR smith each rated to but you
know<00:04:44.440> they<00:04:44.979> may<00:04:45.190> not<00:04:45.400> be<00:04:45.520> able<00:04:45.580> to<00:04:45.729> offer<00:04:45.850> with

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
know they may not be able to offer with

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.170 
know they may not be able to offer with
the<00:04:46.240> Knicks<00:04:46.479> warrant<00:04:46.900> /<00:04:47.139> need<00:04:47.470> so<00:04:48.310> we'll<00:04:49.030> see

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
the Knicks warrant / need so we'll see

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.790 
the Knicks warrant / need so we'll see
what<00:04:49.270> happens<00:04:49.449> if<00:04:49.870> it's<00:04:50.050> going<00:04:50.590> to<00:04:50.710> happen

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
what happens if it's going to happen

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.129 
what happens if it's going to happen
with<00:04:51.220> a<00:04:51.340> trade<00:04:51.610> deadline<00:04:51.880> or<00:04:52.210> not<00:04:52.360> I<00:04:52.600> think

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
with a trade deadline or not I think

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:53.969 
with a trade deadline or not I think
this<00:04:53.199> is<00:04:53.259> probably<00:04:53.350> something<00:04:53.650> that's<00:04:53.889> going

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
this is probably something that's going

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.560 
this is probably something that's going
to<00:04:54.039> happen<00:04:54.250> next<00:04:54.550> year<00:04:54.699> picture<00:04:55.150> is<00:04:55.300> three

shoelace<00:05:30.490> ton<00:05:30.789> and<00:05:31.120> also<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:32.229> possibility<00:05:32.440> of

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
shoelace ton and also the possibility of

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.920 
shoelace ton and also the possibility of
him<00:05:33.250> being<00:05:33.310> traded<00:05:33.729> in<00:05:34.060> teams<00:05:34.419> that<00:05:34.599> you<00:05:34.690> think

would possibly pick him up what teamed

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.399 
would possibly pick him up what teamed
would<00:05:39.250> he<00:05:39.400> fit<00:05:39.639> well<00:05:39.880> with<00:05:40.150> so<00:05:40.599> guys<00:05:40.750> on<00:05:41.050> the
