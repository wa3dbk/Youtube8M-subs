00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.709 

but<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:26.310> being<00:02:26.489> said<00:02:26.549> it<00:02:27.060> has<00:02:27.359> worked<00:02:27.599> well

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
but that being said it has worked well

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:33.020 
but that being said it has worked well
for<00:02:28.079> me<00:02:28.249> it's<00:02:29.249> kept<00:02:29.549> my<00:02:30.109> motorcycle<00:02:32.030> fairly

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
for me it's kept my motorcycle fairly

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.289 
for me it's kept my motorcycle fairly
decently<00:02:33.450> covered<00:02:34.340> for<00:02:35.340> most<00:02:35.549> rain<00:02:35.819> storms

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
decently covered for most rain storms

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.140 
decently covered for most rain storms
and<00:02:38.599> yeah<00:02:39.599> a<00:02:39.780> little<00:02:40.109> update<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.879> still

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
and yeah a little update it is still

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.819 
and yeah a little update it is still
going<00:02:42.450> strong<00:02:42.750> i<00:02:43.139> doubt<00:02:43.379> it<00:02:43.530> would<00:02:43.590> last

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
going strong i doubt it would last

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.360 
going strong i doubt it would last
another<00:02:44.670> year<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.239> if<00:02:45.359> i<00:02:45.450> had<00:02:45.599> bought<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:46.019> then

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
another year and if i had bought it then

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.349 
another year and if i had bought it then
yeah<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.549> wouldn't<00:02:47.760> have<00:02:47.879> worked<00:02:47.939> at<00:02:48.239> all

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
yeah it wouldn't have worked at all

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.489 
yeah it wouldn't have worked at all
considering<00:02:48.989> it's<00:02:49.260> made<00:02:49.469> for<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:49.919> camping

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:51.499 
considering it's made for like camping

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.699 
considering it's made for like camping
but<00:02:52.499> yeah<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:52.919> i<00:02:53.189> recommend<00:02:53.879> just<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.389> typical

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
but yeah so i recommend just a typical

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.420 
but yeah so i recommend just a typical
motorcycle<00:02:55.709> cover<00:02:56.010> would<00:02:56.069> probably<00:02:56.370> work

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
motorcycle cover would probably work

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.959 
motorcycle cover would probably work
better<00:02:59.030> yeah<00:03:00.030> see<00:03:00.629> you<00:03:00.719> guys<00:03:00.840> later
