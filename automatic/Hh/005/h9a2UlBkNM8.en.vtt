talking about the layout of the seek
romantic<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:06.330> reason<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:06.810> so<00:00:07.080> we<00:00:07.200> can

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
romantic and the reason is so we can

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.709 
romantic and the reason is so we can
play<00:00:07.680> all<00:00:07.980> 12<00:00:08.309> major<00:00:08.580> scales<00:00:08.970> easily<00:00:09.480> and

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
play all 12 major scales easily and

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.280 
play all 12 major scales easily and
learn<00:00:09.990> about<00:00:10.200> scales<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:11.730> here<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.929> AC

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
learn about scales so here is AC

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.099 
learn about scales so here is AC
diatonic<00:00:14.250> harmonica<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.120> I'm<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:16.049> to

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
diatonic harmonica and I'm going to

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.140 
diatonic harmonica and I'm going to
start<00:00:16.440> on<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.770> C<00:00:16.920> diatonic<00:00:17.490> harmonica<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
start on the C diatonic harmonica to

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.939 
start on the C diatonic harmonica to
give<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> comparison<00:00:18.960> because<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> lot<00:00:19.920> of

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
give you a comparison because a lot of

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.650 
give you a comparison because a lot of
us<00:00:20.130> know<00:00:20.340> about<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.789> C<00:00:20.939> diatonic<00:00:21.539> harmonica

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
us know about the C diatonic harmonica

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.740 
us know about the C diatonic harmonica
so<00:00:22.439> it's<00:00:22.590> kind<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.980> reference<00:00:23.189> point<00:00:25.760> if<00:00:26.760> you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
so it's kind of a reference point if you

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.160 
so it's kind of a reference point if you
start<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.109> four<00:00:28.349> blow<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.010> see<00:00:30.170> it's

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
start on four blow on the see it's

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.870 
start on four blow on the see it's
pretty<00:00:31.470> easy<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.859> get<00:00:32.040> during<00:00:32.219> me<00:00:32.430> fossel<00:00:32.759> on

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
chromatic harmonica when they number you

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.630 
chromatic harmonica when they number you
know<00:02:35.380> how<00:02:35.470> those<00:02:35.650> little<00:02:35.890> numbers<00:02:36.040> on<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.460> top

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
know how those little numbers on the top

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.680 
know how those little numbers on the top
of<00:02:36.880> your<00:02:37.030> instrument<00:02:37.570> when<00:02:38.230> they<00:02:38.410> number<00:02:38.800> it

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
of your instrument when they number it

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.630 
of your instrument when they number it
some<00:02:40.690> chromatic<00:02:41.080> number<00:02:41.560> at<00:02:41.800> one<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.160> sixteen

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
some chromatic number at one to sixteen

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.300 
some chromatic number at one to sixteen
and<00:02:42.910> some<00:02:43.570> number<00:02:43.959> at<00:02:44.110> one<00:02:44.500> two<00:02:44.740> three<00:02:45.010> four

and some number at one two three four

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.850 
and some number at one two three four
and<00:02:45.580> then<00:02:45.900> one<00:02:46.900> two<00:02:47.080> three<00:02:47.290> four<00:02:47.500> five<00:02:47.680> six

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
and then one two three four five six

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.640 
and then one two three four five six
seven<00:02:48.040> eight<00:02:48.220> nine<00:02:48.280> ten<00:02:48.610> eleven<00:02:48.880> twelve

seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
so<00:02:50.650> they<00:02:50.830> they<00:02:51.730> have<00:02:51.940> two<00:02:52.330> octaves<00:02:52.840> on<00:02:52.959> the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
so they they have two octaves on the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.830 
so they they have two octaves on the
bottom<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.770> very<00:02:54.010> lowest<00:02:54.250> says<00:02:54.790> 1<00:02:55.000> 2<00:02:55.180> 3<00:02:55.330> 4<00:02:55.600> and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
bottom the very lowest says 1 2 3 4 and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.870 
bottom the very lowest says 1 2 3 4 and
then<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.020> next<00:02:56.140> lowest<00:02:56.680> or<00:02:56.890> next<00:02:57.730> highest

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
then the next lowest or next highest

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.920 
then the next lowest or next highest
says<00:02:58.600> 1<00:02:58.870> 2<00:02:59.080> 3<00:02:59.290> 4<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.730> your<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.360> should<00:03:01.570> be<00:03:01.690> smart

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
says 1 2 3 4 so your you should be smart

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.490 
says 1 2 3 4 so your you should be smart
enough<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.140> know<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:03.550> second<00:03:04.000> one<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:05.260> 1

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
enough to know that the second one so 1

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.100 
enough to know that the second one so 1
2<00:03:05.650> 3<00:03:05.800> 4<00:03:06.070> 1<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.640> really<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.300> fifth<00:03:07.540> hole<00:03:07.750> on<00:03:07.989> the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
2 3 4 1 is really the fifth hole on the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.920 
2 3 4 1 is really the fifth hole on the
chromatic<00:03:08.680> but<00:03:09.160> in<00:03:09.250> any<00:03:09.400> case<00:03:09.489> on<00:03:09.850> either<00:03:10.570> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
chromatic but in any case on either the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.620 
chromatic but in any case on either the
diet<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.620> 12<00:03:12.459> hole<00:03:12.670> or<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.030> 16<00:03:13.420> hole

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
diet the 12 hole or the 16 hole

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.020 
diet the 12 hole or the 16 hole
chromatic<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.590> have<00:03:14.800> 3<00:03:15.160> or<00:03:15.340> 4<00:03:15.850> respectively

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
chromatic you have 3 or 4 respectively

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.880 
chromatic you have 3 or 4 respectively
octaves<00:03:19.030> which<00:03:19.959> have<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.739> exact<00:03:21.280> same<00:03:21.910> layout

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
octaves which have the exact same layout

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.090 
octaves which have the exact same layout
so<00:03:23.890> if<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.430> learn<00:03:25.140> how<00:03:26.140> to<00:03:26.170> play<00:03:26.500> in<00:03:26.799> one

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
so if you learn how to play in one

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.979 
so if you learn how to play in one
octave<00:03:27.280> under<00:03:27.700> chromatic<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.570> learn<00:03:28.810> how<00:03:28.959> to

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
octave under chromatic you learn how to

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.440 
octave under chromatic you learn how to
play<00:03:29.260> in<00:03:29.470> all<00:03:30.130> of<00:03:30.280> them<00:03:30.690> now<00:03:31.690> in<00:03:32.500> order<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.459> the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
play in all of them now in order and the

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.550 
play in all of them now in order and the
first<00:03:34.480> octave<00:03:35.320> on<00:03:35.440> for<00:03:35.980> blow<00:03:36.280> seek<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.560> begin

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
first octave on for blow seek and begin

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.820 
first octave on for blow seek and begin
the<00:03:39.130> second<00:03:39.610> octave<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.150> 5<00:03:40.780> blow<00:03:41.080> see<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:44.590> have

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
the second octave on 5 blow see you have

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.789 
the second octave on 5 blow see you have
to<00:03:45.040> make<00:03:45.220> both<00:03:45.519> 5<00:03:45.850> blow<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.450> 4<00:03:46.959> blow<00:03:47.200> for<00:03:47.769> blow

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
to make both 5 blow and 4 blow for blow

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.610 
to make both 5 blow and 4 blow for blow
five<00:03:48.190> blow<00:03:48.220> see<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:49.720> here's<00:03:49.959> four<00:03:50.200> blow<00:03:50.380> five

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
five blow see so here's four blow five

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.030 
five blow see so here's four blow five
blow<00:03:51.900> same<00:03:52.900> note<00:03:55.380> or<00:03:56.380> if<00:03:56.500> you<00:03:56.590> play<00:03:56.739> them<00:03:56.890> both

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
blow same note or if you play them both

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.320 
blow same note or if you play them both
at<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.340> same<00:03:57.549> time

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
at the same time

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.360 
at the same time
you<00:03:59.900> get<00:04:00.080> a<00:04:00.110> shimmering<00:04:00.470> sound<00:04:00.860> kind<00:04:01.130> of<00:04:01.190> like

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
you get a shimmering sound kind of like

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.450 
you get a shimmering sound kind of like
an<00:04:01.520> octave<00:04:01.850> so<00:04:02.480> those<00:04:02.690> are<00:04:02.870> two<00:04:03.350> techniques<00:04:04.220> I

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
an octave so those are two techniques I

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.100 
an octave so those are two techniques I
just<00:04:04.490> showed<00:04:04.880> you<00:04:04.910> that<00:04:05.090> make<00:04:05.780> interesting

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
just showed you that make interesting

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.770 
just showed you that make interesting
sounds<00:04:06.680> on<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:07.100> chromatic<00:04:07.610> the<00:04:08.330> same<00:04:08.540> thing

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
sounds on the chromatic the same thing

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.010 
sounds on the chromatic the same thing
happens<00:04:09.170> on<00:04:09.350> holes<00:04:09.860> 8<00:04:10.550> &amp;<00:04:10.910> 9<00:04:10.940> below<00:04:11.630> they<00:04:11.990> are

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
happens on holes 8 &amp; 9 below they are

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.360 
happens on holes 8 &amp; 9 below they are
both<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.470> note<00:04:12.650> C<00:04:13.270> now<00:04:14.270> you<00:04:14.990> may<00:04:15.140> ask<00:04:15.350> me<00:04:15.680> which

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
both the note C now you may ask me which

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.630 
both the note C now you may ask me which
C<00:04:17.030> should<00:04:17.390> I<00:04:17.510> play<00:04:17.750> four<00:04:18.320> blow<00:04:18.530> five<00:04:18.680> blow<00:04:18.950> and

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
C should I play four blow five blow and

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.250 
C should I play four blow five blow and
I've<00:04:19.730> got<00:04:19.940> all<00:04:20.060> kinds<00:04:20.390> of<00:04:20.420> opinions<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.140> it

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
I've got all kinds of opinions and it

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.910 
I've got all kinds of opinions and it
depends<00:04:21.709> on<00:04:21.830> what's<00:04:22.610> going<00:04:22.910> on<00:04:23.030> musically<00:04:23.600> and

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
depends on what's going on musically and

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.040 
depends on what's going on musically and
but<00:04:24.920> my<00:04:25.070> biggest<00:04:25.340> opinion<00:04:25.880> is<00:04:26.240> it<00:04:26.510> doesn't

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
but my biggest opinion is it doesn't

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.580 
but my biggest opinion is it doesn't
matter

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
matter

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.310 
matter
a<00:04:27.620> C<00:04:28.220> is<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.400> C<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:28.730> if<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:29.060> get<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.450> note<00:04:29.750> C

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
a C is a C and if you get the note C
