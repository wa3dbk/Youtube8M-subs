00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.439
 so cash 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:02.980
 are Massa one 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.779
 of course no normal but the formula 1 among the cutting tools 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.319
 Damascenes sound 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.789
 For centuries, the art of the old blacksmiths was masters from Damascus 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.419
 Forgot now and rediscover the secrets they get 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:21.210
 Once again, the fair is forged out of folded 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:26.810
 secondly 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.810
 he steel forged after ancient body 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.809
 in his smithy between Hamburg and Lübeck the chances of a break are the time 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:35.670
 back 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.620
 As a raw material serve discarded industry writes 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.680
 Selge Blatter ball bearings and freedom 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.470
 Davos made French knives for Cu Chi and Qi Gong 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 today, never got a hunting knife 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.410
 This is best suited for filing steel and one very strong 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.700
 only two women countless secrets on which the high quality its 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.700
 Knife threatens 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.160
 is fired with beechwood coal 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 a special charcoal without sulfur and phosphorus 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.940
 Prevent Battenfeld 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.370
 Lavinia Wilson 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.460
 and percent 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.350
 the place belongs 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.050
 new to it 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.050
 five are satisfied 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.890
 Customers received 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.890
 in Poland and Malta 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.530
 relentlessly Criticizes nine discs 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.480
 five slices of another star not with four slices of porcelain 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.060
 This creates a six centimeters of the cards 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.010
 every knife is a point for the Messdiener Profi 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 put forward polling stations at their work 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.449
 so far, for example, succeed 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.449
 at the six times the ball would have arranged immediately afterwards 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.109
 then become 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.109
 they stand out again 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.339
 all women 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.029
 in it 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:31.729
 who is right 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.139
 there we belong in the best of all confusion of the turn 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.599
 almost 1000 100 degrees heat 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.599
 otherwise, the reinforced concrete will not burn much more 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:50.089
 and pressure 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:55.229
 This is the only way to make steel shapes and folds an exhausting job as well 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.999
 with the help of Leader Hamas 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:01.869
 in the interplay of the 70-year-old machine with the timpani 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.289
 The star fits perfectly 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.289
 2 percent 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.389
 Berlin - make by hand 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.929
 is this balance pulled to measure not only in Aachen measure 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.899
 "It costs a lot of money 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.899
 but you have registered very once 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.129
 so it does not fit 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.299
 the French have cut the pairs to twice the length 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.930
 critical for Kate the new plant for steel simply in the middle around her 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.289
 after that to his wrinkles 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:39.579
 compressed two different carbon content of the steel grades used 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.009
 So has the quality of the sounds 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:45.459
 the higher the carbon 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.259
 the harder the later Queen 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:52.449
 up to six folds all not useful for the cutting edge property 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.319
 a knife after that, according to Ried changed only the optics 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.169
 the picture thus lower than in April 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.299
 but Dr 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.589
 Neat maintenance becomes even higher 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:16.389
 only if she is not for the time being will not be able to do much less 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.229
 March participated 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.120
 Petri find many voices on the internet 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.120
 Round later in Münsterfeld sword influence 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.490
 the Frenchman shoots from 10 years of experience 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.620
 and has valued that and seldom much worse 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.550
 but he also never knows exactly how the knife was designed 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 the flags of the blade is freaked out 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.490
 The blacksmith changes the so-called tarnished later 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.490
 be add 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.660
 Berlin Treatment fired for later 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.009
 but before that the smithy tracks should disappear the blade will be clean though 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.009
 not sharpened yet 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.680
 the decisive moment 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.759
 the 800 degree hot kids going 150 degrees hot can be deterred 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.490
 Wirtz hardened 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.250
 it followed scratch test without business should be the cutting edge against space 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.419
 to prove 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.490
 we'll sit down like that 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.979
 that is not true 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.800
 the problem me times 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.800
 and then cut that's a bit harder 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.370
 per child 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.469
 I think that's enough 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.569
 Now we go by 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.099
 in which other professions 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.550
 The clinic can be sprayed 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.419
 and will be called for an hour at 200 degrees 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.129
 the first dimension is elastic 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.029
 Rietz provides all the sharpness with all his experience Andersen Schleifstein 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:12.340
 Basel sda 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.889
 has no patterns environmentally friendly make IntelCenter honest visible 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.919
 the surface has to bury itself so cleanly before burying itself 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.229
 even the smallest impurities can destroy everything 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.240
 Trieste dives the blade for 20 minutes in texts that are such a case 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:35.319
 The liquid attacks the steel grades used to varying degrees 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.719
 This is how the typical Damascene patterns are formed 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:41.719
 for the blacksmith the moment of truth 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:47.650
 the stage is relieved 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.940
 how must the rule have come out as moderately from Rabbis z very well 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.899
 clearly it is absolutely error free 

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:58.030
 if it is not fair also the cut test exists 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.129
 it will reach a price of 1000 euros 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:06.240
 Only a handful of blacksmiths in Europe work at an embarrassingly high level 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.580
 Each year, Chang US Treats only makes half a dozen such high-quality products 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.110
 sound 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.529
 Technique 

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:16.580
 pure formality 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.729
 because the Frenchman's knives are not only uniquely beautiful 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:23.449
 his country is also incredibly hot 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:26.150
 who wants to can persist with it
