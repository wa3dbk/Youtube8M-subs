village<00:03:35.340> back<00:03:35.610> there<00:03:35.910> in<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.180> flat<00:03:36.480> lens<00:03:36.720> but

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
village back there in that flat lens but

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.289 
village back there in that flat lens but
if<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.860> pursue<00:03:38.220> off<00:03:38.489> into<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:38.910> direction

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299

called
ravine<00:03:54.330> look<00:03:54.630> at<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.930> yeah<00:03:55.110> that's<00:03:55.320> amazing

ravine look at that yeah that's amazing
no<00:03:56.250> over<00:03:56.430> here<00:03:56.610> i<00:03:56.640> put<00:03:56.910> bookshelfs<00:03:57.630> and

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
no over here i put bookshelfs and

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.350 
no over here i put bookshelfs and
cobblestone<00:03:58.170> reason<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.740> did<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:58.950> was

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
cobblestone reason I did that was

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.060 
cobblestone reason I did that was
straight<00:04:00.360> up<00:04:00.510> it's<00:04:00.750> uh<00:04:00.890> there's<00:04:01.890> like<00:04:02.040> a

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
straight up it's uh there's like a

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.190 
straight up it's uh there's like a
monster<00:04:02.610> spawner<00:04:02.730> right<00:04:03.240> beside<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.720> library

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
monster spawner right beside the library

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.960 
monster spawner right beside the library
so<00:04:04.560> it's<00:04:04.740> like<00:04:04.890> you<00:04:05.040> know<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.160> got<00:04:05.550> a<00:04:05.610> feature

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
so it's like you know I got a feature

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.630 
so it's like you know I got a feature
this<00:04:06.320> again<00:04:07.320> you<00:04:07.530> know<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.830> is<00:04:08.070> cool<00:04:08.400> but

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
this again you know this is cool but

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.310 
this again you know this is cool but
there's<00:04:08.850> two<00:04:09.060> chests<00:04:09.540> within<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.960> monster

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
there's two chests within the monster

there's two chests within the monster
spawner<00:04:11.210> within<00:04:12.210> this<00:04:12.360> library<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.220> obvious

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
spawner within this library and obvious

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.770 
spawner within this library and obvious
you<00:04:14.370> know<00:04:14.490> if<00:04:14.610> we're<00:04:14.820> in<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:15.000> library<00:04:15.120> we're<00:04:15.690> in

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
you know if we're in a library we're in

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.570 
you know if we're in a library we're in
a<00:04:15.870> stronghold<00:04:16.170> so<00:04:16.770> those<00:04:17.220> were<00:04:17.430> the

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
a stronghold so those were the

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.350 
a stronghold so those were the
coordinates<00:04:18.200> let's<00:04:19.200> move<00:04:19.440> on<00:04:19.680> here<00:04:20.150> over<00:04:21.150> here

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
coordinates let's move on here over here

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.550 
coordinates let's move on here over here
actually<00:04:21.600> guys<00:04:21.959> this<00:04:22.140> is<00:04:22.290> where<00:04:22.470> the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
actually guys this is where the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.640 
actually guys this is where the
stronghold<00:04:23.220> is<00:04:23.540> now<00:04:24.540> if<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.170> could<00:04:25.380> come<00:04:25.590> to

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
stronghold is now if you could come to

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.230 
stronghold is now if you could come to
these<00:04:25.860> coordinates<00:04:26.100> actually<00:04:26.760> you<00:04:26.910> should

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
these coordinates actually you should

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.570 
these coordinates actually you should
land<00:04:27.600> I'll<00:04:28.260> pull<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.590> coordinates<00:04:29.220> up<00:04:29.400> here

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
land I'll pull the coordinates up here

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.000 
land I'll pull the coordinates up here
in<00:04:29.670> a<00:04:29.730> second<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:31.020> should<00:04:31.200> land<00:04:31.440> somewhere<00:04:31.950> in
