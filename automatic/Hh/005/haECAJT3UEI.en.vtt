of how long it has been around will have
to<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.330> spongebob<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.020> cartoon<00:01:16.560> could<00:01:16.920> be

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
to be spongebob that cartoon could be

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.120 
to be spongebob that cartoon could be
around<00:01:17.400> for<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.330> long<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.290> guarantee<00:01:19.890> it

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
around for so long and I guarantee it

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.219 
around for so long and I guarantee it
would<00:01:20.220> get<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> same<00:01:20.549> another<00:01:21.180> viewer<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.110> it

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
would get the same another viewer as it

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.719 
would get the same another viewer as it
did<00:01:22.350> when<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.530> first<00:01:22.590> started<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.340> amazing

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
did when it first started it's amazing

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.490 
did when it first started it's amazing
the<00:01:23.820> blue<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.240> show<00:01:24.479> started<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.170> think

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the blue that I show started and I think

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.969 
the blue that I show started and I think
it<00:01:25.680> said<00:01:26.330> 1998<00:01:27.330> was<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.259> very<00:01:28.560> first<00:01:28.619> episode

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
it said 1998 was the very first episode

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.219 
it said 1998 was the very first episode
easy<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.700> another<00:01:29.909> 1997<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.810> was<00:01:30.900> one<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.049> those

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
easy to another 1997 it was one of those

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.480 
easy to another 1997 it was one of those
I<00:01:31.500> think<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> main<00:01:31.950> reason<00:01:32.009> why<00:01:32.310> spongebob

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
I think the main reason why spongebob

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.679 
I think the main reason why spongebob
has<00:01:32.759> been<00:01:32.880> around<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.299> long<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.659> because

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
has been around for so long is because

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.840 
has been around for so long is because
that's<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.409> that's<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.860> TV<00:01:35.040> show<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.549> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
that's really that's a TV show that you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.310 
that's really that's a TV show that you
know<00:01:35.939> doesn't<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> main<00:01:36.840> point<00:01:37.170> do

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
know doesn't really have a main point do

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.719 
know doesn't really have a main point do
it<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.619> legitimately<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.430> kind<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
it it's legitimately just kind of the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.580 
it it's legitimately just kind of the
daily<00:01:39.060> lives<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.420> SpongeBob<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:39.930> Patrick<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
daily lives of SpongeBob and Patrick and
