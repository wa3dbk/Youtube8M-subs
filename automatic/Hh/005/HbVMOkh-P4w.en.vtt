00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.529
 hello and welcome to another tutorial 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.110
 total decoration easy with style in 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.300
 this opportunity we are going to make a 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.130
 beautiful centerpiece with flowers 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.379
 natural 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.020
 for this centerpiece we are going to 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.790
 need glass cylinders 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.870
 decorative ribbon 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:48.690
 foliage a flower for each of the 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.690
 centerpieces and a wooden base 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.540
 we start decorating the edge of each 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.079
 one of the cylinders with a piece of 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.079
 tape 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.890
 We use hot silicone to stick it 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.420
 now we select the foliage that we're going 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.750
 to use in each of the centers 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.750
 table 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.579
 once the foliage selection has been made 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.380
 let's stick it to the bottom edge of the 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.110
 cylinder 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.600
 for this we are going to use a piece of my 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.600
 castle and make a very strong knot 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.630
 let's integrate the foliage 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.680
 to 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.400
 and with the help of hot silicone 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.260
 let's go hitting 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.260
 pieces of foliage 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.010
 ah 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.640
 Y 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.260
 we put the cylinder inside the base 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.330
 wooden 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.569
 if we do not have this wooden base 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.260
 we can use a ceramic plate or a 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.260
 clay plate 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.600
 so that the centerpieces last longer 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:25.480
 you should do it calmly one day 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:28.810
 previous and have the foliage refrigerated 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.360
 only at the time of placing the center 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.080
 of table 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.730
 you must enter the flower making a 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.730
 diagonal cut in it 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.490
 we put the flower inside the cylinder 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.780
 then when you're going to put it together in each 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.470
 one of the tables 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.050
 you must incorporate cold water a good 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.990
 idea to give a different touch to 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:02.260
 this centerpiece will place a 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.870
 drop of dyes to paint the water 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.200
 we must place a drop of dye 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.660
 for each of the centerpieces 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.960
 we complete with natural water 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.200
 and in this way we have made a 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.110
 Very nice and very simple centerpiece 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.780
