to<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.670> stock<00:00:42.910> connector<00:00:43.320> since<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.470> is

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
to the stock connector since it is

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.470 
to the stock connector since it is
aftermarket<00:00:45.250> sometimes<00:00:45.610> you<00:00:45.760> don't<00:00:45.940> have<00:00:46.210> a

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
aftermarket sometimes you don't have a

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.530 
aftermarket sometimes you don't have a
direct<00:00:46.989> plug<00:00:47.650> in<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:48.130> your<00:00:48.280> factory<00:00:48.489> plug<00:00:48.970> so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
direct plug in to your factory plug so

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.960 
direct plug in to your factory plug so
we<00:00:49.690> do<00:00:49.840> include<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.320> Spade<00:00:50.620> wires<00:00:50.920> let<00:00:51.879> me

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
we do include the Spade wires let me

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.400 
we do include the Spade wires let me
show<00:00:52.090> you<00:00:52.150> how<00:00:52.300> this<00:00:52.450> works<00:00:52.660> okay<00:00:53.379> so

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
wires okay you have a spade on each end

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.119 
wires okay you have a spade on each end
of<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.360> wire<00:00:58.510> and<00:00:58.780> what<00:00:59.290> you<00:00:59.379> have<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.650> do<00:00:59.830> is

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
of the wire and what you have to do is

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.680 
of the wire and what you have to do is
push<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:01.270> pins<00:01:01.630> into<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:03.040> socket<00:01:03.910> on<00:01:04.059> your

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
push the pins into the socket on your

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.810 
push the pins into the socket on your
stock<00:01:04.930> connector<00:01:05.440> okay<00:01:05.890> so<00:01:06.369> you<00:01:06.460> simply

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
stock connector okay so you simply

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.180 
stock connector okay so you simply
insert<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.390> pin<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.720> push<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:08.020> in<00:01:08.170> insert<00:01:09.009> the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
insert the pin and push it in insert the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.249 
insert the pin and push it in insert the
other<00:01:09.340> pin<00:01:09.610> and<00:01:09.759> push<00:01:09.910> it<00:01:10.060> in<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.390> voila

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
other pin and push it in and voila

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.859 
other pin and push it in and voila
you're<00:01:11.680> done<00:01:11.710> now<00:01:12.460> what<00:01:13.210> you'll<00:01:13.390> notice<00:01:13.420> is

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
you're done now what you'll notice is

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.420 
you're done now what you'll notice is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
okay that means you could have the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.889 
okay that means you could have the
polarity<00:01:18.340> reversed<00:01:18.729> okay<00:01:19.270> so<00:01:19.330> in<00:01:19.570> other<00:01:19.690> words

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899
