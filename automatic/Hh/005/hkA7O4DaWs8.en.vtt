 hello everyone, this is my first 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.500
 commented video that has a beginning 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.870
 but luckily he always had good 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.210
 friends who have supported me 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.230
 some big youtubers that do not value 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.170
 this video is dedicated to omni whip 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.850

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.910
 better not so good pressure that's left 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.330
 there find or get a laugh we 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.880
 summed up the channel in 20 seconds but of 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.140
 everything I'm left with a phrase that's why 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.540
 I do not like talking about missions 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.150
 impossible but from improbable missions 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.590
 worth the thousand subscribers, it's just a 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.710
 number this will not change anything now 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.250
 the channel is great and good before 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:44.330

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.330
