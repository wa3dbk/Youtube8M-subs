00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.090
 danny has short side you are going for one 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.710
 whole team who is then back again 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.529
 put 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.300
 yes in itself do well in the end 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.610
 look in the name of a vacation for a long time 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.170
 season but I still think one 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.579
 a bit disappointing because 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.489
 everyone expected us there 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.840
 would become champion after seven to 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.850
 ten own father millions with the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.260
 cable to the carriage otherwise so 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.970
 yummy 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.489
 you had that one that youth that k yes how 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.430
 how did i get back 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.110
 what kind of impression does it have, yes, it 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.309
 is of course very nice to be there 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.340
 to be 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.660
 Was a bit disappointing about the yes 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.940
 to more and more five thousand men like that 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.300
 So it didn't really stand it 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.649
 feeling that this is a lot of love but yes that 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.660
 is of course many qualities that 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.039
 group and if you can join the day 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.110
 trainer you I would only 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.970
 better off 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.070
 that I was you there together with daley blind 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.149
 you can do well with ricardo van rhijn 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.800
 explain why you were a week earlier 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.229
 You are in that country for another week 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.119
 vacation you think it's pretty logical 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.630
 I mean you could have played almost anything 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.119
 last year and I don't look so 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.439
 and decided it was better for that 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.110
 me to connect earlier too 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.000
 because yes as a group you will become real 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.070
 that such a can so it is for me 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.079
 nice to be back again 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.790
 who also likes to be here yes 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.130
 I know for sure I am a player of 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.049
 ajax and i also have my goals so it 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.250
 is definitely better for me to spend more time on 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.570
 report 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.979
 how do you like it here when you look the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.270
 between the mountains a good one 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.479
 circumstances nice field 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.430
 nice hotel how is it yes it's top 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.259
 it is perfectly arranged it the whole 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.780
 beautiful and as said, what are there too 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.149
 very good at it i would tell him here 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.659
 everything use market and the hotel you have 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.219
 spa a cold warm outside and we 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.649
 you can also ride the mountain and with the bikes 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.570
 so you got everything yesterday 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.680
 have been the storeroom or are not hunters 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.180
 with a group of 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.430
 nine men were my son in the storage room 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.569
 have been pretty steep you have to say 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.950
 how was that yes is quite weak it 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.230
 just getting higher and higher so you 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.000
 don't really have the time to rest 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.439
 but yes it is really nice in you 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.989
 thighs and you feel and of course you do 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.639
 then to day but hey how strong your right 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.930
 for where i get you easy that's it 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.069
 are in season 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.959
 that was a little alternative 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.280
 trainings how are the the training on 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.870
 the field 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.109
 it is ajax i think that very well 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.489
 that we don't start fairly calmly 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.889
 that everyone thought that they could no longer do so 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.230
 so it is being tackled very well 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:50.109
 and slowly we try to 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.930
 our playground ride to work and yes so 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.609
 now it's just going to be top fit and then 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.319
 years later the tactical things could 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.419
 they go that way archaic 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.090
 it with your little finger what exactly do you have 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:03.879
 I figured out 5 months ago 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.680
 my pc tendon torn in my little finger and 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.060
 that was good for two months in the morning 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.340
 so a duel was ripped again 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.389
 camera 10 weeks in the plaster runner 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.889
 you have a lot of problems with it now 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.849
 not taped in and happens 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.889
 that still 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.739
 yes it is a small small plaster 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.030
 but yes it is very annoying 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.000
 because you will eventually notice 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.159
 need a ping and and duels and want 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.540
 you sometimes fly off but it does 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.590
 just annoyingly easy again 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.150
 Stay ahead of him if you're a bit ahead 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.120
 look at what your goals are 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.949
 season I think it is very special 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.540
 what I want to play more 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:40.239
 and of course I also want basic player 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.500
 so here i am last year 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.959
 of course a very nice season for that 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.370
 I have already been because I am the one 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.169
 have made quite a move 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.750
 have a new experience for many minutes 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.310
 but yes you want more and more 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.220
 soccer player so I want that boss too 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.299
 play is recognized processing is it 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.370
 again that you are already starting from it 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.620
 start the at winter that you don't let us 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.689
 ice comes to let you flow 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.720
 yes know for sure view and part ii and 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.489
 Ricardo who are already basic players so yes 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.709
 it's a book that deserves a vacation 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.659
 but yes I am still completely 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.129
 nothing so I still have to work hard and 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.109
 that's why I think so 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.549
 I am never going to rule any more parts 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.690
 compared to last season last 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.889
 season came to talk to you because you have one 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.509
 did not transfer with the real or it 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.270
 Begin by immediately got what you see 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.099
 can be precise and those practice games 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.330
 That can also show you because what you are in 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.099
 home 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
 and you what you are you can be quite late 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.490
 at first there and then she 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.080
 competition already in full swing and 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.510
 and now you can quietly cooperate with 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.529
 everyone and for a moment they say no 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.779
 say 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:41.159
 try to get the fixed number 9 from ajax 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:41.159
 then my intentions will
