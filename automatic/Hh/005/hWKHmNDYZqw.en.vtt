00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello hello kymco review on 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:09.240
 communication is the next passage 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:15.240
 single missions and so we took with us 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.430
 21 barbarian and 9 bows we need 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:25.050
 to destroy 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:26.880
 This Goblin Base Line Maginot Like 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.890
 see here we have bombs so be 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.890
 neat first release one by one 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.120
 see all the bomb we have destroyed and 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:47.030
 now you can easily release everything 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:53.539
 mortar troops we will destroy 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.539
 bows gently paste in a circle 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:08.180
 all protective structures do not have that can 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:14.030
 protect this base so calmly 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:19.840
 destroy must see to 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:24.979
 end comments, in principle, nothing 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.190
 goes just farm arrogant farm pay 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.760
 attention here I made a mistake here 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.979
 at the top 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:37.580
 Now I have the maximum amount 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:39.650
 gold is already gold 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.810
 could earn extra 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:49.930
 I just fly away now 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.930
 somewhere besides storage 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.840
 on this principle in this video all 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.030
 remember to pay attention to bombs 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.580
 who were at the very beginning first 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.810
 let out one barbarian before we meet again 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.810
 bye to everyone bye
