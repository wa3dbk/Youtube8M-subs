00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
observation because what we also believe

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
observation because what we also believe
is<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.780> current<00:01:04.229> behavior<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> great

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
is that current behavior is a great

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700 
is that current behavior is a great
indication<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.270> future<00:01:06.540> behavior<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.229> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
indication of what future behavior is so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.560 
indication of what future behavior is so
if<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.890> understand<00:01:08.460> how<00:01:08.729> people<00:01:09.270> are

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
if you understand how people are

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.840 
if you understand how people are
currently<00:01:09.990> behaving<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.130> shape<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
currently behaving you can shape and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.880 
currently behaving you can shape and
predict<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.810> way<00:01:12.930> their<00:01:13.140> future<00:01:13.439> behavior<00:01:13.590> is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
predict the way their future behavior is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.020 
predict the way their future behavior is
going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.000> just

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
going to be so what we do is just

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.240 
going to be so what we do is just
understand<00:01:15.810> current<00:01:16.049> behavior<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.710> no

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
understand current behavior and no

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.560 
understand current behavior and no
better<00:01:17.460> way<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> understand<00:01:18.240> current

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
better way to understand current

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.350 
better way to understand current
behavior<00:01:18.960> than<00:01:19.140> observation<00:01:20.000> back<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.240> his
