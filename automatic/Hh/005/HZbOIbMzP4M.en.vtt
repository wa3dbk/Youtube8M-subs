caliper<00:02:03.210> which<00:02:03.480> I'm<00:02:03.780> sure<00:02:03.930> isn't<00:02:04.080> cheap<00:02:04.380> but

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
caliper which I'm sure isn't cheap but

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.400 
caliper which I'm sure isn't cheap but
anyway<00:02:06.210> gonna<00:02:06.480> try<00:02:06.630> lubricating<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.170> crap

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
anyway gonna try lubricating the crap

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.570 
anyway gonna try lubricating the crap
but<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.800> a<00:02:07.830> little<00:02:08.009> rubber<00:02:08.190> boot<00:02:08.399> here

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
but this is a little rubber boot here

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.810 
but this is a little rubber boot here
you<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.790> see<00:02:10.100> I'm<00:02:11.100> gonna<00:02:11.190> try<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.490> lubricate

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
you can see I'm gonna try and lubricate

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.160 
you can see I'm gonna try and lubricate
inside<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.240> some<00:02:12.420> good<00:02:12.780> quality

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
inside of there some good quality

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.500 
inside of there some good quality
penetrating<00:02:13.650> oil<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.270> have<00:02:15.270> around<00:02:15.360> here

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
penetrating oil I have around here

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.590 
penetrating oil I have around here
assembly<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.700> only<00:02:17.850> other<00:02:17.970> options<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.450> heat

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
assembly the only other options to heat

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.780 
assembly the only other options to heat
it<00:02:18.690> up<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:19.200> if<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.350> heat<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.590> up<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:20.640> gonna

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
it up but if I heat that up it's gonna

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.670 
it up but if I heat that up it's gonna
damage<00:02:21.060> those<00:02:21.330> rubber<00:02:21.510> boots<00:02:21.780> I'm<00:02:22.500> never

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
damage those rubber boots I'm never

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.940 
damage those rubber boots I'm never
gonna<00:02:22.800> do<00:02:23.040> California<00:02:23.580> baby<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:25.320> we're<00:02:25.830> gonna

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
gonna do California baby so we're gonna

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.430 
gonna do California baby so we're gonna
keep<00:02:26.160> walking<00:02:26.370> off<00:02:26.670> here<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.540> hammer

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.840 

okay<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.709> caliper<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.250> got<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.550> down<00:02:35.640> now<00:02:35.700> I

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
okay so the caliper I got it down now I

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.370 
okay so the caliper I got it down now I
have<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.060> actually<00:02:36.180> give<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.959> gentle<00:02:37.140> tap

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
have to actually give it a gentle tap

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.500 
have to actually give it a gentle tap
fueled<00:02:37.770> hammer<00:02:38.220> by<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.090> way<00:02:39.209> don't<00:02:39.330> use

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
fueled hammer by the way don't use

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.699 
fueled hammer by the way don't use
hammers<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.320> framing

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
hammers like this this is a framing

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.350 
hammers like this this is a framing
hammer<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:41.310> little<00:02:42.090> teeths<00:02:42.270> on<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:44.360> caliper

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
hammer a little teeths on it so caliper

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.290 
hammer a little teeths on it so caliper
kind<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.660> moves<00:02:45.810> now<00:02:46.010> moves<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.190> far<00:02:47.430> all

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
kind of moves now moves that far all

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.330 
kind of moves now moves that far all
right<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.930> way<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.800> fine<00:02:50.010> if<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.220> was

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
right this way is this is fine if I was

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.440 
right this way is this is fine if I was
just<00:02:50.459> replacing<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.880> pads<00:02:50.970> I'd<00:02:51.209> be<00:02:51.300> able<00:02:51.390> to

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
just replacing the pads I'd be able to

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.800 
just replacing the pads I'd be able to
slip<00:02:51.600> them<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.810> there<00:02:51.900> no<00:02:51.990> problem<00:02:53.810> except

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
slip them in there no problem except

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.800 
slip them in there no problem except
that<00:02:55.490> now<00:02:56.490> like<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.910> piston<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.480> in<00:02:57.510> there

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
that now like the piston is in there

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.960 
that now like the piston is in there
yeah<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.770> still<00:02:58.980> moves<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.550> out<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.760> part

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
yeah it still moves in and out that part

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.670 
yeah it still moves in and out that part
works<00:03:00.150> fine<00:03:00.450> I'm<00:03:01.380> sure

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
works fine I'm sure

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.460 
works fine I'm sure
cuz<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.100> was<00:03:02.250> able<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.430> push<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.670> back<00:03:03.410> using<00:03:04.410> a

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
cuz I was able to push it back using a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.600 
cuz I was able to push it back using a
pair<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.680> large<00:03:04.890> pliers

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
pair of large pliers

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.660 
pair of large pliers
however<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:07.560> caliper<00:03:07.920> doesn't<00:03:08.160> self<00:03:08.340> adjust

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
however the caliper doesn't self adjust

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.729 
however the caliper doesn't self adjust
because<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.209> doesn't<00:03:09.420> move<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:10.350> or<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.620> way

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
because it doesn't move this or that way

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.229 
because it doesn't move this or that way
but<00:03:10.950> anyway<00:03:11.130> we've<00:03:11.790> got<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.000> moving<00:03:12.120> this

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
but anyway we've got it moving this

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.880 
but anyway we've got it moving this
little<00:03:12.360> bit<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.780> start<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.709> we're<00:03:13.800> gonna

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
little bit to the start so we're gonna

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.380 
little bit to the start so we're gonna
open<00:03:14.100> up<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.280> boot<00:03:14.459> now<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:15.239> is<00:03:15.360> a

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
open up this boot now this is a

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.509 
open up this boot now this is a
penetrating<00:03:15.810> Oliver<00:03:16.170> news<00:03:16.290> I'm<00:03:17.220> good<00:03:17.430> people

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
didn't work out as planned so actually

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.930 
didn't work out as planned so actually
took<00:03:24.840> off<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.080> brake<00:03:25.230> line<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.830> we're<00:03:26.820> gonna

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.610 
took off the brake line and we're gonna
move<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.209> whole<00:03:27.330> caliper<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.110> bracket

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
move the whole caliper and bracket

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.140 
move the whole caliper and bracket
assembly<00:03:28.680> together<00:03:31.730> that's<00:03:32.730> pretty<00:03:32.910> much<00:03:33.000> how

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
assembly together that's pretty much how

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.440 
assembly together that's pretty much how
things<00:03:33.330> gonna<00:03:33.450> work

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
things gonna work

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.540 
things gonna work
it's<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.690> caliper<00:03:36.080> off<00:03:36.290> now<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:37.010> it's<00:03:37.160> bracket

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
it's a caliper off now and it's bracket

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.220 
it's a caliper off now and it's bracket
you<00:03:37.640> can<00:03:37.670> see<00:03:37.819> this<00:03:37.910> turns<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:39.110> what's

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
you can see this turns and what's
