to find this spot in the seed right

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.280 
to find this spot in the seed right
about<00:02:02.890> now<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.530> that's<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.340> seed<00:02:06.550> up<00:02:06.790> there

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
about now so that's the seed up there

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.620 
about now so that's the seed up there
later<00:02:08.290> 162<00:02:09.010> yada<00:02:09.820> yada<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:11.310> right<00:02:12.310> here<00:02:12.630> is

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
and I believe I've built it right in

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:10.230 
and I believe I've built it right in
this<00:02:55.650> wall<00:02:56.650> right<00:03:00.030> next<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.240> this

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.470

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
and yeah i'll show you the map

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:24.630 
and yeah i'll show you the map
coordinates<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:17.180> map<00:03:17.360> coordinates<00:03:18.110> are<00:03:20.680> 5<00:03:23.230> 4

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
coordinates the map coordinates are 5 4

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.110 
coordinates the map coordinates are 5 4
27<00:03:25.990> so<00:03:26.990> if<00:03:27.110> you<00:03:27.230> want<00:03:27.470> slimes<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.850> want<00:03:29.030> to

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.340 
27 so if you want slimes and you want to
make<00:03:29.210> in<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.420> world<00:03:29.630> out<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:30.710> just<00:03:30.980> going<00:03:31.820> to

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
make in the world out you just going to

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.420 
make in the world out you just going to
this<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:33.740> making<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.970> room<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:36.430> that'll

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
this and making a room and that'll

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.640 
this and making a room and that'll
guarantee<00:03:37.700> you<00:03:38.200> slime<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:41.230> yeah<00:03:42.230> it's

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
basically a most efficient way to get

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.470 
basically a most efficient way to get
slimeballs<00:03:45.410> this<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.490> crazy<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.970> door<00:03:47.150> saying
