00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.890 

about<00:00:32.940> two<00:00:33.420> weeks<00:00:33.450> ago<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:35.210> was<00:00:36.210> looking<00:00:36.600> at<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
about two weeks ago I was looking at the

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.160 
about two weeks ago I was looking at the
bees<00:00:37.130> and<00:00:38.130> there<00:00:38.879> was<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.239> colony<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.840> was

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
bees and there was one colony that was

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.810 
bees and there was one colony that was
strong<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:42.050> I<00:00:43.129> found<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.280> there<00:00:44.460> were<00:00:44.580> Queen

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
strong and I found that there were Queen

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.350 
strong and I found that there were Queen
cells<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> did<00:00:46.370> was<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.580> did<00:00:48.210> an

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
cells so what I did was I did an

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.560 
cells so what I did was I did an
artificial<00:00:48.989> swarm<00:00:49.730> now<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> know<00:00:50.970> that<00:00:51.390> you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
artificial swarm now I know that you

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.560 
artificial swarm now I know that you
would<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:51.900> liked<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.410> eaten<00:00:52.830> there<00:00:53.570> but

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
would have liked to have eaten there but

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.530 
would have liked to have eaten there but
sometimes<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.379> nature<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.920> can't<00:00:56.540> always

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
sometimes in nature you can't always

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.220 
sometimes in nature you can't always
plan<00:00:58.140> ahead<00:00:58.309> so<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.339> had<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.910> go<00:01:00.780> ahead<00:01:00.930> without

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
plan ahead so I had to go ahead without

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.880 
plan ahead so I had to go ahead without
you<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.950> deprive<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.470> actually<00:01:04.470> watching

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you and deprive you of actually watching

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.330 
you and deprive you of actually watching
me<00:01:05.009> split<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> colony<00:01:05.910> but<00:01:06.500> I'll<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.950> able<00:01:08.070> to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
me split the colony but I'll be able to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.389 
me split the colony but I'll be able to
hopefully<00:01:08.789> show<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.060> today<00:01:09.479> what<00:01:09.750> happened

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
hopefully show you today what happened

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.999 
hopefully show you today what happened
two<00:01:11.399> weeks<00:01:11.430> ago<00:01:11.940> I<00:01:11.970> looked<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.649> and<00:01:13.649> I<00:01:13.770> found

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
two weeks ago I looked in and I found

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.570 
two weeks ago I looked in and I found
Queen<00:01:14.670> cells<00:01:15.030> saying<00:01:15.890> we're<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.160> swarm

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
Queen cells saying we're going to swarm

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.290 
Queen cells saying we're going to swarm
so<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> said<00:01:18.810> okay<00:01:19.140> you're<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.830> swarm

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
so I said okay you're going to swarm

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.730 
so I said okay you're going to swarm
what<00:01:21.300> I'm<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.080> find<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> Queen

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
what I'm going to do is find the Queen

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.960 
what I'm going to do is find the Queen
and<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.970> put<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.450> Queen<00:01:24.690> into<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.320> sauce

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
and I put the Queen into this sauce

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.580 
and I put the Queen into this sauce
without<00:01:26.970> any<00:01:27.330> honey<00:01:28.020> without<00:01:28.590> any<00:01:29.090> drawn<00:01:30.090> comb

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
without any honey without any drawn comb

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.609 
without any honey without any drawn comb
just<00:01:32.060> Foundation<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.929> put<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.349> soup

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
just Foundation and I put the soup

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.339 
just Foundation and I put the soup
that's<00:01:34.920> where<00:01:35.099> there<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:35.759> honey<00:01:35.910> on<00:01:36.119> top

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:36.349 
that's where there was some honey on top

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:40.309 
that's where there was some honey on top
this<00:01:37.349> box<00:01:37.709> had<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> cream<00:01:38.550> cells<00:01:39.140> that<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
this box had the cream cells that the

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.150 
this box had the cream cells that the
Queen<00:01:40.560> had<00:01:40.860> laid<00:01:41.069> that's<00:01:41.399> in<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.819> hive<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
Queen had laid that's in this hive and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.940 
Queen had laid that's in this hive and
nothing<00:01:44.160> else<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:46.200> tells<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
nothing else and so that tells the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.089 
nothing else and so that tells the
colony<00:01:47.459> oh<00:01:47.640> we're<00:01:48.300> only<00:01:48.899> half<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.649> size<00:01:49.860> we

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:50.099 
colony oh we're only half the size we

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:53.120 
colony oh we're only half the size we
were<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.750> don't<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.289> should<00:01:52.319> swarm<00:01:52.830> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
were I don't think we should swarm and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.910 
were I don't think we should swarm and
we<00:01:53.819> won't<00:01:54.060> make<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.630> many<00:01:54.780> Queen<00:01:55.200> cells<00:01:55.560> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
we won't make as many Queen cells so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.359 
we won't make as many Queen cells so
that<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.220> just<00:01:56.789> keep<00:01:57.030> enough<00:01:57.420> maybe<00:01:58.050> two<00:01:58.470> so

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
that we just keep enough maybe two so

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.300 
that we just keep enough maybe two so
that<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.970> colony<00:02:00.599> will<00:02:00.750> survive<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.649> this

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
that this colony will survive and this

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.910 
that this colony will survive and this
one<00:02:02.610> carries<00:02:03.300> on<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:04.110> old<00:02:04.259> queen<00:02:04.619> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
one carries on with the old queen and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.919 
one carries on with the old queen and
she's<00:02:05.099> laying<00:02:05.369> away<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.789> then<00:02:05.910> later<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.660> in

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
she's laying away and then later on in

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.050 
she's laying away and then later on in
the<00:02:07.050> summer<00:02:07.289> when<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.250> Queen<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.819> bit

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the summer when this Queen is a bit

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.570 
the summer when this Queen is a bit
older<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.720> if<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.560> queen<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.860> laying<00:02:11.220> well

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
older and if this queen is laying well

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.030 
older and if this queen is laying well
I'll<00:02:11.880> kill<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.510> queen<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.020> put<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.470> colony

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
I'll kill this queen and put this colony

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.360 
I'll kill this queen and put this colony
with<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.430> one<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.150> we've<00:02:15.330> got<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.750> colony<00:02:16.370> so

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
with this one so we've got one colony so

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.830 
with this one so we've got one colony so
first<00:02:17.819> of<00:02:17.970> all<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.120> want<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.450> look<00:02:18.569> in<00:02:18.720> this

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
first of all I want to look in this

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.440 
first of all I want to look in this
colony<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.500> see<00:02:19.709> how<00:02:20.459> they're<00:02:20.700> getting<00:02:20.819> on<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
colony to see how they're getting on and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.600 
colony to see how they're getting on and
to<00:02:21.989> see<00:02:22.200> if<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:23.580> Queen<00:02:24.000> cells<00:02:24.390> have<00:02:24.660> emerged

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
to see if the Queen cells have emerged

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.410 
to see if the Queen cells have emerged
this<00:02:26.610> colony<00:02:27.270> is<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.379> process<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:29.420> making

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
this colony is in the process of making

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.479 
this colony is in the process of making
a<00:02:30.750> queen<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.379> they're<00:02:31.530> relatively<00:02:32.040> content

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
a queen and they're relatively content

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
here this is a honey gone into the frame

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.700 
here this is a honey gone into the frame
and<00:04:23.270> when<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:23.480> take<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.930> honey<00:04:24.140> off<00:04:24.350> this<00:04:24.530> is

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
honey in the comb so that's what that's

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.690 
honey in the comb so that's what that's
all<00:04:37.430> about

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.770 

this<00:04:40.700> is<00:04:40.850> a<00:04:40.880> frame<00:04:41.240> that<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:41.630> put<00:04:41.870> in<00:04:43.570> that<00:04:44.570> was

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
this is a frame that I put in that was

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.140 
this is a frame that I put in that was
just<00:04:45.169> undrawn<00:04:45.650> foundation<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.580> you<00:04:46.669> see<00:04:46.910> them

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
just undrawn foundation and you see them

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.330 
just undrawn foundation and you see them
drawing<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.720> comb<00:04:47.960> out<00:04:48.169> on<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.650> foundation

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
drawing the comb out on the foundation

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.420 
drawing the comb out on the foundation
it's<00:04:49.520> very<00:04:49.790> pretty<00:04:50.090> isn't<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:54.010> and<00:04:55.010> you<00:04:55.280> can

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
it's very pretty isn't it and you can

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.860 
it's very pretty isn't it and you can
see<00:04:55.610> it<00:04:55.700> again<00:04:55.910> on<00:04:56.090> this<00:04:56.270> side<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:56.720> they've

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
see it again on this side and they've

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.190 
see it again on this side and they've
even<00:04:57.050> put<00:04:57.290> some<00:04:57.350> honey<00:04:57.740> in<00:04:57.830> there<00:04:58.780> so<00:04:59.780> this<00:05:00.050> is

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
even put some honey in there so this is

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.690 
even put some honey in there so this is
because<00:05:00.530> there's<00:05:00.740> a<00:05:00.830> honey<00:05:01.010> flow<00:05:01.280> on<00:05:01.490> so

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
because there's a honey flow on so

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.650 
because there's a honey flow on so
they're<00:05:01.880> very<00:05:02.030> busy<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.510> active<00:05:04.330> so<00:05:05.330> that's<00:05:05.540> a

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
they're very busy and active so that's a

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.930 
they're very busy and active so that's a
good<00:05:05.870> sign<00:05:06.140> that<00:05:06.410> says<00:05:06.740> that<00:05:07.100> there's<00:05:07.460> action

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
good sign that says that there's action

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.320 
good sign that says that there's action
in<00:05:08.060> just<00:05:08.330> hive<00:05:09.310> this<00:05:10.310> is<00:05:10.520> where<00:05:10.760> I<00:05:10.790> put<00:05:11.210> the

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
in just hive this is where I put the

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.870 
in just hive this is where I put the
Queen<00:05:11.600> when<00:05:12.140> I<00:05:12.169> did<00:05:12.500> my<00:05:12.710> swarm<00:05:13.070> control<00:05:13.640> so<00:05:13.850> I

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
Queen when I did my swarm control so I

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.360 
Queen when I did my swarm control so I
split<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.450> hive<00:05:14.630> into<00:05:15.020> two<00:05:15.229> this<00:05:15.919> is<00:05:15.979> one

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
split the hive into two this is one

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.409 
split the hive into two this is one
heart<00:05:16.669> and<00:05:16.970> this<00:05:17.090> is<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:17.330> other<00:05:17.479> part<00:05:22.240> so<00:05:23.240> when

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
heart and this is the other part so when

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.740 
heart and this is the other part so when
I<00:05:23.450> put<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:24.290> frames<00:05:24.590> in<00:05:24.860> here<00:05:25.360> these<00:05:26.360> were<00:05:26.570> all

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
I put the frames in here these were all

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.510

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.780 
out very quickly that's a good sign and
there<00:05:36.080> was<00:05:36.200> just<00:05:36.440> absolutely<00:05:37.040> nothing<00:05:37.490> on

these frames and it's all drawn out it's

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.659 
these frames and it's all drawn out it's
all<00:05:41.180> amazing<00:05:41.810> they've<00:05:42.169> done<00:05:42.380> that<00:05:42.590> in<00:05:42.919> under

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
all amazing they've done that in under

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.230 
all amazing they've done that in under
two<00:05:43.850> weeks<00:05:44.140> and<00:05:45.460> this<00:05:46.460> was<00:05:46.640> all<00:05:46.790> just<00:05:46.820> the

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
two weeks and this was all just the

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.430 
two weeks and this was all just the
foundation<00:05:47.690> that<00:05:48.080> I've<00:05:48.229> been<00:05:48.380> showing<00:05:48.680> you<00:05:50.440> so

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
foundation that I've been showing you so

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.620 
foundation that I've been showing you so
when<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:51.650> colony<00:05:52.070> is<00:05:52.220> busy<00:05:52.640> and<00:05:52.790> active<00:05:52.940> this<00:05:53.510> is

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
when a colony is busy and active this is

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:02.239 
when a colony is busy and active this is
what<00:05:53.840> can<00:05:53.990> go<00:05:54.169> on

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:02.249 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:06.199 

this<00:06:02.639> liberalism<00:06:04.099> and<00:06:05.099> there<00:06:05.489> are<00:06:05.609> eggs<00:06:05.849> there

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:06.209 
this liberalism and there are eggs there

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:08.869 
this liberalism and there are eggs there
so<00:06:06.479> somewhere<00:06:06.869> around<00:06:07.019> the<00:06:07.349> queen<00:06:07.619> must<00:06:07.859> be<00:06:08.099> so

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:08.879 
so somewhere around the queen must be so

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:12.459 
so somewhere around the queen must be so
she's<00:06:09.149> laying<00:06:09.509> so<00:06:09.899> that's<00:06:10.109> a<00:06:10.229> good<00:06:10.409> sign<00:06:10.679> and

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469 
she's laying so that's a good sign and

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:15.769 
she's laying so that's a good sign and
in<00:06:13.469> theory<00:06:14.129> I<00:06:14.399> don't<00:06:14.999> need<00:06:15.209> to<00:06:15.389> look<00:06:15.539> at<00:06:15.689> the

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:15.779 
in theory I don't need to look at the

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:19.669 
in theory I don't need to look at the
hive<00:06:15.959> anymore<00:06:16.669> because<00:06:17.669> I<00:06:17.939> know<00:06:18.529> that<00:06:19.529> the

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:19.679 
hive anymore because I know that the

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:23.809 
hive anymore because I know that the
queen<00:06:19.919> is<00:06:19.949> in<00:06:20.399> here<00:06:20.699> I've<00:06:20.969> seen<00:06:21.239> eggs<00:06:22.819> I've
