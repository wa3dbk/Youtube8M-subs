00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.970
 arguing in the critic Kramer 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:15.450
 again this shows but looking for a home on the asphalt according to 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.650
 me make friends yes 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.750
 the if there is a fun we raffled off the race so everything went well 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.509
 Personal improvements time again for the first time under a 50 pm 49 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.249
 back start to look a bit 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.079
 yes we know the people of course the after the winter is but if we 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.250
 world champion skates in various sizes and real for all interests 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.660
 adjust to distance skating afterwards well that will be a lot different than that 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:40.960
 motorcycle racing 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.120
 yes there is with the it is very technical of notaries technical 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.560
 respect 3 in terms of attitude plan lines 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.730
 and that is of challenges you can prove yourself and improve policy 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.470
 in terms of technique it is actually never complaining and that makes the game 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.880
 makes for very fascinating and that kept on having a lot of fun at times 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.450
 you are driving a Germans policy that is flexible 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.420
 Middelburg arrived to enter a motorsport bread anp 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.549
 I was asked once for the TV program to get batteries with too 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.549
 playing elements on a motorcycle I should have no motorcycle license 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.490
 and they last for the length of time that I may do 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.940
 but there you drive to read about the final if you like 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.530
 wasaar lilies that both will run from a small splash at about 175 c 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.570
 and he that we were there with a very nice person who she already mentioned earlier 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.109
 put sku there seaman he must once piracy handful of talent 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.280
 she has no he points to the engine anything so if you and fashion world 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.430
 the clothes I come who called again two weeks later and I have one 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.229
 preparing the motorcycle clothing 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.410
 I said yes it is so that was my first experience to boost 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.840
 Heracles treasure from a boy who at that time also had one and 1000 euros for sale 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.310
 and those who drive then were allowed to come he said under an adult and 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.200
 buy terraces so I not all I had to be on the shelves 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.010
 discussed everything in Friday 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.720
 be coolio there 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.070
 and that we worth a lot as well and that was then on a gay top 100 according to her 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.890
 were driving now only one knew I sold four plates I drove there 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.579
 that day at a 1000 meters according to some I say 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.439
 Reportedly as good actor the accident also encountered an encounter 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.329
 internet in my area that I have bought massive motion bertens and 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.829
 That is before I got there again I think brook came from 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.619
 among others before we drove everything frieda including once to work 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:29.359
 is 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:35.489
 and the big steps made in cohen and now this year and in the old cheese 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.069
 roubaix so that is a bit recovered and now just ride in the team like 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.469
 all the other drivers do the same and the big names that the teacher now 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.930
 on the circuit and would give such a demonstration how does that feel about 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.200
 suddenly a completely different area is being tackled too 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.259
 yes then last year you are engaged in sports and 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.019
 also asks that the school for me I think it can be exciting anyway 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.099
 I like that nicer game 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.180
 also quite a bit again the tension of the competition before he entered 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.410
 almere 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.639
 ask the body that paltrow out for sure 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.190
 yes if you have not driven for a long time and you are at the start 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.390
 we have the common people at the start of the world how championships 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.870
 skating and that the fun competition tension that keeps on living whatever 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.439
 you also do the same 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.159
 and in porridge when saving such a motorcycle that you sit on it and with 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.699
 those speeds that of course makes it all texts action tension with 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:28.739
 brings along 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.060
 and before that you know in advance that you would get that as well 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.559
 You holes that he once had broken collar bone for zoom 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:40.589
 yes that's right that is booted up to the small injury bus that he also sets free 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:43.549
 fast well then you have there of course also do without can 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.489
 and such a turn but where down on a motorcycle down on the ice rink 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:49.260
 after 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.459
 the skater that skating in recent years was not easy either 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.420
 the bend protection the unadapted especially tied up by the couple 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.789
 the concrete disturbed at the window and pumped up really hard 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:05.299
 and all players this year keep the comma and also blue help and everything 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.999
 where you are here you just have the bad luck that you were just a little better 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:13.040
 Several different facts are already known that of humans include animals 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:15.579
 who come to the hospital to put ice skates 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.900
 think never sports it's something more dangerous 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.280
 anyway there are speeds with those speeds far above 100 kilometers you 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.460
 goes off 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.789
 if you are guided is not a problem though 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.229
 so you are driving several people so if you are unlucky you will meet someone 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.210
 on the way 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.470
 then you drive one that we will baeke without a man competition 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.569
 if for islam rising 2 seater ss of a thousand men walking in the gallery that is 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.120
 of course not with every competition the same how it feels when you are here 

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:45.129
 and there are 60,000 people just watching me 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.490
 yes that is very nice but she is running the engine you forget that the two with 

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:51.599
 doing one thing and we try as well as possible 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.400
 don't you know that you are because you are here but that is the 

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:59.539
 We are also talking to you here and not to your colleague who is one 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.539
 place for you is that it is known that maybe marathon pool 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.559
 well that has it yes that is a long time so big a lot happens 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:11.180
 not overnight you know that there is always everywhere you do 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.819
 your focus is that it also indicates the crash I had 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.720
 this preseason 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.080
 yes that is very normal that you bounce carelessly from the hood afterwards well me 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.259
 accidentally broke a collarbone but was in itself not shocking 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.259
 and coming year was that must have stood for the telegraph 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.219
 it might be a bit exaggerated but that is never in such a then you have to 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:33.370
 do first deal with the disease that way and yourself 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.980
 yes i think he never talks about it like a number a skating rink but years still 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.180
 a little less is also done on this circuit where activities are held more often 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.420
 where you may or may not be present also on the motorcycle in a short time 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:45.789
 bring a sleeping bag 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.629
 we have it with it and so we already live here to be handed out 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.529
 I already know that you join the circuit and then say the super leaks 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.139
 soothing you don't have to travel zochers 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.800
 It is very important that you equip everything from it 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.800
 does with his engine when you are a guest then but then it is nothing 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:04.689
 I am already busy with times but there is no president 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:06.050
 we have 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.750
 but for you yourself what I mean you keep improving that 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:13.689
 Good thing it also has a bit of a bit of competition with yourself 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:18.099
 and anyway the first games there are completely behind the field now 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.259
 are you a bit more in the competition that you really 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.449
 anp you must try to pass people from a moving i have yet to 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.719
 a little drawback that very fast pace of the predecessor assume that offender 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:32.569
 very difficult for me to pass by and made very good today 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.180
 step in the right direction again 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.190
 a good second off format personal best time had thus 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:41.900
 year under a five-member band for the first time with very satisfied 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.059
 satisfied with this race 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:47.059
 then you are busy where will this end 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.789
 yes these are the first big steps I expect to be 

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:57.329
 year round a 47 should be able to drive yes then you are just behind 

00:06:57.329 --> 00:06:59.460
 midfield and I think so too 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.430
 her canvases of course already very well me 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.389
 it is the first year in the competition I have driven some competitions on 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:06.610
 a motorcycle 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.819
 He has been cooking winnings since they were fooled for a month and a half 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.349
 2 yes, I can see it I am really nice as long as it is fun to do and 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.470
 the repayment cyclist
