00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
what other people can do the more we can

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.900 
what other people can do the more we can
do<00:00:52.449> here<00:00:52.480> at<00:00:52.840> p.m.<00:00:53.469> the<00:00:53.739> better<00:00:53.920> we<00:00:54.190> try<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.640> do

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
do here at p.m. the better we try to do

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.970 
do here at p.m. the better we try to do
literally<00:00:55.750> almost<00:00:56.140> everything<00:00:56.649> we're<00:00:56.829> really

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
literally almost everything we're really

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.220 
literally almost everything we're really
stubborn<00:00:57.430> about<00:00:57.550> it<00:00:57.699> and<00:00:58.420> make<00:00:58.690> it<00:00:58.719> to<00:00:59.199> the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
stubborn about it and make it to the

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.170 
stubborn about it and make it to the
highest<00:00:59.620> quality<00:00:59.949> so<00:01:00.219> it<00:01:00.579> doesn't<00:01:00.910> matter<00:01:01.030> if

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
highest quality so it doesn't matter if

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.070 
highest quality so it doesn't matter if
it's<00:01:01.390> it's<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.199> smallest<00:01:02.530> component<00:01:03.219> or<00:01:03.370> a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
it's it's the smallest component or a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.420 
it's it's the smallest component or a
really<00:01:05.080> expensive<00:01:05.320> wheel<00:01:05.680> I<00:01:05.710> mean<00:01:06.010> we<00:01:06.130> want

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
really expensive wheel I mean we want

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.550 
really expensive wheel I mean we want
that<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:07.000> quality<00:01:07.360> level<00:01:07.660> is<00:01:07.750> exactly<00:01:08.380> the

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
that the quality level is exactly the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:46.890 
that the quality level is exactly the
same<00:01:08.740> across<00:01:08.980> the<00:01:09.100> board

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:02:01.180 

these<00:01:47.170> are<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.740> days<00:01:48.010> where<00:01:48.430> we<00:01:48.610> have<00:01:49.090> to

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:11.500 

Oh

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.080 

he's<00:02:12.050> that

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
he's that

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:33.650 
he's that
the<00:02:14.330> stick<00:02:15.260> is<00:02:15.470> that

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.260 

are<00:02:34.860> you

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:54.860 

so

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.930 

you
