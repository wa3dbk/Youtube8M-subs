the<00:00:33.390> lights<00:00:33.829> it<00:00:34.829> runs<00:00:35.070> pretty<00:00:35.340> nicely

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the lights it runs pretty nicely

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.850

although<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.630> has<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> cross<00:00:37.170> threaded<00:00:37.620> fuel

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
although it has a cross threaded fuel

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
although it has a cross threaded fuel
line<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.969> under<00:00:39.120> here<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.690> fuel<00:00:39.899> pump

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
line just under here for the fuel pump

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.959 
line just under here for the fuel pump
so<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> bit<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.010> gas<00:00:41.160> leaks<00:00:41.489> out<00:00:41.700> while<00:00:41.850> you're

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
so a bit of gas leaks out while you're

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.930 
so a bit of gas leaks out while you're
riding<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.360> along<00:00:42.570> which<00:00:43.410> means<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.010> 200

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
riding it along which means the 200

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.430 
riding it along which means the 200
miles<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> gallon<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.050> normally

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
miles to the gallon that it normally

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.180 
miles to the gallon that it normally
gets<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.879> rather<00:00:48.620> greatly<00:00:49.620> reduced

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
gets is rather greatly reduced

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.939 
gets is rather greatly reduced
I<00:00:50.930> doubt<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.079> even<00:00:52.140> gets<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> quarter<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.890> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
I doubt it even gets a quarter of that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.619 
I doubt it even gets a quarter of that
right<00:00:53.190> now<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> gas<00:00:53.699> leak<00:00:54.320> but<00:00:56.329> it's<00:00:57.329> all

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
the carburetor you can see when I

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.750 
the carburetor you can see when I
squeeze<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.590> brake<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:32.070> shuts<00:02:32.340> off<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.580> gas

so<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.560> pinch<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:34.890> can<00:02:35.070> just<00:02:35.250> sort<00:02:35.370> of

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
so in a pinch you can just sort of

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.010 
so in a pinch you can just sort of
squeeze<00:02:35.820> both<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.330> brakes<00:02:36.570> in<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.750> engine

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
really shut it off with this

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.550 
really shut it off with this
decompression<00:02:41.880> valve<00:02:41.910> here<00:02:42.360> he<00:02:43.170> says<00:02:43.380> not

pointing the camera well he's actually

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.680 
pointing the camera well he's actually
looking<00:02:45.240> at

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
looking at

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.390 
looking at
this<00:02:47.080> is<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.290> decompression<00:02:47.950> valve<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.250> use

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
this is a decompression valve you use

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.830 
this is a decompression valve you use
this<00:02:48.549> to<00:02:48.700> get<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.879> motor<00:02:49.150> started<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.750> to

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
this to get the motor started and to

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.990 
this to get the motor started and to
stop<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.110> again<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.640> this<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.879> your

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
stop it again and this is your

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.059 
stop it again and this is your
engagement<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:53.080> wheel<00:02:53.290> just<00:02:53.560> sort<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.739> falls

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
engagement the wheel just sort of falls

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.020 
engagement the wheel just sort of falls
down<00:02:54.340> onto<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:54.970> tire<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.569> motor<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:57.030> then

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
down onto the tire the motor and then

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.100 
down onto the tire the motor and then
we'll<00:02:58.239> be<00:02:58.360> off<00:02:59.310> okay<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:00.730> let's<00:03:00.970> go<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:02.019> I'll

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
we'll be off okay so let's go so I'll

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.130 
we'll be off okay so let's go so I'll
put<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.470> pedal<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.099> a<00:03:03.280> good<00:03:03.430> position<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:04.140> we

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
put the pedal to a good position and we

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.100 
put the pedal to a good position and we
will<00:03:05.319> squeeze<00:03:05.530> up<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.950> decompression<00:03:06.489> valve

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
will squeeze up the decompression valve

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.300 
will squeeze up the decompression valve
we<00:03:08.110> reel<00:03:08.260> pedal<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.860> we're<00:03:09.040> going<00:03:09.129> to<00:03:09.190> see

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
we reel pedal it and we're going to see

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.009 
we reel pedal it and we're going to see
if<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.430> starts<00:03:09.610> here<00:03:09.879> but<00:03:10.450> easier<00:03:10.720> said<00:03:10.750> than

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
if it starts here but easier said than

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.680 
if it starts here but easier said than
done<00:03:11.079> but<00:03:12.450> here<00:03:13.450> we<00:03:13.540> go

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
done but here we go

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.089 
done but here we go
see<00:03:14.110> up<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:15.159> we're<00:03:15.310> away<00:03:16.620> hide<00:03:17.620> Oh

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
kind of let me put the choke on that

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:34.870 
kind of let me put the choke on that
might<00:03:22.959> help
