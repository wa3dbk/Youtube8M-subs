00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
gonna type in Hessian in the console you

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.360 
gonna type in Hessian in the console you
know<00:00:16.109> console<00:00:16.710> by<00:00:16.830> typing<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:18.150> tilt<00:00:18.390> key

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.370 
know console by typing the tilt key

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.820 
know console by typing the tilt key
all<00:00:21.120> right<00:00:21.450> after<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.080> you're<00:00:22.320> gonna<00:00:22.440> put<00:00:22.770> in

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
all right after that you're gonna put in

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.020 
all right after that you're gonna put in
spawn<00:00:23.810> entity<00:00:24.810> your<00:00:25.740> player<00:00:26.040> name<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.670> then

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.030 
spawn entity your player name and then

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.570 
spawn entity your player name and then
the<00:00:27.360> entity<00:00:27.690> which<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.990> 32<00:00:28.290> which<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.220> enter

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the entity which is 32 which is enter

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.150 
the entity which is 32 which is enter
vehicle<00:00:30.350> let's<00:00:31.350> see<00:00:31.439> why<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> named<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.950> that<00:00:32.010> in

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
vehicle let's see why I named it that in

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.780 
vehicle let's see why I named it that in
a<00:00:32.220> second<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.020> it<00:00:34.020> should<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.380> spawned<00:00:34.790> around

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
a second and it should be spawned around

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.960 
a second and it should be spawned around
us<00:00:36.030> there<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:37.309> so<00:00:38.309> now<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.580> you<00:00:38.670> look<00:00:38.699> at<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
us there it is so now if you look at the

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.660 
us there it is so now if you look at the
body<00:00:39.150> you<00:00:39.750> should<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.050> able<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> enter<00:00:40.379> it

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
body you should be able to enter it

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.850 
body you should be able to enter it
pressing<00:00:41.670> E<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:43.170> now<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:43.470> on<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.739> bear<00:00:45.860> now

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
pressing E and now I'm on the bear now

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.830 
pressing E and now I'm on the bear now
as<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.160> said<00:00:47.220> in<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.030> video<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.480> did<00:00:48.660> watch

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
as I said in the video if you did watch

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.620 
as I said in the video if you did watch
it<00:00:48.870> turn<00:00:49.650> radius<00:00:49.830> is<00:00:50.190> horrible<00:00:51.470> but<00:00:52.470> you<00:00:53.340> know

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
it turn radius is horrible but you know

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.479 
it turn radius is horrible but you know
it's<00:00:54.630> it's<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.290> fast<00:00:55.470> way<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> travel

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.100 

I<00:00:58.520> guess<00:00:59.120> so<00:00:59.300> this<00:00:59.450> is<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.660> code<00:00:59.809> you<00:00:59.840> should

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
I guess so this is the code you should

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.770 
I guess so this is the code you should
have<00:01:00.200> gotten<00:01:00.820> from<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.910> forms<00:01:02.890> right<00:01:03.890> here

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
have gotten from the forms right here

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.580 
have gotten from the forms right here
now<00:01:05.780> I'm<00:01:05.869> going<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.049> show<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:06.140> how<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.409> change

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
now I'm going to show you how to change

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.500 
now I'm going to show you how to change
it<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:06.890> something<00:01:06.920> else<00:01:07.340> like<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.909> car<00:01:08.210> or<00:01:08.390> maybe

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
it to something else like a car or maybe

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.180 
it to something else like a car or maybe
the<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:09.140> zombie<00:01:09.440> dog<00:01:09.590> it's<00:01:09.800> really<00:01:10.010> quite

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
the the zombie dog it's really quite

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.670 
the the zombie dog it's really quite
simple<00:01:10.810> once<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:11.900> if<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:12.229> have<00:01:12.320> no<00:01:12.470> plant

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
simple once you if you have no plant

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.649 
simple once you if you have no plant
life<00:01:12.830> loss<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.880> should<00:01:14.060> be<00:01:14.150> able<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.390> just<00:01:14.540> do

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
life loss you should be able to just do

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.620 
life loss you should be able to just do
ctrl<00:01:15.020> F<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:15.580> then<00:01:16.580> just<00:01:16.820> search<00:01:17.180> up<00:01:17.210> something

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
ctrl F and then just search up something

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.499 
ctrl F and then just search up something
so<00:01:17.869> car<00:01:19.630> alright<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.500> here<00:01:21.649> mesh<00:01:22.180> vehicle<00:01:23.180> this

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
so car alright so here mesh vehicle this

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.520 
so car alright so here mesh vehicle this
is<00:01:23.570> what<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:23.810> want<00:01:23.960> to<00:01:24.020> copy<00:01:25.240> ctrl<00:01:26.240> C

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
is what you want to copy ctrl C

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.840 
is what you want to copy ctrl C
we're<00:01:28.220> going<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.400> go<00:01:28.490> back<00:01:28.730> to<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.300> code

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
we're going to go back to the code

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.969 

oops

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.830 

right<00:01:36.789> here<00:01:36.939> where<00:01:37.119> it<00:01:37.180> says<00:01:37.210> mesh<00:01:37.509> animal

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
launch seven days that it should be a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.120 
launch seven days that it should be a
car<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:48.990> same<00:01:49.170> thing<00:01:49.380> with<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.800> all
