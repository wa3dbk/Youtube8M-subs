 a gentleman pays all attention to the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.460
 detail why the knot of a tie 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.340
 tied to perfection defines the style and 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.989

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.850

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.469
 for you the art of living 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.839
 the new windsor has a way 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.609
 wide and symmetric triangular 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.530
 considered the most appropriate for 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.149
 formal occasions but it is not 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.149
 recommended for men face 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.030
 small or sharp to conquer it 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.640
 you will need a plate tie 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.799
 fine silk and without relief and even if 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.979
 you want to do it under rigor one that measures 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.780
 four centimeters more than the common ones 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.680
 a shirt with a wide opening collar 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.970
 the windsor is never worn with collars and 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.069
 We think that Alejandro HernÃ¡ndez 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.690
 buyer of costumes and English salon 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.210
 iron palace would be the option 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.940
 adequate to show us even though it is not 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.710
 makes the windsor knot a tie 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.710
 printed on silk 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.290
 to execute it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.909
 here we are going to start the first button 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.049
 down with 5 and a half buttons 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.049
 with the thin 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.350
 we start 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.350
 toward the left 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.840
 to look for it 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.840
 down 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.880
 and then 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.729
 Well, no 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.400
 the previous knot is the middle windsor 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.370
 it also forms a symmetrical triangle 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.770
 but of smaller width is appropriate for 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.170
 iron ties and lightweight fabrics or 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.390
 media is ideal for collars 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.210
 medium opening and you can dress it for 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.060
 any occasion but we will perform 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.260
 an average windsor knot with a 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.860
 in pulling out silk a little more robust 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.730
 and we started 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:23.319
 let's say in cross the right hand 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.749
 we climb up the back of the neck 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.200
 we turn slightly upwards to 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:28.200
 adjust 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.740
 down 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.960
 80 degrees 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.470
 the smile or no smile as we most 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.470
 like 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.540
 we adjust remains firm 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.650
 we handle the neck 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.340
 and the 360 a knot so easy and fast 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.370
 do that is also known as double 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.170
 simple its use is recommended exclusive 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.470
 for open necks and ties 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.320
 Thin and light never thick now 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.810
 let's make a 360 degree knot 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.810
 let's cross it to the right 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:41.889
 and then we give double spin 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.290
 two 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.220
 we search 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.710
 we lower his neck 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:26.900
 for a certain occasion that is not 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:29.890
 that the knot is the personality of each 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.690
 one and the attitude that each person has 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.760
 wise words from an expert do not 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.940
 we could have said better 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.400
