vehicle so this bar we have begun our
basic<00:02:14.270> script<00:02:14.630> we<00:02:15.230> have<00:02:15.350> changed<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.520> players

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
basic script we have changed the players

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.600 
basic script we have changed the players
health<00:02:17.120> we<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:17.720> changed<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.560> costume<00:02:18.800> we

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
health we have changed the costume we

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.910 
health we have changed the costume we
have<00:02:19.730> created<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.450> limo<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.110> which<00:02:21.470> Jimmie

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
have created a limo of which Jimmie

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.870

spawns<00:02:22.340> as<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.030> driver<00:02:23.390> inside<00:02:24.050> of<00:02:24.459> so<00:02:25.459> let's

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
spawns as the driver inside of so let's

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.480 
spawns as the driver inside of so let's
spawn<00:02:26.180> some<00:02:26.450> characters<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:27.500> here<00:02:28.190> we<00:02:28.310> have<00:02:28.459> a

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
spawn some characters so here we have a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.910 
spawn some characters so here we have a
complete<00:02:28.970> list<00:02:29.300> it's<00:02:29.630> not<00:02:29.810> alphabetical<00:02:30.050> it's

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
complete list it's not alphabetical it's

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.280 
complete list it's not alphabetical it's
ordered<00:02:31.430> by<00:02:31.610> what<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.540> ID<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.140> that

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
ordered by what the ID for that

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.780 
ordered by what the ID for that
character<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.770> so<00:02:33.950> let's<00:02:34.100> say<00:02:34.310> we<00:02:34.490> want<00:02:34.670> to

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
character is so let's say we want to

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.190 
character is so let's say we want to
spawn<00:02:35.770> Algernon<00:02:37.270> over<00:02:38.270> at<00:02:38.650> 55<00:02:39.850> 44:33<00:02:41.200> spawn

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
spawn Algernon over at 55 44:33 spawn

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.070 
spawn Algernon over at 55 44:33 spawn
him<00:02:42.470> can<00:02:43.340> we<00:02:43.430> paste<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.209> now<00:02:44.480> Algernon

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
him can we paste that so now Algernon

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.790 
him can we paste that so now Algernon
has<00:02:45.320> spawned<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:47.510> can<00:02:47.690> go<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.870> weapons<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.650> an

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
has spawned we can go to weapons and an

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.180 
has spawned we can go to weapons and an
arm

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
arm

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.760

for<00:03:06.560> bully<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.209> this<00:03:08.209> is<00:03:08.360> why<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:09.080> forum<00:03:09.440> has

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
for bully and this is why the forum has

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.560 
for bully and this is why the forum has
gone<00:03:09.830> over<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.160> bullying<00:03:10.760> add<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.390> Lua

scripting<00:03:12.080> instead<00:03:12.380> of<00:03:12.470> trigger<00:03:12.850> scripting

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
scripting instead of trigger scripting

so you can teleport the player to a new
area<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:17.750> can<00:03:18.080> show<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.590> message<00:03:19.160> at<00:03:19.519> the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
area you can show a message at the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.170 
area you can show a message at the
beginning<00:03:20.150> which<00:03:20.360> is<00:03:21.100> quite<00:03:22.100> fun<00:03:22.459> so<00:03:22.940> how<00:03:23.120> many

beginning which is quite fun so how many

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.080 
beginning which is quite fun so how many
seconds<00:03:23.780> I'll<00:03:24.019> type<00:03:24.590> maybe<00:03:24.890> four<00:03:25.310> seconds<00:03:25.820> and

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
seconds I'll type maybe four seconds and

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:35.259 
seconds I'll type maybe four seconds and
make<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.540> have<00:03:29.560> speedy<00:03:30.560> TAS<00:03:31.480> crazy<00:03:33.100> fun<00:03:34.100> mod<00:03:34.880> I

am<00:03:35.660> no<00:03:35.870> idea<00:03:36.170> generate<00:03:36.739> code<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.250> there<00:03:37.549> we<00:03:37.610> go

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
am no idea generate code and there we go

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.259 
am no idea generate code and there we go
so<00:03:39.080> at<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.470> beginning<00:03:42.250> this<00:03:43.250> misha's<00:03:43.790> will

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
so at the beginning this misha's will

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.130 
so at the beginning this misha's will
come<00:03:44.540> up<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:46.640> can<00:03:46.880> save<00:03:47.390> your<00:03:47.630> script

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
come up and you can save your script

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.110 
come up and you can save your script
anyways<00:03:48.590> let's<00:03:48.860> save<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.190> let's<00:03:49.670> say<00:03:49.850> it<00:03:49.970> a

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
anyways let's save it let's say it a

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.979 
anyways let's save it let's say it a
smart<00:03:50.540> or<00:03:50.900> blew<00:03:51.110> up<00:03:51.489> we<00:03:52.489> go<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:53.360> if<00:03:53.630> we<00:03:53.840> ever

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
smart or blew up we go so if we ever

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.810 
smart or blew up we go so if we ever
launched<00:03:54.410> up<00:03:54.680> this<00:03:54.799> program<00:03:55.220> again<00:03:55.459> we<00:03:55.670> can

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
launched up this program again we can

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.449 
launched up this program again we can
simply<00:03:56.180> just<00:03:56.480> load<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.959> script<00:03:57.070> let's<00:03:58.070> find

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
simply just load the script let's find

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.170 
simply just load the script let's find
it

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
it

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.340 
it
there<00:04:01.180> you<00:04:01.300> go<00:04:01.690> it's<00:04:02.320> easy<00:04:02.500> as<00:04:02.680> one-two-three
