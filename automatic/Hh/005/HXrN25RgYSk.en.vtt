it was so much easier to just go to that
one<00:03:51.260> document<00:03:51.770> and<00:03:51.950> like<00:03:52.130> read<00:03:52.490> all<00:03:52.850> the

seeing<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.820> answer<00:04:43.180> is<00:04:43.240> laid<00:04:43.510> out<00:04:43.540> like<00:04:43.690> you

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
seeing the answer is laid out like you

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.180 
seeing the answer is laid out like you
know<00:04:44.170> one<00:04:44.320> of<00:04:44.350> them<00:04:44.500> is<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.740> answer<00:04:45.010> so

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
know one of them is the answer so

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.710 
know one of them is the answer so
obviously<00:04:45.520> that<00:04:46.030> can<00:04:46.240> like<00:04:46.390> set<00:04:46.600> off<00:04:46.690> a

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
obviously that can like set off a

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.300 
obviously that can like set off a
trigger<00:04:47.050> for<00:04:47.260> you<00:04:47.350> and<00:04:47.500> your<00:04:47.590> memory<00:04:47.890> like<00:04:48.160> the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
trigger for you and your memory like the

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.860 
trigger for you and your memory like the
way<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:48.460> memorized<00:04:48.850> it<00:04:49.000> so<00:04:49.060> definitely

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
way you memorized it so definitely

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.690 
way you memorized it so definitely
recommend<00:04:50.200> doing<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.620> as<00:04:50.860> well<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.670> other

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
recommend doing that as well the other

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.920 
recommend doing that as well the other
thing<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:52.060> I<00:04:52.210> know<00:04:52.270> a<00:04:52.360> lot<00:04:52.540> of<00:04:52.570> people<00:04:52.810> like

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
thing that I know a lot of people like

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.780 
thing that I know a lot of people like
to<00:04:53.050> do<00:04:53.170> is<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.530> create<00:04:53.680> like<00:04:53.980> a<00:04:54.130> playlist<00:04:54.400> or

something<00:04:55.060> on<00:04:55.180> their<00:04:55.300> phone<00:04:55.510> so<00:04:55.990> they<00:04:56.080> can

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
something on their phone so they can

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.990 
something on their phone so they can
just<00:04:56.320> listen<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.830> music<00:04:57.010> as<00:04:57.430> they're<00:04:57.760> studying

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
I sometimes do this it kind of just

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.800 
I sometimes do this it kind of just
depends<00:05:00.670> on<00:05:00.820> like<00:05:00.970> what<00:05:01.240> kind<00:05:01.450> of<00:05:01.510> thing<00:05:01.720> I'm

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
depends on like what kind of thing I'm

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.080 
depends on like what kind of thing I'm
doing<00:05:02.200> if<00:05:02.380> I'm<00:05:02.710> like<00:05:02.890> memorizing<00:05:03.310> things<00:05:03.850> or

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
doing if I'm like memorizing things or

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.490 
doing if I'm like memorizing things or
just<00:05:04.120> like<00:05:04.420> really<00:05:04.660> trying<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:04.990> get<00:05:05.080> into<00:05:05.230> note
