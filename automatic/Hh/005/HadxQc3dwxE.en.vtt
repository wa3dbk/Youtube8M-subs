okay folks in this clip we're going to
learn<00:00:02.159> how<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.399> dry<00:00:02.760> battle<00:00:03.449> Android<00:00:03.929> now<00:00:04.589> what

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
learn how to dry battle Android now what

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.369 
learn how to dry battle Android now what
exactly<00:00:05.040> is<00:00:05.490> an<00:00:05.609> Android<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.180> Android<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.960> a

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
exactly is an Android and Android is a

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.360 
exactly is an Android and Android is a
human-shaped<00:00:08.099> or<00:00:08.910> human<00:00:09.450> designed<00:00:10.370> robot

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
human-shaped or human designed robot

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.039 
human-shaped or human designed robot
obviously<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:12.509> what<00:00:12.540> you're<00:00:12.750> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.929> want

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
obviously so what you're going to want

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.870 
obviously so what you're going to want
to<00:00:13.110> do<00:00:13.230> first<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.650> all<00:00:13.769> start<00:00:14.639> out<00:00:14.700> by

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
to do first of all start out by

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.170 
to do first of all start out by
establishing<00:00:15.800> dimensions<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.910> mean

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
establishing dimensions and what I mean

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.090 
establishing dimensions and what I mean
by<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.660> clearly<00:00:19.260> defined<00:00:19.740> where

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
by that is clearly defined where

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.950 
by that is clearly defined where
everything<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.730> supposed<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.810> really

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
everything is supposed to be and really

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.529 
everything is supposed to be and really
at<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.380> point<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.800> would<00:00:22.859> hope<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:24.269> sort

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
at this point I would hope that you sort

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.509 
at this point I would hope that you sort
of<00:00:24.630> already<00:00:24.960> brainstormed<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.039> decided

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
of already brainstormed and decided

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.269 
of already brainstormed and decided
exactly<00:00:26.670> what<00:00:27.289> your<00:00:28.289> Android's<00:00:28.800> general

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
exactly what your Android's general

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.749 
exactly what your Android's general
appearance<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.849> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.269> i<00:00:31.759> would

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
appearance is going to be i would

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.650 
appearance is going to be i would
suggest<00:00:33.050> sticking<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> relatively<00:00:34.890> human

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
suggest sticking to a relatively human

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.889 
suggest sticking to a relatively human
shape<00:00:37.340> simply<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:38.690> that's<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:39.840> an

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
shape simply because that's what an

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.389 
shape simply because that's what an
Android<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:40.620> supposed<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.250> is

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
Android is really supposed to be is

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.000 
Android is really supposed to be is
supposed<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> human-shaped<00:00:42.829> robot<00:00:43.829> that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
supposed to be a human-shaped robot that

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.549 
supposed to be a human-shaped robot that
is<00:00:44.070> essentially<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:44.879> an<00:00:45.090> Android<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.750> so

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
is essentially what an Android is so

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.450 
is essentially what an Android is so
really<00:00:46.860> come<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.430> define<00:00:47.700> exactly<00:00:48.059> where

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
really come in and define exactly where

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.080 
really come in and define exactly where
all<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.789> dimensions<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:52.520> get<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.670> general

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
all the dimensions are get your general

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.389 
all the dimensions are get your general
outline<00:00:54.510> going<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.350> okay<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> add<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> few

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
outline going and it's okay to add a few

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.920 
outline going and it's okay to add a few
details<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.870> stage<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.379> would<00:00:58.530> say<00:00:59.930> I'm

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
details this this stage I would say I'm

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.990 
details this this stage I would say I'm
I<00:01:01.350> wouldn't<00:01:01.680> go<00:01:01.770> into<00:01:01.859> too<00:01:01.980> much<00:01:02.129> detail<00:01:02.309> yet

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
I wouldn't go into too much detail yet

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240 
I wouldn't go into too much detail yet
simply<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.260> should<00:01:04.530> kind<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.830> trying

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
simply because you should kind of trying

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.730 
simply because you should kind of trying
to<00:01:05.309> figure<00:01:05.519> out<00:01:05.580> where<00:01:05.700> everything<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:12.740> really

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
to figure out where everything is really

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:23.060 
to figure out where everything is really
just<00:01:13.920> kind<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.280> establish<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:16.500> general<00:01:16.979> pose

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.260 

I<00:01:28.010> mean<00:01:29.010> I'm<00:01:29.159> putting<00:01:29.430> my<00:01:29.580> android<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
I mean I'm putting my android in a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.760 
I mean I'm putting my android in a
position<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:31.520> attack<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:33.110> he's<00:01:34.110> gonna<00:01:34.590> make

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
position of attack that he's gonna make

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:45.930 
position of attack that he's gonna make
it<00:01:34.830> look<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.130> he's<00:01:35.370> firing<00:01:35.760> at<00:01:39.290> his<00:01:40.290> enemy

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.260 

I'm<00:01:46.450> going<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.660> make<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:46.870> seem<00:01:47.080> like<00:01:47.140> he<00:01:47.380> has<00:01:47.590> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
I'm going to make it seem like he has a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.070 
I'm going to make it seem like he has a
sort<00:01:49.270> of<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.480> weapon<00:01:49.690> on<00:01:49.990> top<00:01:50.290> of<00:01:50.470> his

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.980 

outstretched<00:01:56.080> arm<00:01:56.620> their<00:02:00.180> little<00:02:01.180> laser

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
outstretched arm their little laser

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.150 
outstretched arm their little laser
blasts<00:02:02.560> there<00:02:03.750> come<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:05.140> establish<00:02:05.950> where

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
blasts there come in and establish where

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:26.240 
blasts there come in and establish where
all<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.520> different<00:02:09.600> body<00:02:10.600> parts<00:02:11.110> are

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.470 

and<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.180> fun<00:02:27.390> thing<00:02:27.420> about<00:02:27.660> drawing<00:02:28.290> and

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
and the fun thing about drawing and

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.260 
and the fun thing about drawing and
android<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:32.630> you're<00:02:33.630> allowed<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:34.140> obviously

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
android is you're allowed to obviously

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.410 
android is you're allowed to obviously
borrow<00:02:36.270> from<00:02:36.860> basic<00:02:37.860> human<00:02:38.280> designs<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:41.420> when

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
borrow from basic human designs and when

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.560 
borrow from basic human designs and when
you're<00:02:42.630> when<00:02:43.470> you're<00:02:43.590> drawing<00:02:43.800> this<00:02:44.570> robot

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
you're when you're drawing this robot

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.140 
you're when you're drawing this robot
creature<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:47.370> fun<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.700> kind<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:47.940> take

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
creature it's fun to kind of take

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.000 
creature it's fun to kind of take
certain<00:02:48.600> physical<00:02:48.840> attributes<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.650> human

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
certain physical attributes of human

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.400 
certain physical attributes of human
beings<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.550> then<00:02:50.700> apply<00:02:51.000> them<00:02:51.270> in<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.720> usual

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
beings and then apply them in a usual

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.640 
beings and then apply them in a usual
way<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:52.860> your<00:02:53.310> robot<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:54.540> i<00:02:54.570> would<00:02:54.840> do<00:02:55.020> is<00:02:55.320> at

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
way to your robot what i would do is at

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.949 
way to your robot what i would do is at
certain<00:02:56.160> point<00:02:56.370> i<00:02:56.550> would<00:02:56.610> come<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.150> i<00:02:57.510> would

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
certain point i would come in i would

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.900 
certain point i would come in i would
really<00:02:58.140> start<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.620> define<00:02:58.980> things<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.640> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
really start to define things like the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.180 
really start to define things like the
face<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:02.280> obviously<00:03:02.850> don't<00:03:03.739> you<00:03:04.739> obviously

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
face you obviously don't you obviously

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.130 
face you obviously don't you obviously
don't<00:03:05.400> want<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.700> make<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:05.910> look<00:03:06.090> too<00:03:06.510> human

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
don't want it to make it look too human

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.729 
don't want it to make it look too human
because<00:03:08.100> if<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.340> does<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:09.530> spoils<00:03:10.530> the

because if it does that spoils the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.760 
because if it does that spoils the
illusion<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:12.780> being<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.080> robot<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.530> want<00:03:13.680> to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
illusion of it being a robot you want to

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.840 
illusion of it being a robot you want to
clearly<00:03:14.010> make<00:03:14.280> sure<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.580> everyone

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
clearly make sure that everyone

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.550 
clearly make sure that everyone
understands<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.660> in<00:03:15.840> fact<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:16.170> robot

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
understands that it is in fact a robot

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.080 
understands that it is in fact a robot
and<00:03:16.590> obviously<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:18.180> are<00:03:18.330> free<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:20.489> do<00:03:20.670> just

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
and obviously you are free to do just

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.160 
and obviously you are free to do just
about<00:03:21.150> anything<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:21.540> want<00:03:21.930> in<00:03:22.050> terms<00:03:22.230> of

about anything you want in terms of
design

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.509 

from<00:03:43.140> here<00:03:43.319> on<00:03:43.469> out<00:03:43.620> it's<00:03:43.890> really<00:03:44.040> all<00:03:44.249> in<00:03:44.400> the

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
from here on out it's really all in the

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.220 
from here on out it's really all in the
details

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.860 

kind<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:48.920> come<00:03:49.129> in<00:03:49.310> there<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.709> really<00:03:52.870> make

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
kind of come in there and really make

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.589 
kind of come in there and really make
sure<00:03:54.049> people<00:03:54.319> understand<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:55.790> mechanics<00:03:55.970> of

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
sure people understand the mechanics of

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:04.809 
sure people understand the mechanics of
it<00:03:56.659> all<00:03:57.879> and<00:03:58.879> the<00:03:59.000> shapes<00:03:59.360> and<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:04.489> get<00:04:04.670> this

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
it all and the shapes and you get this

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.130 
it all and the shapes and you get this
point<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:05.120> can<00:04:05.209> get<00:04:05.330> into<00:04:05.420> some<00:04:05.660> pretty<00:04:05.840> crazy

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
point you can get into some pretty crazy

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.089 
point you can get into some pretty crazy
detail<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.220> can<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:10.690> know<00:04:11.690> add<00:04:11.900> wires<00:04:12.530> and

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
detail to you can you know add wires and

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.910 
detail to you can you know add wires and
tubes<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:14.750> all<00:04:14.840> sorts<00:04:15.140> of<00:04:15.200> crazy<00:04:15.410> things<00:04:15.530> to

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
tubes and all sorts of crazy things to

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.920 
tubes and all sorts of crazy things to
make<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:16.340> look<00:04:16.489> you<00:04:17.269> know<00:04:17.419> more<00:04:18.310> machine<00:04:19.310> like

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
make it look you know more machine like

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:29.120 
make it look you know more machine like
so<00:04:21.880> go<00:04:22.880> in<00:04:23.090> and<00:04:23.270> really<00:04:23.389> add<00:04:23.660> some<00:04:23.960> detail

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.100 

but<00:04:30.360> once<00:04:31.360> you've<00:04:31.480> kind<00:04:31.660> of<00:04:31.690> gone<00:04:31.870> over

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
but once you've kind of gone over

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.540 
but once you've kind of gone over
everything<00:04:32.290> and<00:04:32.650> you're<00:04:32.770> happy<00:04:32.980> with<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:33.400> this

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
everything and you're happy with it this

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.370 
everything and you're happy with it this
is<00:04:33.730> you<00:04:34.330> know<00:04:34.450> early<00:04:34.900> at<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.080> end<00:04:35.170> of<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.290> day

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
is you know early at the end of the day

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.960 
is you know early at the end of the day
would<00:04:35.560> it<00:04:35.620> ought<00:04:36.100> to<00:04:36.130> be<00:04:36.310> close<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.610> looking

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
would it ought to be close to looking

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.740 
would it ought to be close to looking
like<00:04:37.120> this<00:04:37.390> is<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.780> general<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:39.340> know<00:04:39.510> look<00:04:40.510> for

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
like this is a general you know look for

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.230 
like this is a general you know look for
a<00:04:40.780> battle<00:04:41.020> Android<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.800> obviously<00:04:42.130> you<00:04:43.060> are

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
a battle Android and obviously you are

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.610 
a battle Android and obviously you are
the<00:04:43.330> designer<00:04:43.660> so<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:43.990> may<00:04:44.110> do<00:04:44.200> whatever<00:04:44.470> you

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
the designer so you may do whatever you

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.650 
the designer so you may do whatever you
wish<00:04:44.740> but<00:04:44.980> this<00:04:45.130> is<00:04:45.280> my<00:04:45.550> definition<00:04:45.820> anyway<00:04:46.510> of

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
wish but this is my definition anyway of

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.610 
wish but this is my definition anyway of
what<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:47.080> battle<00:04:47.410> Android<00:04:48.010> might<00:04:48.400> look<00:04:48.550> like
