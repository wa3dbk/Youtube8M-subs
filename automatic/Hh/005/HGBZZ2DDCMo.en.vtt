00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
balance system what we're going to take

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.650 
balance system what we're going to take
a<00:00:07.230> look<00:00:07.410> at<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.010> difference<00:00:08.370> between

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
a look at is the difference between

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.879 
a look at is the difference between
Yvonne's<00:00:09.660> white<00:00:10.320> shirt<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.179> her<00:00:12.179> skin<00:00:12.420> tones

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.730 
compared to the normal indoor white
balance<00:00:15.870> setting<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.230> right<00:00:16.410> now<00:00:16.440> we're

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
balance setting so right now we're

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.900 
balance setting so right now we're
totally<00:00:17.250> white<00:00:17.850> balance<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:19.010> preset<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.699> if

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
totally white balance to preset but if

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.599 
totally white balance to preset but if
we<00:00:20.970> were<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.300> zoom<00:00:21.480> into<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.650> warm<00:00:22.949> card<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
we were to zoom into the warm card and

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.359 
we were to zoom into the warm card and
white<00:00:24.300> balance<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.380> pale<00:00:25.740> blue<00:00:26.099> card

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
white balance to this pale blue card

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.880 
white balance to this pale blue card
called<00:00:26.699> warm<00:00:27.000> one<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:28.859> can

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
called warm one what we can do is we can

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.840 
called warm one what we can do is we can
see<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.519> when<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:29.910> white<00:00:30.330> balance<00:00:31.850> it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
see that when we white balance it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.330 
see that when we white balance it
mellows<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.690> more<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.230> gray<00:00:34.469> color<00:00:34.710> so

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
mellows it to more of a gray color so

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.540 
mellows it to more of a gray color so
just<00:00:35.610> neutralize<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.510> pale<00:00:37.410> blue<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.070> now

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
just neutralize that pale blue and now

these warm cards you can see they come

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.360 
these warm cards you can see they come
in<00:00:57.750> different<00:00:57.899> strengths<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:59.250> go

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
ahead and warm up a little bit more you

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.560 
ahead and warm up a little bit more you
have<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> stronger<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> warm<00:01:03.059> two<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.539> a

have a stronger with a warm two and a
little<00:01:03.719> bit<00:01:03.809> stronger<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.890> warm<00:01:05.129> three

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
little bit stronger for the warm three

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.210 
little bit stronger for the warm three
so<00:01:06.150> again<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> difference<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.920> let's<00:01:08.040> zoom

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
so again the difference and let's zoom

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.560 
so again the difference and let's zoom
all<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.490> way<00:01:08.610> back<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.090> kind<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.390> see

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
all the way back so you kind of see

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.480 
all the way back so you kind of see
other<00:01:09.689> things<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> studio<00:01:10.470> we're<00:01:11.369> going

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
other things in the studio we're going

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.179 
other things in the studio we're going
to<00:01:11.580> switch<00:01:12.030> back<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.270> our<00:01:12.750> normal<00:01:13.619> setting

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
to switch back to our normal setting

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.740 
to switch back to our normal setting
actually<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.909> our<00:01:15.060> normal<00:01:15.180> setting<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
actually this is our normal setting and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.340 
actually this is our normal setting and
here's<00:01:16.409> our<00:01:16.500> warmer<00:01:16.830> setting<00:01:18.140> so<00:01:19.140> before

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
here's our warmer setting so before

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.460 
here's our warmer setting so before
without<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.130> worm<00:01:20.310> cards<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:21.470> very

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
without the worm cards and with very

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.039 
without the worm cards and with very
cool<00:01:22.799> very<00:01:23.040> nice<00:01:23.610> very<00:01:24.330> inexpensive<00:01:24.960> solution

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
cool very nice very inexpensive solution

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.980 
cool very nice very inexpensive solution
to<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.650> warmer<00:01:26.040> film<00:01:26.310> Mike<00:01:26.490> look

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.179 

alright<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.350> example<00:01:31.530> we're<00:01:31.920> taking

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
alright so in this example we're taking

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.529 
alright so in this example we're taking
a<00:01:32.280> look<00:01:32.399> at<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.640> different<00:01:32.939> colors<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.270> light

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
a look at the different colors of light

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.300 
a look at the different colors of light
right<00:01:34.170> now<00:01:34.200> we're<00:01:34.409> white<00:01:34.649> balance<00:01:35.039> to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
right now we're white balance to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.800 
right now we're white balance to
incandescent<00:01:36.380> 3200<00:01:37.380> Kelvin<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.659> what<00:01:39.659> you're

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
incandescent 3200 Kelvin and what you're

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.870 
incandescent 3200 Kelvin and what you're
seeing<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.439> white<00:01:40.799> light<00:01:41.159> bulb<00:01:41.399> and<00:01:41.640> you're

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
seeing is a white light bulb and you're

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.429 
seeing is a white light bulb and you're
seeing<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.270> daylight<00:01:42.659> balanced<00:01:43.020> light<00:01:43.229> is

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
seeing that a daylight balanced light is

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.620 
seeing that a daylight balanced light is
appearing<00:01:43.829> blue<00:01:44.070> let's<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.210> happens<00:01:45.509> if

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
appearing blue let's see what happens if

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.940 
appearing blue let's see what happens if
we<00:01:45.750> switch<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.259> white<00:01:46.409> balance<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.950> daylight

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
we switch the white balance to daylight
