00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.890
 an innovative research and development project carried out by lotus engineering 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.740
 and the chaff with ufo holdings 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.960
 allows to reduce the issue of ciro 2 by more than 22% 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.550
 and is already in an advanced state of study to equip recent models 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.820
 lotus engineering presented a world preview at the

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.589
 that the English car manufacturer has done with the company to which it belongs 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:34.340
 proton 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.240
 with the aim of introducing reduced licensing variants in the range 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.380
 already existing models equipped both with petrol engine and guy 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.620
 totosi ingeneering strongly believes that the way of applying the 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.890
 Hybrid technology is the key to reducing the polluting emissions of cv2 and 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.580
 this technology will be more easily available in the next 5 years 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.430
 he said adaptable to the technologies currently present in the cars 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.780
 this solution will be proposed by lotus engineering 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.190
 to its customers 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.510
 maintaining the original price of the cars thanks to the low costs of the 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.590
 development and will be available immediately to introduce in 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.740
 current models in the next generation of java cars to the 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.740
 time of the project 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.980
 the program hey would say 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.700
 do well and focus on establishing production processes 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.790
 integrated with hybrid technology with the lowest development cost 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.030
 I see in very fast time 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.770
 bypassing many the rest 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.750
 connected with integration of hybrid technology into the platforms already 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.689
 existing 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.850
 through an intelligent design 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.499
 and with compact dimensions where all hybrid systems 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:55.330
 they come on TV 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.700
 in recent times many of the solutions adopted by lotus engineering aim at 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.490
 offer excellent proposals 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.730
 to other vehicle manufacturers 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.529
 in medium to high range 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.969
 program was held with 2t indigenous people 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:17.239

 do the first demonstration 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.109
 made on the basis of the compact car deepening 2 equipped 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.540
 with a 1-point 6-liter petrol engine that allows the demonstration of 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.249
 three new technologies 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:42.489
 such as the micro hybrid star dance top system 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.799
 parallel hybrid technology and variable transmission accounts 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:51.009

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:57.189
