00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.790
 one of my favorites of mario kart is the 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.769
 mario kart double dash 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.870
 the differential of this game for the games 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.150
 of the mario kart you found two 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.549
 characters in a kart, this is a lot 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.780
 fun you can have alternating between 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.639
 two characters for example if you 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.579
 is playing with mario luigi 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.470
 you can choose human is piloting 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.260
 then you can change and 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.319
 putting the leed to pilot and an area 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.419
 to play but the items are not to detonate 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.660
 especially the other carts in the front 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:18.630
 a very good and excellent game and comenda 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.709

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.190
 board 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.590

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.270
