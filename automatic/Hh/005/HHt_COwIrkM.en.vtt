00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.040
 hi all guys are always i 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.560
 baths and welcome back to the channel of a few 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.360
 hubert then today as you know Thursday e 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.800
 so I am the one who brings you 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.590
 the door is part of the pokémon guide 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.320
 arcoiris and I want to clarify immediately 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.600
 that this part is not a live like 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.760
 I usually do but it's a post that at least 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.040
 so comment on why I'm doing it 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.050
 narrating on the part and then I ask you 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.699
 to pay more attention to that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.350
 which I will tell you is what you will see on 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.589
 gameplay because I have some things to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.510
 just tell you even if it's not so much 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.309
 guys immediately start that is I mean 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.650
 that I apologize for last week that 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.180
 I didn't load the part of course 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.729
 this part where it had to arrive 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.250
 last week but for many 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:06.840
 problems did not come because it is there 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.750
 precisely the modem, various crap that I am 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.270
 have prevented from registering it e 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.030
 just to load it and in fact I have 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.010
 alerted also to other comrades 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.900
 few cuber if I don't know if they were 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.210
 communicated something however I anyway for 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.700
 that week he had entered twice 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.030
 on youtube and then let it be 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.540
 so I apologize but today I wanted to 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.880
 do this kind of video 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.010
 with my comment above but from the dai 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.650
 next at least hopefully that will be all 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.700
 in place and I will return to play the parts in 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.230
 live 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.730
 and oh well as you can see in this 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.700
 part I have not done much in fact I'm 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.980
 training pokémon here and we're going 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.810
 a little ahead beating some coaches 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.220
 and then I especially have to thank you 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.590
 what guys in the comments you write to me 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.240
 always like going on and indeed it has 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.250
 kept doing it because it is again 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.200
 need because anyway i to do 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.280
 this guide will play once a 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.300
 week or the guide anyway 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.020
 being also in Spanish is just me 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.940
 I remember it so much when he picked it up again 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.130
 so guys since been rumors 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.420
 playing that from how you can guess in 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.430
 comments 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.260
 I ask myself to tell me everything 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.870
 you have on the game and therefore never from 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.880
 we will write the private message on mine 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.160
 channel or not write it when i 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.390
 comments so I say in preparation and 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.700
 I go ahead 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.260
 maybe I could even say hello anyway 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.480
 to thank you and this then 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.909
 many ask me if I already have in mind the 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.980
 team to do but guys in fact 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.569
 as I told you I don't know anything because 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.510
 it is the first time they play us then 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.200
 sandy spanish I don't understand doubly e 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.739
 so as you know the work if p2p jobs 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.230
 I'm after in the sense that I found them 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.000
 are bonuses given by the game and therefore i 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.290
 guys me and if there will be others like that 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.760
 I will keep those because they are anyway 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.740
 always strong because I honestly don't know 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.270
 as they are found in the grass 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.680
 I only know that being comes up to 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.550
 third generation however the map is 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.060
 different 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.520
 yet the areas therefore do not seem useless 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.440
 so if they give us those there why not 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.940
 take them so kids I 'll keep those 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:20.000
 there and then always suitable of themes always 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.620
 a monster I don't know if you find something 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.840
 some of their scorers are interesting 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.380
 or in part 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.090
 then the last thing I wanted to tell you 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.739
 guys that I don't know if yes well there are any 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.930
 you will surely be noticed that with 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.030
 this channel we have exceeded a thousand and 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.569
 100 children enrolled in a month 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.790
 mom my kids i the others 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.230
 we will never thank you enough for 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.660
 for the supporters and we are giving 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:50.200
 and it will certainly come 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.290
 a special wine that we are still de 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.560
 but let's say that we are there 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.000
 exchanged ideas and now we'll see if 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.520
 the others also agree and if there is 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.440
 will be precisely because we wanted that 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.310
 come a well done thing because to do 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.600
 thousand subscribers and in any case it is this then i 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.880
 guys I wanted great to clarify the 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.390
 question of why however many 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.060
 many people send us messages 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.940
 personal where they ask us to enter a 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.130
 being part of staff then I wanted 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.200
 excellent clarify this question but not 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.850
 from sunken no because now one sees 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.930
 this settemari channel says knows that 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.000
 I want to enter too 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.680
 ok now a moment considering that anyway 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.020
 I do not have anything to say 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.820
 I wanted to talk about this thing then 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.240
 guys do you know that the idea started from 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.250
 mills and in any case we have 7 vabbè 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.260
 we can define ourselves those that still today 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.650
 they are almost more famous than when me 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.080
 few in this area on youtube e 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.730
 so in fact we were also already friends and 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.170
 so that's why we decided 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.180
 also to create one 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.440
 but it's not like we got what they cause 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.930
 the exceptions I know most beautiful was 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.120
 taken at random so on the way later 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.400
 we obviously have a joke and friends here 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.140
 we took the boy for the 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.520
 moment we remain we continue septa 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.190
 the ones we are doing because then 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.520
 however many ask us to enter 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.410
 however if one enters then a part that 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.030
 it serves however the is the week therefore 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.490
 we have already distributed days for the 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.080
 video but then if we let it in 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.580
 one as you know, that is, others too 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.230
 they say what you did and why 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.480
 I ca n't go in for that too 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.450
 which for the moment at least as I repeat 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.640
 for the moment we are 7 if then in 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.600
 future if I don't know, a column is spoken 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.580
 where we will decide to make known 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.740
 some youtuber that needs to 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.390
 growing up the kids will make but it's all from 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.190
 see now nothing is decided yet 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.169
 we talked about it but little because 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.430
 however now we have the first 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.840
 created the channel so now there 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.450
 focus on in the sets on the guides that 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.420
 we are doing e 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:53.930
 now guys then not continued not 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.310
 continue because then that is a piece not 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.870
 keep asking three guys that 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:02.030
 for the moment it is no so here is no in 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.880
 future and kids will see you first while 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:09.620
 so don't worry look at ours 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.390
 video and this is enough and guys I don't 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.770
 I have nothing more to say I know I am six 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.480
 minutes to do it but I still have 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.070
 wanted to tell him what I had to say e 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.570
 clear up some right 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.080
 question that maybe he didn't have with his ass 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:23.479
 understood and 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.400
 enough now I would say about drake though 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:27.740
 I always leave the other there is the video 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.409
 but I continue other minutes I know I don't know 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.759
 how much, however, guys from me 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:33.379
 I hope the next part is all a 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.960
 place or will be re- commented live 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:37.550
