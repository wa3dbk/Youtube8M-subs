00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
so Dale this is the first super electric

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.080 
so Dale this is the first super electric
car<00:00:07.589> ever<00:00:07.859> built<00:00:07.980> in<00:00:08.280> Britain<00:00:08.400> that's<00:00:08.820> right

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
car ever built in Britain that's right

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.270 
car ever built in Britain that's right
and<00:00:09.330> how<00:00:09.719> fast<00:00:09.929> have<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.200> taken<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.590> I've<00:00:11.130> been

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
and how fast have you taken it I've been

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.830 
and how fast have you taken it I've been
to<00:00:11.370> about<00:00:11.460> 120<00:00:12.090> units<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.420> far

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
to about 120 units so far

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.589 
to about 120 units so far
what's<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.500> British<00:00:14.400> record<00:00:14.759> for<00:00:15.269> electric

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
what's the British record for electric

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.150 
what's the British record for electric
cars<00:00:15.630> British<00:00:16.440> record<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.770> one<00:00:16.859> hundred<00:00:17.070> and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
cars British record is one hundred and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160 
cars British record is one hundred and
thirty<00:00:17.460> eight<00:00:17.580> or<00:00:17.880> nine<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.570> you'll<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.869> taking

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
thirty eight or nine so you'll be taking

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.410 
thirty eight or nine so you'll be taking
on<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.350> record<00:00:19.680> yes<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.970> couple<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.240> months

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
on the record yes in a couple of months

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.660 
on the record yes in a couple of months
time<00:00:21.570> yeah<00:00:21.869> yeah<00:00:22.189> what's<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.369> difference

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
time yeah yeah what's the difference

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.980 
time yeah yeah what's the difference
between<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.269> Ferrari<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
between this and a Ferrari this is a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.679 
between this and a Ferrari this is a
purely<00:00:25.350> electric<00:00:25.769> car<00:00:26.330> two<00:00:27.330> moving<00:00:27.660> parts

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
purely electric car two moving parts

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.009 
purely electric car two moving parts
Fiona<00:00:28.789> I<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.420> think<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> as<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> wind

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
Fiona I like to think of it as a wind

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.770 
Fiona I like to think of it as a wind
powered<00:00:31.320> car<00:00:31.560> because<00:00:32.270> it's<00:00:33.270> important<00:00:33.690> in

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
powered car because it's important in

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.180 
powered car because it's important in
their<00:00:33.960> whole<00:00:34.110> debate<00:00:34.350> about<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.829> shift<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
their whole debate about the shift to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.620 
their whole debate about the shift to
electric<00:00:35.520> cars<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:36.059> don't<00:00:36.360> forget<00:00:36.450> that

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
electric cars that we don't forget that

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.819 
electric cars that we don't forget that
the<00:00:36.899> electricity<00:00:37.440> has<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.559> come<00:00:37.770> from

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the electricity has to come from

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.799 
the electricity has to come from
somewhere<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:39.180> our<00:00:39.300> case<00:00:39.510> what<00:00:39.690> we've

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
somewhere and in our case what we've

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.000 
somewhere and in our case what we've
built<00:00:39.899> here<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> wind-powered<00:00:40.440> car<00:00:40.860> to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
built here is a wind-powered car to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.740 
built here is a wind-powered car to
demonstrate<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.540> lot<00:00:42.719> of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
demonstrate that we can have a lot of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.420 
demonstrate that we can have a lot of
fun<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.110> electric<00:00:43.559> cars<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.980> future<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
fun in electric cars of the future and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.979 
fun in electric cars of the future and
we<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.450> know<00:00:45.539> maintain<00:00:45.870> our

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
we can we can you know maintain our

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.020 
we can we can you know maintain our
lifestyle<00:00:46.379> still<00:00:46.620> drive<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> lot<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.640> very

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
lifestyle still drive a lot this is very

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.209 
lifestyle still drive a lot this is very
different<00:00:48.329> from<00:00:48.450> almost<00:00:49.140> every<00:00:49.469> electric<00:00:50.100> car

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
different from almost every electric car

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.100 
different from almost every electric car
I've<00:00:50.370> ever<00:00:50.399> seen<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.600> fun<00:00:51.809> it's

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
I've ever seen because it's fun it's

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.889 
I've ever seen because it's fun it's
yeah<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.760> Jeremy<00:00:54.180> Clarkson<00:00:54.600> it's

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
yeah it's this is Jeremy Clarkson it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.650 
yeah it's this is Jeremy Clarkson it's
your<00:00:55.110> socks<00:00:55.410> yeah<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.309> when<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.760> sow<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
your socks yeah we we when we sow to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660 
your socks yeah we we when we sow to
make<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.620> wanted<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> smash<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
make it we wanted to smash the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.220 
make it we wanted to smash the
stereotypes<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.390> electric<00:01:00.750> cars<00:01:00.930> being

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
stereotypes of electric cars being

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.450 
stereotypes of electric cars being
something<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.559> Noddy<00:01:01.859> would<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.309> drive

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
something that Noddy would like to drive

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.640 
something that Noddy would like to drive
yeah<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.449> thought<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.899> cars<00:01:04.170> got<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.470> look

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
yeah so we thought this cars got to look

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
yeah so we thought this cars got to look
good<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.070> got<00:01:05.189> sound<00:01:05.549> good<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.270> got<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
good it's got sound good and it's got to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.940 
good it's got sound good and it's got to
get<00:01:06.600> really<00:01:06.900> well<00:01:07.049> what's<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.710> back<00:01:07.830> in

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
get really well what's in the back in

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.010 
get really well what's in the back in
carbon<00:01:08.460> fibre<00:01:08.610> tail<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.240> made<00:01:09.450> two<00:01:09.630> LED

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
carbon fibre tail that we made two LED

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.719 
carbon fibre tail that we made two LED
lights<00:01:10.290> backing<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
lights backing on this is this is the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.609 
lights backing on this is this is the
original<00:01:11.790> motors<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.810> been<00:01:12.990> expanded

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
original motors but it's been expanded

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.859 
original motors but it's been expanded
outwards<00:01:13.979> or<00:01:14.159> what's<00:01:14.700> different<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.659> our

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
outwards or what's different this is our

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.510 
outwards or what's different this is our
tail<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> whole<00:01:16.740> back<00:01:16.950> end<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.310> made

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
tail we with the whole back end we made

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.940 
tail we with the whole back end we made
right<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.390> car<00:01:18.869> itself<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.380> stretch<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.920> make

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
right the car itself we stretch to make

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.590 
right the car itself we stretch to make
it<00:01:20.159> longer<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.670> how<00:01:21.090> do<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.240> charge<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.540> up

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
it longer so how do you charge it up

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.490 
it longer so how do you charge it up
this<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:23.479> we've<00:01:24.479> got<00:01:24.600> two<00:01:24.750> flaps<00:01:25.020> one<00:01:25.409> on

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
this is the we've got two flaps one on

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.810 
this is the we've got two flaps one on
this<00:01:25.619> side<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> slow<00:01:26.189> charge<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:26.700> on

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this side for the slow charge and one on

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.149 
this side for the slow charge and one on
that<00:01:26.909> side<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> fast<00:01:27.479> charge<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
that side for the fast charge and

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.870 
that side for the fast charge and
hopefully<00:01:29.159> it'll<00:01:29.280> behave<00:01:29.460> yourself<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.850> just

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
hopefully it'll behave yourself you just

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.710 
hopefully it'll behave yourself you just
push<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.329> pull<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.689> then<00:01:31.439> out<00:01:31.770> comes<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.100> plug

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
push and pull and then out comes a plug

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.990 
push and pull and then out comes a plug
it's<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:33.900> my<00:01:34.049> my<00:01:34.829> Hoover<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:38.820> you

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it's like my my Hoover and and then you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.830 
it's like my my Hoover and and then you
snatch<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.540> she'd<00:01:39.689> go<00:01:39.840> back<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.720> we

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
snatch in it she'd go back in but so we

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.300 
snatch in it she'd go back in but so we
use<00:01:43.140> all<00:01:43.259> stop<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.890> would<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.159> back

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
use all stop it like it would you back

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.600 
use all stop it like it would you back
in<00:01:44.460> he's<00:01:45.049> tweaking<00:01:46.049> when<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.070> goes<00:01:47.189> back<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
