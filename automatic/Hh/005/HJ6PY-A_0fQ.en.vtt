00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
actually totally committing to a cut

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.510 
actually totally committing to a cut
crease<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.930> I'm<00:02:15.500> also<00:02:15.650> taking<00:02:16.069> these<00:02:16.160> colors

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
crease and I'm also taking these colors

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.860 
crease and I'm also taking these colors
and<00:02:16.700> I'm<00:02:16.760> bringing<00:02:16.940> them<00:02:17.209> forth<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.569> little<00:02:17.780> bit

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
and I'm bringing them forth a little bit

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.180 
and I'm bringing them forth a little bit
closer<00:02:18.200> towards<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.740> bridge<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.040> my<00:02:19.160> nose

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.860 
closer towards the bridge of my nose
which<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.580> something<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:20.090> don't<00:02:20.240> typically<00:02:20.600> do

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
which is something I don't typically do

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.540 
which is something I don't typically do

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
because I like the inner corner to be

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.130
