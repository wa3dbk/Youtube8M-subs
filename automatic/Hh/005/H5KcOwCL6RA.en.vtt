import this image into blender so that

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.370 
import this image into blender so that
only<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.310> image<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.029> leaf<00:00:24.210> shows<00:00:25.080> up

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
only the image of the leaf shows up

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.620 
only the image of the leaf shows up
everything<00:00:25.980> else<00:00:26.130> will<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.670> transparent<00:00:27.330> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
I'm going to hit B for brush and I have

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.600 
I'm going to hit B for brush and I have
white<00:01:06.990> selected<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
I don't I've got black selected okay

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.890 
I don't I've got black selected okay
so<00:01:19.770> save<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.210> same<00:01:21.420> format<00:01:21.869> that

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
so save that in the same format that

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.080 
so save that in the same format that
your<00:01:22.200> picture<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.310> image<00:01:23.520> was<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.790> PNG

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
your picture is and the image was in PNG

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
your picture is and the image was in PNG
so<00:01:24.750> follow<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.259> up<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.380> PNG<00:01:25.770> blender

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
so follow it up with PNG blender

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.190 
so follow it up with PNG blender
sometimes<00:01:26.850> gets<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.119> little<00:01:27.150> weird<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.840> kicks

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
sometimes gets a little weird and kicks

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.740 
sometimes gets a little weird and kicks
out<00:01:28.350> PNG<00:01:28.860> files<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.610> may<00:01:30.180> also<00:01:30.479> want<00:01:30.659> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
out PNG files so you may also want to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.780 
out PNG files so you may also want to
try<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.140> JPEG<00:01:31.500> now<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.310> setting<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.729> up

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
try this in JPEG now on to setting it up

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.370 
try this in JPEG now on to setting it up
here<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> quick<00:01:33.420> scene<00:01:33.630> setup<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.140> Sun

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
here I have a quick scene setup a Sun

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.910 
here I have a quick scene setup a Sun
from<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.650> light<00:01:34.829> source<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:36.439> simply<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> ground

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
from a light source and simply a ground

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.100 
from a light source and simply a ground
so<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.400> show<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> shadow<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.930> now<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so that I can show the shadow so now to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.030 
so that I can show the shadow so now to
add<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.439> plane<00:01:41.689> file<00:01:43.220> import<00:01:45.500> image<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:46.710> plane

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
add the plane file import image as plane

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.020 
add the plane file import image as plane
there's<00:01:48.000> our<00:01:48.180> image<00:01:48.329> enter<00:01:49.490> let's<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.759> raise

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
there's our image enter let's just raise

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.270 
there's our image enter let's just raise
that<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.750> little<00:01:51.869> bit<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.380> rotate<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.189> on

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that up a little bit and rotate it on

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.370 
that up a little bit and rotate it on
the<00:01:53.490> x-axis<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.840> little<00:01:55.049> bit<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.350> can

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
the x-axis just a little bit so we can

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.370 
the x-axis just a little bit so we can
see<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.770> shadow<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:58.759> there<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.880> go

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
see that shadow and there we go

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.810 
see that shadow and there we go
so<00:02:01.380> now<00:02:01.530> what<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.890> want<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.310> remove<00:02:02.549> all

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
so now what we want to do is remove all

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.420 
so now what we want to do is remove all
that<00:02:03.060> black<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.560> you'll<00:02:04.770> see<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that black so that you'll see just the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.249 
that black so that you'll see just the
leaf<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:05.909> shadow<00:02:06.360> will<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.689> represented

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
leaf and that shadow will be represented

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.010 
leaf and that shadow will be represented
properly<00:02:07.910> how<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.970> achieve<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.300> will<00:02:09.899> go

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
properly how to achieve that will go

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.890 
properly how to achieve that will go
into<00:02:10.170> our<00:02:10.379> node<00:02:10.649> editor

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.470 

and<00:02:16.220> it's<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.280> quite<00:02:17.459> simple<00:02:17.730> process<00:02:18.330> we're

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
and it's a quite simple process we're

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.699 
and it's a quite simple process we're
going<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.660> copy<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.200> image<00:02:19.850> note<00:02:21.709> here's

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
going to copy this image note here's

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.250 
going to copy this image note here's
where<00:02:22.920> we<00:02:23.010> add<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.400> alpha<00:02:23.940> image<00:02:24.300> there<00:02:25.170> we

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
where we add that alpha image there we

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.900 
where we add that alpha image there we
go<00:02:26.330> now<00:02:27.330> we're<00:02:27.450> going<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.600> add<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> shader

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
go now we're going to add a shader

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.260 
go now we're going to add a shader
excuse<00:02:29.910> me

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
excuse me

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:40.940 
excuse me
shift<00:02:30.600> they<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:32.330> mix<00:02:33.330> shader'<00:02:39.680> let's<00:02:40.680> give<00:02:40.800> this

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
shift they a mix shader' let's give this

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.140 
shift they a mix shader' let's give this
a<00:02:41.010> little<00:02:41.250> bit<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.489> space<00:02:41.790> here<00:02:43.910> I'll<00:02:44.910> tell<00:02:45.090> you

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
a little bit of space here I'll tell you

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.120 
a little bit of space here I'll tell you
a<00:02:45.209> running<00:02:45.600> Photoshop<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.470> then<00:02:46.739> blender

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
a running Photoshop and then blender

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.650 
a running Photoshop and then blender
sometimes<00:02:47.489> can<00:02:47.640> really<00:02:47.850> block<00:02:48.030> us<00:02:48.209> down<00:02:48.390> so

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
sometimes can really block us down so

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.220 
sometimes can really block us down so
sorry<00:02:49.020> about<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.380> lag<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:54.450> screen

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
sorry about this lag and screen

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.860 
sorry about this lag and screen
recording<00:02:56.180> we're<00:02:57.180> going<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.360> move<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.810> down

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
recording we're going to move that down

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.320 
recording we're going to move that down
so<00:02:58.320> again<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.920> original<00:02:59.040> image<00:02:59.670> goes<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.209> the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
so again the original image goes to the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.320 
so again the original image goes to the
diffuse<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.080> goes<00:03:01.440> into<00:03:01.680> shader<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:03.060> bottom

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
diffuse and goes into shader the bottom

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.740 
diffuse and goes into shader the bottom
half<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:04.680> shader<00:03:04.890> node<00:03:05.239> now<00:03:06.239> under<00:03:06.510> shader

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
half the shader node now under shader

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.840 
half the shader node now under shader
also<00:03:07.050> we're<00:03:07.140> going<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.290> go<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.910> transparent

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
also we're going to go to transparent

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.479 
also we're going to go to transparent
all<00:03:11.850> right<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:13.769> Alpha<00:03:14.100> image<00:03:15.860> will<00:03:16.860> go<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.100> the

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
all right the Alpha image will go to the

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.729 
all right the Alpha image will go to the
FAC<00:03:18.950> tab<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.840> now<00:03:22.140> we're<00:03:22.290> going<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.440> click<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
FAC tab and now we're going to click the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.390 
FAC tab and now we're going to click the
transparent<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:24.420> add<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.470> shader<00:03:26.070> number

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
transparent and add it to shader number

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.190 
transparent and add it to shader number
one<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.850> that's<00:03:27.269> where<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.510> magic<00:03:27.690> happens

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
one and that's where the magic happens

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.670 
one and that's where the magic happens
folks<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:29.310> now<00:03:29.670> we<00:03:29.730> have<00:03:29.940> our<00:03:30.090> leaf<00:03:30.680> displaying

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
folks so now we have our leaf displaying

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.710 
folks so now we have our leaf displaying
the<00:03:31.829> proper<00:03:32.160> shadows<00:03:32.549> exactly<00:03:33.480> what<00:03:33.600> we're

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
the proper shadows exactly what we're

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.509 
the proper shadows exactly what we're
looking<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:34.019> achieve<00:03:34.170> we<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.160> can<00:03:35.280> use<00:03:35.400> this

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
looking to achieve we you can use this

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.250 
looking to achieve we you can use this
technique<00:03:35.730> for<00:03:35.940> many<00:03:36.690> different<00:03:37.140> functions

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
technique for many different functions

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.650 
technique for many different functions
