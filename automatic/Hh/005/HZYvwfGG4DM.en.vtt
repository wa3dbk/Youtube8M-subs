this<00:00:00.480> video<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.960> about<00:00:01.050> carving<00:00:01.439> 3d<00:00:02.040> indented

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
this video is about carving 3d indented

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.170 
this video is about carving 3d indented
letters<00:00:03.179> with<00:00:03.449> my<00:00:03.689> router<00:00:03.990> pantograph<00:00:05.180> Maya

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
letters with my router pantograph Maya

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.730 
letters with my router pantograph Maya
pantograph<00:00:06.720> not<00:00:06.990> only<00:00:07.140> controls<00:00:07.529> the

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
pantograph not only controls the

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.200 
pantograph not only controls the
position<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.280> router<00:00:08.519> but<00:00:08.730> also<00:00:08.910> adds

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
position of the router but also adds

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.450 
position of the router but also adds
depth<00:00:09.510> which<00:00:10.260> allows<00:00:10.530> me<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:11.010> carve<00:00:11.280> these

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
depth which allows me to carve these

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.220 
depth which allows me to carve these
profile<00:00:12.059> letters<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.690> kinetic<00:00:13.080> variable

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
profile letters of a kinetic variable

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.090 
profile letters of a kinetic variable
depth<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.830> cut<00:00:14.130> along<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.490> whole<00:00:14.790> letter<00:00:16.100> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
depth of cut along the whole letter the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.800 
depth of cut along the whole letter the
way<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.430> pantograph<00:00:17.880> works<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.779> a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
way the pantograph works is I have a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.200 
way the pantograph works is I have a
conical<00:00:19.410> follower<00:00:19.859> which<00:00:20.670> follows<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
conical follower which follows the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.990 
conical follower which follows the
grooves<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.720> template<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.640> V<00:00:23.640> bit<00:00:23.820> that

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
grooves in the template and V bit that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.370 
grooves in the template and V bit that
is<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.210> same<00:00:24.390> shape<00:00:24.630> as<00:00:24.779> my<00:00:24.810> clinical

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
is the same shape as my clinical

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.609 
is the same shape as my clinical
follower<00:00:25.789> now<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.480> have<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> wider<00:00:27.960> gap<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.590> my

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
follower now if I have a wider gap in my

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.189 
follower now if I have a wider gap in my
template<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.670> see<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.210> then<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
template as you can see here then the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.200 
template as you can see here then the
clinical<00:00:31.650> follower<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.340> dip<00:00:32.550> deeper<00:00:32.940> into

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
clinical follower can dip deeper into

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.360 
clinical follower can dip deeper into
that<00:00:33.360> template<00:00:33.750> which<00:00:34.649> will<00:00:34.829> tilt<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> whole

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that template which will tilt the whole

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.639 
that template which will tilt the whole
pantograph<00:00:35.880> forward<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.410> turn<00:00:37.440> will

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
pantograph forward and that in turn will

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.979 
pantograph forward and that in turn will
drive<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.340> v-shaped<00:00:38.790> cutter<00:00:39.090> deeper<00:00:39.600> into<00:00:39.840> my

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
drive the v-shaped cutter deeper into my

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.720 
drive the v-shaped cutter deeper into my
stock<00:00:40.290> which<00:00:40.590> will<00:00:40.739> make<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> deeper<00:00:41.520> wider

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
stock which will make for a deeper wider

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.299 
stock which will make for a deeper wider
cut<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.719> here's<00:00:43.020> my<00:00:43.079> v-shaped<00:00:43.739> bit<00:00:44.010> that

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
cut so here's my v-shaped bit that

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.119 
cut so here's my v-shaped bit that
carves<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.940> letters<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.770> to<00:00:46.770> go<00:00:46.890> along

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
carves out the letters and to go along

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.600 
carves out the letters and to go along
with<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.399> v-shaped<00:00:47.640> bit<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.620> have<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:50.010> conical

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
with this v-shaped bit I have a conical

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.279 
with this v-shaped bit I have a conical
follower<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.360> got<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> same<00:00:51.840> angle<00:00:52.199> as

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
follower that's got the same angle as

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.939 
follower that's got the same angle as
the<00:00:52.350> bit<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.120> that<00:00:54.199> follower<00:00:55.199> follows<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the bit and that follower follows in the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.910 
the bit and that follower follows in the
grooves<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> template<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.829> where<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
grooves of the template and where the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.220 
grooves of the template and where the
template<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.430> wider<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.120> dips<00:01:00.539> deeper<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.140> in

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
template is wider it dips deeper and in

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.799 
template is wider it dips deeper and in
where<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:01.890> wide<00:01:02.149> it<00:01:03.149> writes<00:01:03.449> further

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
where it's not as wide it writes further

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.960 
where it's not as wide it writes further
up<00:01:04.019> which<00:01:04.409> then<00:01:04.650> controls<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.339> depth<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.700> cut

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
up which then controls the depth of cut

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.660 
up which then controls the depth of cut
and<00:01:06.439> width<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> groove<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.340> might<00:01:08.520> be

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
and width of the groove that might be

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.109 
and width of the groove that might be
shaped<00:01:08.939> bit<00:01:09.150> will<00:01:09.330> cut<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:11.670> make<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
shaped bit will cut to make the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.420 
shaped bit will cut to make the
templates<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.780> start<00:01:13.619> with<00:01:13.740> letter<00:01:14.159> shapes

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
templates I start with letter shapes

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.340 
templates I start with letter shapes
that<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.820> printed<00:01:15.240> using<00:01:15.390> my<00:01:15.630> online<00:01:15.780> stencil

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that I printed using my online stencil

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.679 
that I printed using my online stencil
generator<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.610> glue<00:01:17.909> those<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.270> two<00:01:18.390> pieces

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
generator and I glue those on two pieces

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.230 
generator and I glue those on two pieces
of<00:01:18.720> half-inch<00:01:19.320> plywood<00:01:22.880> before<00:01:23.880> cutting<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
of half-inch plywood before cutting a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.030 
of half-inch plywood before cutting a
mode<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.659> drill<00:01:25.020> some<00:01:25.049> holes<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.710> some<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
mode I drill some holes in some of the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.230 
mode I drill some holes in some of the
corners<00:01:26.460> which<00:01:26.670> will<00:01:26.820> make<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.180> easier

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
corners which will make it much easier

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.060 
corners which will make it much easier
to<00:01:27.689> turn<00:01:27.840> around<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> bandsaw<00:01:28.770> blade

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
to turn around with the bandsaw blade

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.670 
to turn around with the bandsaw blade
and<00:01:30.610> then<00:01:31.300> I<00:01:31.390> separate<00:01:31.840> them<00:01:31.960> into<00:01:32.080> individual

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
and then I separate them into individual

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.030 
and then I separate them into individual
letters<00:01:32.950> on<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.159> table<00:01:33.490> saw<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:35.830> cut

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
letters on the table saw and then I cut

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.830 
letters on the table saw and then I cut
the<00:01:36.130> letters<00:01:36.370> out<00:01:36.520> on<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.700> bandsaw<00:01:37.090> it's

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
the letters out on the bandsaw it's

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.420 
the letters out on the bandsaw it's
quite<00:01:38.110> okay<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.440> just<00:01:38.620> make<00:01:38.830> a<00:01:38.860> cut<00:01:39.190> from<00:01:39.340> the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
quite okay to just make a cut from the

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.010 
quite okay to just make a cut from the
outside<00:01:39.820> into<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.150> letter<00:01:40.390> because<00:01:40.630> I<00:01:40.810> don't

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
outside into the letter because I don't

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.780 
outside into the letter because I don't
actually<00:01:41.170> have<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.530> follow<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.040> extra<00:01:42.550> cut

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
actually have to follow that extra cut

00:01:42.790 --> 00:02:10.440 
actually have to follow that extra cut
that<00:01:42.910> I<00:01:43.000> made

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.240 

next<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.540> glue<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.900> letters<00:02:12.140> down<00:02:12.350> onto<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.890> thin

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
next I glue the letters down onto a thin

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.550 
next I glue the letters down onto a thin
piece<00:02:13.550> of<00:02:13.610> plywood<00:02:13.970> as<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.300> backer<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:15.410> is

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
piece of plywood as a backer this is

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.350 
piece of plywood as a backer this is
important<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.250> hold<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.700> template<00:02:17.030> together

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
important to hold the template together

now<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.360> need<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.720> follower<00:03:00.350> for<00:03:00.560> my<00:03:00.650> template

now I need a follower for my template

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.670 
now I need a follower for my template
that's<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.519> same<00:03:01.820> shape<00:03:02.180> as<00:03:02.450> my<00:03:02.480> V<00:03:03.230> cutting

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
that's the same shape as my V cutting

that's the same shape as my V cutting
motor<00:03:03.860> hood<00:03:04.070> so<00:03:05.030> i<00:03:05.060> made<00:03:05.299> a<00:03:05.330> conical<00:03:06.049> follower

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
motor hood so i made a conical follower

my follower cone is critical depending

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.850 
my follower cone is critical depending
on how<00:03:26.690> high<00:03:26.900> i<00:03:26.930> said<00:03:27.320> it<00:03:27.440> i<00:03:27.590> end<00:03:27.739> up<00:03:27.799> with

on how high i said it i end up with

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.590 
on how high i said it i end up with
letters<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.430> are<00:03:28.519> really<00:03:28.760> skinny<00:03:29.060> or<00:03:29.360> really

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
letters that are really skinny or really

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.569 
letters that are really skinny or really
bold<00:03:32.470> once<00:03:33.470> i<00:03:33.590> have<00:03:33.709> everything<00:03:33.950> all<00:03:34.250> set<00:03:34.459> up

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
bold once i have everything all set up

carving<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.299> actual<00:03:35.690> sign<00:03:35.989> was<00:03:36.260> really<00:03:36.709> fast

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
carving the actual sign was really fast

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.039 
carving the actual sign was really fast
I<00:03:37.340> don't<00:03:38.030> have<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.239> be<00:03:38.360> really<00:03:38.630> careful<00:03:38.840> about

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
I don't have to be really careful about

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.170 
I don't have to be really careful about
falling<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.739> lines<00:03:39.950> because<00:03:40.400> my<00:03:40.610> cone<00:03:40.910> just

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
falling the lines because my cone just

00:03:41.180 --> 00:04:04.410 
falling the lines because my cone just
naturally<00:03:41.780> follows<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.290> grooves

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.930 

so<00:04:05.420> here's<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.870> relatively<00:04:06.440> deep<00:04:06.860> cut<00:04:07.220> to<00:04:07.489> sign

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
so here's a relatively deep cut to sign

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.850 
so here's a relatively deep cut to sign
using<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.750> one-half<00:04:09.200> scale<00:04:09.560> in<00:04:09.739> my

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
using the one-half scale in my

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.339 
using the one-half scale in my
pantograph<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.780> here's<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.900> same<00:04:12.080> sign

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
pantograph and here's the same sign

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.080 
pantograph and here's the same sign
carved<00:04:12.830> one-third<00:04:13.280> scale<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:13.760> one-half

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
carved one-third scale and one-half

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.870 
carved one-third scale and one-half
scale<00:04:14.390> both<00:04:14.630> from<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:14.900> same<00:04:15.140> template<00:04:15.650> and

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
scale both from the same template and

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.099 
scale both from the same template and
here's<00:04:16.880> experimenting<00:04:17.510> with<00:04:17.540> font<00:04:17.930> weight

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
here's experimenting with font weight

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.209 
here's experimenting with font weight
also<00:04:19.040> all<00:04:19.340> from<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.609> same<00:04:19.790> template
