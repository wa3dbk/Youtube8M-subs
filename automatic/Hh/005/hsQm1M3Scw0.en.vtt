00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.439
 today in tracktest a very special 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.110
 audi the karmann hull is celebrating this year 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.580
 her fiftieth birthday the technique 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.060
 comes from a ten year old 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.130
 porsche can be found here in his 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.950
 original form promises the name 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.169
 solid vw mass production technology paired with 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.169
 elegant Italian line guides 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.640
 very different this chamber visually almost 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.969
 as standard, it's more like calm 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.480
 and hair-raising lateral acceleration 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.420
 basic requirement for a good one 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.420
 tracktest time a hard sports suspension 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.399
 the bike is perfect i can 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.629
 really drive around the corners with the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.999
 Do not steer the gas foot 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.739
 It is very possible the chassis 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.399
 as soon as it goes from the gas that catches 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.399
 car immediately again 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.909
 scary acceleration and one 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.530
 Road situation as on rails still 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:26.700
 more impressive is the possible 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:28.560
 extreme speed straight ahead and 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.680
 it is not that you are afraid 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.670
 must lift water from a point of 150 to 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.670
 tempo 300 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.530
 a hussar piece charged the trick 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.479
 Parts like motors gearboxes and axles 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.670
 are stuck with the massive roll cage 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.530
 screwed next to brakes and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.210
 numerous other porsche building blocks 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:02:08.280
 the engine comes out too 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:02:10.619
 Zuffenhausen 320 ps conjure up a smile 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.019
 in the apparently the face are for the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.820
 close test track but almost too much around 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.010
 the silver bullet on the way to 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.140
 it requires an experienced 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.820
 pilots fortunately the designer has 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:30.840
 many kilometers with his racecourse 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:34.220
 unpacked I have not yet 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.220
 thank absolutely problems 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.170
 no hesitation in the gasfoot goes off the 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.170
 best time chases 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.810
 with 19 14 seconds shoots the chambers 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.810
 on a podium 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.280
 jochen bader draws a resume 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.230
 hardly is almost as important too heavy and 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.599
 actually overpowered and so it was 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.730
 actually quite a bit at the beginning 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.670
 Rode on the cannonball speaks halt 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.310
 very fast because the about 400 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.500
 newtonmeter torque and wants that 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.700
 stop then be counted and I am 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.110
 actually amazed that I'm in 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.830
 end effect then such a good time 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.510
 Reason enough for one 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.510
 befitting approval
