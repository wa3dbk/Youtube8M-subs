00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.460 
just throw it in your bag it's nice to
have<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.000> with<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.869> if<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> turn<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.380> off

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
have this with you so if you turn it off

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.539 
have this with you so if you turn it off
though<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.799> won't<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.130> able<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.340> push<00:01:56.520> down

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
though you won't be able to push down

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.060 
though you won't be able to push down
and<00:01:57.060> do<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.930> and<00:02:00.469> so<00:02:01.469> there's<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> Richard

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and do that and so there's the Richard

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.639 
and do that and so there's the Richard
solo<00:02:02.460> now<00:02:03.450> how<00:02:03.750> does<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.110> Richard<00:02:04.409> solo

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
solo now how does the Richard solo

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.999 
solo now how does the Richard solo
actually<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.189> power<00:02:05.430> through<00:02:06.680> this<00:02:07.680> USB

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
actually get power through this USB

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.040 
actually get power through this USB
cable<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:08.759> actually<00:02:09.060> kind<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.300> nice<00:02:09.509> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
cable it's actually kind of nice it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.930 
cable it's actually kind of nice it
locks<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.860> when<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.220> extend<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.670> all<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.879> way

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
locks and when you extend it all the way

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.850 
locks and when you extend it all the way
you<00:02:13.240> just<00:02:13.420> pull<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.780> one<00:02:13.900> more<00:02:14.080> time<00:02:14.320> they'll

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
you just pull it one more time they'll

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.970 
you just pull it one more time they'll
close<00:02:15.100> itself<00:02:15.430> up<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.720> one<00:02:17.170> port<00:02:17.560> will<00:02:17.830> get

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
close itself up so one port will get

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.640 
close itself up so one port will get
plugged<00:02:18.550> into<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.850> Richard<00:02:19.180> solo<00:02:19.420> itself<00:02:19.840> and

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
plugged into the Richard solo itself and

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.750 
plugged into the Richard solo itself and
the<00:02:20.830> other<00:02:20.950> port<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.340> have<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.520> few<00:02:21.730> options

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
the other port you have a few options

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.880 
the other port you have a few options
obviously<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.840> can<00:02:22.990> plug<00:02:23.200> this<00:02:23.290> into<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.590> USB

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
obviously you can plug this into a USB

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.070 
obviously you can plug this into a USB
for<00:02:24.220> power<00:02:24.460> but<00:02:24.760> included<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.750> have<00:02:25.900> two

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
for power but included you have two

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.590 
for power but included you have two
adapters<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.830> have<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.550> AC<00:02:27.940> power<00:02:28.420> adapter

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
adapters I have the AC power adapter

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.770 
adapters I have the AC power adapter
here<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.490> plug<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.880> in<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.180> just<00:02:31.420> plug<00:02:31.630> it

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
here so to plug it in you just plug it

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.240 
here so to plug it in you just plug it
in<00:02:32.850> like<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.230> also<00:02:35.230> included<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:35.800> box<00:02:36.010> is

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
in like that also included in the box is

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.040 
in like that also included in the box is
actually<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> car<00:02:36.940> charger<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:37.540> you'll<00:02:37.660> get<00:02:37.810> two

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
actually a car charger so you'll get two

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.490 
actually a car charger so you'll get two
USB<00:02:38.530> port<00:02:38.800> side<00:02:38.950> one<00:02:39.190> car<00:02:39.460> cigarette<00:02:39.790> port

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
USB port side one car cigarette port

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.170 
USB port side one car cigarette port
which<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.650> actually<00:02:41.800> really<00:02:42.100> nice<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.970> have

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
which is actually really nice to have

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.200 
which is actually really nice to have
that<00:02:43.890> for<00:02:44.890> your<00:02:45.040> car<00:02:45.280> because<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:45.910> can<00:02:46.060> use

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
that for your car because you can use

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.530 
that for your car because you can use
that<00:02:46.360> with<00:02:46.540> more<00:02:46.930> than<00:02:47.050> one<00:02:47.470> device<00:02:48.540> anything

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
that with more than one device anything

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.620 
that with more than one device anything
that<00:02:49.690> uses<00:02:49.930> USB<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.850> how<00:02:52.150> does<00:02:52.210> this<00:02:52.390> actually

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
that uses USB so how does this actually

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.650 
that uses USB so how does this actually
work<00:02:53.070> first<00:02:54.070> of<00:02:54.220> all<00:02:54.310> also<00:02:55.120> included<00:02:55.390> in<00:02:55.540> the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
work first of all also included in the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.180 
work first of all also included in the
Box<00:02:55.870> are<00:02:56.080> these<00:02:56.260> supports<00:02:56.770> one<00:02:56.950> for<00:02:57.130> the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
Box are these supports one for the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.370 
Box are these supports one for the
iphone<00:02:57.460> 3g<00:02:57.880> one<00:02:58.120> for<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.420> original<00:02:59.020> iphone

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
iphone 3g one for the original iphone

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.700 
iphone 3g one for the original iphone
that<00:02:59.980> just<00:03:00.160> is<00:03:00.430> an<00:03:00.580> extra<00:03:00.880> brace<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.840> make<00:03:02.530> the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
that just is an extra brace to make the

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.620 
that just is an extra brace to make the
connection<00:03:03.130> between<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.640> two<00:03:03.790> devices<00:03:03.940> more

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
connection between the two devices more

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.660 
connection between the two devices more
solid<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.560> doesn't<00:03:05.830> work<00:03:05.920> with<00:03:06.070> all<00:03:06.190> cases<00:03:06.460> but

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
solid it doesn't work with all cases but

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.090 
solid it doesn't work with all cases but
the<00:03:06.880> contour<00:03:07.300> flick<00:03:07.720> for<00:03:08.380> instance<00:03:08.770> it'll

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
the contour flick for instance it'll

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.440 
the contour flick for instance it'll
it'll<00:03:09.310> work<00:03:09.580> with<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:09.970> was<00:03:10.060> designed<00:03:10.360> to

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
it'll work with that it was designed to

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.470 
it'll work with that it was designed to
work<00:03:10.600> with<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.230> i<00:03:12.220> actually<00:03:12.340> got<00:03:13.300> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
work with that and i actually got the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.270 
work with that and i actually got the
flick<00:03:13.720> from<00:03:13.870> richard<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.800> never<00:03:15.010> seen<00:03:15.250> that

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
flick from richard and never seen that

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.330 
flick from richard and never seen that
in<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.610> later<00:03:15.760> review<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.709> again<00:03:17.980> it's

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
in a later review so again it's

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.340 
in a later review so again it's
recommended<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.060> use<00:03:19.450> with<00:03:19.630> particular<00:03:19.930> cases

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
recommended to use with particular cases

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.320 
recommended to use with particular cases
but<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.770> should<00:03:20.950> work<00:03:20.980> with<00:03:21.280> most<00:03:21.459> cases<00:03:21.850> you

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
but it should work with most cases you

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.800 
but it should work with most cases you
just<00:03:22.570> go<00:03:23.500> ahead<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.739> plug<00:03:24.130> it<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.630> your<00:03:25.630> iphone

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
just go ahead and plug it in your iphone

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.470 
just go ahead and plug it in your iphone
will<00:03:26.320> register<00:03:27.160> that's<00:03:27.520> being<00:03:27.730> charged<00:03:28.209> and

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
will register that's being charged and

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.560 
will register that's being charged and
the<00:03:28.510> richard<00:03:29.500> solo<00:03:29.800> unit<00:03:30.280> will<00:03:30.430> actually<00:03:30.880> like

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
the richard solo unit will actually like

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.750 
the richard solo unit will actually like
i<00:03:31.690> said<00:03:31.959> register<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.410> blue<00:03:32.650> light<00:03:32.860> that<00:03:33.160> it's

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
i said register a blue light that it's

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.060 
i said register a blue light that it's
working<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:34.480> can<00:03:34.630> also<00:03:34.780> still<00:03:35.709> use<00:03:35.920> the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
working and you can also still use the

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.780 
working and you can also still use the
laser<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.610> all<00:03:36.700> that<00:03:36.910> while<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.660> charging<00:03:38.790> but

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
laser and all that while to charging but

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.190

cases<00:04:45.980> like<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.400> contour<00:04:46.820> flick<00:04:47.120> that<00:04:47.240> are

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
cases like the contour flick that are

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.900

neck<00:04:49.910> braces<00:04:50.300> to<00:04:50.720> get<00:04:50.840> extra<00:04:51.110> support<00:04:51.530> but<00:04:52.130> if

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
neck braces to get extra support but if

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.380 
neck braces to get extra support but if
you're<00:04:52.310> careful<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:52.760> don't<00:04:52.880> need<00:04:53.060> them<00:04:53.210> of

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
you're careful you don't need them of

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.380 
you're careful you don't need them of
course<00:04:53.860> so<00:04:54.860> pretty<00:04:55.310> much<00:04:55.400> it's<00:04:56.180> not<00:04:56.360> a

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
course so pretty much it's not a

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.120 
course so pretty much it's not a
separate<00:04:56.840> case<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.350> you<00:04:57.380> have<00:04:57.590> to<00:04:57.740> use<00:04:57.950> the

separate case that you have to use the

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.070 
separate case that you have to use the

Richard solo though I mean the Richard
soul<00:05:00.230> isn't<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.620> case<00:05:00.830> itself<00:05:01.250> I<00:05:01.580> can<00:05:02.480> just<00:05:02.600> plug
