over<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.880> softbox<00:00:12.860> last<00:00:13.860> time<00:00:14.330> let's<00:00:15.330> see<00:00:15.450> right

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
over a softbox last time let's see right

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.820 
over a softbox last time let's see right
here<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:16.199> did<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> 22<00:00:17.160> inch<00:00:17.340> PT<00:00:17.640> dish<00:00:18.740> so<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
here we did a 22 inch PT dish so the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.510 
here we did a 22 inch PT dish so the
softbox

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
softbox

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:29.980 
softbox
today<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:24.199> 27<00:00:25.199> by<00:00:27.439> 2020<00:00:28.439> 8<00:00:28.529> by<00:00:28.650> 20<00:00:29.070> ish<00:00:29.490> is

today is 27 by 2020 8 by 20 ish is

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.799 
today is 27 by 2020 8 by 20 ish is
mounted<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.109> same<00:00:31.439> alien<00:00:32.219> BB<00:00:32.640> 800<00:00:33.300> strobe

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
mounted on the same alien BB 800 strobe

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.540 
mounted on the same alien BB 800 strobe
I'm<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.620> attempt<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.130> place<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
I'm going to attempt to place the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.760 
I'm going to attempt to place the
softbox<00:00:36.090> at<00:00:36.329> roughly<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> same<00:00:36.870> distances<00:00:37.590> we

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
softbox at roughly the same distances we

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.590 
softbox at roughly the same distances we
had<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> beauty<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.850> should<00:00:39.090> give<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
had the beauty so that should give you a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.290 
had the beauty so that should give you a
pretty<00:00:39.719> good<00:00:40.340> comparison<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> different

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
pretty good comparison of the different

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.590 
pretty good comparison of the different
types<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.719> light<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.260> different<00:00:43.469> distances

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
types of light and different distances

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.060 
types of light and different distances
based<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> light<00:00:46.020> modifier<00:00:46.500> that's<00:00:46.890> right

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
based on the light modifier that's right

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.920 
based on the light modifier that's right
kitty<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.309> let's<00:00:50.489> get<00:00:50.640> these<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> softbox

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
kitty so let's get these get the softbox

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.950 
kitty so let's get these get the softbox
set<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:53.960> okay<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.020> our<00:00:55.260> softbox<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> now<00:00:56.039> set<00:00:56.430> up

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
set up okay so our softbox is now set up

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.240 
set up okay so our softbox is now set up
softbox<00:00:59.300> it<00:01:00.440> is<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.980> roughly<00:01:04.250> six

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
softbox it is going to be roughly six

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.060 
softbox it is going to be roughly six
feet<00:01:05.369> five<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> half<00:01:06.450> feet<00:01:06.780> from<00:01:06.840> my<00:01:07.290> head

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.469 

again<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:11.549> two<00:01:12.000> feet<00:01:12.270> from<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> background

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
again I'm two feet from the background

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.420 
again I'm two feet from the background
so<00:01:15.479> let's<00:01:15.630> fire<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> test<00:01:16.170> shot<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:17.340> what

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
so let's fire a test shot and see what

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.080 
so let's fire a test shot and see what
it<00:01:17.520> looks<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.850> at<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.360> distance

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.610 

okay<00:01:26.090> everything<00:01:26.540> is<00:01:26.690> pretty<00:01:27.080> bright<00:01:27.380> there's

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
okay everything is pretty bright there's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.690 
okay everything is pretty bright there's
a<00:01:27.710> very<00:01:28.190> very<00:01:28.610> soft<00:01:28.910> shadow<00:01:29.270> on<00:01:29.600> this<00:01:30.290> side<00:01:30.700> the

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
a very very soft shadow on this side the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.640 
a very very soft shadow on this side the
group<00:01:31.970> that<00:01:32.150> I'm<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.450> has<00:01:32.690> a<00:01:32.720> white<00:01:33.170> roof

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
group that I'm in has a white roof

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.230 
group that I'm in has a white roof
there's<00:01:33.890> quite<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.100> bit<00:01:34.280> of<00:01:34.310> spill<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:35.000> comes

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
there's quite a bit of spill that comes

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.740 
there's quite a bit of spill that comes
off<00:01:35.420> of<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.860> softbox<00:01:36.860> like<00:01:37.160> this<00:01:37.370> so<00:01:37.550> it's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
off of a softbox like this so it's

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.300 
off of a softbox like this so it's
bouncing<00:01:38.750> off<00:01:38.870> walls<00:01:39.320> ceiling<00:01:39.890> everything

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
bouncing off walls ceiling everything

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.660 
bouncing off walls ceiling everything
and<00:01:40.840> filling<00:01:41.840> in<00:01:42.020> if<00:01:42.650> I<00:01:42.770> had<00:01:42.920> barn<00:01:43.220> doors<00:01:43.490> or

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
and filling in if I had barn doors or

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.600 
and filling in if I had barn doors or
something<00:01:44.000> or<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.420> grid<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.830> light<00:01:46.340> would<00:01:46.490> be<00:01:46.580> a

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
something or a grid the light would be a

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.740 
something or a grid the light would be a
little<00:01:46.880> bit<00:01:46.970> more<00:01:47.120> directional<00:01:47.630> it'd

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
little bit more directional it'd

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.360 
little bit more directional it'd
probably<00:01:47.870> be<00:01:48.080> a<00:01:48.140> little<00:01:48.290> bit<00:01:48.560> less<00:01:48.770> soft<00:01:49.070> that

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
probably be a little bit less soft that

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.340 
probably be a little bit less soft that
wouldn't<00:01:49.700> be<00:01:49.760> bouncing<00:01:50.060> on<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.210> ceiling<00:01:50.660> also

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
wouldn't be bouncing on the ceiling also

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.050 
wouldn't be bouncing on the ceiling also
I'm<00:01:51.440> getting<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.770> huge<00:01:52.190> spectrum<00:01:52.580> of<00:01:52.729> highlight

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
I'm getting a huge spectrum of highlight

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.980 
I'm getting a huge spectrum of highlight
on<00:01:53.390> my<00:01:54.190> computer<00:01:55.190> glasses<00:01:55.509> so<00:01:56.509> I<00:01:56.540> just<00:01:56.720> took<00:01:56.810> my

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
on my computer glasses so I just took my

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.359 
on my computer glasses so I just took my
computer<00:01:57.140> glasses<00:01:57.590> off<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.600> now<00:01:59.600> let's<00:01:59.840> bring

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
computer glasses off so now let's bring

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.820 
computer glasses off so now let's bring
this<00:02:01.690> so<00:02:02.690> now<00:02:02.810> let's<00:02:03.020> bring<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.350> softbox

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
this so now let's bring the softbox

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.490 
this so now let's bring the softbox
closer<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.150> see<00:02:05.720> how<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:05.990> changes<00:02:06.380> the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
closer and see how that changes the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.900 
closer and see how that changes the
light<00:02:07.540> our<00:02:08.540> softbox<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.410> now<00:02:09.740> about<00:02:10.520> three

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
light our softbox is now about three

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.930 
light our softbox is now about three
feet<00:02:11.150> away<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:13.310> let's<00:02:13.490> see<00:02:13.640> what<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:13.880> one

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
feet away so let's see what this one

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.070 
feet away so let's see what this one
looks<00:02:14.240> like

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.540 

that's<00:02:22.650> pretty<00:02:22.830> see<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> really<00:02:23.430> nice

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
that's pretty see it's a really nice

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.180 
that's pretty see it's a really nice
soft<00:02:23.940> light<00:02:24.410> transition<00:02:25.410> across<00:02:25.710> my<00:02:25.920> face

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
soft light transition across my face

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.720 
soft light transition across my face
still<00:02:27.060> an<00:02:27.300> ever<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.320> slight<00:02:28.350> shadow<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
still an ever so slight shadow on the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.390 
still an ever so slight shadow on the
background<00:02:30.050> when<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.080> moved<00:02:31.380> by<00:02:31.650> decrease<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
background when I moved by decrease the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.460 
background when I moved by decrease the
distance<00:02:32.640> by<00:02:32.970> house<00:02:33.330> power<00:02:33.900> by<00:02:34.050> half<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.380> was

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
distance by house power by half it was

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.310 
distance by house power by half it was
at<00:02:34.620> half<00:02:34.830> power<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.210> now<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.570> at<00:02:36.660> 1/4<00:02:37.080> power

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
at half power and now it is at 1/4 power

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.380 
at half power and now it is at 1/4 power
send<00:02:38.220> I'm<00:02:38.310> gonna<00:02:38.460> decrease<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.880> distance<00:02:39.060> and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
send I'm gonna decrease the distance and

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.190 
send I'm gonna decrease the distance and
bring<00:02:39.570> them<00:02:39.690> closer<00:02:40.310> also<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:42.200> softbox

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
bring them closer also this is a softbox

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.560 
bring them closer also this is a softbox
that's<00:02:43.470> currently<00:02:43.860> mounted<00:02:44.190> vertically<00:02:44.570> so

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
that's currently mounted vertically so

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.270 
that's currently mounted vertically so
now<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.720> softbox<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.320> mounted<00:02:46.650> very<00:02:46.860> close<00:02:47.130> to

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
now the softbox is mounted very close to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.920 
now the softbox is mounted very close to
my<00:02:47.370> face<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.790> about<00:02:47.940> 20<00:02:48.360> inches<00:02:48.510> away

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
my face to about 20 inches away

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.820 
my face to about 20 inches away
I<00:02:49.790> also<00:02:50.790> decrease<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.270> power<00:02:51.600> let's<00:02:52.560> see<00:02:52.710> what

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
I also decrease the power let's see what

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:01.960 
I also decrease the power let's see what
this<00:02:52.950> looks<00:02:53.220> like

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.790 

they're<00:03:02.540> at<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:02.840> distance<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.380> can<00:03:03.470> see<00:03:03.650> the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
they're at this distance you can see the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.070 
they're at this distance you can see the
shadows<00:03:04.250> starting<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.610> become<00:03:04.700> free<00:03:05.080> dramatic

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
shadows starting to become free dramatic

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.570 
shadows starting to become free dramatic
but<00:03:06.890> it's<00:03:07.130> still<00:03:07.400> soft<00:03:08.210> looks<00:03:08.840> pretty<00:03:09.230> cool

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
but it's still soft looks pretty cool

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.830 
but it's still soft looks pretty cool
okay<00:03:10.580> so<00:03:10.610> now<00:03:10.820> what<00:03:10.940> softbox<00:03:11.420> really<00:03:11.660> close

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
okay so now what softbox really close

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.780 
okay so now what softbox really close
we're<00:03:12.020> gonna<00:03:12.110> try<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.590> pivot<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.490> little

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
we're gonna try and pivot it a little

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.320 
we're gonna try and pivot it a little
bit<00:03:13.910> closer<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:15.190> head-on<00:03:18.970> softbox<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.120> now

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
bit closer to head-on softbox is now

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.010 
bit closer to head-on softbox is now
approximately<00:03:21.200> 20<00:03:22.070> inches<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.610> my<00:03:22.730> face

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
approximately 20 inches to my face

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:31.350 
approximately 20 inches to my face
really<00:03:24.020> close<00:03:24.380> on<00:03:24.560> my<00:03:24.740> left<00:03:24.980> let's<00:03:25.880> try<00:03:26.060> this

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.700 

still<00:03:32.360> too<00:03:32.540> powerful<00:03:33.020> so<00:03:33.290> we're<00:03:33.380> gonna<00:03:33.470> drop

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
still too powerful so we're gonna drop

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:40.930 
still too powerful so we're gonna drop
power<00:03:34.010> a<00:03:34.100> little<00:03:34.280> bit<00:03:34.370> more<00:03:34.550> try<00:03:34.730> again<00:03:39.940> there

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
power a little bit more try again there

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.270 
power a little bit more try again there
we<00:03:41.060> go<00:03:41.180> so<00:03:41.360> now<00:03:41.410> we're<00:03:42.410> probably<00:03:42.560> exposing<00:03:43.190> the

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
we go so now we're probably exposing the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.980 
we go so now we're probably exposing the
hot<00:03:43.430> side<00:03:43.640> of<00:03:43.730> my<00:03:43.820> face<00:03:44.030> but<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.540> rest<00:03:44.720> of<00:03:44.870> my

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
hot side of my face but the rest of my

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.900 
hot side of my face but the rest of my
face<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.530> body<00:03:45.650> are<00:03:45.890> fading<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.250> darkness<00:03:46.520> I

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
face and body are fading to darkness I

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.490 
face and body are fading to darkness I
also<00:03:47.390> see<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.660> background<00:03:48.050> is<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.200> little<00:03:48.410> bit

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
also see the background is a little bit

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.290 
also see the background is a little bit
darker<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:48.920> it's<00:03:49.040> not<00:03:49.160> as<00:03:49.220> much<00:03:49.370> lightest<00:03:49.820> and

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
darker and it's not as much lightest and

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.520 
darker and it's not as much lightest and
I'm<00:03:50.450> getting<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.840> it<00:03:50.930> because<00:03:51.080> we're<00:03:51.260> still

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
I'm getting to it because we're still

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.890 
I'm getting to it because we're still
doing<00:03:51.620> probably<00:03:51.890> from<00:03:52.160> my<00:03:52.250> face<00:03:52.660> so<00:03:53.660> now<00:03:53.780> we'll

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
doing probably from my face so now we'll

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.960 
doing probably from my face so now we'll
do<00:03:54.020> one<00:03:54.230> more<00:03:54.440> demonstration<00:03:54.680> with<00:03:55.490> a<00:03:55.520> softbox

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
do one more demonstration with a softbox

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.620 
do one more demonstration with a softbox
right<00:03:56.540> at<00:03:56.690> my<00:03:56.840> side<00:03:57.140> I'll<00:03:57.860> show<00:03:58.070> you<00:03:58.130> how

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
right at my side I'll show you how

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.500 
right at my side I'll show you how
spinning<00:03:59.630> a<00:03:59.720> softbox<00:04:00.220> from<00:04:01.420> portrait<00:04:02.420> to

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
spinning a softbox from portrait to

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.320 
spinning a softbox from portrait to
landscape<00:04:02.750> can<00:04:03.410> alter<00:04:04.040> how<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.760> light<00:04:05.060> wraps

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
landscape can alter how the light wraps

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.530 
landscape can alter how the light wraps
around<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.750> subject<00:04:06.970> okay<00:04:07.970> so<00:04:08.180> now<00:04:08.480> the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
around the subject okay so now the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.650 
around the subject okay so now the
softbox<00:04:09.140> my<00:04:10.040> head<00:04:10.310> is<00:04:10.459> about<00:04:10.550> middle<00:04:11.360> height

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
softbox my head is about middle height

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.710 
softbox my head is about middle height
the<00:04:12.560> back<00:04:12.830> edge<00:04:13.100> of<00:04:13.370> it<00:04:13.489> lines<00:04:14.150> up<00:04:14.330> with<00:04:14.390> my

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
the back edge of it lines up with my

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.470 
the back edge of it lines up with my
cheek<00:04:14.989> and<00:04:15.170> it's<00:04:16.160> still<00:04:16.430> in<00:04:16.640> portrait<00:04:17.209> so

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
cheek and it's still in portrait so

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
cheek and it's still in portrait so
let's<00:04:17.660> see<00:04:18.049> what<00:04:18.169> this<00:04:18.260> looks<00:04:18.500> like<00:04:23.320> when<00:04:24.320> this

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
let's see what this looks like when this

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.200 
let's see what this looks like when this
it's<00:04:24.680> not<00:04:24.860> able<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.310> really<00:04:25.550> wrap<00:04:25.760> around<00:04:26.090> my

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
it's not able to really wrap around my

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.780 
it's not able to really wrap around my
face<00:04:26.510> at<00:04:26.870> all<00:04:27.220> just<00:04:28.220> because<00:04:28.490> it's<00:04:28.640> not<00:04:28.730> very

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
face at all just because it's not very

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.860 
face at all just because it's not very
wide<00:04:29.600> if<00:04:30.320> I<00:04:30.470> switch<00:04:31.190> this<00:04:31.490> to<00:04:32.030> landscape<00:04:32.390> which

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
wide if I switch this to landscape which

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.380 
wide if I switch this to landscape which
I'll<00:04:33.050> do<00:04:33.230> right<00:04:33.260> now<00:04:33.560> so<00:04:34.310> now<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.550> softbox<00:04:35.150> is

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
I'll do right now so now the softbox is

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.480 
I'll do right now so now the softbox is
sticking<00:04:35.810> quite<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.140> bit<00:04:36.350> further<00:04:37.250> out<00:04:37.370> in

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
sticking quite a bit further out in

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.300 
sticking quite a bit further out in
front<00:04:37.700> of<00:04:37.790> me<00:04:37.880> back<00:04:38.810> and<00:04:39.140> just<00:04:39.830> still<00:04:40.100> lining

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
front of me back and just still lining

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.430 
front of me back and just still lining
up<00:04:40.430> with<00:04:40.460> my<00:04:40.669> face<00:04:40.990> but<00:04:41.990> it's<00:04:42.169> in<00:04:42.320> the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
up with my face but it's in the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.370 
up with my face but it's in the
landscape<00:04:43.780> configuration<00:04:44.780> see<00:04:45.140> what<00:04:45.290> this

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
landscape configuration see what this

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:55.870 
landscape configuration see what this
looks<00:04:45.620> like

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.610 

as<00:04:55.940> you<00:04:56.570> can<00:04:56.660> see<00:04:56.810> in<00:04:56.900> that<00:04:56.930> configuration

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
as you can see in that configuration
