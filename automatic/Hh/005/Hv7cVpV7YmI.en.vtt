what<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.450> big<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.750> said<00:00:07.080> here<00:00:07.259> from<00:00:07.410> Texas<00:00:07.830> and

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
what is a big I said here from Texas and

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.470 
what is a big I said here from Texas and
today<00:00:08.160> we're<00:00:08.429> just<00:00:08.490> gonna<00:00:08.670> take<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.910> quick<00:00:09.179> look

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
today we're just gonna take a quick look

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.850 
today we're just gonna take a quick look
at<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.630> difference<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.260> performance<00:00:10.410> between

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
at a difference in performance between

the standard HTC One m8 and the Google
Play<00:00:13.590> edition<00:00:13.910> we<00:00:14.910> figured<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.360> best<00:00:15.389> way<00:00:15.719> to

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
Play edition we figured the best way to

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.330 
Play edition we figured the best way to
test<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.199> was<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.619> play<00:00:16.800> some<00:00:17.010> graphic

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
test this was to play some graphic

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.599 
test this was to play some graphic
intensive<00:00:17.609> games<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.480> first<00:00:18.840> up<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.230> have

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
intensive games so first up we have

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.640 
intensive games so first up we have
asphalt<00:00:20.609> 8<00:00:20.850> airborne<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:22.050> have<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.320> throw<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.590> a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
asphalt 8 airborne we have to throw in a

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.349 
asphalt 8 airborne we have to throw in a
racing<00:00:22.949> game<00:00:22.980> since<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.670> fast-paced<00:00:24.060> game

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.400 
and by the looks of it both phones
handle<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.880> pretty<00:00:27.090> well<00:00:27.390> if<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:28.199> look<00:00:28.380> very

closely<00:00:28.769> however<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.609> GPE<00:00:30.029> does<00:00:30.449> seem<00:00:30.750> to

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
closely however the GPE does seem to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.170 
closely however the GPE does seem to
have<00:00:31.080> smoother<00:00:31.500> gameplay<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:32.850> hardly

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.799 

the<00:00:54.520> next<00:00:54.760> game<00:00:54.910> we<00:00:55.090> tested<00:00:55.449> out<00:00:55.540> was<00:00:55.690> the

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
the next game we tested out was the

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.200 
the next game we tested out was the
popular<00:00:56.170> dead<00:00:56.440> trigger<00:00:56.769> 2<00:00:56.920> game<00:00:57.489> this<00:00:57.940> is<00:00:58.120> a

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
popular dead trigger 2 game this is a

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.939 
popular dead trigger 2 game this is a
first-person<00:00:58.540> zombie<00:00:59.170> shooter<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.620> it<00:00:59.710> said

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
first-person zombie shooter and it said

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.439 
first-person zombie shooter and it said
that<00:01:00.129> this<00:01:00.309> is<00:01:00.460> one<00:01:00.610> of<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.760> most<00:01:00.910> intensive

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
that this is one of the most intensive

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.150 
that this is one of the most intensive
first-person<00:01:02.110> shooters<00:01:02.500> out<00:01:02.649> there<00:01:02.710> and

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
first-person shooters out there and

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.009 
first-person shooters out there and
that's<00:01:03.940> probably<00:01:04.089> why<00:01:04.330> we<00:01:04.449> got<00:01:04.570> this<00:01:04.720> for<00:01:04.900> the

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
that's probably why we got this for the

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.410 
that's probably why we got this for the
test<00:01:05.290> once<00:01:06.009> again<00:01:06.250> both<00:01:06.520> phones<00:01:06.820> seem<00:01:07.119> to<00:01:07.270> play

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420

test once again both phones seem to play
the<00:01:07.570> game<00:01:07.720> very<00:01:07.930> well<00:01:08.020> however<00:01:08.560> if<00:01:08.710> you<00:01:08.770> look

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
the game very well however if you look

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.430 
the game very well however if you look
closely<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.430> GPU<00:01:09.909> once<00:01:10.119> again<00:01:10.509> seems<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.259> bit

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
closely the GPU once again seems a bit

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:28.700 
closely the GPU once again seems a bit
smoother<00:01:11.890> when<00:01:12.130> constantly<00:01:12.729> moving<00:01:13.030> around

but the GPE proved to be the better of

but the GPE proved to be the better of
the<00:01:48.819> two<00:01:48.850> it's<00:01:49.720> pretty<00:01:49.990> obvious<00:01:50.319> in<00:01:50.409> the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
the two it's pretty obvious in the

the two it's pretty obvious in the

standard edition and mate has choppy

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.990 
standard edition and mate has choppy
gameplay<00:01:56.259> so<00:01:56.979> I'm<00:01:57.250> sure<00:01:57.429> we<00:01:57.610> can<00:01:57.729> agree<00:01:57.819> that

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
gameplay so I'm sure we can agree that

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.600 
gameplay so I'm sure we can agree that
the<00:01:58.509> GPE<00:01:58.989> performs<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.890> lot<00:02:00.069> better<00:02:00.310> than<00:02:00.520> the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
the GPE performs a lot better than the

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.219 
the GPE performs a lot better than the
standard<00:02:01.000> edition<00:02:01.179> simply<00:02:01.720> because<00:02:02.050> it's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
standard edition simply because it's

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.410 
standard edition simply because it's
running<00:02:02.410> stock<00:02:02.770> Android<00:02:03.429> if<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:04.239> are<00:02:04.390> a

running stock Android if you are a

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:07.499 
hardcore smartphone gamer and want to
get<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.340> most<00:02:06.520> out<00:02:06.670> of<00:02:06.729> your<00:02:06.879> intense<00:02:07.179> games

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
get the most out of your intense games

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.389 
get the most out of your intense games
then<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.170> should<00:02:08.319> probably<00:02:08.530> pick<00:02:08.830> up<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.069> GPE

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
then you should probably pick up the GPE

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.309 
then you should probably pick up the GPE
Edition<00:02:09.849> instead<00:02:10.300> otherwise<00:02:10.959> if<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.230> don't

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
Edition instead otherwise if you don't

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.920 
Edition instead otherwise if you don't
care<00:02:11.590> then<00:02:11.890> either<00:02:12.190> will<00:02:12.580> do<00:02:12.910> but<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.780> will

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
care then either will do but that will

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.570 
care then either will do but that will
do<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.200> for<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> quick<00:02:14.650> comparison<00:02:14.830> video<00:02:15.370> make
