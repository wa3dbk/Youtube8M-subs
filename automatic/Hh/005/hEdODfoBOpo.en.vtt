 hello to you Artem and now I will 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.770
 do a review on stadicam like 3000 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.040
 She goes here in this case and square 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.490
 bottom two legs 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:21.990
 house handle Well, let's proceed to unpacking 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:25.820
 open the contents of the bag all 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.820
 the beauty of Sasha's steadicam 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:37.330
 everywhere strengthening bolts wide weights 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:46.090
 the very main part of it among kama 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:46.090
 weights as I finished this unit 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.320
 platform which you stand by yourself 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:01:00.310
 camera so playground 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.310
 fixing this tube 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.140
 so swords will start assembly 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:18.520
 first I take the film so that it does not 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:21.430
 interfered with embers steve here we see 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.550
 big bearing 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.390
 small bearings that go well and 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.390
 bearing handle itself 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.720
 so fasten this pad on this tube from 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:43.340
 we see the holes of the two sides take 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.680
 six-sided music and things like that 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.530
 candy wrappers are also bundled coming by myself 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.530
 hexagon bolted piece 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.400
 I tighten gothic 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.799
 everything is now pie 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.020
 bob I must remove the top 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.929
 weights because it's too hard 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.030
 if you leave 4 weights for this 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.610
 a bigger camera, I think that's enough for me 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.610
 and the bottom board quietly unscrew 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.930
 pull back their edges 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.150
 The first time I collect it is that all 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.760
 tune in now how you do it yourself 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.460
 i will try to make a little weight i developed up 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.890
 edges now wind the tube itself out 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:42.760
 there is such a thread and intend to key 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.760
 this tube 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.050
 could find them stick and see how 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.060
 telescopic tube extends for now 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:02.350
 so leave in the first area 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:05.290
 need to screw here special here 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.960
 loop that are twisted by hand 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.360
 Also included are spare parts. 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.940
 you never know if you lose some 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.400
 the pedal here spare parts all 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.910
 I have a single copy fasten 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.910
 a platform 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.100
 here from the hole which is not unscrew 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.100
 bolts 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.310
 4 pieces 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.739
 how much I will not delay because 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.069
 will need to regulate last 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.069
 baltic 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.150
 but practically stadicam is assembled now 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.370
 need to check how he will behave 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.490
 when i put a camera on it so 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.700
 here is the apparatus i will wind the canon 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.540
 650d 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.069
 with a lens of 18 35 millimeters takes and 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.140
 the platform here is a must 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.800
 unscrew this bolt because you 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.140
 rests sea ​​classics will not spin 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.590
 this bolt how to unscrew for me 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.720
 it seems 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.120
 useless bolt can be needed for 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.280
 camcorder as it should be in 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.290
 kulechek we twist this platform on 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.460
 the camera itself under the screwdriver here 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.460
 bolt is made 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:43.150
 Armen to break the thread 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:47.010
 all screwed up the platform dressing up 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.010
 camera stadicam 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:56.310
 of such a lever lock closes 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.310
 pad 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.590
 all on the bag you need to take off the jumper 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.850
 wash interfere when working with the camera all 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.100
 strap there is a camera and took off now 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:14.060
 look at get stooped stadicam 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:17.390
 he can stand almost exactly like that 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.940
 here somehow regulated stadicam here 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.650
 twisted it in such a way that 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.110
 The lens was above the ground for the first time. 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.810
 screwed wrong if city.com 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.080
 properly adjusted so the transformation 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.690
 with this he should not take 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.580
 just stand the computer to the whole world 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.400
 slightly there is some kind of this side 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.010
 and there is no vocal but this is what I work for 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.180
 regular and all this comp is it faster 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.790
 soon will be obtained 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.920
 regulate the glades should be 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.260
 look ahead like the camera itself 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.500
 watched a video on youtube did everything 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.500
 So 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.150
 Now I will show video samples which 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.150
 filmed this miracle 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.999
 Giuseppe is sick
