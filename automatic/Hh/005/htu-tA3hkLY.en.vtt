anything and let's just say normal CNS
so<00:02:01.100> after<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.429> we're<00:02:01.580> going<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.849> click<00:02:02.030> one

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
so after that we're going to click one

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.669 
so after that we're going to click one
so<00:02:03.940> now<00:02:04.940> after<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.840> once<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:06.259> click<00:02:06.440> on<00:02:06.619> the

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
seat the C&amp;S file you scroll down to you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.380 
seat the C&amp;S file you scroll down to you
come<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.860> come<00:02:10.130> across<00:02:10.399> an<00:02:10.640> area<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.180> says

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
come to come across an area that says

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.970 
come to come across an area that says
sides

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
sides

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.740 
sides
that's<00:02:12.980> right<00:02:13.250> size<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.330> when<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.510> get<00:02:14.660> to

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
that's right size and when you get to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.890 
that's right size and when you get to
the<00:02:14.840> size<00:02:15.050> part<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:16.040> will<00:02:16.160> see<00:02:16.190> X<00:02:17.000> scale<00:02:17.390> and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
the size part you will see X scale and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.100 
the size part you will see X scale and
you<00:02:17.989> see<00:02:18.230> Y<00:02:18.410> scale<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.790> what<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.030> do<00:02:20.209> is<00:02:20.420> in

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
you see Y scale so what you do is in

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.100 
you see Y scale so what you do is in
order<00:02:21.230> change<00:02:21.620> cloud<00:02:21.920> size<00:02:22.780> into<00:02:23.780> its<00:02:23.930> or

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
order change cloud size into its or

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.170 
order change cloud size into its or
tolerance<00:02:24.470> size<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:25.250> have<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.819> mix<00:02:26.000> around

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
tolerance size you have the mix around

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.570 
tolerance size you have the mix around
with<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.630> X<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.050> y<00:02:27.230> scale<00:02:27.530> X<00:02:28.010> stands<00:02:28.459> for

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
with the X and the y scale X stands for

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.710 
with the X and the y scale X stands for
the<00:02:29.420> width<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.950> Y<00:02:30.950> stands<00:02:31.340> for<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:32.510> height

the width and Y stands for the height

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.830 
the width and Y stands for the height
now<00:02:33.050> as<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.520> already<00:02:34.640> see<00:02:35.030> right<00:02:35.060> here<00:02:35.480> cloud

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
now as you already see right here cloud

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.370 
now as you already see right here cloud
was<00:02:35.989> originally<00:02:36.440> 1<00:02:37.540> which<00:02:38.540> means<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:39.260> was

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
was originally 1 which means that was

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.729 
was originally 1 which means that was
the<00:02:39.470> smaller<00:02:39.770> size<00:02:40.099> so<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:41.540> will<00:02:42.440> make<00:02:42.590> them

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
the smaller size so that will make them

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.000 
the smaller size so that will make them
big<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:44.300> if<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.260> want<00:02:45.440> if<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:45.650> want<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.890> make

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.760 
but it's whiff is not going to be too
good<00:03:22.360> so<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:22.960> in<00:03:23.170> other<00:03:23.380> words<00:03:23.590> the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
good so that in other words the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.380 
good so that in other words the
character<00:03:24.190> would<00:03:24.280> look<00:03:24.460> distorting<00:03:25.120> he<00:03:25.240> was

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
character would look distorting he was

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.910 
character would look distorting he was
the<00:03:25.480> weird<00:03:25.750> looking<00:03:25.990> and<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:26.620> don't<00:03:26.770> like

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
the weird looking and you don't like

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.190 
the weird looking and you don't like
that<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:27.520> you<00:03:27.580> want<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.030> change<00:03:28.210> both<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:29.020> Y

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
that so you want to change both the Y

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.410 
that so you want to change both the Y
and<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.770> X<00:03:29.920> scale<00:03:30.220> in<00:03:30.490> order<00:03:30.820> to<00:03:31.000> balance<00:03:31.180> the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
and the X scale in order to balance the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.150 
and the X scale in order to balance the
character<00:03:31.870> out<00:03:31.900> they<00:03:32.410> ordered<00:03:32.830> for<00:03:32.980> him<00:03:33.040> to

give it get a perfect shape then some

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.480 
give it get a perfect shape then some
carrots<00:03:35.350> you<00:03:35.410> gotta<00:03:35.530> mess<00:03:35.740> around<00:03:35.890> with<00:03:36.220> it

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
carrots you gotta mess around with it

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.610 
carrots you gotta mess around with it
sometimes<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:37.000> both<00:03:37.209> make<00:03:37.420> them<00:03:37.660> if<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.410> both

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
sometimes you both make them if you both

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.250 
sometimes you both make them if you both
make<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.100> X<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.670> y<00:03:39.820> um<00:03:40.120> evenly<00:03:41.020> it<00:03:41.110> what

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
make the X and the y um evenly it what

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.140 
make the X and the y um evenly it what
like<00:03:41.440> that<00:03:41.680> there'd<00:03:42.310> be<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.490> little<00:03:42.790> bit<00:03:42.940> too

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
like that there'd be a little bit too

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.940 
like that there'd be a little bit too
thick<00:03:43.450> so<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.750> do<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.320> I<00:03:44.350> mess<00:03:44.530> around<00:03:44.680> with

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
thick so you do that I mess around with

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.729 
thick so you do that I mess around with
it<00:03:45.070> but<00:03:45.190> most<00:03:45.400> times<00:03:45.700> not<00:03:46.150> on<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.540> 9<00:03:46.720> out<00:03:47.050> of<00:03:47.110> 10

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
it but most times not on it 9 out of 10

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.790 
it but most times not on it 9 out of 10
times<00:03:47.770> just<00:03:48.780> evenly<00:03:49.780> change<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.260> X<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.620> y

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
times just evenly change the X and the y

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.949 
times just evenly change the X and the y
scale<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:51.730> now<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:51.910> got<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.330> to<00:03:52.450> one<00:03:52.630> point<00:03:52.840> six

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
scale so now I got it to one point six

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.770 
scale so now I got it to one point six
on<00:03:53.920> both<00:03:54.220> x<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:54.640> y<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.150> we're<00:03:55.510> gonna<00:03:55.600> see

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
on both x and y and we're gonna see

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:15.690 
on both x and y and we're gonna see
what's<00:03:55.930> going<00:03:56.080> to<00:03:56.110> happen

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700
