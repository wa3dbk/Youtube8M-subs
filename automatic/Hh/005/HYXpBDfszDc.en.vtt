with this particular one I cut it to a

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
with this particular one I cut it to a
certain<00:04:54.150> length<00:04:54.540> just<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.140> head<00:04:55.320> off<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:55.800> the

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
certain length just the head off of the

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.990 
certain length just the head off of the
coffe<00:04:57.870> tube<00:04:58.169> itself<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:59.130> tubes<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.580> bit<00:04:59.790> too

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
coffe tube itself the tubes a bit too

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.469 
coffe tube itself the tubes a bit too
big<00:05:00.240> for<00:05:00.570> it<00:05:00.600> but<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.380> works<00:05:01.620> fine<00:05:01.979> for<00:05:02.820> the

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
big for it but it works fine for the

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.360 
big for it but it works fine for the
keeper<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.820> just<00:05:05.820> like<00:05:05.940> that<00:05:06.260> so<00:05:07.260> it's<00:05:07.590> been
