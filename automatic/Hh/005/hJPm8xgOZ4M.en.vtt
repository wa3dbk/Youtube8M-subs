00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:23.589 
out and save the excess fuel so if you

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.349 
out and save the excess fuel so if you
make<00:00:23.800> a<00:00:23.830> little<00:00:24.220> bit<00:00:24.339> of<00:00:24.460> a<00:00:24.519> mistake<00:00:24.999> you're

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
kind of wasting fuel and you just have

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.669 
kind of wasting fuel and you just have
to<00:00:27.160> let<00:00:27.249> it<00:00:27.310> burn<00:00:27.550> off<00:00:27.820> and<00:00:28.150> I<00:00:28.990> got<00:00:29.259> this<00:00:29.470> idea

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:29.679 
to let it burn off and I got this idea

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.620 
to let it burn off and I got this idea
for<00:00:30.039> this<00:00:30.189> video<00:00:30.460> after<00:00:30.699> some<00:00:30.999> comments<00:00:31.509> that

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630

I received on my stove shootout video
and<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:36.460> is<00:00:36.640> kind<00:00:36.940> of<00:00:37.030> annoying<00:00:37.270> just<00:00:37.600> letting

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
and it is kind of annoying just letting

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.540 
and it is kind of annoying just letting
the<00:00:37.960> extra<00:00:38.289> fuel<00:00:38.530> burn<00:00:38.770> off<00:00:39.010> because<00:00:39.399> you

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
the extra fuel burn off because you

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.099 
the extra fuel burn off because you
don't<00:00:39.699> want<00:00:39.850> to<00:00:39.910> have<00:00:40.059> too<00:00:40.239> little<00:00:40.539> fuel<00:00:40.840> and

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
don't want to have too much and waste it

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.740 
don't want to have too much and waste it
at<00:00:45.340> the<00:00:45.460> end<00:00:45.609> just<00:00:45.879> letting<00:00:46.090> it<00:00:46.120> burn<00:00:46.269> off<00:00:46.480> so

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
at the end just letting it burn off so

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.619 
at the end just letting it burn off so
here's<00:00:47.469> my<00:00:47.649> trick<00:00:47.920> it's<00:00:48.309> ridiculous<00:00:49.239> simple

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
here's my trick it's ridiculous simple

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.240 
here's my trick it's ridiculous simple
find<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.379> tin<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.829> will<00:00:51.510> fit<00:00:52.510> over<00:00:52.629> this<00:00:52.960> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
find a tin that will fit over this and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.610 
find a tin that will fit over this and
also<00:00:54.250> that<00:00:54.730> will<00:00:55.000> fit<00:00:55.269> inside<00:00:55.420> of<00:00:56.109> your<00:00:56.320> cook

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
also that will fit inside of your cook

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.930 
also that will fit inside of your cook
head<00:00:56.890> that's<00:00:57.579> kind<00:00:57.940> of<00:00:58.030> a<00:00:58.120> key<00:00:58.390> this<00:00:58.859> nests

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
head that's kind of a key this nests

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.060 
head that's kind of a key this nests
perfectly<00:01:00.940> with<00:01:01.120> all<00:01:01.300> my<00:01:01.449> other<00:01:01.480> stuff<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.829> I

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
perfectly with all my other stuff so I

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.760 
perfectly with all my other stuff so I
found<00:01:03.399> this<00:01:03.550> little<00:01:03.730> tin<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.620> the<00:01:05.620> only

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
found this little tin and the only

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.530 
found this little tin and the only
modification<00:01:06.250> I<00:01:06.700> had<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:06.940> do<00:01:07.120> with<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.390> is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
modification I had to do with it is

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.360 
modification I had to do with it is
because<00:01:07.930> I<00:01:07.960> had<00:01:08.200> this<00:01:08.290> little<00:01:08.470> inside<00:01:08.950> rim

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
because I had this little inside rim

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.840 
because I had this little inside rim
here

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
here

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.490 
here
I<00:01:10.200> took<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.740> my<00:01:12.430> Leatherman<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.270> I<00:01:13.990> just<00:01:14.290> gave

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
I took a my Leatherman and I just gave

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.700 
I took a my Leatherman and I just gave
it<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.740> good<00:01:14.890> old<00:01:14.950> pinch<00:01:15.610> like<00:01:16.030> that<00:01:16.710> flattened

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
it a good old pinch like that flattened

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.750 
it a good old pinch like that flattened
out<00:01:17.830> this<00:01:18.490> inside<00:01:19.240> rim<00:01:19.630> here<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.760> flattened

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
out this inside rim here and flattened

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.300 
out this inside rim here and flattened
out<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:22.360> little<00:01:22.690> piece<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.290> can<00:01:24.010> see<00:01:24.040> it's

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
out that little piece you can see it's

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.670 
out that little piece you can see it's
kind<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:24.910> crude<00:01:25.150> but<00:01:25.540> it's<00:01:25.810> just<00:01:26.140> enough<00:01:26.470> to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
kind of crude but it's just enough to

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.150 
kind of crude but it's just enough to
where<00:01:27.220> you<00:01:27.310> can<00:01:27.340> easily<00:01:27.640> pour<00:01:28.120> it<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.320> let<00:01:30.040> me

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
where you can easily pour it so let me

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.820 
where you can easily pour it so let me
give<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.550> a<00:01:30.580> quick<00:01:31.060> demonstration<00:01:31.360> on<00:01:32.230> how

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
give you a quick demonstration on how

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.660 
give you a quick demonstration on how
this<00:01:33.040> all<00:01:33.280> works

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
this all works

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.600 
this all works
we<00:01:34.150> take<00:01:34.360> our<00:01:34.510> fuel<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.560> I'll<00:01:35.680> dump<00:01:35.920> far<00:01:36.370> too

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
we take our fuel and I'll dump far too

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.990 
we take our fuel and I'll dump far too
much<00:01:36.790> in<00:01:37.090> for<00:01:38.050> what<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.230> would<00:01:38.470> need<00:01:39.000> that's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
much in for what I would need that's

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.200 
much in for what I would need that's
enough<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.570> boil<00:01:40.920> boatload<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:41.950> water<00:01:42.340> so

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
enough to boil boatload of water so

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.700 
enough to boil boatload of water so
here's<00:01:43.780> what<00:01:43.990> we<00:01:44.110> do<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:45.850> light<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:47.340> okay<00:01:48.340> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
here's what we do we light it okay and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.600 
here's what we do we light it okay and
I'm<00:01:50.710> going<00:01:51.070> to<00:01:51.570> wait<00:01:52.570> until<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:53.440> starts<00:01:54.370> coming

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
I'm going to wait until it starts coming

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.900 
I'm going to wait until it starts coming
