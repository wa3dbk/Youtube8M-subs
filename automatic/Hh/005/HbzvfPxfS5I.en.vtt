two by two spiral piston door over here

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.470 
two by two spiral piston door over here
I<00:00:18.650> came<00:00:19.650> up<00:00:19.830> with<00:00:20.029> this<00:00:21.470> compact<00:00:22.470> wiring<00:00:22.949> and

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
I came up with this compact wiring and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.120 
I came up with this compact wiring and
in<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.630> video<00:00:24.869> tutorial<00:00:25.230> I'll<00:00:25.710> show<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.010> how

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.320 
in this video tutorial I'll show you how
to<00:00:26.340> build<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:27.920> piston<00:00:28.920> door<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.460> some<00:00:30.090> very

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
to build this piston door and some very

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.479 
to build this piston door and some very
interesting<00:00:30.840> modifications<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:31.980> mix<00:00:32.279> to

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
interesting modifications you can mix to

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.709 
interesting modifications you can mix to
this<00:00:32.669> design<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:35.460> now<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.730> shall<00:00:36.120> commence<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
this design so now we shall commence the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
this design so now we shall commence the
building<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> door<00:00:38.300> first<00:00:40.340> build<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
building of the door first build the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:59.389 
building of the door first build the
frame<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> door<00:00:57.890> next<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> need<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> know

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
frame for the door next you need to know

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.360 
frame for the door next you need to know
where<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.820> pistons<00:01:00.270> are<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.079> go<00:01:01.370> so

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
where your pistons are going to go so

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.750 
where your pistons are going to go so
your<00:01:02.550> first<00:01:02.760> piston<00:01:03.210> I'll<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.480> over<00:01:03.660> here

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:17.080 

second<00:01:08.760> piston<00:01:09.270> over<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:15.259> another<00:01:16.259> piston

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
second piston over here another piston

second piston over here another piston
here

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.730 

and<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:22.640> last<00:01:22.820> piston<00:01:23.480> over<00:01:23.930> here<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.840> for

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
and the last piston over here and for

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.500 
and the last piston over here and for
this<00:01:27.860> video<00:01:28.130> tutorial<00:01:28.190> we'll<00:01:28.940> be<00:01:29.090> using<00:01:29.300> a

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
this video tutorial we'll be using a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.380 
this video tutorial we'll be using a
buttons<00:01:29.840> in<00:01:30.340> doing<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.460> wiring<00:01:31.670> but<00:01:32.000> if<00:01:32.270> a

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
buttons in doing the wiring but if a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.550 
buttons in doing the wiring but if a
button<00:01:32.690> is<00:01:32.870> slightly<00:01:33.140> more<00:01:33.470> difficult<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:38.560> to

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
button is slightly more difficult so to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.260 
button is slightly more difficult so to
draw<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.770> signal<00:01:40.220> from<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.520> button<00:01:40.820> you<00:01:41.090> need

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
draw a signal from the button you need

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.780 
draw a signal from the button you need
to<00:01:41.530> put<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.560> redstone<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:45.400> repeater<00:01:46.400> like

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
to put a redstone that repeater like

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.810 
to put a redstone that repeater like
this<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:48.200> get<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.560> signal<00:01:48.979> from<00:01:49.220> this<00:01:49.580> pattern

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.469 

cover<00:01:55.820> this<00:01:56.000> up<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.360> put<00:01:57.910> a<00:01:58.910> repeater<00:01:59.240> here

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
cover this up and put a repeater here

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:16.259 
cover this up and put a repeater here
clock<00:02:00.110> here<00:02:02.200> touch

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.479 

bring<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.450> redstone<00:02:17.989> over<00:02:18.290> here<00:02:18.530> set<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
bring the redstone over here set the

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:29.530 
bring the redstone over here set the
repeater<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:21.040> two<00:02:22.040> redstone<00:02:22.430> torch<00:02:23.000> delay<00:02:28.540> and

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
repeater to two redstone torch delay and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:44.080 
repeater to two redstone torch delay and
over<00:02:29.870> here<00:02:30.109> do<00:02:30.349> something<00:02:30.829> like<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:42.909> and<00:02:43.909> you

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
over here do something like this and you

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.909 
over here do something like this and you
get<00:02:44.239> something<00:02:44.420> like<00:02:44.569> this<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.959> wiring<00:02:48.319> for

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:48.919 
get something like this the wiring for

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:54.309 
get something like this the wiring for
the<00:02:48.950> top<00:02:49.329> draw<00:02:50.329> the<00:02:50.659> red<00:02:50.870> stone<00:02:51.139> like<00:02:51.439> this<00:02:53.319> put

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
the top draw the red stone like this put

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.339 
the top draw the red stone like this put
a<00:02:54.349> block<00:02:54.680> here<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:58.519> place<00:02:59.389> a<00:02:59.419> block<00:02:59.750> here<00:02:59.810> in

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
a block here and place a block here in

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.360 
a block here and place a block here in
red<00:03:00.709> stone<00:03:02.379> so<00:03:03.379> now<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.650> have<00:03:03.829> a<00:03:04.010> fully

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
red stone so now you have a fully

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:13.569 
red stone so now you have a fully
functional<00:03:05.030> doll<00:03:11.859> now<00:03:12.859> if<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.129> want<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.430> can

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
functional doll now if you want you can

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.050 
functional doll now if you want you can
mess<00:03:13.879> around<00:03:14.239> with<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.689> delays<00:03:15.049> of<00:03:15.349> the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
mess around with the delays of the

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.619 
mess around with the delays of the
Pistons<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.659> can<00:03:17.840> add<00:03:18.079> a<00:03:19.150> repeater<00:03:20.150> here<00:03:20.329> if

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
Pistons you can add a repeater here if

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:26.469 
Pistons you can add a repeater here if
you<00:03:20.750> so<00:03:20.959> desire<00:03:24.729> you<00:03:25.729> might<00:03:25.909> want<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.120> set<00:03:26.329> it

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:26.479 
you so desire you might want to set it

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:31.929 
you so desire you might want to set it
to<00:03:26.599> four<00:03:26.870> tix<00:03:28.359> to<00:03:29.359> touch<00:03:29.659> delay<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.819> if<00:03:31.819> you

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
to four tix to touch delay and if you

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.819 
to four tix to touch delay and if you
use<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.269> now<00:03:32.449> you<00:03:32.510> get<00:03:32.870> something<00:03:33.079> like<00:03:33.290> this

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.369 

or<00:03:36.829> if<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:37.159> want<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:37.849> can<00:03:38.049> set<00:03:39.049> this<00:03:39.199> to

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
or if you want to you can set this to

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.789 
or if you want to you can set this to
one<00:03:39.560> touch<00:03:39.769> delete<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.189> touch<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.870> this<00:03:42.409> shall

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
one touch delete to touch so this shall

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.409 
one touch delete to touch so this shall
be<00:03:43.479> free<00:03:44.479> torch<00:03:44.810> delay<00:03:45.939> this<00:03:46.939> will<00:03:47.090> be<00:03:47.180> for

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
be free torch delay this will be for

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:56.120 
be free torch delay this will be for
watch<00:03:47.720> today<00:03:48.139> and<00:03:49.449> you'll<00:03:50.449> get<00:03:50.659> this

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.370 

and<00:03:57.130> you<00:03:57.310> can<00:03:57.460> mess<00:03:57.670> around<00:03:57.700> with<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.380> delays

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
and you can mess around with the delays

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.240 
and you can mess around with the delays
even<00:04:00.100> more<00:04:00.280> if<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.490> want<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:01.620> but<00:04:02.620> that's

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
even more if you want to but that's
