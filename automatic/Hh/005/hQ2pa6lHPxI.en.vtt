it's<00:00:08.250> kind<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.700> nasty<00:00:08.880> outside<00:00:09.150> so<00:00:09.660> thought<00:00:10.410> I

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
it's kind of nasty outside so thought I

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.830 
it's kind of nasty outside so thought I
would<00:00:10.590> get<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.010> but<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.300> my<00:00:12.330> air

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
would get to it but this is my air

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.450 
would get to it but this is my air

is<00:00:25.410> airbrush<00:00:25.830> compressor<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.550> bought<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.300> at

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
is airbrush compressor I bought this at

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.870 
is airbrush compressor I bought this at
Harbor<00:00:28.590> Freight<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:29.039> was<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.429> sale<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.699> think

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
Harbor Freight it was on sale I think

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.940 
Harbor Freight it was on sale I think
for<00:00:31.700> $69.99<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:33.300> comes<00:00:33.600> with<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:35.329> air<00:00:36.329> trap

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
for $69.99 it comes with the air trap

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.810 
for $69.99 it comes with the air trap
here<00:00:38.210> comes<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.690> pressure<00:00:40.140> regulator

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
here comes with the pressure regulator

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.500 
here comes with the pressure regulator
here<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.920> does<00:00:43.920> come<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.489> hose<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
here and does come with this hose is the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.049 
here and does come with this hose is the
curly<00:00:45.840> hose<00:00:46.129> this<00:00:47.129> one<00:00:47.340> actually<00:00:47.820> came<00:00:47.910> with

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
curly hose this one actually came with

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.200 
curly hose this one actually came with
my<00:00:48.180> airbrush<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:49.190> air<00:00:50.190> trap<00:00:50.520> or<00:00:50.789> moisture

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
my airbrush this air trap or moisture

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.049 
my airbrush this air trap or moisture
trap<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.539> are<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> call<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.489> came<00:00:53.489> with

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
trap but are going to call it came with

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.000 
trap but are going to call it came with
my<00:00:54.239> airbrush<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.770> part<00:00:55.980> of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
my airbrush so that this is not part of

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.229 
my airbrush so that this is not part of
them<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> quick<00:00:56.610> disconnect<00:00:57.149> that

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
them this is the quick disconnect that

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
them this is the quick disconnect that
came<00:00:57.660> with<00:00:57.809> them<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.559> bought<00:00:58.770> separately

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
came with them that I bought separately

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160 
came with them that I bought separately
so<00:00:59.969> these<00:01:00.239> two<00:01:00.390> don't<00:01:00.600> come<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.050> but

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
so these two don't come with it but

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.660 
so these two don't come with it but
everything<00:01:01.379> else<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:02.010> does<00:01:02.280> come<00:01:02.520> with

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
everything else you see does come with

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.210 
everything else you see does come with
it<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> box<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.409> says<00:01:04.970> 40<00:01:05.970> psi<00:01:06.780> believe

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
it and on the box it says 40 psi believe

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
it and on the box it says 40 psi believe
but<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.760> doesn't<00:01:09.150> actually<00:01:09.270> get<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.810> high<00:01:09.990> at

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
but it doesn't actually get that high at

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.750 
but it doesn't actually get that high at
least<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.470> can't<00:01:10.680> make<00:01:10.830> mine<00:01:11.010> go<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.369> high<00:01:11.520> I

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
least I can't make mine go that high I

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.080 
least I can't make mine go that high I
think<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> highest<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.720> get<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.049> 35<00:01:14.090> psi

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
think the highest I can get it is 35 psi

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.179 
think the highest I can get it is 35 psi
so<00:01:15.439> you're<00:01:16.439> probably<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.920> be<00:01:16.979> able<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
so you're probably going to be able to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.850 
so you're probably going to be able to
shoot<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.909> thicker<00:01:18.240> paints<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.710> you'd<00:01:19.830> have

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
shoot the thicker paints so you'd have

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
shoot the thicker paints so you'd have
to<00:01:20.100> thin<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.939> haven't<00:01:21.720> had<00:01:21.810> any

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to thin with this I haven't had any

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.320 
to thin with this I haven't had any
problems<00:01:22.350> really<00:01:22.650> I've<00:01:22.770> been<00:01:23.270> I've<00:01:24.270> been

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
problems really I've been I've been

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.530 
problems really I've been I've been
spraying<00:01:24.689> about<00:01:24.990> 20<00:01:25.350> psi<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.369> with<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
spraying about 20 psi and with the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.690 
spraying about 20 psi and with the
Vallejo<00:01:27.840> air<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.680> that's<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.369> I've<00:01:29.460> seemed

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
Vallejo air and that's what I've seemed

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.330 
Vallejo air and that's what I've seemed
to<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:29.909> gravitating<00:01:30.720> towards<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.770> liked<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.250> I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
to be gravitating towards I liked it I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.399 
to be gravitating towards I liked it I
tried<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> wicked<00:01:32.909> colors<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> color<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
tried the wicked colors but the color I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.020 
tried the wicked colors but the color I
bought<00:01:34.680> came<00:01:34.920> out<00:01:35.070> way<00:01:35.280> too<00:01:35.340> bright<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:35.759> what

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
bought came out way too bright for what

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.859 
bought came out way too bright for what
I<00:01:36.060> was<00:01:36.210> looking<00:01:36.479> for

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
I was looking for

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.870 
I was looking for
I<00:01:37.009> also<00:01:38.009> decanted<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:40.130> gomango<00:01:41.130> from

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
I also decanted a can of gomango from

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.490 
I also decanted a can of gomango from
model<00:01:42.180> master<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.439> did

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
model master and that was what I did

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.249 
model master and that was what I did
with<00:01:43.710> my<00:01:43.799> 71<00:01:44.280> CUDA<00:01:44.820> with<00:01:45.149> which<00:01:45.810> came<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.110> nice

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
with my 71 CUDA with which came out nice

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.539 
with my 71 CUDA with which came out nice
I<00:01:46.530> didn't<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.009> anything<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.369> just

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
I didn't really do anything I just

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.139 
I didn't really do anything I just
decanted<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.270> put<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:49.170> two<00:01:49.409> drops<00:01:49.770> of

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
decanted it and put I think two drops of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.969 
decanted it and put I think two drops of
thinner<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.360> there<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.649> wanted

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
thinner in there just because I wanted

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.740 
thinner in there just because I wanted
to<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.159> some<00:01:53.340> thinner<00:01:54.890> in<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:57.450> that's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
to have some thinner in it so that's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.340 
to have some thinner in it so that's
what<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.899> did<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.159> this<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
what I did but this is the this is the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.410 
what I did but this is the this is the
air<00:02:01.350> compressor<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.070> bought<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.399> $70<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
air compressor that I bought for $70 and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.539 
air compressor that I bought for $70 and
I'm<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.469> turn<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:05.130> real<00:02:05.340> quick

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
I'm going to turn it on here real quick

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.330 
I'm going to turn it on here real quick
so<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.540> guys<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.960> hear<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.530> don't<00:02:08.160> think

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
so you guys can hear it I don't think

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.589 
so you guys can hear it I don't think
it's<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.550> loud<00:02:08.849> especially<00:02:09.090> when<00:02:09.509> it's

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
it's that loud especially when it's

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.420 
it's that loud especially when it's
under<00:02:09.780> my<00:02:09.810> desk<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.440> I'm<00:02:10.560> airbrushing<00:02:10.920> but

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
under my desk and I'm airbrushing but

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.490 
under my desk and I'm airbrushing but
that's<00:02:13.030> what<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.269> sounds<00:02:13.569> like<00:02:13.599> and<00:02:14.079> it's<00:02:14.379> an

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
that's what it sounds like and it's an

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.119 
that's what it sounds like and it's an
automatic<00:02:14.829> on/off<00:02:15.129> so<00:02:16.120> it'll<00:02:16.420> turn<00:02:16.599> off

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
automatic on/off so it'll turn off

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.470 
automatic on/off so it'll turn off
automatically<00:02:18.129> when<00:02:18.250> it's<00:02:18.549> not<00:02:18.730> when<00:02:19.390> it's

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
automatically when it's not when it's

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.899 
automatically when it's not when it's
not<00:02:19.629> on<00:02:19.840> let<00:02:20.799> me<00:02:20.890> hook<00:02:21.010> up<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.310> bahir<00:02:21.670> brush

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
not on let me hook up the bahir brush

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.259 
not on let me hook up the bahir brush
here<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:24.220> I'm<00:02:24.430> gonna<00:02:24.549> hook<00:02:24.640> up<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.909> airbrush

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
here so I'm gonna hook up the airbrush

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.619 
here so I'm gonna hook up the airbrush
so<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.540> can<00:02:25.720> kind<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.290> see<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:27.030> here<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.239> and

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
so you can kind of see it here it is and

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.330 
so you can kind of see it here it is and
so<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.680> turns<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:31.390> can<00:02:31.540> hear<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.980> this

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
so it turns on you can hear it and this

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.119 
so it turns on you can hear it and this
is<00:02:33.549> actually<00:02:33.909> set<00:02:34.090> at<00:02:34.239> 30<00:02:34.890> let's<00:02:35.890> write<00:02:36.040> it

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
is actually set at 30 let's write it

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:42.660 
is actually set at 30 let's write it
down<00:02:36.390> right<00:02:37.390> here<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:41.470> dropped<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.769> 20<00:02:42.220> but

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
down right here and it dropped to 20 but

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.539 
down right here and it dropped to 20 but
I<00:02:43.090> don't<00:02:43.390> think<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:43.659> that<00:02:43.720> loud<00:02:44.019> and

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
I don't think it's that loud and

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.149 
I don't think it's that loud and
especially<00:02:45.549> when<00:02:45.760> it's<00:02:46.150> under<00:02:46.389> the<00:02:46.480> gas<00:02:47.159> right

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
especially when it's under the gas right

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.789 
especially when it's under the gas right
here<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:49.150> then<00:02:49.420> it'll<00:02:49.599> turn<00:02:49.750> off<00:02:49.810> but<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.590> so

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
here and then it'll turn off but I so

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.920 
here and then it'll turn off but I so
that's<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.010> great<00:02:51.129> feature<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.480> when<00:02:52.810> it's

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
that's a great feature and so when it's

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.970 
that's a great feature and so when it's
under<00:02:53.109> the<00:02:53.230> desk<00:02:53.489> we<00:02:54.489> throw<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.849> down<00:02:55.030> there

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
under the desk we throw it down there

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.599 
under the desk we throw it down there
and<00:02:58.019> so<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.560> know<00:02:59.650> here<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.099> it's<00:03:00.340> under<00:03:00.489> my

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
and so you know here it is it's under my

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.240 
and so you know here it is it's under my
desk<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:01.510> know<00:03:01.599> I<00:03:01.629> just<00:03:01.900> sit<00:03:02.049> here<00:03:02.139> is<00:03:03.010> what<00:03:03.220> I

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
desk you know I just sit here is what I

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.449 
desk you know I just sit here is what I
do<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:04.329> so<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.230> think<00:03:05.530> it's<00:03:05.650> it's<00:03:05.859> pretty<00:03:06.310> good

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
do and so I think it's it's pretty good

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.399 
do and so I think it's it's pretty good
it's<00:03:07.269> pretty<00:03:07.299> good<00:03:07.569> for<00:03:07.750> especially<00:03:08.019> not<00:03:08.349> a

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
it's pretty good for especially not a

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:09.960 
it's pretty good for especially not a
lot<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.650> money<00:03:08.859> I<00:03:08.980> know<00:03:09.159> some<00:03:09.489> of<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.639> iwata

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
lot of money I know some of the iwata

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.729 
lot of money I know some of the iwata
stuff<00:03:10.299> goes<00:03:10.540> up<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:11.379> know<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.500> couple

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
stuff goes up to you know a couple

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.410 
stuff goes up to you know a couple
hundred<00:03:11.859> and<00:03:12.760> then<00:03:12.849> you<00:03:12.909> can<00:03:13.060> go<00:03:13.239> up<00:03:13.389> from

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
hundred and then you can go up from

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.869 
hundred and then you can go up from
there<00:03:13.810> but<00:03:14.439> this<00:03:15.310> was<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.489> cheap<00:03:15.730> alternative

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
there but this was a cheap alternative

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.689 
there but this was a cheap alternative
for<00:03:16.329> me<00:03:16.419> for<00:03:16.599> right<00:03:16.750> now<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:17.769> can<00:03:18.160> save<00:03:18.579> up

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699 
for me for right now so I can save up

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.030 
for me for right now so I can save up
some<00:03:18.879> bones<00:03:19.060> for<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.359> good<00:03:19.480> compressor<00:03:20.019> look<00:03:20.919> at

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
some bones for a good compressor look at

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.830 
some bones for a good compressor look at
one<00:03:21.220> that's<00:03:21.370> probably<00:03:22.269> can<00:03:22.449> spray<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.690> little

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
one that's probably can spray a little

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.720 
one that's probably can spray a little
bit<00:03:22.959> better<00:03:23.169> but<00:03:23.440> for<00:03:23.500> right<00:03:23.799> now<00:03:23.859> since<00:03:24.400> like

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
bit better but for right now since like

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.390 
bit better but for right now since like
