00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:25.029
 and multiples of a number the multiples 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.640
 it is calculated by multiplying that number 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:31.150
 by the natural numbers a number that 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:35.769
 is a multiple of n is represented by m of 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.600
 n on with a circle in the part 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.460
 higher 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 ej 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.620
 calculate the multiples of 4 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.230
 we elaborate a table here next 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.090
 left we place the numbers 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.530
 natural 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:00.379
 0 1 2 3 4 5 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.379
 multiply in this case by 4 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.360
 and we get the multiples as a result 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:14.830
 of 4 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:17.550
 0 4 8 12 16 20 and this continues until the 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.550
 infinite 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:28.930
 so multiples of four are 0 4 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.930
 8 12 16 20 ellipsis 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.560
 divisors of a number it is said that a 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.790
 number divisor other when the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.700
 divide it by the the division is exact 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.030
 It is represented with d 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.409
 parentheses n 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.840
 ej 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:56.110
 the number five is divisor of 30 because 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:01.030
 30 between 5 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:05.980
 we obtain as quotient 6 multiplying 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:11.330
 we would have 6 x 5 30 operating 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:14.480
 we have zero waste that is to say 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.770
 the division of 30 between 5 is a 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.770
 exact division 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:29.280
 the number seven is divisor of 56 because 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:32.030
 56 among 7 we get as conscious 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.030
 8 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.970
 the number one is divisor of all number 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:49.129
 example calculates the number of divisors and 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.129
 the dividers of 24 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.640
 calculation of the number of dividers of 24 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:07.280
 we break down into its prime factors 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:09.240
 24 half 12 half 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.930
 6 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.930
 half 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.180
 tertiary 1 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.610
 2 x 2 x 2 can be written as 2 to 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.240
 Cube 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:31.770
 then 24 can be written as 2 to 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.200
 cube by 3 to exponent 1 to calculate 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.770
 the number of divisors 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:43.490
 we add a unit to exponent 3 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:48.170
 three plus one would give us four sum 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:52.970
 a unit to exponent 1 that is 11 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:57.380
 we get 2 now multiply 4 times 2 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:03.010
 is equal to 8 that is the number of 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.010
 divisors of 24 equals 8 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:13.700
 calculation of the dividers of 24 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:18.230
 to calculate the divisors of 24 they 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:21.110
 write 2 to the cube and express 2 to the 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.850
 exponent 0 2 to exponent 1 2 to 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:27.990
 square until you reach 2 cubed 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.660
 what we do with 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:35.820
 number 3 to exponent 1 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:40.920
 we write 3 to exponent 1 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:45.540
 operating muzzle to 0 is 12 to exponent 1 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:50.460
 is 22 squared gives us 42 cube is 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:54.080
 equal to 8 3 to exponent 1 equals 3 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:59.460
 that is to say these numbers one two four 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:02.360
 eight and three are the divisors of 24 to 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.719
 this will be called base divisors 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.320
 with these dividers can be generated and 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:13.070
 get the missing dividers 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.980
 if there are 8 dividers of 24 here 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:21.460
 we have only 5 divisors we are missing 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.460
 3 dividers now we multiply 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:34.259
 2 x 3 we get 6 is another divider 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:40.199
 4 x 3 we get 12 is another divisor and 8 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:44.520
 by 3 equals 24 is another divisor already 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:50.550
 we have the 8 divisors of 24 we write 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:55.129
 the divisors of 24 equals 1 2 3 4 6 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.129
 8 12 and 24
