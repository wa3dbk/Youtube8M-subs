devices<00:06:00.729> but<00:06:01.729> seriously<00:06:02.000> I<00:06:02.539> think<00:06:02.840> there's

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
devices but seriously I think there's

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.050

some things I would like them to do one

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.520 
some things I would like them to do one
of<00:06:05.180> them<00:06:05.270> is<00:06:05.360> much<00:06:05.720> better<00:06:06.050> speech

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
of them is much better speech

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.409 
of them is much better speech
