00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
I'd actually be kind of actually maybe

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.490 
I'd actually be kind of actually maybe
you<00:01:57.680> don't<00:01:58.010> want<00:01:58.190> to<00:01:58.250> fight<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.580> monkey

you don't want to fight the monkey

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.210 
you don't want to fight the monkey
considering<00:02:00.500> what<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.680> would<00:02:00.770> probably<00:02:00.950> be

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
considering what it would probably be

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.870 
considering what it would probably be
throwing<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.820> throwing<00:02:01.850> at<00:02:02.300> me<00:02:03.580> maybe<00:02:04.580> I

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
throwing and throwing at me maybe I

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.990 
throwing and throwing at me maybe I
shouldn't<00:02:05.390> be<00:02:05.479> fighting<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.870> monkey

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.490 

let's<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:09.899> hope<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.110> don't<00:02:10.140> fight<00:02:10.410> them

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:32.650 
area all right so where am I
yeah<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:17.959> guess<00:04:18.110> that's<00:04:18.260> me<00:04:20.950> so<00:04:31.420> now<00:04:32.420> that<00:04:32.540> we

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
yeah I guess that's me so now that we

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.510 
yeah I guess that's me so now that we
have<00:04:32.690> our<00:04:32.900> map<00:04:35.200> we've<00:04:36.200> set<00:04:36.440> hat

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
have our map we've set hat

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.409 
have our map we've set hat
let's<00:04:39.520> look<00:04:39.610> at<00:04:39.759> that<00:04:39.849> again<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.090> believe<00:04:40.300> and

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
let's look at that again I believe and

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:47.429 
let's look at that again I believe and
I'm<00:04:40.479> pretty<00:04:40.659> sure<00:04:40.750> it<00:04:40.930> said<00:04:41.110> half<00:04:41.439> h8p<00:04:46.439> map

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:47.439 
I'm pretty sure it said half h8p map

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:51.330 
I'm pretty sure it said half h8p map
again<00:04:49.469> okay<00:04:50.469> so<00:04:50.500> I'm<00:04:50.620> guessing<00:04:50.919> that's<00:04:51.039> the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
again okay so I'm guessing that's the

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.189 
again okay so I'm guessing that's the
door<00:04:51.520> out<00:04:51.759> and<00:04:52.090> we<00:04:52.150> need<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.389> find<00:04:52.659> the<00:04:52.840> special

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
door out and we need to find the special

00:04:53.199 --> 00:05:01.830 
door out and we need to find the special
key<00:04:53.409> that'll<00:04:53.650> open<00:04:53.770> that<00:04:54.340> door<00:05:00.449> those<00:05:01.449> girls

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
key that'll open that door those girls

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.300 
key that'll open that door those girls
like<00:05:02.050> bounce<00:05:02.409> around<00:05:02.620> like<00:05:02.949> nobody's

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
like bounce around like nobody's

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.890 
like bounce around like nobody's
business<00:05:03.430> man<00:05:03.789> oh<00:05:06.150> where<00:05:07.150> am<00:05:07.180> I<00:05:07.300> going<00:05:07.509> anyway

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
business man oh where am I going anyway

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
like a slingshot things I guess our feed

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.159 
like a slingshot things I guess our feed
so<00:05:21.610> waiting<00:05:21.940> out<00:05:22.060> into<00:05:22.419> here<00:05:22.750> then<00:05:22.930> there's

there<00:05:50.050> was<00:05:50.110> a<00:05:50.199> secret<00:05:50.379> passageway<00:05:50.919> here<00:05:51.099> so

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
there was a secret passageway here so

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.089 
there was a secret passageway here so
yeah<00:05:51.940> okay<00:05:52.389> okay<00:05:55.169> so<00:05:56.169> secret<00:05:56.589> passageways

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
yeah okay okay so secret passageways

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.570 
yeah okay okay so secret passageways
also<00:05:57.400> show<00:05:57.580> up<00:05:57.759> on<00:05:57.909> this<00:05:58.029> on<00:05:58.330> the<00:05:58.449> map<00:05:59.580> very

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
also show up on this on the map very

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:08.159 
also show up on this on the map very
convenient<00:06:06.539> so<00:06:07.539> I<00:06:07.569> guess<00:06:07.719> I<00:06:07.810> just<00:06:07.960> need<00:06:08.080> to

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
convenient so I guess I just need to

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.930 
convenient so I guess I just need to
check<00:06:08.289> back<00:06:08.440> up<00:06:08.589> my<00:06:08.680> map<00:06:08.889> every<00:06:09.400> so<00:06:09.520> often<00:06:09.669> over

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
check back up my map every so often over

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.119 
check back up my map every so often over
to<00:06:10.060> see<00:06:10.210> you<00:06:10.389> know<00:06:10.529> where<00:06:11.529> all<00:06:11.560> the<00:06:11.800> stuff<00:06:11.949> is

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
to see you know where all the stuff is

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.820 
to see you know where all the stuff is
okay<00:06:12.909> I<00:06:13.120> could<00:06:13.270> seen<00:06:13.389> that<00:06:13.509> be<00:06:13.599> a<00:06:13.629> band-aid<00:06:14.139> to

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
okay I could seen that be a band-aid to

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.649 
okay I could seen that be a band-aid to
lead<00:06:15.009> me<00:06:15.159> down<00:06:15.190> this<00:06:15.969> way<00:06:17.310> in<00:06:18.449> through<00:06:19.449> and

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:19.659 
lead me down this way in through and

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.159 
lead me down this way in through and
around<00:06:19.750> there<00:06:20.710> and<00:06:21.580> I<00:06:22.360> guessing<00:06:22.690> that<00:06:22.839> little

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
around there and I guessing that little

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:24.540 
around there and I guessing that little
square<00:06:23.440> there<00:06:23.500> is<00:06:23.740> probably<00:06:24.129> the<00:06:24.250> end<00:06:24.400> of<00:06:24.490> the

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
square there is probably the end of the

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.719 
square there is probably the end of the
level<00:06:25.529> or<00:06:26.529> the<00:06:26.560> door<00:06:27.099> to<00:06:27.219> get<00:06:27.310> to<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.520> end<00:06:27.639> of

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
level or the door to get to the end of

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.010 
level or the door to get to the end of
level<00:06:27.940> which<00:06:28.089> was<00:06:28.270> that<00:06:28.419> one

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
level which was that one

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.349 
level which was that one
I<00:06:31.090> think<00:06:32.090> they're<00:06:32.360> so<00:06:32.930> great
