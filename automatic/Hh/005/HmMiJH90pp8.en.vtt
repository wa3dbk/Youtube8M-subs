00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.009
 so hello dear subscribers and 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.859
 channel viewers with you as always i don't 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.230
 cut and on this beautiful spring day we 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.920
 play a game called dino or 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.929
 how else can you call this simulator 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.609
 dinosaur simulator game now 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.220
 is on alpha testing she 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.119
 very bad at all adapted to 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.100
 any iron 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.410
 that is, it is generally very much in principle 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.170
 sucks adapted as though here 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.800
 Now here's a FPS there 20 jumps 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.489
 constantly 20 to 35 I now had something 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.059
 have any 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.480
 what settings we would choose graphics 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.750
 either low or high we have nothing 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.329
 changing vps also jumps the essence of the game 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.719
 the essence of the game, in principle, is not here that is 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.230
 we play dinosaur we run by 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.510
 territories that we have here 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.430
 limited and looking landscapes 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.530
 here also here were cows 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.649
 here is this cow i don't know why i have 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.350
 not associated with cows but shorter 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.180
 cows let's try to attack 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.330
 anyone yes we have an attack here 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.939
 these are the forepaws of the foreleg and 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.640
 back also we can jump run 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:20.720
 let's try never 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.720
 got to attack someone 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.820
 we also have a camera hang here 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:32.520
 as it was again, come on now 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:41.460
 two still have but spam did not score it so that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:46.340
 you had to stand to stand where it is not 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.340
 I get this you do nothing 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:59.399
 no no no it can't and cannot 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:01.700
 maybe I'm not a curve like no 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.399
 it turns out to say okay not the point 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.920
 so we had here somewhere in the lake yes 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:12.209
 now we will reach the lake 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.810
 very nice picture with a lake well in 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:20.280
 principle from the game of some big hopes 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:24.360
 I was not on this game well, actually 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.360
 here we have it swims like this 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.090
 with water that is, we just sink into 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.989
 water 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:39.200
 just water, in principle, drawn 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:44.750
 decent but better game 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.030
 completely on unity3d done in principle 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.940
 unity3d graphics can be immediately identified 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.280
 because in all games on the unity engine 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:58.700
 it is basically the same so you 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.579
 still remember wanted to show yes cards with us 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.459
 limited ie beyond these forests we 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.160
 we can not run away very much hope that 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.130
 guys will continue to make the game because 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.150
 in principle, it is interesting and interesting 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.769
 if there are any 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.030
 additional opportunities there are hunting 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.440
 something else but I don't know what 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.069
 dinosaurs do in their free days 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.069
 let's run on 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.590
 the mountain is no general 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.440
 musical 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.880
 Musically singing it upset me 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.000
 a little bit because i love music in 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:44.270
 games play good music and constantly 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:51.090
 constantly howling howling these cows though 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:57.300
 more like a wolf so we 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:59.550
 climbed yes we got well drawing 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:05.370
 here is not really that is all soap 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:07.650
 ahead all very soapy can 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.980
 jump in principle if with big 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.900
 heights jump he doesn't die so much 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.410
 camera for some reason he remains top 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.799
 I can leave a reference to the game 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.000
 the description he is now thank god 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.000
 in free access 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.599
 Yes 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.210
 perfect perfect swimming 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.640
 so well, in principle, all according to the drawing schedule 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.780
 I can say graffiti in principle 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.520
 unity 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:54.840
 unity graphics are basically good at 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.850
 In principle, a lot of good grass 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.980
 trees and so this is very good but 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.660
 not on all computers that will pull 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.730
 more so powerful they are fine 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.950
 but when the game is complete 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.200
 adapted to 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:11.280
 under the game so that there is no such thing 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:15.660
 FPS from twenty to thirty I jump 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.220
 I forgot the idea pohoy by the way I'm not the whole card 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.110
 ran around can now look out there 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.110
 what that bitches stick out 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.440
 no traces of traces of not we are left in 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.570
 We just dust under your feet under the legs 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.000
 so why here now he just 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.889
 stuck can not exceed further then 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.130
 here is some invisible yes here 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:42.770
 invisible wall guys can not for some reason 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.360
 run under and under water 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.300
 it is impossible so we have to that territory 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.060
 it seems there is absolutely no way to get 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:53.020
 This is her climb now in any way 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.020
 No, you can jump 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.670
 but it is worth to us to invisibility 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.370
 how not to go well, in general, here it is 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:07.040
 such a game 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.470
