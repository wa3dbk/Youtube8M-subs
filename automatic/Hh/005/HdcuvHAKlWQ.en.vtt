00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:15.910
 I love Mexico and I do not think 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:19.810
 He has raised more 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:24.250
 a good years ago the house takes 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.130
 in full jumping swim in the time where 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.810
 the soils today to see if we are there 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.400
 Have another video for you guys. 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.579
 demonstrate how the whole process works 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.680
 from the helicopter boats from the beginning of the 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.760
 withdrawal from the carton until the initial flight 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.559
 new 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.570
 I hope to help you there if I have 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.519
 doubts at the end and have our 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.140
 even our means of communication there 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.239
 so come on 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.970
 I'm taking a demo one 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.010
 helicopter until hawk three of them 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.409
 six channels okay so that's what 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.640
 He can head such everything else 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.900
 We'll have to show you how. 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.519
 what are the procedural principles 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.519
 before flying and then 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.820
 very early the shooting staff and what whole 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:34.230
 the rate turns the sneaker is this one and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.270
 there the best the 10 with the naked eye if 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.100
 You mother, she's going to give it a lot. 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.560
 attention on Bruno's body when he 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.140
 back and he asks calmly during the flight she 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.090
 will never be 100% called to the police 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.300
 about important gives a good turn 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.740
 cool 10 before in your eye like this 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.910
 as fast as you can 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.300
 to be able to leave after the 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.910
 analyzed in the general context're all 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.760
 helicopter cdm mechanism that 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.160
 his cyclic peace grows here and he passes 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.500
 collective and we must not forget 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:15.780
 of the tail motor see only the line 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:17.870
 too, there we go there beauty 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.450
 I'm going to pass the radio procedure now. 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.600
 super important come from the radio 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.959
 all keys up from the verified 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.640
 motor cut and normal and 3d 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.500
 this must never normal key 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.750
 may be motivated because I will not call 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.370
 helicopter battery and she will 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.070
 shoot the engine you're still with 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.140
 so normal a lot was 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.880
 unlocked engine work that way 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.370
 you have a safety when you hit 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.989
 the helicopter that makes the move it 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.480
 will not have engine understands 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:03:04.320
 Let's go and connect by beating the product. 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:07.230
 now it 's super important too personal 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.140
 and I'll try to hit the chopper 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.110
 while not entering a crop rotation 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.019
 I can not do any of the 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.830
 move at the right helicopter this 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.830
 procedure here 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.740
 only entered gil did under certain then today 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.110
 it makes a slight movement that in the tail 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.430
 I know I've entered it now I can 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.430
 product canopy 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.310
 now do some initial testing before 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.150
 flight to see if all the 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:59.980
 movements are corresponding to the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.980
 product then front right right 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:13.520
 left-right brings some pass 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:16.040
 positive pass became easy positive 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.110
 pass rover are modifying this 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.780
 on is not because it is the engine 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.490
 Locked up, what I did not work 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.860
 I can do this moment because the 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.590
 Helicopter will give motor now back to 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.640
 practice to involve there out there 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.640
 office there staff 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.420
 It 's a bit boring today to make a 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.450
 final flight trying a lot here then the 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.880
 movement the question of paxixi rover does 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.160
 with which the series without rotation causes a 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.810
 wing as if it were an airplane then the wind 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.950
 in the case makes him 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.420
 in this relationship 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.490
 I'll try to take off again and try 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.780
 hold a little bit thinner 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.780
 now for you to see 

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:05.119
 that's it folks the flight procedure 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:09.229
 what would that be now we just can not 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:11.869
 forget the simple fact that radio always 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:15.369
 is the first one was connected and the last one to be 

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:15.369
 off then 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:24.300
 the disconnects the right battery 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:26.550
 Now I can turn off the radio with 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.830
 safety 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:31.439
 so always recapitulating the radio is the 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:34.919
 first connected and the last one to be 

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:37.110
 off on every chromatic helicopter 

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:38.249
 I hope to help if you have questions about 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:51.259
 our contacts 

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:54.259
 a hug to the mother is not that neither thinks 

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:54.259
 normal 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:06.680
 they are training at the time was 6
