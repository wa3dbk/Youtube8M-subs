this<00:00:18.939> will<00:00:19.150> start<00:00:19.539> with<00:00:19.810> a<00:00:19.840> pretty<00:00:20.170> good<00:00:20.380> grip

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
this will start with a pretty good grip

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.490 
this will start with a pretty good grip
and<00:00:20.950> I<00:00:21.880> usually<00:00:22.330> suggest<00:00:22.570> most<00:00:23.140> players

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
and I usually suggest most players

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
level to stay within that Eastern to

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.740 
level to stay within that Eastern to

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
get a feel for the correct wrist

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.689 
get a feel for the correct wrist
position<00:00:59.019> which<00:00:59.679> is<00:00:59.829> very<00:01:00.039> important<00:01:00.549> for<00:01:00.639> a

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
position which is very important for a

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.430 
position which is very important for a
forehand<00:01:01.209> so<00:01:01.629> I'm<00:01:01.719> going<00:01:01.869> to<00:01:01.959> be<00:01:02.019> able<00:01:02.139> to<00:01:02.260> make

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
forehand so I'm going to be able to make

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.310 
forehand so I'm going to be able to make
contact<00:01:02.649> in<00:01:03.159> front<00:01:03.549> I<00:01:03.850> have<00:01:04.510> to<00:01:04.690> have<00:01:04.839> my<00:01:05.049> wrist

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
contact in front I have to have my wrist

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.200 
contact in front I have to have my wrist
laid<00:01:05.710> back<00:01:05.920> but<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.369> should<00:01:06.549> be<00:01:06.580> comfortable

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
laid back but it should be comfortable

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.360 
laid back but it should be comfortable
if<00:01:07.659> I<00:01:07.900> try<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:08.290> do<00:01:08.380> this<00:01:08.530> with<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.800> continental

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
if I try and do this with a continental

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.600 
if I try and do this with a continental
grip<00:01:09.430> it's<00:01:10.210> awkward<00:01:10.780> if<00:01:11.740> I've<00:01:12.070> got<00:01:12.250> too<00:01:12.460> much

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
grip it's awkward if I've got too much

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.640 
grip it's awkward if I've got too much
of<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.910> severe<00:01:13.300> Western<00:01:13.780> grip<00:01:14.050> you<00:01:14.260> can<00:01:14.410> see

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
I've got to be way out in front so this

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.130 
I've got to be way out in front so this
gives<00:01:17.140> me<00:01:17.290> a<00:01:17.560> good<00:01:18.070> neutral<00:01:18.820> grip<00:01:19.180> if<00:01:19.780> you're

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
and if we were to get extreme you can

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.290 
and if we were to get extreme you can
see<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.070> straw<00:02:06.310> is<00:02:06.460> almost<00:02:06.700> pointing<00:02:07.120> down

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300
