00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.869 

okay<00:00:00.539> so<00:00:01.100> when<00:00:02.100> you're<00:00:02.220> getting<00:00:02.520> ready<00:00:02.790> to

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay so when you're getting ready to

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.700 
okay so when you're getting ready to
make<00:00:03.120> concrete<00:00:03.449> countertops<00:00:04.230> you're<00:00:04.589> going

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
make concrete countertops you're going

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.019 
make concrete countertops you're going
to<00:00:04.770> want<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.009> know<00:00:05.069> what<00:00:05.220> size<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.670> make<00:00:05.700> them

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
to want to know what size to make them

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.600 
to want to know what size to make them
so<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.080> problem<00:00:07.620> here<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:08.130> that<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.460> can

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
so the problem here is that you can

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.790 
so the problem here is that you can
either<00:00:08.820> measure<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.210> all<00:00:09.330> out<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.960> be<00:00:10.559> real

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
either measure it all out and be real

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.350 
either measure it all out and be real
smart<00:00:11.040> not<00:00:11.280> make<00:00:11.490> any<00:00:11.670> mistakes<00:00:12.030> but<00:00:12.269> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
smart not make any mistakes but the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.879 
smart not make any mistakes but the
chances<00:00:12.750> are<00:00:12.840> they're<00:00:13.080> not<00:00:13.110> square<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:13.769> you're

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
chances are they're not square so you're

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.020 
chances are they're not square so you're
gonna<00:00:14.009> be<00:00:14.099> screwed<00:00:14.340> up<00:00:14.460> anyway

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
gonna be screwed up anyway

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.240 
gonna be screwed up anyway
so<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:16.170> get<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:18.050> masonite<00:00:19.050> board<00:00:19.250> which

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
so I just get this masonite board which

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.130 
so I just get this masonite board which
is<00:00:20.400> kind<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.609> like<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.060> pegboard<00:00:21.510> except

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
is kind of like the pegboard except

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.230 
is kind of like the pegboard except
without<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> holes<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.949> real<00:00:23.160> cheap<00:00:23.240> rip

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
without the holes in it real cheap rip

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.810 
without the holes in it real cheap rip
it<00:00:24.359> into<00:00:24.510> some<00:00:24.750> convenient<00:00:25.289> widths<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.980> and

it into some convenient widths of it and

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.609 
it into some convenient widths of it and
then<00:00:26.970> make<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> template<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.810> countertop<00:00:28.439> you

out of granite I have those salmon cut

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.789 
out of granite I have those salmon cut
out<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.939> granite<00:01:48.149> put<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.140> your<00:01:49.320> glass<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
out of granite put all your glass and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.920 
out of granite put all your glass and
your<00:01:49.920> design<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.460> there<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.630> use

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
your design in there and then just use

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.889 
your design in there and then just use
sack<00:01:52.229> Creek<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.860> fill<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.420> there<00:01:54.659> fill

sack Creek and fill it on in there fill

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.429 
sack Creek and fill it on in there fill
it<00:01:55.049> up<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.820> use<00:01:56.820> an<00:01:56.969> air<00:01:57.180> hammer<00:01:57.450> underneath<00:01:58.259> it

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
it up I use an air hammer underneath it

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.080 
it up I use an air hammer underneath it
an<00:01:58.590> air<00:01:58.770> chisel<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.640> kind<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> rub

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
an air chisel and I just kind of rub

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.560 
an air chisel and I just kind of rub
underneath<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.500> mellah<00:02:01.740> line<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:03.270> some

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
underneath the mellah line to get some

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.639 
underneath the mellah line to get some
of<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.719> bubbles<00:02:04.049> out<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.380> it

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
of the bubbles out of it

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.479 
of the bubbles out of it
and<00:02:04.829> then<00:02:05.820> let<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.000> sit<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.329> two<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> week

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
and then let it sit for two for a week

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.160 
and then let it sit for two for a week
and<00:02:08.489> maybe<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.119> slow<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> sit<00:02:09.690> two<00:02:09.899> weeks

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
and maybe I slow to sit two weeks

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.870 
and maybe I slow to sit two weeks
depends<00:02:10.679> what's<00:02:11.009> up<00:02:11.220> anyway<00:02:11.700> then<00:02:11.910> go<00:02:12.030> back

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
depends what's up anyway then go back

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.870 
depends what's up anyway then go back
he's<00:02:13.060> probably<00:02:13.240> good<00:02:13.540> go<00:02:14.380> back<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.890> then<00:02:15.220> take

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
he's probably good go back and then take

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.700 
he's probably good go back and then take
it<00:02:15.910> out<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.210> mold<00:02:16.360> flip<00:02:16.990> it<00:02:17.140> over<00:02:17.290> and

it out of the mold flip it over and

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.560 
it out of the mold flip it over and
you're<00:02:18.460> gonna<00:02:18.520> have<00:02:18.760> something<00:02:19.060> looks<00:02:19.360> like

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
you're gonna have something looks like

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.260 
you're gonna have something looks like
this<00:02:19.930> but<00:02:20.740> there's<00:02:21.010> always<00:02:21.160> got<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.580> skin<00:02:22.060> on

at a lot of different places Amazon's
got<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.850> mine<00:02:43.090> now<00:02:43.260> anyway<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.440> then<00:02:45.100> start

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
got a mine now anyway and then start

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.250 
got a mine now anyway and then start
grinding<00:02:45.610> into<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.750> first<00:02:46.960> piece

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
grinding into it this is the first piece

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.810 
grinding into it this is the first piece
I<00:02:47.410> ever<00:02:47.440> made<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.160> was<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> sample<00:02:48.790> piece<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:50.820> so

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
I ever made it was a sample piece and so

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.000 
I ever made it was a sample piece and so
you<00:02:51.880> grind<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.570> into<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.290> start<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.650> expose

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
you grind it into it and start to expose

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.490 
you grind it into it and start to expose
the<00:02:54.310> glass<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.090> aggregate<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.900> lot<00:02:56.380> of

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
the glass and the aggregate a lot of

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.200 
the glass and the aggregate a lot of
things<00:02:56.800> that<00:02:56.950> are<00:02:57.010> going<00:02:57.160> on<00:02:57.340> there<00:02:57.580> these<00:02:58.150> are

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
things that are going on there these are

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.820 
things that are going on there these are
those<00:02:58.510> things<00:02:58.990> you<00:02:59.170> get<00:02:59.320> at<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.470> 99-cent

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
those things you get at the 99-cent

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.980 
those things you get at the 99-cent
store<00:03:00.130> that<00:03:00.520> you<00:03:00.580> might<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.060> vase<00:03:01.450> full<00:03:01.750> of

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
store that you might have a vase full of

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.570 
store that you might have a vase full of
dry<00:03:02.980> flowers<00:03:03.520> holding<00:03:04.180> them<00:03:04.270> anyway<00:03:05.580> so

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
dry flowers holding them anyway so

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.640 
dry flowers holding them anyway so
that's<00:03:07.300> what<00:03:07.690> it's<00:03:07.840> going<00:03:07.960> to<00:03:08.020> look<00:03:08.140> like<00:03:08.200> when

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
that's what it's going to look like when

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.050 
that's what it's going to look like when
when<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.100> first<00:03:09.310> grind<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.790> though<00:03:09.880> you

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
when you first grind it though you

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.930 
when you first grind it though you
exposed<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.660> bunch<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.960> holes<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:12.430> then<00:03:12.760> get

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
exposed a bunch of holes so then get

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.850 
exposed a bunch of holes so then get
some<00:03:13.120> cement<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.780> doesn't<00:03:14.170> have<00:03:14.350> aggregate

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
some cement that doesn't have aggregate

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.090 
some cement that doesn't have aggregate
just<00:03:15.070> pure<00:03:15.370> cement<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.350> you're<00:03:17.350> gonna<00:03:17.440> make<00:03:18.070> a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
just pure cement and you're gonna make a

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.370 
just pure cement and you're gonna make a
slurry<00:03:18.490> and<00:03:18.820> backfill<00:03:19.540> all<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.960> bubbles<00:03:20.140> that

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
slurry and backfill all the bubbles that

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.580 
slurry and backfill all the bubbles that
you<00:03:20.560> expose<00:03:20.890> when<00:03:21.130> you're<00:03:21.250> grounded<00:03:22.350> hey<00:03:23.350> Jo

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
you expose when you're grounded hey Jo

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.000 
you expose when you're grounded hey Jo
dinnertime<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.400> then<00:03:25.180> anyway<00:03:25.710> let<00:03:26.710> it<00:03:26.830> sit

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
dinnertime and then anyway let it sit

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.310 
dinnertime and then anyway let it sit
for<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.250> week<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.640> then<00:03:27.880> grind<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.360> again<00:03:28.450> don't

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
for a week and then grind it again don't

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.560 
for a week and then grind it again don't
you<00:03:29.560> need<00:03:29.800> to<00:03:29.830> use<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.220> from<00:03:30.490> then<00:03:30.640> on<00:03:30.790> you're

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
you need to use this from then on you're

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.110 
you need to use this from then on you're
gonna<00:03:31.660> be<00:03:31.750> using<00:03:31.960> like<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.230> 50<00:03:32.740> grit<00:03:33.280> here<00:03:33.610> so

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120

but those are just the natural rocks and
with<00:04:22.060> lamp<00:04:22.330> block<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:22.960> made<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.680> another<00:04:23.919> this

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
with lamp block I made it another this

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.780 
with lamp block I made it another this
is<00:04:24.250> what<00:04:24.400> I<00:04:24.460> use<00:04:24.640> for<00:04:24.669> that<00:04:25.060> other<00:04:25.240> one<00:04:25.390> where<00:04:25.570> I

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
is what I use for that other one where I

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.400 
is what I use for that other one where I
put<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.000> styrofoam<00:04:26.540> in<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:26.930> made<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.080> voids

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
put the styrofoam in and made the voids

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.730 
put the styrofoam in and made the voids
intentionally<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:29.960> think<00:04:30.380> that's<00:04:30.620> about

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
intentionally so I think that's about

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.940 
intentionally so I think that's about
all<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.160> there<00:04:31.520> is<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.440> used<00:04:33.440> this<00:04:33.680> on

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
all that there is to it I used this on

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.060 
all that there is to it I used this on
this<00:04:34.640> corner<00:04:35.120> here<00:04:35.420> but<00:04:36.200> it<00:04:36.380> didn't<00:04:36.680> last<00:04:36.800> very

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
this corner here but it didn't last very

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.030 
this corner here but it didn't last very
long<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:37.940> did<00:04:38.390> one<00:04:38.600> counter<00:04:38.960> top<00:04:39.170> with<00:04:39.200> it<00:04:39.560> you

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
long I I did one counter top with it you

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.010 
long I I did one counter top with it you
can<00:04:40.190> actually<00:04:40.400> just<00:04:40.850> use<00:04:41.060> this<00:04:41.540> sort<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:41.900> a

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
can actually just use this sort of a

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.510 
can actually just use this sort of a
thing<00:04:42.170> to<00:04:42.320> round<00:04:42.500> it<00:04:42.620> out<00:04:42.770> by<00:04:42.950> hand<00:04:43.160> if<00:04:43.430> you

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
thing to round it out by hand if you

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.300 
thing to round it out by hand if you
like<00:04:44.320> this<00:04:45.320> doesn't<00:04:45.680> have<00:04:45.770> any<00:04:45.890> see<00:04:46.040> there<00:04:46.190> on

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
like this doesn't have any see there on

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.340 
like this doesn't have any see there on
it<00:04:46.460> but<00:04:46.640> again<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.150> put<00:04:47.750> some<00:04:47.930> sealer<00:04:48.200> on<00:04:48.290> it

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
it but again you put some sealer on it

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.430 
it but again you put some sealer on it
when<00:04:48.560> you're<00:04:48.620> done<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:50.110> good<00:04:51.110> luck<00:04:51.260> with<00:04:51.380> your
