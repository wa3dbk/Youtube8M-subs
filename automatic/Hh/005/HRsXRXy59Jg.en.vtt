decided lead off with them my slowbro
cuz<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.930> figured<00:00:25.230> he<00:00:25.350> might<00:00:25.500> lead<00:00:25.830> off<00:00:25.949> with<00:00:26.180> his

after like burn damage and entry hazards

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.190 
after like burn damage and entry hazards
maybe<00:02:07.439> it'll<00:02:07.860> get

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
maybe it'll get

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.499 
maybe it'll get
Caleb<00:02:08.679> are<00:02:08.800> other<00:02:09.039> quake<00:02:09.250> or<00:02:09.369> something<00:02:09.759> since

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
Caleb are other quake or something since

to<00:02:14.560> ground<00:02:15.000> earthquakes<00:02:16.000> gonna<00:02:16.180> be<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.390> only

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
to ground earthquakes gonna be the only

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.160 
to ground earthquakes gonna be the only
move<00:02:16.810> on<00:02:16.989> with<00:02:17.140> youth<00:02:17.349> so<00:02:17.709> yeah<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.870> now<00:02:20.110> he

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
move on with youth so yeah so now he

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.530 
move on with youth so yeah so now he
goes<00:02:20.319> into<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:20.769> in<00:02:21.129> Poli<00:02:21.370> on<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.849> thought<00:02:22.300> he

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
goes into this in Poli on I thought he

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.420 
goes into this in Poli on I thought he
would<00:02:22.660> go<00:02:22.810> for<00:02:22.989> grass<00:02:23.260> not<00:02:23.560> cuz<00:02:23.860> that's<00:02:24.190> really

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
would go for grass not cuz that's really

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.670 
would go for grass not cuz that's really
the<00:02:24.550> only<00:02:24.580> option<00:02:24.819> that<00:02:25.239> i'm<00:02:26.050> polling<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.500> has

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
the only option that i'm polling on has

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.979 
the only option that i'm polling on has
to<00:02:26.860> hurt<00:02:27.040> my<00:02:27.220> slow<00:02:27.489> bro<00:02:27.670> but<00:02:28.300> he<00:02:28.480> makes<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.840> very

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
to hurt my slow bro but he makes a very

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.839 
to hurt my slow bro but he makes a very
good<00:02:29.110> prediction<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:29.980> he<00:02:30.250> predicts<00:02:30.640> my

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
good prediction and he predicts my

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.490 
good prediction and he predicts my
latias<00:02:31.239> succumbing<00:02:31.630> goes<00:02:31.870> for<00:02:32.050> ice<00:02:32.200> beam

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
latias succumbing goes for ice beam

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.470 
latias succumbing goes for ice beam
which<00:02:33.190> kind<00:02:33.489> of<00:02:33.580> sucks<00:02:33.819> cuz<00:02:34.030> he<00:02:34.120> goes<00:02:34.299> that

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
which kind of sucks cuz he goes that

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.650 
which kind of sucks cuz he goes that
shit<00:02:34.690> off<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.230> now<00:02:36.010> i<00:02:36.040> only<00:02:36.489> got<00:02:36.819> one<00:02:37.180> special

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
shit off and now i only got one special

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.140 
shit off and now i only got one special
attacker<00:02:37.930> left<00:02:38.170> with<00:02:38.410> dude<00:02:38.560> me<00:02:38.769> ama<00:02:38.950> dude<00:02:39.549> but

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
attacker left with dude me ama dude but

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.470 
attacker left with dude me ama dude but
which<00:02:40.930> would<00:02:41.230> be<00:02:41.410> my<00:02:41.620> slow<00:02:41.950> brew<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.060> go<00:02:43.450> to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
which would be my slow brew so I go to

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.750 
which would be my slow brew so I go to
landris<00:02:43.930> again<00:02:44.319> I<00:02:44.560> guess<00:02:45.040> just<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.459> check<00:02:45.610> if

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
landris again I guess just to check if

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.910 
landris again I guess just to check if
he<00:02:45.880> had<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.120> Aquajet<00:02:46.420> but<00:02:46.930> he<00:02:47.440> switches<00:02:47.680> out

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
he had the Aquajet but he switches out

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.740 
he had the Aquajet but he switches out
so<00:02:48.190> maybe<00:02:48.459> he<00:02:48.640> doesn't<00:02:48.849> maybe<00:02:49.180> he<00:02:49.390> knows<00:02:49.540> that

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
so maybe he doesn't maybe he knows that

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.199 
so maybe he doesn't maybe he knows that
it<00:02:50.230> might<00:02:50.530> not<00:02:50.709> be<00:02:50.769> able<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.160> kill<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.610> don't

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
it might not be able to kill I don't

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.250 
it might not be able to kill I don't
know<00:02:52.329> but<00:02:53.250> yeah<00:02:54.269> after<00:02:55.269> earthquake<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.959> knew<00:02:56.079> he

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
know but yeah after earthquake I knew he

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.020 
know but yeah after earthquake I knew he
would<00:02:56.380> go<00:02:56.620> for<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:56.920> roar<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.549> I<00:02:57.579> went<00:02:57.880> for

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
would go for the roar so I went for

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.319 
would go for the roar so I went for
earthquake<00:02:58.450> again<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.760> heroes<00:03:00.760> me<00:03:00.940> onto<00:03:01.209> my

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
earthquake again and heroes me onto my

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.270 
earthquake again and heroes me onto my
horse<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.840> guess<00:03:02.349> he<00:03:02.470> thought<00:03:02.650> he<00:03:02.799> could<00:03:02.950> be

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
horse I guess he thought he could be

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.250 
horse I guess he thought he could be
able<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.549> live<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.760> close<00:03:04.269> combat<00:03:04.540> but<00:03:04.959> this

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
able to live a close combat but this

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.940 
able to live a close combat but this
horse<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.890> banded<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.030> that's<00:03:07.900> an<00:03:08.140> easy<00:03:08.500> kale

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
horse is banded so that's an easy kale

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.740 
horse is banded so that's an easy kale
at<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.400> range<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.970> now<00:03:10.180> he's<00:03:10.329> gonna<00:03:10.450> go<00:03:10.630> out

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
at that range and now he's gonna go out

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.870 
at that range and now he's gonna go out
to<00:03:10.870> this<00:03:10.989> needle<00:03:11.319> king<00:03:11.530> which<00:03:12.220> makes<00:03:12.639> me<00:03:12.850> think

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
to this needle king which makes me think

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.229 
to this needle king which makes me think
he's<00:03:13.239> probably<00:03:13.420> scarfed<00:03:14.079> so<00:03:14.920> I'm<00:03:15.850> gonna<00:03:16.000> go

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
he's probably scarfed so I'm gonna go

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.990 
he's probably scarfed so I'm gonna go
into<00:03:16.450> tyranitar<00:03:17.250> basically<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.280> know<00:03:18.430> he<00:03:18.639> might

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
into tyranitar basically I know he might

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.059 
into tyranitar basically I know he might
go<00:03:19.239> for<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.569> earth<00:03:19.690> power<00:03:19.930> but<00:03:20.319> Edd's<00:03:20.590> of<00:03:20.859> this

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
go for the earth power but Edd's of this

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.250 
go for the earth power but Edd's of this
point<00:03:21.340> my<00:03:21.519> landris<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:22.030> his<00:03:22.180> gigantic<00:03:22.840> threat

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
point my landris is his gigantic threat

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.780 
point my landris is his gigantic threat
to<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.470> seam<00:03:23.709> so<00:03:23.859> I'm<00:03:23.980> thinking<00:03:24.549> he<00:03:24.639> might

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
to the seam so I'm thinking he might

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.849 
to the seam so I'm thinking he might
predict<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:25.239> a<00:03:25.299> go<00:03:25.450> for<00:03:25.630> ice<00:03:25.750> beam<00:03:26.019> so<00:03:26.560> just

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
predict that a go for ice beam so just

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.440 
predict that a go for ice beam so just
to<00:03:26.950> play<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.160> safe<00:03:27.280> I'm<00:03:27.579> gonna<00:03:27.730> go<00:03:27.880> into<00:03:28.060> detar

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
to play it safe I'm gonna go into detar

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.449 
to play it safe I'm gonna go into detar
ends<00:03:29.139> up<00:03:29.230> paying<00:03:29.410> off<00:03:29.650> cuz<00:03:29.859> he<00:03:29.950> goes<00:03:30.130> for<00:03:30.340> like

ends up paying off cuz he goes for like

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.250 
ends up paying off cuz he goes for like
ice<00:03:30.700> beam<00:03:30.970> reception<00:03:31.510> predicting<00:03:32.019> something

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.620 
ice beam reception predicting something
and<00:03:33.010> ya<00:03:33.489> get<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.760> freeze<00:03:34.000> on<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.269> heat<00:03:34.389> grant

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
and ya get a freeze on the heat grant

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.180 
and ya get a freeze on the heat grant
doesn't<00:03:34.810> matter<00:03:35.109> i<00:03:35.260> think<00:03:35.590> i<00:03:35.650> get<00:03:35.799> up<00:03:35.889> stealth

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
doesn't matter i think i get up stealth

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.670 
doesn't matter i think i get up stealth
rock<00:03:36.400> here<00:03:36.609> cuz<00:03:37.269> i<00:03:37.480> expected<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.109> roar<00:03:38.380> maybe

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
rock here cuz i expected the roar maybe

rock here cuz i expected the roar maybe
a<00:03:38.799> toxic<00:03:39.220> i<00:03:39.340> did<00:03:39.700> not<00:03:39.940> expect<00:03:40.209> flash<00:03:40.810> cannon

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
a toxic i did not expect flash cannon

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.620 
a toxic i did not expect flash cannon
though<00:03:41.410> so<00:03:41.799> that's<00:03:42.639> kind<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:43.000> fucking<00:03:43.329> weird

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
though so that's kind of fucking weird

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.599 
though so that's kind of fucking weird
but<00:03:43.870> whatever<00:03:44.650> i<00:03:44.769> guess<00:03:44.859> it<00:03:45.069> works<00:03:45.250> out<00:03:45.400> for

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
but whatever i guess it works out for

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.190 
but whatever i guess it works out for
him<00:03:45.700> because<00:03:45.850> I<00:03:46.120> think<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:46.660> might<00:03:46.720> kill<00:03:47.049> my

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
him because I think this might kill my

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.860 
him because I think this might kill my
tyranitar<00:03:47.799> so<00:03:48.489> my<00:03:48.970> tyranitar<00:03:49.540> is<00:03:49.630> gone<00:03:49.840> I

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
might Thunderbolt so druggies not really

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.260 
might Thunderbolt so druggies not really
gonna<00:05:07.830> do<00:05:08.040> too<00:05:08.190> much<00:05:08.340> anyway<00:05:08.730> because<00:05:08.880> it<00:05:09.090> has

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
gonna do too much anyway because it has

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.600 
gonna do too much anyway because it has
like<00:05:09.480> body<00:05:09.750> slam<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.200> iron<00:05:10.470> head<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.430> guess

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
like body slam and iron head and I guess

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.160 
like body slam and iron head and I guess
bodies<00:05:11.910> land<00:05:12.090> might<00:05:12.240> be<00:05:12.390> useful<00:05:12.510> against<00:05:13.080> the

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
bodies land might be useful against the

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.010 
bodies land might be useful against the
needle<00:05:13.470> king<00:05:13.680> but<00:05:14.540> whatever<00:05:15.540> I<00:05:15.690> figured

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
needle king but whatever I figured

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.110 
needle king but whatever I figured
sloper<00:05:16.410> would<00:05:16.560> be<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.710> little<00:05:16.950> more<00:05:17.130> useful<00:05:17.610> cuz

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
sloper would be a little more useful cuz

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.910 
sloper would be a little more useful cuz
it'll<00:05:18.360> do<00:05:18.480> a<00:05:18.510> lot<00:05:18.750> more<00:05:18.780> damage<00:05:19.110> at<00:05:19.410> body<00:05:19.620> slam

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
it'll do a lot more damage at body slam

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.810 
it'll do a lot more damage at body slam
I<00:05:20.100> assume<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:21.860> again<00:05:22.860> I'm<00:05:23.190> gonna<00:05:23.490> double
