00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
332nd size use these as paillettes

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.410 
332nd size use these as paillettes
the<00:02:00.110> idea<00:02:00.380> is<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:01.880> don't<00:02:02.000> have<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.240> throw

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
the idea is that you don't have to throw

the idea is that you don't have to throw
those<00:02:02.600> pieces<00:02:02.840> away<00:02:04.120> so<00:02:05.120> that's<00:02:05.240> it<00:02:05.479> very<00:02:05.659> easy

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
those pieces away so that's it very easy

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.440 
those pieces away so that's it very easy
to<00:02:06.140> use<00:02:06.350> great<00:02:06.920> heavy-duty<00:02:07.310> tool<00:02:07.670> really

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
to use great heavy-duty tool really

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.030
