00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
switcher we did a video on that a little

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.310 
switcher we did a video on that a little
earlier<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.549> that's<00:01:11.970> killed<00:01:12.330> well<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:13.049> yet

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320

almost there we go

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.929 
almost there we go
that's<00:01:15.720> killed<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.200> now<00:01:16.740> we'll<00:01:16.979> load<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.250> one

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
that's killed now now we'll load up one

password verify with touch ID and now

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.969 
password verify with touch ID and now
you<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.720> been<00:01:21.900> killed<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.799> been
