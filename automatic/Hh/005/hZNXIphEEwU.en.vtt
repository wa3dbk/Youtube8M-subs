front of my house one day bored just on
the<00:00:08.790> grass<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.299> I<00:00:09.690> wanted<00:00:09.959> something<00:00:10.340> fun<00:00:11.340> to

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
the grass and I wanted something fun to

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.760 
the grass and I wanted something fun to
do<00:00:11.549> to<00:00:11.699> occupy<00:00:11.969> my<00:00:12.240> time<00:00:12.270> and<00:00:12.719> for<00:00:13.410> some<00:00:13.529> reason

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
do to occupy my time and for some reason

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.629 
do to occupy my time and for some reason
I<00:00:13.830> thought<00:00:13.949> of<00:00:14.039> unicycling

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
I thought of unicycling

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.460 
I thought of unicycling
I<00:00:14.789> have<00:00:14.910> no<00:00:15.059> idea<00:00:15.270> why<00:00:15.510> there<00:00:15.959> is<00:00:16.049> no<00:00:16.230> like

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
I have no idea why there is no like

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.680 
I have no idea why there is no like
moment<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.430> inspiration<00:00:17.609> or<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> didn't<00:00:18.450> see<00:00:18.600> it

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
moment of inspiration or I didn't see it

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.410 
moment of inspiration or I didn't see it
anywhere<00:00:19.040> I'm<00:00:20.040> like<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.490> think<00:00:20.790> learning<00:00:21.360> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
anywhere I'm like I think learning to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.180 
anywhere I'm like I think learning to
ride<00:00:21.540> a<00:00:21.570> unicycle<00:00:21.840> would<00:00:22.260> be<00:00:22.350> fun<00:00:22.770> for<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.130> while

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
ride a unicycle would be fun for a while

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.570 
ride a unicycle would be fun for a while
and<00:00:23.850> keep<00:00:24.060> me<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> little<00:00:24.360> keeping<00:00:25.080> entertained

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
and keep me a little keeping entertained

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.910 
and keep me a little keeping entertained
so<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.610> got<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.210> shortly<00:00:27.570> after<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.020> and<00:00:28.289> I

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
so I got one shortly after that and I

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.850 
so I got one shortly after that and I
didn't<00:00:29.130> expect<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.850> take<00:00:30.300> over<00:00:30.450> my<00:00:30.660> life

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
didn't expect it to take over my life

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.810 
didn't expect it to take over my life
but<00:00:31.860> gradually<00:00:32.699> it<00:00:32.730> did<00:00:34.340> in<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> beginning<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
but gradually it did in the beginning I

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.040 
but gradually it did in the beginning I
didn't<00:00:36.060> really<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.480> was<00:00:36.600> doing<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
didn't really know what I was doing I

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.140 
didn't really know what I was doing I
would<00:00:37.410> Google<00:00:38.040> things<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.550> read<00:00:38.940> things

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
would Google things and read things

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.270 
would Google things and read things

when<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.970> get<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> unicycle<00:00:51.720> it's<00:00:52.140> really

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
when I get on a unicycle it's really

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.020 
when I get on a unicycle it's really
similar<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.829> walking<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.460> me<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.700> don't<00:00:53.790> have

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
similar to walking for me I don't have

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.090 
similar to walking for me I don't have
to<00:00:54.120> think<00:00:54.300> about<00:00:54.450> balance<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.680> go

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
to think about balance I just go

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.620 
to think about balance I just go
I'm<00:00:56.160> usually<00:00:56.730> worried<00:00:57.090> about<00:00:57.180> dodging<00:00:57.510> people

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
or like doing tricks so I wrote it on

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.540 
or like doing tricks so I wrote it on
UCLA<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.500> lot<00:01:01.710> when<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.950> was<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> school

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.450 
UCLA a lot when I was going to school
here<00:01:02.790> and<00:01:03.559> it's<00:01:04.559> actually<00:01:04.920> one<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.219> few

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
here and it's actually one of the few

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.149 
here and it's actually one of the few
situations<00:01:06.420> where<00:01:06.810> unicycling<00:01:07.319> is<00:01:07.619> kind<00:01:08.069> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
situations where unicycling is kind of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.039 
situations where unicycling is kind of
efficient<00:01:08.579> because<00:01:09.149> it's<00:01:09.630> faster<00:01:09.929> than

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
efficient because it's faster than

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.480 
efficient because it's faster than
walking<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.619> less<00:01:10.889> cumbersome<00:01:11.249> than<00:01:11.399> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
walking but it's less cumbersome than a
