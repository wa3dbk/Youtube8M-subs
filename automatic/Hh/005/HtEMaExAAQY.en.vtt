00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:15.830
 the lifetime of a mobile phone is 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.480
 sometimes short glass break after almost ten 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.610
 months what now 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.190
 I'm looking for one 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.929
 new ones on average every two years 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.060
 we buy german a new mobile phone 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.699
 Over 20 million were in the 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.550
 last year but which of the many 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.079
 comes into question 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.090
 main criterion for me the raw materials 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.340
 should be mined fair and environmentally friendly 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.500
 his and not among the dubious 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.500
 conditions that show many reports 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.420
 technically 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.170
 be quite good if it works but also 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.160
 Sustainability what to recommend for me 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.080
 i can tell you something about that 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.850
 technical stuff that nobody can say 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.110
 tell where the manufacturer came from where the 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.580
 individual devices then or which 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.290
 components are produced except at 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.240
 rp where you know that i am at foxconn 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.880
 China would be produced to me 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.750
 known no sustainable fairtrade 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.000
 Mobile phone in the store 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.040
 That can not be but maybe 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:30.789
 Other mobile phone owners know where to find me 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:32.229
 get what to understand what 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.810
 I for coffee or something in the art 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.910
 I think it was just it seems harder 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.950
 to be a fairtrade cellphone on the 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.930
 market as fairtrade coffee 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.020
 the employees of the environmental organization 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.970
 germanwatch have investigated how good the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:52.330
 production conditions of mobile phones like this 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:55.179
 complicated are fair chocolate or 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.909
 fair coffee there is a basic product 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.619
 which is used in mobile phones and are the 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.049
 30 metals alone needed 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.430
 it starts with the extraction of raw materials 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.680
 That goes beyond the production conditions 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.810
 frequently and where in asia and even if the 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.130
 Devices to electric scrap will land 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.829
 Unfortunately, she returns to the place too often 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.540
 in africa and because there too 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.370
 Heavy metal and toxic substances in it 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.620
 when you are back to the problem 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.630
 What would you recommend to me what I am 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.940
 to make this mobile phone 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.920
 Overall, it is certainly still difficult 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.690
 So that's why we say it first 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.140
 main device to use as long as 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.540
 it works and then it is just a stop 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.370
 new device soon on the market 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.400
 come what is certainly very interesting 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.350
 the so-called person 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.030
 which at least some problems too 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.319
 trying to address 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.870
 that sounds promising 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.840
 I'm on my way to the country 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.790
 Tulip coffee shops and crashed in 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.280
 amsterdam, the company sits faire 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.680
 phone that makes headlines and that 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.640
 theme fairer phones on the agenda 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:07.440
 will soon deliver the first 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:09.120
 25,000 so-called fair funds from us 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.489
 are an initiative in the kongo 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.019
 joined and received two of our 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.200
 metals from certified 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.099
 conflict-free mines but the other 28 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.420
 metals 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.519
 since we can not get the origin 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.230
 determine the problem in the industry 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.940
 is tracing that at the moment 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.959
 of metals to the origin so 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.959
 has become difficult 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.640
 in the end so completely fair or 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.640
 Not 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.959
 I do not think so at the moment 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.150
 something like a fair phone at all 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.819
 just because you can not get the metals 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.250
 can trace back and what is one 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.810
 fair phone at all so no me 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.760
 would not say that our cellphone 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.200
 it's just the fair phone 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.329
 first step a procedure that 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.709
 somehow none is better then 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.680
 back to Berlin 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.430
 without a new mobile phone, search for it 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.430
 is enough for me now 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.240
 the solution instead of a new mobile phone 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.030
 just a new glass that is 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.830
 environmentally friendly fair and with 70 euro 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:26.870
 even comparatively cheap that 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:29.970
 times even a works great 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.900
 After two days running around works 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.270
 my mobile again 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.580
 hopefully it will stop for a while 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.210
 a really fair mobile phone I can probably 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.210
 wait a long time
