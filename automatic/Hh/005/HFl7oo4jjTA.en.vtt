the<00:00:04.259> new<00:00:04.819> 2014<00:00:05.819> crush<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.779> major<00:00:07.290> thing<00:00:07.680> about

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
the new 2014 crush the major thing about

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.810 
the new 2014 crush the major thing about
the<00:00:08.519> board<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:10.469> when<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:10.980> was<00:00:11.490> asked<00:00:11.790> to

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
the board is that when I was asked to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.910 
the board is that when I was asked to
design<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.360> what<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.719> really<00:00:13.080> wanted<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.380> do<00:00:13.620> was

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
design it what I really wanted to do was

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.760 
design it what I really wanted to do was
I<00:00:14.099> wanted<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.700> try<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.000> accomplish<00:00:15.560> getting<00:00:16.560> a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
I wanted to try to accomplish getting a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.349 
I wanted to try to accomplish getting a
board<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.100> works<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> beginner<00:00:18.060> rider

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
board that works for the beginner rider

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.240 
board that works for the beginner rider
but<00:00:18.840> also<00:00:19.020> getting<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.529> board<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.830> worked<00:00:20.100> for

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
but also getting a board that worked for

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.590 
but also getting a board that worked for
the<00:00:20.369> advanced<00:00:20.699> rider<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.300> there<00:00:21.510> really

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
the advanced rider and there really

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.179 
the advanced rider and there really
hasn't<00:00:21.930> been<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.230> board<00:00:22.529> that's<00:00:22.650> been<00:00:22.890> able<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
hasn't been a board that's been able to

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.730 
hasn't been a board that's been able to
do<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.570> so<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> heel<00:00:25.019> side<00:00:25.230> edge<00:00:25.260> what

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
do that so on a heel side edge what

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.200 
do that so on a heel side edge what
you're<00:00:25.859> doing<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.189> you're<00:00:26.220> sitting<00:00:26.789> back

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
you're doing is you're sitting back

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.269 
you're doing is you're sitting back
against<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> boat<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> toe<00:00:29.039> side

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
against the boat but on the toe side

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.640 
against the boat but on the toe side
edge<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.119> cross<00:00:30.510> our<00:00:30.840> feet<00:00:31.109> over<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
edge we have to cross our feet over and

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.410 
edge we have to cross our feet over and
lean<00:00:31.920> against<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.460> line<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.940> we're<00:00:33.059> not<00:00:33.180> by

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
lean against the line and we're not by

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330 
lean against the line and we're not by
mechanically<00:00:34.020> correct<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.860> hard<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.309> us

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
mechanically correct so it's hard for us

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.250 
mechanically correct so it's hard for us
to<00:00:35.399> deal<00:00:35.610> with<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> forces<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> wanted<00:00:37.200> to

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
to deal with the forces what I wanted to

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.690 
to deal with the forces what I wanted to
do<00:00:37.500> would<00:00:37.680> come<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> design<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
do would come up with a design that

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.209 
do would come up with a design that
allowed<00:00:39.329> us<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.629> stand<00:00:40.110> more<00:00:40.440> by<00:00:40.680> mechanically

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
allowed us to stand more by mechanically

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.280 
allowed us to stand more by mechanically
correct<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> toe<00:00:42.660> side<00:00:42.870> edge<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
correct so on the toe side edge of the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.010 
correct so on the toe side edge of the
board<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.980> longer<00:00:44.370> deeper<00:00:45.120> fin<00:00:45.390> that's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
board we have a longer deeper fin that's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.779 
board we have a longer deeper fin that's
off<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> side<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.070> board<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.640> that

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
off to the side of the board but that

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.400 
off to the side of the board but that
does<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.180> allows<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.600> hold<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:49.050> toe<00:00:49.200> side

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
does it allows you to hold your toe side

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.200 
does it allows you to hold your toe side
edge<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.620> lot<00:00:49.860> easier<00:00:50.039> keeps<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.820> board<00:00:51.030> true

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
edge a lot easier keeps the board true

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.630 
edge a lot easier keeps the board true
off<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> wake<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.289> heel<00:00:52.559> side<00:00:52.770> edge<00:00:52.800> we

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
off the wake on the heel side edge we

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.639 
off the wake on the heel side edge we
have<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> shallower<00:00:54.390> fin<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.079> still<00:00:55.350> gives<00:00:55.379> us

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
have a shallower fin that still gives us

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.099 
have a shallower fin that still gives us
a<00:00:55.770> track<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> allows<00:00:57.120> us<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> pre<00:00:57.660> turn<00:00:57.870> on

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
a track but it allows us to pre turn on

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.410 
a track but it allows us to pre turn on
spinning<00:00:58.469> tricks<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.859> our<00:00:59.430> heel<00:00:59.640> side<00:00:59.850> edge<00:00:59.879> we

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
spinning tricks on our heel side edge we

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.569 
spinning tricks on our heel side edge we
have<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> steeper<00:01:01.260> sidewall<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
have a steeper sidewall and what that

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.399 
have a steeper sidewall and what that
does<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.270> allows<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.809> board<00:01:04.049> carried

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
does is it allows the board carried

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.770 
does is it allows the board carried
speed<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> little<00:01:04.920> better<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.369> tracks<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.270> our

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
speed a little better and tracks on our

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.570 
speed a little better and tracks on our
toe<00:01:07.080> side<00:01:07.320> edge<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> more<00:01:08.130> relieved

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
toe side edge we have a more relieved

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.000 
toe side edge we have a more relieved
top<00:01:08.939> edge<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.810> allows<00:01:10.110> us<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.590> hold<00:01:10.860> our

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
top edge and that allows us to hold our

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.850 
top edge and that allows us to hold our
edge<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.400> less<00:01:11.640> effort<00:01:12.049> on<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.530> center<00:01:13.830> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
edge with less effort on the center of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.200 
edge with less effort on the center of
the<00:01:14.010> board<00:01:14.189> what<00:01:14.400> we<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.790> more<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the board what we have is more of a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.600 
the board what we have is more of a
rounded<00:01:15.509> bottom<00:01:16.409> edge<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.400> does

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
rounded bottom edge and what that does

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.030 
rounded bottom edge and what that does
is<00:01:17.670> allows<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.360> board<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> transition<00:01:19.439> so

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
is allows the board to transition so

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.530 
is allows the board to transition so
when<00:01:20.220> you're<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.670> from<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.150> edge<00:01:21.330> to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
when you're going from one edge to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.850 
when you're going from one edge to
another<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.020> your<00:01:22.140> board<00:01:22.380> has<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.680> pass

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
another and your board has to pass

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.710 
another and your board has to pass
underneath<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> transition<00:01:24.270> smoother

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
underneath you a transition smoother

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.080 
underneath you a transition smoother
under<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.549> think<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> best<00:01:26.850> way<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
under you I think the best way to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.609 
under you I think the best way to
describe<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.659> rocker<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.500> were

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
describe this rocker is what we were

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.929 
describe this rocker is what we were
looking<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.250> where<00:01:29.430> you're<00:01:29.520> looking<00:01:29.790> for

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
looking for is where you're looking for

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.270 
looking for is where you're looking for
stability<00:01:30.119> we're<00:01:31.020> looking<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.470> low<00:01:31.590> drag<00:01:31.920> but

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
stability we're looking for low drag but

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.950 
stability we're looking for low drag but
we<00:01:32.400> were<00:01:32.549> looking<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.060> good<00:01:33.299> pop<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
we were looking for a good pop a
