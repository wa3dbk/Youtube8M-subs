images<00:00:47.420> gonna<00:00:48.420> start<00:00:48.719> first<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.200> your

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
images gonna start first with your

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.639 
images gonna start first with your
triangle<00:00:50.149> you<00:00:51.149> make<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.570> cross<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:52.469> you

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
triangle you make a cross and then you

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.110 
triangle you make a cross and then you
drop<00:00:52.920> two<00:00:53.250> lines<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:54.199> from<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> center<00:00:55.680> line

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
drop two lines down from the center line

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.020 
drop two lines down from the center line
join<00:00:57.120> them<00:00:57.270> together<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.930> highlight<00:00:58.379> them

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
join them together and highlight them

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.959 
join them together and highlight them
I'm<00:01:00.030> now<00:01:00.570> highlighting<00:01:01.199> each<00:01:01.289> corner<00:01:01.969> I'm

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
I'm now highlighting each corner I'm

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.759 
I'm now highlighting each corner I'm
gonna<00:01:03.120> try<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> different<00:01:03.600> type<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.170> triangle

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
gonna try a different type of triangle

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.250 
gonna try a different type of triangle
by<00:01:04.979> drawing<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:06.020> diamond<00:01:07.020> shape<00:01:08.840> train<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.960> dot

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
by drawing a diamond shape train a dot

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.920 
by drawing a diamond shape train a dot
and<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:11.220> drawing<00:01:11.549> three<00:01:12.119> lines<00:01:12.360> connect<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
and then drawing three lines connect it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.340 
and then drawing three lines connect it
to<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> dot<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.490> highlight<00:01:15.170> areas<00:01:16.170> they

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to the dot in a highlight areas they

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.260 
to the dot in a highlight areas they
don't<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.770> keep<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.610> focus<00:01:18.060> on

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
don't want to keep and focus on

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.100 
don't want to keep and focus on
highlighting<00:01:21.270> my<00:01:21.540> corners<00:01:23.750> now<00:01:24.750> I'm<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
highlighting my corners now I'm going to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.780 
highlighting my corners now I'm going to
do<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.530> more<00:01:26.240> 3d<00:01:27.240> triangle<00:01:31.220> this<00:01:32.220> time<00:01:32.579> you're

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
do one more 3d triangle this time you're

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.990 
do one more 3d triangle this time you're
doing<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.200> v-shape<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.530> base<00:01:34.770> making<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.759> dot

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
doing the v-shape for base making a dot

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.289 
doing the v-shape for base making a dot
and<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:36.869> drawing<00:01:37.200> three<00:01:37.590> lines<00:01:38.090> coming<00:01:39.090> off

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and then drawing three lines coming off

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
and then drawing three lines coming off
the<00:01:39.450> dot<00:01:39.890> now<00:01:40.890> I'm<00:01:41.070> highlighting<00:01:41.490> my

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the dot now I'm highlighting my

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.670 
the dot now I'm highlighting my
coordinates<00:01:42.270> once<00:01:42.479> again<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.590> you

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
coordinates once again and there you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.840 
coordinates once again and there you
have<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.000> next<00:01:45.000> I'm<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.509> draw<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> square

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
have it next I'm going to draw a square

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.530 
have it next I'm going to draw a square
so<00:01:47.850> drawing<00:01:48.329> four<00:01:48.689> lines<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.229> equal<00:01:49.380> length

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
so drawing four lines of equal length

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.520 
so drawing four lines of equal length
dropping<00:01:51.540> them<00:01:51.659> down<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.079> joining<00:01:52.350> them

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
dropping them down and joining them

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.899 
dropping them down and joining them
together<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.460> then<00:01:53.850> highlighting<00:01:54.479> them<00:01:55.909> now

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
together and then highlighting them now

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.030 
together and then highlighting them now
going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> demonstrate<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.930> three<00:01:58.439> dimensional

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
going to demonstrate a three dimensional

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.590 
going to demonstrate a three dimensional
square<00:01:59.630> it's<00:02:00.630> we're<00:02:00.840> using<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.259> diamond<00:02:01.500> shape

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
square it's we're using a diamond shape

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.289 
square it's we're using a diamond shape
you<00:02:03.600> draw<00:02:03.840> three<00:02:04.200> lines<00:02:04.430> parallel<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:06.149> one

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
you draw three lines parallel to one

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.420 
you draw three lines parallel to one
another<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.459> then<00:02:08.459> connect<00:02:08.819> them<00:02:10.220> then<00:02:11.220> you

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
another and then connect them then you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.180 
another and then connect them then you
highlight<00:02:11.910> your<00:02:12.090> corners

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
highlight your corners

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.260 
highlight your corners
highlighting<00:02:15.190> makes<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.640> difference<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.240> makes

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
highlighting makes a difference it makes

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.500 
highlighting makes a difference it makes
it<00:02:16.630> drawing<00:02:17.050> more<00:02:17.920> realistic<00:02:18.520> okay<00:02:19.360> you're

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
it drawing more realistic okay you're

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.620 
it drawing more realistic okay you're
doing<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.840> circle<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.390> plain

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
doing a circle this is just a plain

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:30.570 
doing a circle this is just a plain
circle<00:02:23.140> highlighting<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.830> edges<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:29.580> then

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
circle highlighting the edges and then

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.310 
circle highlighting the edges and then
you<00:02:30.670> have<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:31.030> now<00:02:31.840> we're<00:02:31.990> going<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.140> do<00:02:32.290> a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
you have it now we're going to do a

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.570 
you have it now we're going to do a
curve<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:35.620> for<00:02:36.160> an<00:02:36.670> oval<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.710> will<00:02:38.920> circle

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
curve in for an oval and I will circle

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.260 
curve in for an oval and I will circle
I<00:02:40.170> used<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.290> line<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.740> begin<00:02:41.890> with<00:02:42.190> then<00:02:43.150> I

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
I used to line to begin with then I

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.200 
I used to line to begin with then I
created<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.810> curve<00:02:44.340> then<00:02:45.340> I've<00:02:45.490> created<00:02:46.000> a

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
created a curve then I've created a

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.640 
created a curve then I've created a
curve<00:02:46.480> with<00:02:46.810> both<00:02:47.260> sides<00:02:48.420> making<00:02:49.420> my<00:02:49.690> eyeball

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
you know highlight my curves so then you

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.860 
you know highlight my curves so then you
can<00:05:18.510> see<00:05:18.720> just<00:05:19.200> where<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.590> wheel<00:05:19.770> is<00:05:20.870> now

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870
