00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.440
 Hello friends today with you and me 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:21.450
 another lesson on movement and penetration with 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.910
 various rags today we will analyze 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.260
 penetrations with turkish beads we all know 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:34.480
 rocking with you 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.790
 shaking kachalochku and here on these shaking 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.980
 rocked glasses we can climb socks 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:45.160
 do it on the toes and can add 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.350
 kicking date and moving around 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:54.280
 very very nice little steps 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.500
 this shaking call Turkish beads and here 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.469
 already with this Turkish beads we can 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.000
 do the most diverse 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.160
 penetrations 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.350
 create a drawing of dance let's now 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.160
 let's see what we can do and so we 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.340
 with you we are making Turkish beads on the steps 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.380
 you can turn right right only 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.170
 body and hands hold 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.470
 only ours is turning down from the waist 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.640
 hips and legs body and head in place 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.400
 one two three four another side five 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.350
 six seven eight times two three 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.830
 this is the first movement the second movement 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:41.079
 which can make this turn around 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.979
 yourself get up on the floor fingers and shaking 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.869
 quickly and quickly with buckets we make beads and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.420
 turning around it is clear that 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.380
 You can impose a snake with hands you need 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:57.899
 you can turn the other side up 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.340
 handles on the turn nice to lower 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.290
 some kind of head tilt up to what are you 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.280
 diversify express your 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.620
 individuality 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.630
 example raising 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:14.090
 cant turn around show ourselves 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.610
 so what else can you do 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.560
 just walk and side to side 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:25.459
 for example the same snake hands 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:28.940
 we go to the right then we go to the left that is 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.890
 we are moving not just on 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.760
 the spot before it turns around its axis 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.800
 and you can move on the same steps 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.810
 when we move we can do 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.110
 any size circle around the scene and so well 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.110
 eg 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:53.480
 vintage on stage and we have gone 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.520
 some kind of long board yes so pretty 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.310
 monotonous under which you need to do 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.989
 some kind of long shaking drift on 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.860
 shaking so here we use this 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:10.519
 Turkish beads can get around them big 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:13.100
 circle on stage in any size of course 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:18.320
 maybe this circle is what you want 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.840
 what music goes here 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.190
 here you can still apply such a bundle 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.610
 when we did a circle around the scene of course 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.500
 will music dictate under 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.720
 we go we go we made a circle and then 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.290
 immediately this big circle is moving 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:41.890
 small circle around 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:45.760
 an example like this is a simpler option here 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.890
 so natural 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.310
 it all depends on your desire on your 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.500
 individuality can any hands up 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.349
 apply interesting here let 's say you 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.909
 send us pens moving on the snake 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:06.489
 need to raise up to make full all 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:09.099
 just just now 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.349
 show for training here pens 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.950
 for example, can follow such a trajectory 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:18.190
 it goes down 2 rises to such 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.160
 way but try with all the same 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.789
 strongly hands do not fade so as not to 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.310
 distract the viewer's attention exactly 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:29.520
 nuclear shaking just the same it is very 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.580
 greatly fascinates the viewer when 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:37.530
 a beaded skirt novels just here 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.060
 on this fun shakes everything plays 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.910
 Of course, viewers like it very much. 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.840
 very much 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.720
 here so train and by the way 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.580
 some pretty hard on this one 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.419
 penetrations keep thighs moving 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:59.650
 please pay more attention 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:03.250
 exactly the movement of the hips is very good 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:07.690
 by the way coaches many then sinking not 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.870
 becoming strong and enduring and mean 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.310
 what problem is there still? 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.580
 problem of very big steps 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.220
 that is somewhere here well here so here 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.130
 there we start to make something big 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.410
 steps here legs stand to each other very 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.889
 close and nice little steps 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.050
 make small small small so then 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:36.460
 then this 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:37.900
 relaxed and move beautifully yes 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.970
 the main thing is to relax and get 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.479
 dance pleasure 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.820
 Well then, learn to drive, I wish you 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.200
 good luck saying goodbye to you next 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.710
 video 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.710
 until
