00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.760 

it's<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> bending<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.060> these<00:01:24.960> double<00:01:25.530> stops

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it's the bending of these double stops

it's the bending of these double stops
here<00:01:26.160> on<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> seventh<00:01:26.970> fret<00:01:28.760> there's<00:01:29.760> a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790

couple<00:01:30.120> of<00:01:30.240> ways<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.630> execute<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:32.010> just

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
couple of ways to execute then I just

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.720 
couple of ways to execute then I just
borrow<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.870> my<00:01:34.050> third<00:01:34.320> finger<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.950> pull

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
borrow with my third finger and pull

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.750 
borrow with my third finger and pull
down<00:01:35.970> towards<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> floor

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.219 

there<00:01:40.760> gives<00:01:41.000> me<00:01:41.150> kind<00:01:41.299> of<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.570> half<00:01:41.780> note<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.049> a

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
there gives me kind of a half note and a

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.359 
there gives me kind of a half note and a
quarter<00:01:42.619> note<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:43.159> a<00:01:43.310> band<00:01:43.580> it's<00:01:44.240> not<00:01:44.930> really

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
quarter note of a band it's not really

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.040 
quarter note of a band it's not really
precisely<00:01:46.369> in<00:01:46.700> tune<00:01:46.970> that<00:01:47.330> gives<00:01:47.540> us<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.869> kind

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
precisely in tune that gives us the kind

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.590 
precisely in tune that gives us the kind
of<00:01:48.430> rawness<00:01:51.400> you<00:01:52.400> could<00:01:52.670> for<00:01:52.880> example<00:01:53.479> we

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
of rawness you could for example we

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.550 
of rawness you could for example we
place<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.979> Bart<00:01:55.250> third<00:01:55.759> finger<00:01:56.119> with

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
place the the Bart third finger with

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.660 
place the the Bart third finger with
placing<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.650> third<00:01:57.860> and<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.070> fourth<00:01:58.250> finger

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
placing the third and the fourth finger

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.930 
placing the third and the fourth finger
and<00:01:58.850> pushing<00:01:59.840> up<00:02:03.280> which<00:02:04.280> gives<00:02:04.580> it<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.759> more

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
and pushing up which gives it a more

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.250 
and pushing up which gives it a more
into<00:02:05.450> more<00:02:05.690> controlled<00:02:06.110> field

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.580 

but<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.290> kind<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.620> like<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.070> more<00:02:14.140> raw<00:02:15.140> feel

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
but I kind of like the the more raw feel

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:24.130 
but I kind of like the the more raw feel
of<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:16.400> using<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.120> part<00:02:17.360> finger<00:02:23.140> and

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
of just using the part finger and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.330 
of just using the part finger and
pulling<00:02:24.440> down<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:24.890> can<00:02:25.070> hear<00:02:25.220> the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
pulling down so you can hear the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.470 
pulling down so you can hear the
difference<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:26.000> kind<00:02:26.210> of<00:02:28.180> kind<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.270> raw

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
difference this kind of kind of raw

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.670 
difference this kind of kind of raw
sound<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:31.430> nice

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.020 

you<00:02:39.680> should<00:02:39.830> practice<00:02:39.980> both<00:02:40.400> obviously

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
you should practice both obviously

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.390 
you should practice both obviously
because<00:02:42.020> depending<00:02:42.380> on<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.709> situation<00:02:43.220> if

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
because depending on the situation if

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.030 
because depending on the situation if
you<00:02:43.520> want<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.790> be<00:02:43.910> kind<00:02:44.600> of<00:02:44.630> really<00:02:45.080> clean<00:02:45.440> then

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
you want to be kind of really clean then

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.440 
you want to be kind of really clean then
you<00:02:46.250> might<00:02:46.400> want<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.640> use<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.880> third<00:02:47.120> and

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
you might want to use the third and

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.300 
you might want to use the third and
fourth<00:02:48.020> thicker<00:02:48.319> pen<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.950> want<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.190> be<00:02:52.280> a

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
fourth thicker pen you want to be a

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.860 
fourth thicker pen you want to be a
little<00:02:52.580> bit<00:02:52.670> dirty<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:57.590> may<00:02:57.740> want<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.160> use<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
little bit dirty you may want to use the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.080 
little bit dirty you may want to use the
third<00:02:59.870> finger<00:03:00.050> bar<00:03:00.380> thing<00:03:00.590> obviously<00:03:01.400> also

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
third finger bar thing obviously also

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:11.140 
third finger bar thing obviously also
practice<00:03:02.420> up<00:03:02.600> here<00:03:03.140> just<00:03:09.610> 1234<00:03:10.610> even<00:03:11.030> more

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
practice up here just 1234 even more

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.210 
practice up here just 1234 even more
aggressive<00:03:11.510> sound<00:03:11.660> okay<00:03:12.350> so<00:03:12.380> that<00:03:12.830> was<00:03:12.980> leaked

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
aggressive sound okay so that was leaked

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.550 
aggressive sound okay so that was leaked
