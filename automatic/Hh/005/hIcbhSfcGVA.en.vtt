00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.359
 driver for valle lines the newest edition of drive and got back on track 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.160
 valuing the fundamental mechanics of the series c which is the direction of vehicles 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.120
 the reproduction of the city is with the fran who is one of the pioneers who 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.640
 shows quite faithful the tricolor for the mainz 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.020
 but again the classic mechanics of completing missions on board vehicles 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.669
 in a huge city in the new york case 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.480
 the progression of the game is with the primary missions 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.630
 started with the player moves to a certain point on the map 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.220
 but it is also a series of non-mandatory alternative targets that do not 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.370
 rewards how the money was spent the protagonist has changed the officer has left 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.370
 in mind who was the main character of the previous three editions 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.499
 and enter 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.389
 a young talented flyer who lives to transport all kinds of criminal 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.110
 the streets of big apple 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.120
 this beginning well sums up how the lions functioned or is a part of the 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.630
 game 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.050
 you are forced to run fast and sew by the chaotic 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.869
 City 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.840
 often chased by police officers beyond the main streets the screams 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.310
 can also be used to cut path 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.660
 or mislead the forces of law 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.360
 now you can modify your car did not signal the player to change 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.510
 appearance improves its performance making a series of 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.430
 changes it is also possible to 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.880
 making your chip clean is very much like the first 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.610
 episode 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.920
 the difficulty for him still quite high 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.190
 you will often have to deal with the heavy traffic and patrol of 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.280
 cops 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.479
 any infraction seen by them 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.100
 will result in persecution 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.009
 Happily the artificial intelligence of men of the law is not the best 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.640
 Well, just post a little bit 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.630
 or enter a 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.580
 to get rid of them easily 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.860
 Of course, when the situation starts to weigh, swat 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.280
 even helicopters 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.900
 there is a dangerous level for cars and another for the character in 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.599
 yes 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.789
 crimes committed within the vehicle 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.049
 as accidents 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.999
 run over and speed over cause the car to be searched for 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.559
 by the police 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:23.849
 in which case this exchange of vehicles for the agents to stop pestering 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.010
 but the guilt will be transferred to the character 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.839
 if a police officer pivot 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:35.319
 In this case they start looking for their own in any car that 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.389
 he is 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:42.309
 The difficulty of the dm also stems from the controls of the physical simulation 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:46.449
 commands respond well but driving the cars can be a little tricky on 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:47.930
 parallel lines driver 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.309
 especially in curves 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:54.760
 is one of those titles that required a good training time to be able to master all 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.379
 the actions of the positions 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.810
 lion only accepts only two types of players 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.700
 we of course with 11 racing games with those who have high 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.749
 tolerance for frustrations 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:09.909
 and repetition and repetition try to memorize all the details of the mission 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.749
 how and how to anticipate the hazards 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.999
 already for the mainz already decreased the number of cities but the area covered 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:24.699
 is larger than its predecessor with more than 360 kilometers of pistes 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.509
 according to the producer 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:31.339
 more than reproducing new york the map has more life as sellers and 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:34.129
 more interactive passersby 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.570
 poles and during newspaper debates for example 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.969
 are destructible beyond several obstacles 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.259
 like barrels and all kinds of dirt that remain in vehicles 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.530
 in poorer neighborhoods for example 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.340
 to papers scattered on the floor and vouho when cars pass by 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.189
 the physics system is evident in accidents depending on the force and how 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.490
 the vehicles collided 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.180
 the result is different 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.869
 and may even have a lump 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:07.119
 the destruction of vehicles is not as complex as one might expect 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:12.259
 but even simpler they leave the most flashy accidents 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:16.309
 The variety of vehicles is even greater if the 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:19.439
 models from the two eras present in Kenya 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:25.999
 The soundtrack also reflects the two epochs portrayed in the 1978 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:30.490
 compositions and includes artists such as beard mustache bowen and tram 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.719
 mixing different styles 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:36.599
 as a vote of 70 1,300 singles already in the contemporary part 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.320
 the musical selection brings many names from the independent scene as kaiser chiefs and 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.350
 today to ideas beyond the brook all so that m 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.830
 the most evident sound effects are those of the cars each model has different 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.249
 fluids to your 'engine' 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:56.259
 which shows the care of the producer with the main theme of drivers 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:01.400
 parallel mcp makes its origins 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.449
 focusing more on the actions on board cars the decision is agreed two of the 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.790
 moments happen in the direction of vehicles because even the character 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.259
 still bad 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.550
 Despite this, the high difficulty of monotony makes the game not 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.839
 I like so many people 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:24.719
 if you are good at driving games or are tolerant of repetitions it may be that 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:27.270
 find good hours of fun 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.030
 peace 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.030
 a student 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.900
 Bernardo 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.900
 manaus - the government of venezuela 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.569
 besides the saints told 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.449
 But never mind. 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.050
 I'm going back because I love you budgets. 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.139
 lula da silva 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.379
 per 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.699
 be the first we respect very much our team was well structured 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.849
 the challenges 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.240
 psoriasis 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.919
 so here we go 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.879
 by the decision of the government its destiny is our home
