through<00:00:24.119> both<00:00:24.359> walls

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.760 

we<00:00:31.939> have<00:00:32.150> to<00:00:32.270> keep<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.599> cool<00:00:32.840> flowing<00:00:33.500> on<00:00:33.620> this

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
we have to keep the cool flowing on this

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.920 
we have to keep the cool flowing on this
just<00:00:34.040> because<00:00:34.309> of<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:34.520> material<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:35.690> then

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
just because of the material and then

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.540 
just because of the material and then
heat<00:00:36.140> that's<00:00:36.320> being<00:00:36.440> generated

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.369 

otherwise<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:40.760> Basilio<00:00:41.300> definitely<00:00:42.170> work

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
otherwise the Basilio definitely work

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.260 
otherwise the Basilio definitely work
hard<00:00:43.000> and<00:00:44.000> you<00:00:44.739> instantly<00:00:45.790> dull<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:47.000> drill

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
hard and you instantly dull the drill

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.729 
hard and you instantly dull the drill
bit<00:00:47.420> out<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:49.100> seems<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:49.460> work<00:00:49.489> pretty<00:00:49.640> good

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
bit out it seems to work pretty good

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.890 
bit out it seems to work pretty good
there's<00:00:51.739> a<00:00:51.800> slight<00:00:52.160> there's<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.120> slight<00:00:53.449> raise

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
there's a slight there's a slight raise

there's a slight there's a slight raise
on<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.170> surfaced<00:00:55.720> internally<00:00:56.720> it's<00:00:57.620> pretty

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
on the surfaced internally it's pretty

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.490 
on the surfaced internally it's pretty
clean<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:59.330> birds<00:00:59.629> have<00:00:59.839> been<00:00:59.960> greatly

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
clean the the birds have been greatly

clean the the birds have been greatly
reduced<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.160> breakout<00:01:01.550> on<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.790> extra<00:01:02.030> side

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
reduced the breakout on the extra side

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.939 
reduced the breakout on the extra side
of<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.390> drill<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:02.780> that's<00:01:03.409> just<00:01:03.589> a<00:01:03.680> matter<00:01:03.860> of

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
of the drill and that's just a matter of

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.229 
of the drill and that's just a matter of
the<00:01:04.129> speed<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:04.580> we're<00:01:04.699> getting<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.030> feed

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
the speed and we're getting the feed

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:13.950 
the speed and we're getting the feed
match<00:01:05.479> rate

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.540 

and<00:01:14.960> this<00:01:15.110> is<00:01:15.260> only<00:01:15.380> a<00:01:15.530> you<00:01:15.800> know<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.220> isn't

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
and this is only a you know this isn't

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.660 
and this is only a you know this isn't
the<00:01:16.700> perfect<00:01:17.530> test<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.800> there's<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.400> little

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
the perfect test and there's a little

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.260 
the perfect test and there's a little
bite<00:01:19.850> bit<00:01:20.480> of<00:01:20.600> vibration<00:01:21.170> in<00:01:21.290> it<00:01:21.410> but<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:23.090> can

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
bite bit of vibration in it but you can

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.340 
bite bit of vibration in it but you can
see<00:01:23.450> here<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.770> holes<00:01:24.980> are<00:01:25.220> directly<00:01:25.880> through

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
see here the holes are directly through

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.480 
see here the holes are directly through
it's<00:01:27.350> hard<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:27.770> probably<00:01:28.040> hard<00:01:28.160> to<00:01:28.190> see<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:28.430> a

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
it's hard to probably hard to see in a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.600 
it's hard to probably hard to see in a
video<00:01:28.760> but<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.740> breakout<00:01:30.740> on<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.040> exit<00:01:31.400> side

video but the breakout on the exit side

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.350 
video but the breakout on the exit side
of<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.790> holes<00:01:32.000> as<00:01:32.930> compared<00:01:33.410> to<00:01:33.530> before<00:01:33.619> is

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
of the holes as compared to before is

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.980 
of the holes as compared to before is
drastically<00:01:35.360> improved<00:01:37.900> and<00:01:38.900> we<00:01:39.619> also<00:01:40.990> see

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
drastically improved and we also see

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.440 
drastically improved and we also see
where<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.440> tabs<00:01:42.710> on<00:01:42.950> here<00:01:44.290> we<00:01:45.290> also<00:01:45.470> did<00:01:46.009> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
where the tabs on here we also did the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.999 
where the tabs on here we also did the
5/16<00:01:47.450> 18<00:01:49.119> tapped<00:01:50.119> holes<00:01:50.360> with<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
5/16 18 tapped holes with the

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.960 
5/16 18 tapped holes with the
accomodations<00:01:52.009> rollin<00:01:52.250> tap<00:01:52.430> or<00:01:52.640> known<00:01:52.790> as<00:01:52.820> a

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
accomodations rollin tap or known as a

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.080 
accomodations rollin tap or known as a
drap<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:54.950> worked<00:01:55.160> out<00:01:55.310> pretty<00:01:55.490> well<00:01:55.610> I

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
drap and that worked out pretty well I

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.020 
drap and that worked out pretty well I
think<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:57.440> know<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.950> breakout<00:01:58.729> on<00:01:58.880> the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
think you know the breakout on the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.840 
think you know the breakout on the
inside<00:01:59.869> is<00:02:00.140> very<00:02:00.380> minimal<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:01.430> tapped<00:02:01.700> holes

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
inside is very minimal the tapped holes

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.780 
inside is very minimal the tapped holes
are<00:02:02.119> pretty<00:02:02.240> good<00:02:02.540> I<00:02:03.470> guess<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.250> main<00:02:04.399> concern

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
are pretty good I guess the main concern

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.380 
are pretty good I guess the main concern
is<00:02:04.970> now<00:02:05.149> just<00:02:06.160> with<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.310> back<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.149> drilled

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
is now just with the back to the drilled

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.840 
is now just with the back to the drilled
holes<00:02:08.600> again<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:09.800> know<00:02:09.890> what<00:02:10.160> can<00:02:10.429> we<00:02:10.640> live

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
holes again you know what can we live

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.170 
holes again you know what can we live
with<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.920> do<00:02:12.920> we<00:02:13.070> need<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.459> address<00:02:13.760> this

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
with and do we need to address this

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.520 
with and do we need to address this
slight<00:02:14.510> raise<00:02:14.840> on<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.170> surface<00:02:16.720> both<00:02:17.720> on<00:02:18.320> the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
slight raise on the surface both on the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.500 
slight raise on the surface both on the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.100 
entrance and the exit side of the hole
just<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:22.430> know<00:02:22.610> maybe<00:02:23.600> what<00:02:23.840> we<00:02:23.930> should

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
just you know maybe what we should

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.770 
just you know maybe what we should
consider<00:02:24.380> is<00:02:24.620> putting<00:02:24.950> getting<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.820> drill<00:02:26.120> with

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
consider is putting getting a drill with

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.020 
consider is putting getting a drill with
like<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:26.989> slight<00:02:27.320> champing<00:02:28.250> or<00:02:28.370> devouring<00:02:28.820> toll

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
like a slight champing or devouring toll

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.509 
like a slight champing or devouring toll
on<00:02:29.269> it<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.630> then<00:02:30.560> maybe<00:02:30.769> on<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.100> opposite

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
on it and then maybe on the opposite

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.229 
on it and then maybe on the opposite
side<00:02:31.730> we<00:02:31.940> can<00:02:32.090> put<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:32.420> two<00:02:33.019> 250<00:02:33.410> drill<00:02:33.830> unit

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
side we can put the two 250 drill unit

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.580 
side we can put the two 250 drill unit
which<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:36.010> shown<00:02:37.010> next<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.810> okay<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.049> then

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
which is shown next to it okay and then

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.930 
which is shown next to it okay and then
maybe<00:02:39.739> what<00:02:40.010> we<00:02:40.130> can<00:02:40.250> do<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.549> make<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.880> a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
maybe what we can do is make that a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.670 
maybe what we can do is make that a
short-stroke<00:02:41.510> inch<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.959> half<00:02:41.989> stroke<00:02:42.440> and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
short-stroke inch and a half stroke and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.130 
short-stroke inch and a half stroke and
put<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.580> chamfering<00:02:44.030> tool<00:02:44.239> directly<00:02:44.720> into<00:02:44.989> it

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
put the chamfering tool directly into it

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.110 
put the chamfering tool directly into it
just<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.380> go<00:02:45.530> up<00:02:45.620> just<00:02:45.950> touch<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.910> surface

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
just to go up just touch the surface

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.449 
just to go up just touch the surface
break<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:47.780> sharp<00:02:48.080> edge<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.739> come<00:02:49.040> back<00:02:49.190> out

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
break that sharp edge and come back out

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.229 
break that sharp edge and come back out
and<00:02:49.700> then<00:02:50.269> what<00:02:50.690> we<00:02:50.780> can<00:02:50.930> do<00:02:51.110> on<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:52.239> drill

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
and then what we can do on the drill

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.090 
and then what we can do on the drill
itself<00:02:53.360> is<00:02:53.810> maybe<00:02:54.170> do<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.470> same<00:02:54.680> thing<00:02:54.920> get

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
itself is maybe do the same thing get

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.130 
itself is maybe do the same thing get
the<00:02:55.190> drill<00:02:55.400> in<00:02:55.549> combination<00:02:56.110> chamfer<00:02:57.110> and

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
the drill in combination chamfer and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.620 
the drill in combination chamfer and
debarring<00:02:57.620> toilet<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.070> maybe<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:59.030> will<00:02:59.269> you

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
debarring toilet and maybe that will you

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.240 
debarring toilet and maybe that will you
know<00:02:59.750> just<00:03:00.049> make<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.260> clean<00:03:00.799> hole<00:03:01.070> without

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
know just make a clean hole without

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.380 
know just make a clean hole without
having<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.760> do<00:03:01.910> anything<00:03:02.180> else<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.690> it

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
having to do anything else to it

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.420 
having to do anything else to it
what<00:03:05.230> I'm<00:03:05.350> going<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.650> do<00:03:05.800> is<00:03:05.920> upload<00:03:06.160> this

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
what I'm going to do is upload this

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.370 
what I'm going to do is upload this
video<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.850> YouTube<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.630> you<00:03:07.690> can<00:03:07.960> take<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.170> look

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
video to YouTube so you can take a look

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.270 
video to YouTube so you can take a look
at<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.950> I<00:03:10.080> guess<00:03:11.080> we'll<00:03:11.350> probably<00:03:11.830> talk

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
at it and I guess we'll probably talk

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.040 
at it and I guess we'll probably talk
tomorrow<00:03:12.490> sometime<00:03:13.120> which<00:03:13.510> will<00:03:13.660> be<00:03:13.780> Friday
