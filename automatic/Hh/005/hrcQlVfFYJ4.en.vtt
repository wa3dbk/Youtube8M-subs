additional things with it which is the
whole<00:01:20.670> point<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.080> by<00:01:22.140> moving

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
whole point and you do that by moving

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.460 
whole point and you do that by moving
the<00:01:22.979> clips<00:01:23.280> back<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.240> forth<00:01:24.540> along<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.020> cover

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the clips back and forth along the cover

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.330 
the clips back and forth along the cover
so<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.490> by<00:01:26.640> moving<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.090> first<00:01:27.360> clip<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:28.340> one

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
so here by moving this first clip up one

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640 
so here by moving this first clip up one
notch<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.970> blocking<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.930> first<00:01:31.229> fold

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
notch and blocking that first fold

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.429 
notch and blocking that first fold
you'll<00:01:32.430> see<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> fold<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.240> now<00:01:33.390> stiff<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.079> I

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
you'll see the fold is now stiff and I

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.060 
you'll see the fold is now stiff and I
can<00:01:34.680> turn<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.220> back<00:01:35.750> set<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.960> iPad<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.710> now

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
can turn it back set the iPad and now

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
can turn it back set the iPad and now
boom<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:39.090> there<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.560> type<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.490> tap

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
boom it's there and I can type I can tap

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.910 
boom it's there and I can type I can tap
against<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.140> going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.439> fall<00:01:43.680> it's

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
against it it's not going to fall it's

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.530 
against it it's not going to fall it's
very<00:01:44.630> stable<00:01:46.520> it's<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.880> second<00:01:48.329> thing<00:01:48.450> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
very stable it's like the second thing I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.179 
very stable it's like the second thing I
can<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.399> move<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.460> second<00:01:51.000> clip<00:01:51.210> down<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
can do is move that second clip down and

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.060 
can do is move that second clip down and
now<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.610> both<00:01:54.060> folds<00:01:54.720> both<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.799> first

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
now I have both folds both of the first

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.389 
now I have both folds both of the first
folds<00:01:56.460> locked<00:01:56.869> into<00:01:57.869> place<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.219> use

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
folds locked into place and I can use

another<00:02:11.770> position<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.370> wanted<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.760> show<00:02:12.970> you

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
another position I wanted to show you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.050 
another position I wanted to show you
today<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.700> position<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:15.910> was

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
today is the position that I was

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.720 
today is the position that I was
demonstrated<00:02:16.690> in<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.960> original<00:02:17.770> Kickstarter

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
demonstrated in the original Kickstarter

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.020 
demonstrated in the original Kickstarter
video<00:02:18.850> which<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:20.380> private<00:02:21.100> typing<00:02:21.550> stand

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
video which is the private typing stand

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.900 
video which is the private typing stand
position<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:24.070> achieve<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.520> by<00:02:24.700> putting

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
position and I achieve that by putting

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.940 
position and I achieve that by putting
both<00:02:25.180> clips<00:02:25.540> here<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:25.960> could<00:02:26.260> just<00:02:26.410> have<00:02:26.590> just

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
both clips here I could just have just

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.380 
both clips here I could just have just
one<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.310> them<00:02:27.430> there<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.000> other<00:02:28.150> one<00:02:28.360> on

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
one of them there and the other one on

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.430 
one of them there and the other one on
this<00:02:28.690> on<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.700> neutral<00:02:30.700> position<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.410> when<00:02:32.410> I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
this on the neutral position and when I

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.340 
this on the neutral position and when I
do<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.760> you'll<00:02:34.660> see<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.990> doesn't<00:02:35.290> isolate

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
do that I you'll see it doesn't isolate

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.290 
do that I you'll see it doesn't isolate
the<00:02:35.800> first<00:02:36.070> fold<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.640> first<00:02:36.850> full<00:02:37.030> sort<00:02:37.240> of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
the first fold so the first full sort of

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.630 
the first fold so the first full sort of
flips<00:02:37.540> back<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.500> does<00:02:38.860> nice<00:02:39.070> elate<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.460> last

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
flips back it does nice elate the last

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.010 
flips back it does nice elate the last
one<00:02:39.940> but<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.330> one<00:02:40.360> in<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.660> middle<00:02:40.780> is

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
one but the one in the middle is

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.140 
one but the one in the middle is
isolated<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.830> I<00:02:42.250> get<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> private<00:02:42.700> typing

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
isolated and I get a private typing

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.640 
isolated and I get a private typing
stand<00:02:43.390> meaning<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.840> meaning<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.440> if

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
stand meaning that meaning that if

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.800 
stand meaning that meaning that if
someone<00:02:45.040> is<00:02:45.220> in<00:02:45.730> front<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.090> me<00:02:46.210> and<00:02:46.420> I'm<00:02:46.540> saying

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
someone is in front of me and I'm saying

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.330 
someone is in front of me and I'm saying
interviewing<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.500> person<00:02:47.890> are<00:02:48.010> having<00:02:48.280> a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
meeting with them they can't see my

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.900 
meeting with them they can't see my
screen<00:02:49.780> because<00:02:50.470> it's<00:02:50.620> blocked<00:02:50.980> by<00:02:51.850> this

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
screen because it's blocked by this

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.210 
screen because it's blocked by this
first<00:02:52.810> fold<00:02:53.250> being<00:02:54.250> folded<00:02:54.460> back<00:02:54.820> like<00:02:55.660> that

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
first fold being folded back like that

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.410 
first fold being folded back like that
so<00:02:57.220> another<00:02:57.460> very<00:02:57.730> handy<00:02:58.180> position<00:02:59.020> there's

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
so another very handy position there's

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.910 
so another very handy position there's
