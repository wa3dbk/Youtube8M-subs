nice<00:00:47.610> open<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.360> kind<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.870> matches<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.039> don't

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
nice open this kind of matches I don't

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.610 
nice open this kind of matches I don't
think<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.059> might<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.809> some<00:00:51.989> minor

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
think so it's just might like some minor

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.490 
think so it's just might like some minor
mistakes<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.820> its<00:00:53.969> lucky<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.660> less<00:00:55.410> than

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
mistakes but its lucky of like less than

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.810 
mistakes but its lucky of like less than
a<00:00:55.620> second<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> decide<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> want<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.730> do

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
a second to decide what you want to do

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.670 
a second to decide what you want to do
and<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.660> know<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.750> took<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.230> two<00:00:58.469> or<00:00:58.620> three

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and you know just took like two or three

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.250 
and you know just took like two or three
my<00:00:59.670> name's<00:00:59.879> things<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> row<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.079> that

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
my name's things in the row and that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.900 
my name's things in the row and that
cost<00:01:01.469> me<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> game<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:02.430> sending<00:01:02.760> one

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
cost me the game like sending one

cost me the game like sending one
Colossus<00:01:03.329> regularly<00:01:03.809> would've<00:01:04.019> helped<00:01:04.290> maybe

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
Colossus regularly would've helped maybe

Colossus regularly would've helped maybe
mind<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.580> 400<00:01:06.090> building<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.750> wall<00:01:06.960> prism

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
mind to that 400 building a wall prism

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.080 
mind to that 400 building a wall prism
instead<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:07.830> void<00:01:08.010> ray<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.970> those

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
instead of or void ray all of those

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.060 
instead of or void ray all of those
could<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.450> prevented<00:01:09.869> Cho<00:01:10.110> from<00:01:10.409> winning<00:01:10.650> or

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
could have prevented Cho from winning or

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.520 
could have prevented Cho from winning or
maybe<00:01:11.340> even<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.610> snapping<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.570> natural<00:01:12.930> I

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
maybe even just snapping the natural I

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.350 
maybe even just snapping the natural I
what's<00:01:14.100> another<00:01:14.250> impression<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.180> killed

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
what's another impression that I killed

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.420 
what's another impression that I killed
his<00:01:15.570> natural<00:01:16.020> orbital<00:01:16.320> command<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.280> I'm<00:01:17.340> way

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
his natural orbital command so I'm way

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.950 
his natural orbital command so I'm way
to<00:01:17.490> buy<00:01:17.640> quadrate<00:01:18.090> before<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> draw<00:01:18.689> I

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
to buy quadrate before the draw I

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.070 
to buy quadrate before the draw I
thought<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.350> killed

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
thought I killed

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.520 
thought I killed
when<00:01:21.710> is<00:01:21.800> he<00:01:21.830> gonna<00:01:21.980> be<00:01:22.040> revealed<00:01:22.430> when<00:01:23.330> I<00:01:23.530> when

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
when is he gonna be revealed when I when

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.900 
when is he gonna be revealed when I when
I<00:01:24.560> didn't<00:01:24.770> get<00:01:24.860> real<00:01:25.070> like<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:25.460> was<00:01:25.700> kind<00:01:25.820> of

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
I didn't get real like it was kind of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.460 
I didn't get real like it was kind of
sure<00:01:26.060> that<00:01:26.210> I<00:01:26.240> lost<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.540> game<00:01:26.720> even<00:01:27.350> when<00:01:27.410> I

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
sure that I lost the game even when I

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.130 
sure that I lost the game even when I

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
time wise it's manageable cut back a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.729
