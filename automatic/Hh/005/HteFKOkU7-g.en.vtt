problem for me but I don't mind it at

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.119 
problem for me but I don't mind it at
all<00:00:56.670> because<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.870> good<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.800> we're<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
all because is that good so we're in the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.000 
all because is that good so we're in the
80<00:00:59.370> toothpaste<00:00:59.850> 72<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.780> shooting<00:01:01.109> 69<00:01:01.590> passing

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
80 toothpaste 72 to shooting 69 passing

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.969 
80 toothpaste 72 to shooting 69 passing
76<00:01:02.670> troubling<00:01:03.090> far<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.750> defending<00:01:04.140> 79<00:01:04.589> heading

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
76 troubling far to defending 79 heading

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.179 
76 troubling far to defending 79 heading
he<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.240> quite<00:01:06.600> fast<00:01:06.900> he<00:01:07.290> plays<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.680> Celtic<00:01:08.040> is

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
he is quite fast he plays for Celtic is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.950 
he is quite fast he plays for Celtic is
quite<00:01:08.430> fast<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:09.750> his

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
quite fast and I think that's what his

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.870 
quite fast and I think that's what his
normal<00:01:10.260> card<00:01:10.439> should<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:11.040> or<00:01:11.280> we've<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.700> higher

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
normal card should be or we've a higher

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.550 
normal card should be or we've a higher
so<00:01:12.479> we're<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.780> see<00:01:12.840> his<00:01:12.960> end<00:01:13.110> game<00:01:13.170> stats

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
so we're going to see his end game stats

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200 
so we're going to see his end game stats
here<00:01:13.799> he's<00:01:14.130> got<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.400> medium<00:01:14.729> attacking<00:01:15.119> were

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
here he's got a medium attacking were

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.570 
here he's got a medium attacking were
created<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> medium<00:01:15.900> defensive<00:01:16.320> workrate<00:01:16.580> he's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
created a medium defensive workrate he's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.039 
created a medium defensive workrate he's
quite<00:01:17.759> light<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.210> well<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.689> quite<00:01:18.869> small

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
quite light as well and is quite small

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.410 
quite light as well and is quite small
so<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.710> good<00:01:19.860> acceleration<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.970> he's<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
so it's a good acceleration and he's a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.420 
so it's a good acceleration and he's a
three-story<00:01:21.869> fit<00:01:22.140> into<00:01:22.229> our<00:01:22.320> skills<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:22.979> I've

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
three-story fit into our skills as I've

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.730 
three-story fit into our skills as I've
already<00:01:23.580> said<00:01:24.020> but<00:01:25.020> yeah<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.409> test<00:01:25.590> our

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
already said but yeah the test our

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.710 
already said but yeah the test our
skills<00:01:25.860> could<00:01:26.670> be<00:01:26.850> better<00:01:27.030> i<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:27.270> deserves

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
skills could be better i think deserves

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
skills could be better i think deserves

I'll<00:07:31.590> covering<00:07:31.950> finesse<00:07:32.220> right<00:07:32.550> into<00:07:32.760> the

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:32.820 
I'll covering finesse right into the

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.480 
I'll covering finesse right into the
bottom<00:07:33.060> corner<00:07:33.200> he<00:07:34.200> saw<00:07:34.470> so<00:07:34.860> well-balanced

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:35.490 
bottom corner he saw so well-balanced

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.310 
bottom corner he saw so well-balanced
and<00:07:35.640> I<00:07:35.760> don't<00:07:36.030> know<00:07:36.150> why<00:07:36.420> people<00:07:36.480> don't<00:07:37.170> I

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:37.320 
and I don't know why people don't I

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.600 
and I don't know why people don't I
think<00:07:37.620> it's<00:07:37.740> just<00:07:37.890> because<00:07:37.950> he<00:07:38.160> hasn't<00:07:38.340> got

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:38.610 
think it's just because he hasn't got

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.280 
think it's just because he hasn't got
Lester<00:07:38.940> in<00:07:39.210> case<00:07:39.420> or<00:07:39.660> he<00:07:39.780> shouldn't<00:07:40.140> that

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:40.290 
Lester in case or he shouldn't that

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.220
