00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
try and explain this because um you need

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.949 
try and explain this because um you need
your<00:02:45.859> mouth<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.340> stay<00:02:46.609> in<00:02:46.970> while<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.720> share

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
and so this is what I found works the

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.870 
and so this is what I found works the
best<00:02:50.420> you're<00:02:50.959> gonna<00:02:51.049> take<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.410> top<00:02:51.440> layer<00:02:51.980> of

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
a top layer right here I'm gonna bring

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.849 
a top layer right here I'm gonna bring
that<00:03:02.480> up<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.690> you're<00:03:05.900> gonna<00:03:06.019> put<00:03:06.319> your<00:03:06.530> bow

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859

and<00:03:07.370> between<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:09.319> hair<00:03:10.750> where<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.900> rubber

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
and between the hair where the rubber

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.280 
and between the hair where the rubber
band<00:03:12.380> is<00:03:12.680> in<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:14.299> bottom<00:03:14.630> pieces<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:15.170> the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
band is in the bottom pieces of the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.520 
band is in the bottom pieces of the
rubber<00:03:15.590> end<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.910> then<00:03:17.780> you're<00:03:17.930> gonna<00:03:18.049> clip<00:03:18.380> it

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
rubber end and then you're gonna clip it

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.360 
rubber end and then you're gonna clip it
into<00:03:18.680> place

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
into place

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.260 
into place
and<00:03:22.260> you're<00:03:23.260> gonna<00:03:23.380> pull<00:03:23.710> the<00:03:24.310> rope<00:03:24.490> man<00:03:24.700> up<00:03:24.940> so

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
and you're gonna pull the rope man up so

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.620 
and you're gonna pull the rope man up so
that<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.540> keeps<00:03:26.050> your<00:03:26.290> bow<00:03:26.470> into<00:03:26.710> place

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.490 

so<00:03:31.630> basically<00:03:33.150> your<00:03:34.150> bow<00:03:34.390> is<00:03:34.690> gonna<00:03:34.870> stay<00:03:35.140> on

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
so basically your bow is gonna stay on

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.180 
so basically your bow is gonna stay on
it<00:03:35.740> in<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.250> same<00:03:36.460> place<00:03:36.670> so<00:03:38.040> usually<00:03:39.040> what

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
it in the same place so usually what

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.910 
it in the same place so usually what
happens<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.670> this<00:03:39.760> is<00:03:39.820> how<00:03:40.240> I<00:03:40.720> do<00:03:41.050> my<00:03:41.350> hair<00:03:41.380> for

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
happens and this is how I do my hair for

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.240 
happens and this is how I do my hair for
cheer<00:03:42.700> so<00:03:44.220> basically<00:03:45.220> it's<00:03:45.640> pretty<00:03:45.910> simple<00:03:46.420> um

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
cheer so basically it's pretty simple um
