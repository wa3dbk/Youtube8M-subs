00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
they're a few clicks north of where you

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.900 
they're a few clicks north of where you
are<00:05:41.570> now<00:05:41.780> it's<00:05:42.440> a<00:05:42.590> non<00:05:42.770> combat<00:05:43.280> zone<00:05:43.550> so<00:05:43.790> there

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.700 
won't be any checkpoints there's even a
dialysis<00:05:46.850> machine<00:05:47.230> it'll<00:05:48.230> take<00:05:48.260> some<00:05:48.470> time

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
dialysis machine it'll take some time

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.639 
dialysis machine it'll take some time
but<00:05:49.280> I<00:05:49.790> think<00:05:50.600> he'll<00:05:50.840> be<00:05:50.870> okay
