00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.459
 around half past four Sunday afternoon the remaining part of the peaceful in one 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.659
 fireworks found in Heenvliet exploded 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:21.239
 this operation was initially scheduled for half past one but was postponed because 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.429
 found fireworks not to explode twice but once 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.849
 an explosive one had to go deeper for that 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.079
 theo d destroyed Saturday night even though part of the fireworks came one 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.439
 number of 33 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.670
 as a result, a window was smashed in at least four houses in Zwartewaal 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.360
 in a house there would also be a crack the weather conditions of saturday 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.490
 would get main cause of having been according to people 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.670
 The blow was in the spacious environment being targeted also there and that goes the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.310
 Damage due to the huge fireworks finding had to be found around the 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.750
 number two nights spend all found raw materials before 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.890
 explosives in the sea have since been removed from the home and a skilled one there 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.580
 transferred and destruction 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.670
 Sunday evening at six o'clock after a thorough inspection of the new b 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.030
 residents back 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.450
 where a home 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.290
 what it was waiting for was the remains were found in it 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.450
 home where q fever is a lower disease 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.430
 the remains are heard today 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.730
 what goes on like that was told last night 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.980
 Midfield was not that much last night we are going this way then 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.580
 supports the newspaper 9 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.520
 thus offer between with defective to a minimum limit what a 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.100
 last night actually happened is that there is a considerable amount 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.330
 snow until this is a poster 8 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.100
 obviously had to deal with an improvised exclusive with 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.920
 unstable quarter with a high energetic value that means there 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.910
 very much 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.310
 if you have he comes during the explosion 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.160
 the return on declamation will therefore 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.380
 reflection and focus the opportunities on all points 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.200
 the expectation is that this is possibly the cause of damage to the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.150
