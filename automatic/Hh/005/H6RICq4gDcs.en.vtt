 But what should I and wait for me smart about the moor Jung 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.280
 above 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.150
 Let's say that the creditors adapt to people 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.270

 Experts Lengsfeld the whole intuitive just a little 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.020
 to patients Mon 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.020
 Next 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.329
 which some people try to get in March 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:25.880
 Commune with him already

 which makes a complete record of presenting myself like boxing art 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.670
 the type of acceptance 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.049
 and the microphone 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.570
 completely choose 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.750
 with fine clothes 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.750
 one would like now that my four look for the Loburg a more suitable one 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 I'm good for you 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.590
 the Spitz 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.470
 this function middle class «That takes proportions wanting the whole something 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.359
 runterregeln 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.469
 in euro lie new function with it Police Thorium 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.330
 which automatically adjust the volume 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.520
 how the pictures can determine the big the internos both 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.520
 Boxers should 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.959
 then also change the shape of change 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.450
 when I first get one 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.250
 Far from naming this ok by creating Neely corresponding Nico focus-money 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.250
 choose 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:32.590
 then you should also make that then according to Jäggi Rome answer over r 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.590
 in the course of 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.939
 the automatic front Spyder Tarnat took a box 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.939
 The microphone will be underlined even deeper 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:50.509
 Dr 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:52.620
 it was clear that you read a lot 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.560
 Hach continue to duplicate this complete leads here with a setting 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.629
 can 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.559
 and already so lost if I can make a second win by doing so 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:05.859
 So here, for example, a second box loading inter-star like 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.050
 operate with two boxes or as my case leaves the box exactly the same 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.909
 more than just an alternative 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.270
 bring in a second wiko foundation 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.819
 namely a Klaus Meidling 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.929
 Atletico has forums to break that up 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:22.459
 because with a stalemate of course this Holm answer he comes out speech 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.989
 a course is the Klose Meidling 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.649
 OZ what happens 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:29.809
 then 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.539
 although clear 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.669
 with more heights still through the close times gene variant 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.599
 the whole wants to distribute the panorama already and that the first steps 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.269
 further left in the second to the right 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.389
 the baits are still some things other play 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.689
 to the females then also to live the two channels 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.650
 and then over this these regulators are still the phase against others 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.129
 gambling 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.219
 Dr 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.790
 You should be careful what you exaggerate it to the motive 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.829
 Draw comes 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.540
 the whole thing in the hollow one without adjustments of the fair for 1 kilo 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.699
 Create sound 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.099
 7 Julian lost quite well 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.639
 l 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.570
 AR the second 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.690
 but then little new in the cities 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.510
 9 new example in the form of what one believes to be playing 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.030
 to this unison 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.800
 Ork I'm working on such a plethora of test flair she wants to lend 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.910
 even a fat to shop though like the mother's revenge so a Flemish 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.710
 not available but read sounds and sneezing Electric Lady Flender me 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.689
 want here now 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.689
 Ryan four-first place in the rack 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.770
 because later to open the field 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.939
 I want that countries now 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.039
 Zong Tempo force him to do the same with the Laga over also with Modersohns 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:08.670
 effects 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.560
 and then the wave can adapt to the tempo of the same 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.129
 Activate drink bathing first 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.479
 Melanie from this 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.240
 about the UNO with the clock over this time works 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:25.779
 it is 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:27.599
 is 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.599
 This is 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:33.710
 it is 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.150
 what militia was with the tour 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.320
 made sure that 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.650
 Zong pace 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.629
 I think about one hundred two masters reported to play three times 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:44.229
 Heartbroken out 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.120
 and everyone promises that lasts longer 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.710
 adapted differently Zong Tembo 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.790
 however, the red has the tractor times accordingly 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.790
 Grandel to change 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.369
 times 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:03.369
 January

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.939
 So vote down vote 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:13.219
 the curlers affect the mixing ratio of 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.369
 dry and sunny to Follett sixes and 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:19.369
 later a little adjuster itself that was the central 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.389
 we can spread it to the world 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.090
 and accordingly praise, of course 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.639
 affect the sound 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.680
 over deeper and coloring boat 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.499
 min

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.249
 Dr 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:40.349
 meanwhile, it's supposed to be December 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.279
 over STRATEC you can still the wave from the bed already that I have one 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:46.279
 static perfection 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.490
 was certainly a kind of filter 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.490
 Borrmann the whole thing to run either sounds 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:15.280

 Five times when I did, she recognized Blue Control 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.289
 to arrange accordingly 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:23.599
 that you just do it 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:26.599
 can turn on and off 

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:31.529
 even today are then in a second passage 

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:34.529
 who drive over 

00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:49.429
 Ben

 Dr 

00:07:57.369 --> 00:08:00.369
 Dr 

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:09.849
 others say that was and that was already here 

00:08:09.849 --> 00:08:10.590
