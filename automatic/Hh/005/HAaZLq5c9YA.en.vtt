things<00:00:15.100> are<00:00:15.280> the<00:00:15.340> answers<00:00:15.820> to<00:00:15.970> the<00:00:16.090> question

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
things are the answers to the question

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.140 
things are the answers to the question
why<00:00:16.840> when<00:00:17.290> posed<00:00:17.560> a<00:00:17.710> game<00:00:17.950> design<00:00:18.340> I<00:00:18.610> can't

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
why when posed a game design I can't

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.910 
why when posed a game design I can't
simply<00:00:19.480> accept<00:00:19.779> that<00:00:19.869> something<00:00:20.110> just<00:00:20.560> works

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
simply accept that something just works

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.249 
simply accept that something just works
in<00:00:21.189> a<00:00:21.250> game<00:00:21.460> I<00:00:21.670> have<00:00:21.880> to<00:00:22.060> break<00:00:22.330> it<00:00:22.509> down<00:00:22.720> really

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
in a game I have to break it down really

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.440 
in a game I have to break it down really
analyze<00:00:24.070> it<00:00:24.189> so<00:00:24.369> I<00:00:24.430> can<00:00:24.610> understand<00:00:25.090> it<00:00:25.270> that's

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
analyze it so I can understand it that's

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.150 
analyze it so I can understand it that's
why<00:00:25.779> I<00:00:25.810> created<00:00:25.869> this<00:00:26.259> channel<00:00:26.560> so<00:00:26.829> hopefully

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
why I created this channel so hopefully

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
videos are always about the little

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.950 
videos are always about the little
things<00:01:09.130> where<00:01:09.580> they're<00:01:09.700> supposed<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.300> be<00:01:10.390> but

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
things where they're supposed to be but

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.330 
things where they're supposed to be but
this<00:01:11.140> time<00:01:11.260> it<00:01:11.409> was<00:01:11.500> about<00:01:11.620> something<00:01:11.890> so

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
this time it was about something so

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.520 
this time it was about something so
minut<00:01:12.939> that<00:01:13.149> most<00:01:13.420> people<00:01:13.750> probably<00:01:13.899> still

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
minut that most people probably still

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.050 
minut that most people probably still
don't<00:01:14.860> think<00:01:14.950> that<00:01:15.520> what<00:01:15.670> I<00:01:15.700> was<00:01:15.880> talking

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
don't think that what I was talking

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.210 
don't think that what I was talking
about<00:01:16.329> matters<00:01:16.720> all<00:01:17.049> that<00:01:17.079> much<00:01:17.290> and<00:01:17.530> maybe<00:01:18.009> it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
about matters all that much and maybe it

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.670 
about matters all that much and maybe it
doesn't<00:01:18.460> but<00:01:18.759> dkc<00:01:19.299> returns<00:01:19.659> has<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.380> very

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
doesn't but dkc returns has a very

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.499 
doesn't but dkc returns has a very
purposeful<00:01:21.310> combination<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:21.909> environments

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
purposeful combination of environments

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.149 
purposeful combination of environments
in<00:01:22.600> gameplay<00:01:22.869> such<00:01:23.380> that<00:01:23.560> from<00:01:23.680> level<00:01:24.009> to

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
in gameplay such that from level to

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.340 
in gameplay such that from level to
level<00:01:24.189> it<00:01:24.610> actually<00:01:25.420> looks<00:01:25.689> like<00:01:25.869> DK<00:01:26.229> is

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
level it actually looks like DK is

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.200 
level it actually looks like DK is
progressing<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.070> seeing<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:27.820> experiencing

progressing and seeing and experiencing

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.910 
progressing and seeing and experiencing
new<00:01:28.270> things<00:01:28.360> which<00:01:28.899> i<00:01:29.110> think<00:01:29.439> is<00:01:29.560> kind<00:01:29.799> of

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
new things which i think is kind of

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.770 
new things which i think is kind of
important<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.820> course<00:01:31.090> we<00:01:31.240> zoom<00:01:31.509> that's

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
important of course we zoom that's

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.959 
important of course we zoom that's
happening<00:01:32.200> anyways<00:01:32.710> because<00:01:33.130> as<00:01:33.460> our<00:01:33.610> video

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
happening anyways because as our video

games work but Donkey Kong Country
Returns<00:01:35.680> made<00:01:36.250> sure<00:01:36.610> it<00:01:36.909> was<00:01:37.119> apparent<00:01:37.570> on<00:01:37.899> the

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
Returns made sure it was apparent on the

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.590 
Returns made sure it was apparent on the
opposite<00:01:38.950> end<00:01:39.159> some<00:01:39.700> games<00:01:39.969> end<00:01:40.240> up<00:01:40.329> going

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
opposite end some games end up going

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.630 
opposite end some games end up going
nowhere<00:01:40.930> fast<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.680> that's<00:01:42.039> what<00:01:42.219> I<00:01:42.250> wanted<00:01:42.520> to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
nowhere fast and that's what I wanted to
