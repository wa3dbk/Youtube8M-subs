and I'm going to give you a step-by-step

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.100 
and I'm going to give you a step-by-step
on<00:01:14.189> how<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.430> go<00:01:14.640> ahead<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.210> create<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> same

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
on how to go ahead and create the same

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.460 
on how to go ahead and create the same
slide<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:17.009> made<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.930> first<00:01:19.229> step

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
slide as what I just made the first step

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.429 
slide as what I just made the first step
is<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.890> add<00:01:20.040> your<00:01:20.070> video<00:01:20.670> background<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:22.140> next

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
is to add your video background the next

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.410 
is to add your video background the next
step<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.950> use<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.310> playback<00:01:23.580> option<00:01:24.270> in

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
step is to use the playback option in

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
step is to use the playback option in
your<00:01:24.540> tools<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.590> tell<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> start

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
your tools to tell it to start

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.219 
your tools to tell it to start
automatically<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.509> loop<00:01:27.720> until<00:01:28.020> it's

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
automatically and to loop until it's

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.910 
automatically and to loop until it's
stopped

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
stopped

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.140 
stopped
this<00:01:30.920> will<00:01:31.130> enable<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.549> video<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:31.970> start

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
this will enable the video to start

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.969 
this will enable the video to start
playing<00:01:32.360> as<00:01:32.720> soon<00:01:32.930> as<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:33.170> slide<00:01:33.409> comes<00:01:33.740> into

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
playing as soon as the slide comes into

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.050 
playing as soon as the slide comes into
play<00:01:35.049> next<00:01:36.049> we'll<00:01:36.409> be<00:01:36.500> adding<00:01:36.530> our<00:01:36.979> welcome<00:01:37.880> to

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
play next we'll be adding our welcome to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.930 
play next we'll be adding our welcome to
anatomy<00:01:38.479> 101<00:01:38.690> text<00:01:39.440> box<00:01:39.680> now<00:01:40.580> we'll<00:01:40.820> be<00:01:40.909> adding

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
anatomy 101 text box now we'll be adding

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.680 
anatomy 101 text box now we'll be adding
an<00:01:41.270> animation<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:43.119> for<00:01:44.119> this<00:01:44.240> case<00:01:44.479> we'll

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
an animation and for this case we'll

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.660 
an animation and for this case we'll
just<00:01:44.720> use<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.170> fade<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:45.680> make<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.399> take<00:01:46.640> a

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
just use the fade and make it take a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.100 
just use the fade and make it take a
little<00:01:46.970> bit<00:01:47.090> longer<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:47.600> it's<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.780> little<00:01:48.020> bit

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
little bit longer so it's a little bit

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.410 
little bit longer so it's a little bit
more<00:01:48.259> subtle<00:01:48.550> now<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.610> next<00:01:49.970> step<00:01:50.119> is<00:01:50.240> the

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
more subtle now the next step is the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.660 
more subtle now the next step is the
important<00:01:50.899> one<00:01:50.930> because<00:01:51.500> at<00:01:51.649> this<00:01:51.770> point<00:01:52.070> all

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
important one because at this point all

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.460 
important one because at this point all
you'll<00:01:53.030> have<00:01:53.240> is<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.690> actual<00:01:54.080> animation

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
you'll have is the actual animation

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.730 
you'll have is the actual animation
happening<00:01:55.250> in<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.460> background<00:01:56.649> with<00:01:57.649> the

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
happening in the background with the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.710 
happening in the background with the
video<00:01:58.040> playing<00:01:58.369> but<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:58.970> won't<00:01:59.180> actually<00:01:59.450> be

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
video playing but you won't actually be

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.469 
video playing but you won't actually be
able<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.080> see<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.619> text<00:02:00.860> coming<00:02:01.310> up<00:02:01.399> above<00:02:01.729> you

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
able to see the text coming up above you

the<00:03:03.280> next<00:03:03.579> step<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.879> a<00:03:03.909> little<00:03:04.000> bit<00:03:04.269> trickier

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:04.719 
the next step is a little bit trickier

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.390 
the next step is a little bit trickier
as<00:03:04.900> this<00:03:05.109> will<00:03:05.319> be<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:05.500> step<00:03:05.920> where<00:03:06.159> these

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
as this will be the step where these

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.720 
as this will be the step where these
items<00:03:06.609> fade<00:03:07.060> out<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:07.510> new<00:03:07.750> items<00:03:08.049> come<00:03:08.349> in
