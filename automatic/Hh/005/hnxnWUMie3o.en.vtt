and my drive mode is also continuous now

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.990 
and my drive mode is also continuous now
a<00:00:31.740> couple<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.189> these<00:00:32.309> things<00:00:32.609> are<00:00:32.820> great

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
a couple of these things are great

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.720 
a couple of these things are great
others<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.750> don't<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.109> very<00:00:34.350> much

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
others I don't like very much

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.250 
others I don't like very much
white<00:00:35.730> balance<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.270> don't<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.110> on

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
white balance I don't like that it's on

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.380 
white balance I don't like that it's on
auto<00:00:37.500> because<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.340> you're<00:00:38.489> indoors<00:00:38.970> and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
auto because if you're indoors and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.810 
auto because if you're indoors and
you're<00:00:40.079> using<00:00:40.260> regular<00:00:40.950> tungsten<00:00:41.579> lighting

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
you're using regular tungsten lighting

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.819 
you're using regular tungsten lighting
then<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> auto<00:00:42.840> white<00:00:43.079> balance<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.500> really

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
then the auto white balance is really

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.460 
then the auto white balance is really
not<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.399> produce<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:45.030> very<00:00:45.780> good<00:00:46.079> image

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
not going to produce a very good image

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.490 
not going to produce a very good image
the<00:00:46.800> ISO<00:00:47.250> also<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.790> like<00:00:48.180> setting<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.200> I

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the ISO also I like setting that so I

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500 
the ISO also I like setting that so I
don't<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.190> auto<00:00:50.399> setting<00:00:50.880> and<00:00:51.090> another

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
don't like the auto setting and another

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.680 
don't like the auto setting and another
thing<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.230> flash<00:00:52.680> cannot<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.460> used<00:00:53.760> so

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
thing the flash cannot be used so

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.450 
thing the flash cannot be used so
because<00:00:55.440> we're<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> sport<00:00:56.100> mode<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
because we're in the sport mode it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.600 
because we're in the sport mode it
assumes<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.239> subject<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.200> far<00:00:58.620> away<00:00:58.890> so

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
assumes that the subject is far away so

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.190 
assumes that the subject is far away so
it's<00:00:59.850> not<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> allow<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> use<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
it's not going to allow you to use the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.160 
it's not going to allow you to use the
flash<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.820> one<00:01:03.000> good<00:01:03.210> thing<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.450> is<00:01:03.690> used<00:01:03.960> in

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
flash the one good thing that is used in

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.950 
flash the one good thing that is used in
this<00:01:04.289> mode<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.489> continuous<00:01:06.030> drive<00:01:06.360> which

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
this mode is the continuous drive which

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.990 
this mode is the continuous drive which
allows<00:01:07.260> us<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.860> hold<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.460> shutter<00:01:08.640> button

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
allows us to hold the shutter button

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.090 
allows us to hold the shutter button
down<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.869> camera<00:01:10.229> will<00:01:10.409> continuously

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
down and the camera will continuously

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.149 
down and the camera will continuously
keep<00:01:11.790> taking<00:01:12.210> pictures<00:01:12.590> but<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.830> set<00:01:14.040> that

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
keep taking pictures but we can set that

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
keep taking pictures but we can set that
up<00:01:14.220> ourselves<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.090> still<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:15.990> much<00:01:16.229> more

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
up ourselves and still have much more

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.010 
up ourselves and still have much more
control<00:01:16.560> over<00:01:17.100> everything<00:01:17.400> else<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.780> go<00:01:18.930> ahead

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
control over everything else so go ahead

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.899 
control over everything else so go ahead
and<00:01:19.490> change<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.760> back<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:22.430> p4<00:01:23.430> program

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and change this back to p4 program

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.670 
and change this back to p4 program
depending<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> situation<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:25.530> you're

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
depending on the situation if you're

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.190 
depending on the situation if you're
outdoors<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.520> backyard<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:27.689> example

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
outdoors in the backyard for example

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.039 
outdoors in the backyard for example
there's<00:01:28.380> plenty<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.770> light<00:01:29.010> stick<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.939> 100<00:01:30.540> ISO

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
there's plenty of light stick to 100 ISO

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.469 
there's plenty of light stick to 100 ISO
you<00:01:31.320> don't<00:01:31.590> need<00:01:31.710> any<00:01:31.890> more<00:01:32.070> than<00:01:32.130> that

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
you don't need any more than that

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.609 
you don't need any more than that
anymore<00:01:33.479> we'll<00:01:33.810> create<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.409> bit<00:01:34.560> more

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
anymore we'll create a little bit more

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.160 
anymore we'll create a little bit more
grainy<00:01:35.070> image<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:36.180> you're<00:01:36.360> indoors<00:01:36.720> however

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
and there's not a whole lot of light you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.260 
and there's not a whole lot of light you
may<00:01:39.330> want<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.869> increase<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> ISO<00:01:40.790> to<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
may want to increase the ISO to have the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.880 
may want to increase the ISO to have the
camera<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> little<00:01:42.990> bit<00:01:43.110> more<00:01:43.290> sensitive<00:01:43.680> to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
camera be a little bit more sensitive to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.460 
camera be a little bit more sensitive to
light<00:01:44.270> allowing<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> faster<00:01:46.290> shutter

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
light allowing for a faster shutter

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.490 
light allowing for a faster shutter
speed<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.100> fast<00:01:47.670> shutter<00:01:47.909> speed<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.420> key<00:01:49.259> in

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
speed the fast shutter speed is key in

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.580 
speed the fast shutter speed is key in
this<00:01:50.100> picture<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:51.000> again<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:52.079> subjects

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
this picture because again your subjects

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.160 
this picture because again your subjects
are<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.710> going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.369> stop<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.689> picture<00:01:54.960> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
are not going to stop for the picture so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.649 
are not going to stop for the picture so

because by doing so you're going to slow

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.220 
because by doing so you're going to slow
down<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.950> frame<00:03:33.160> rate<00:03:33.520> or<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:34.540> rate<00:03:34.930> at<00:03:35.200> which

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
in this case that's probably not fast

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.059 
in this case that's probably not fast
enough<00:04:50.199> to<00:04:50.699> stop<00:04:51.699> the<00:04:52.029> action<00:04:52.560> so<00:04:53.560> I'm<00:04:53.889> going

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
enough to stop the action so I'm going
