I think I got it so I didn't feel me

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.260 
I think I got it so I didn't feel me
because<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.340> didn't<00:01:44.670> know<00:01:44.729> how<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.909> was<00:01:45.030> going<00:01:45.210> to

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.590 
cut out come out and I prayed that it
came<00:01:47.340> out<00:01:47.490> good<00:01:47.700> because<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.420> hair

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
