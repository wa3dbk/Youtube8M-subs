running<00:00:44.040> through<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> ruins<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.879> thought<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
running through the ruins I thought that

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.000

added<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.850> added<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> whole<00:00:48.329> experience

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
added I added to the whole experience

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.310 
added I added to the whole experience
and<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.550> thought<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> steps<00:00:51.660> were<00:00:51.870> tough<00:00:52.079> but

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
and I thought the steps were tough but

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.910 
and I thought the steps were tough but
they<00:00:53.129> were<00:00:53.219> fun<00:00:54.260> what<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.410> your<00:00:55.559> tactic

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
they were fun what was your tactic

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.709 
they were fun what was your tactic
because<00:00:56.190> first<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.510> then

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
because first you have to go up and then

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.170 
because first you have to go up and then
the<00:00:58.170> second<00:00:58.559> part<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.829> cool<00:00:59.070> almost<00:00:59.399> all<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.820> it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the second part is cool almost all of it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.290 
the second part is cool almost all of it
downhill<00:01:00.480> oh<00:01:00.899> yeah<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.250> held<00:01:02.850> back<00:01:02.940> at
