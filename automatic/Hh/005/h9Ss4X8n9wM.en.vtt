00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:02.670
 Gundolf Stertmann 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.230
 behavioral Biology 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.330
 an introduction to Lyon 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.899
 Tumbleweed publishing house 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.049
 457 pages 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.349
 no exaggeration even after the fifth read what you still do not 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.699
 whether this book is actually an introduction to the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.009
 Behavioral biology for Lyon or simply one more or less 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.659
 involuntary form or animals 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.519
 Stertmann is by his own admission self-taught 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.259
 which becomes clear in Spanish in many passages 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.079
 like in phrases like 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.110
 we had plenty of guinea pigs at home and all 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.190
 or 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.190
 I once believed in a pet shop for three days 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.940
 the following examples may clarify how the author with rather 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.510
 tried modest success 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.770
 the layman understandably complicated aspects of behavioral biology 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.260
 do 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.590
 to the term skip from the chapter field research 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.520
 Time Online 22 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.080
 a leap action would be if, for example, a horse in front of you 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.520
 Obstacle stands and decides to jump over it instead of the 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.160
 Avoid obstacle 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.150
 The same is true for a donkey some Rafe some found in traffic jams or 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.710
 other four-legged friends 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.610
 an example from the chapter at the North Pole 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.110
 both 285 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.870
 at the North Pole there are many seals climbing and sometimes ice floes 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.650
 although they have no legs 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.160
 They do it with their fins, but they only clumsily word 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.180
 can move 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.940
 they are not called Mettmann Schein feet 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.180
 or Soldo podiums 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.890
 Here's another example 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.420
 this time from the chapter in the sun 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.370
 whopping 300 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.130
 In the zoo there are also animals that are dangerous tigers for example 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.110
 so Kathi had to be built that way 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.650
 that the tiger did not come out but he must also be built so said 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.700
 Animal keeper you can go in there 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.760
 Such a construction is called Senica Miata partition 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.900
 Last but not least, an example from the chapter what can we Portman 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.720
 learn 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.520
 both duration 89 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.919
 "We had an eagle's nest nearby at home 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.519
 to be able to observe the eagles better in brood care I am tall 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.579
 climbed and put a stool in the net 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.000
 You have to wait quite a long time before the eagles parents with food 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.659
 to return for the young 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.659
 and there is such a nest stool I Calle questionable 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.449
 At that time I also made a drawing of it 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.779
 it is hardly surprising that this work in 2018 even two semesters back from the 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:39.510
 Required reading for the undergraduate studies in Biology at the University of MÃ¼nster 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.809
 was taken out
