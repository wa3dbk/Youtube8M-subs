00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:13.869
 hello i am the thomas we are here 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.119
 At the company frick I would like you 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:27.369
 Let's show how to put the gas away at one 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:28.810
 regulator kassel da lang 90 1 learns before 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.579
 we will now turn the heli 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:36.250
 we participate in our program in the station 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:37.960
 make some changes we go into 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.490
 program and become the gas cooker 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:46.080
 change to diagonal here now 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.080
 already a few percent with it 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:13.020
 then I go under servo setting in 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.130
 Gas away and change the two ways 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.130
 30 percent off 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.210
 so we can now turn on the heli 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.920
 For security reasons, I have before 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.479
 motto of the drive solved if we can 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.479
 whole times in connection to set 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.890
 The regulator gives now but does not 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.280
 continue such a remote control of the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.100
 received turned I also 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.470
 then I go full throttle first 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.979
 Turn of 30 percent up is the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:17.310
 rule is of course still a few 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:17.310
 percent to that on the other side 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.080
 this also a few percent 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.760
 so I have learned my gas away 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.330
 the engine starts now that we now 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.330
 test 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.270
 runs on should be
