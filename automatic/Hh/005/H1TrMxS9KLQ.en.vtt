 the interlocutor was well heard more precisely than you 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.940

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.570
 holes and just transmit the sound by 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.500
 wire 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.660

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.660
 skype talk 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.310

 microphone how do you hear the volume very much 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.729
 high and you can even speak louder 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.530

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.130
 much better than other microphone out 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.039
