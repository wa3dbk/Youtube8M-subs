the sink engine in Traktor DJ we also

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.310 
the sink engine in Traktor DJ we also

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
listened closely to the beat and only

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.930 
listened closely to the beat and only
try<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.530> see<00:01:20.770> if<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.010> two<00:01:21.160> songs<00:01:21.340> can<00:01:21.670> be<00:01:21.700> beat

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
try to see if the two songs can be beat

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.940 
try to see if the two songs can be beat
matched<00:01:22.180> since<00:01:23.170> we're<00:01:23.350> not<00:01:23.470> touching<00:01:23.650> any

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.710 
matched since we're not touching any
faders<00:01:24.370> I'll<00:01:24.820> just<00:01:25.120> make<00:01:25.270> sure<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.480> the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
faders I'll just make sure that the

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.180 
faders I'll just make sure that the
cross<00:01:25.930> fader<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.260> in<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.530> middle<00:01:26.710> position

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
cross fader is in the middle position

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.550 
cross fader is in the middle position
this<00:01:28.120> means<00:01:28.330> i<00:01:28.480> can<00:01:28.630> hear<00:01:28.780> both<00:01:28.960> tracks<00:01:29.320> at

this means i can hear both tracks at

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.200 
this means i can hear both tracks at
their<00:01:29.710> full<00:01:29.890> volume<00:01:30.160> once<00:01:30.580> i<00:01:30.670> start<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.030> play

blending well this is not only because

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.070 
blending well this is not only because

decade anyways I'll precautionary use a
high-pass<00:03:33.160> filter<00:03:33.580> to<00:03:34.000> filter<00:03:34.150> out<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.599> low

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750

high-pass filter to filter out the low

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
frequencies completely this way I can

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.580 
frequencies completely this way I can
keep<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.180> track<00:03:37.390> running<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:37.900> won't<00:03:38.290> have<00:03:38.470> to

keep the track running and won't have to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.460 
keep the track running and won't have to
worry<00:03:38.769> about<00:03:38.920> clashing<00:03:39.400> frequencies<00:03:39.910> later

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.600 

one<00:03:44.470> last<00:03:44.709> trick<00:03:44.920> I'd<00:03:45.040> like<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.310> share<00:03:45.489> with
