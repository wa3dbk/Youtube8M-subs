00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.680
 and the team is prepared knows that it has 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.820
 When the moment of truth has arrived, it is time 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.430
 to show that we want to be in the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.510
 final 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:20.090
 those who play from start to 90 minutes or 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.770
 those who are going to be full those who 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.070
 play 5 minutes they will be full and 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.369
 those who are outside will be at their best and 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.920
 we hope the bernabéu is at its best 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.070
 a very important moment of the 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.650
 season and we are going to be at 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.000
 This is how Real Madrid is before the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.500
 game in which you play to be in the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.330
 final of this year's champions 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.949
 Esteban Barn wants to live it from 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.720
 inside and believes that the desire and the 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.260
 team capacity can do it 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.170
 actually this three champions for the 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.490
 madrid on TV 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.730
 and I've always suffered a lot 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:01.200
 I had a great time celebrating very well 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.200
 the titles of the cybele 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.920
 well now I have to live it from within 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.520
 we are one step away from getting the final 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.100
 and we have a team that is 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.469
 very involved in getting it what happens 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.289
 that we have to play a game that 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.250
 we have a small disadvantage but 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.840
 we are prepared and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.450
 the fans have to know that we 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.520
 let's leave it all morning 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.040
 we hope that they also leave everything and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.640
 that surely yes 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.670
 if things go well 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.190
 we can go to real Madrid- and we need 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.810
 to score 1 to 0 would be worth a team 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.790
 that in this competition has achieved 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.100
 an average of three goals per match 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.700
 that barn relies fully on power 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.290
 do it we have people up with 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.930
 a lot of punch 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.159
 each end what 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.620
 we have many resources 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.330
 possibilities and good we are a team 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.070
 very offensive what 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.590
 that has scored many goals this year and 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.340
 that in the important matches because not 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.010
 has failed in that aspect then then 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.390
 I hope tomorrow I will continue the streak and 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.520
 we can make goals that allow us 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.970
 be in the final 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.970
 I think that 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.379
 normally keeping the goal zero 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.000
 as it may be sufficient and 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.400
 in front they will have a bayern who also 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.629
 it is played in the bernabéu thus it is expected 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.260
 to the german team we expect a team that 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.920
 do not be back waiting because 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.650
 obviously 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.170
 that can not not be good for them 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.890
 Then we 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.440
 we are posing the game watching us 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.150
 a little inwards 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.150
 and seeing what we have to do 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.920
 a little focusing on ourselves 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.680
 in the work that we have to do in 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.629
 as we can 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.150
 and get the result we need 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.890
 and good the value that we expect is a 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.340
 good bayern is a semifinal value of 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.340
 champions
