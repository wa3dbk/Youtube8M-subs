00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
a springy material here like a coil and

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.950 
a springy material here like a coil and
it<00:00:21.720> has<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.109> these<00:00:22.380> two<00:00:22.619> plastic<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.960> it's

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
it has like these two plastic and it's

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.099 
it has like these two plastic and it's
been<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:26.519> save<00:00:26.730> bending<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.539> up<00:00:27.660> and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
been I just save bending it up and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.640 
been I just save bending it up and
everything

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
everything

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.429 
everything
instead<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.789> supposed<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.330> be

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
instead it this is supposed to be

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.700 
instead it this is supposed to be
quicker<00:00:31.439> than<00:00:32.099> doing<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:33.329> lot<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.570> plucking<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
quicker than doing a lot of plucking and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.030 
quicker than doing a lot of plucking and

I guess for like if you have get here

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.450 
I guess for like if you have get here
like<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.370> rag<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.149> or<00:00:39.860> underneath<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:41.190> or

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
