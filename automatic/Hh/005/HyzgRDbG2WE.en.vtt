00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
something like that and then I decided

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.590 
something like that and then I decided
to<00:02:05.219> make<00:02:05.369> into<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> stall<00:02:05.969> because<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.270> was<00:02:06.509> just

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
to make into a stall because I was just

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.059 
to make into a stall because I was just
like<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.710> big<00:02:08.039> enough<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:09.060> would<00:02:09.179> fit<00:02:09.390> so

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
like it's big enough and it would fit so

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.979 
like it's big enough and it would fit so
made<00:02:11.549> it<00:02:11.780> stall<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.379> put<00:02:13.709> some<00:02:14.840> shavings<00:02:15.840> in

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
made it stall and put some shavings in

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.550 
made it stall and put some shavings in
there<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.469> then<00:02:16.950> there's<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.260> dog<00:02:19.260> agility

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
