00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.950 

bulkheads<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.490> two<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.600> that's<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
bulkheads we have two so that's a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.830

vertical wall a foam ball pit there and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.080 
vertical wall a foam ball pit there and
there<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:17.189> creates<00:01:18.030> dry<00:01:18.360> storage<00:01:18.810> and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
there that creates dry storage and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.460 
there that creates dry storage and
eliminates<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.360> lot<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> water<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.290> would

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
eliminates a lot of the water that would

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.770 
eliminates a lot of the water that would

trying to do and what they do very well

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.370 
trying to do and what they do very well
is<00:02:05.320> create<00:02:05.830> that<00:02:06.010> one<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.550> fit<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.080> more

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
is create that one of fit so the more

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.230 
is create that one of fit so the more
the<00:02:09.340> better<00:02:09.490> she<00:02:09.910> fits<00:02:10.210> the<00:02:10.509> better<00:02:11.200> ratio<00:02:12.240> the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
the better she fits the better ratio the
