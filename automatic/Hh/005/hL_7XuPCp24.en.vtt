00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
had it at a 30 and it was just too much

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.869 
had it at a 30 and it was just too much
of<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:13.190> difference<00:02:13.700> for<00:02:13.790> me<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.780> went<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.440> my

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
of a difference for me so I went to my

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.699 
of a difference for me so I went to my
local<00:02:16.879> Walgreens<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.720> for<00:02:17.840> five<00:02:18.049> bucks<00:02:18.319> bald
