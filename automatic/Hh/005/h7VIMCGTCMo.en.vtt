00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.309 

well<00:00:01.170> when<00:00:01.350> I<00:00:01.380> was<00:00:01.669> cleaning<00:00:02.669> up<00:00:02.939> my<00:00:03.179> valves<00:00:03.780> in

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
well when I was cleaning up my valves in

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.780 
well when I was cleaning up my valves in
these<00:00:04.650> AFR<00:00:05.310> heads<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:06.859> little<00:00:07.859> while<00:00:08.160> ago<00:00:08.340> I

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
these AFR heads a little while ago I

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.370 
these AFR heads a little while ago I
found<00:00:09.120> something<00:00:09.660> there's<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.900> little<00:00:10.200> bit

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
found something there's a little bit

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.690 
found something there's a little bit
disconcerting<00:00:12.530> I've<00:00:13.530> mentioned<00:00:13.950> before<00:00:13.980> that

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
disconcerting I've mentioned before that

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.130 
disconcerting I've mentioned before that
this<00:00:15.179> engine<00:00:15.690> only<00:00:16.170> had<00:00:16.470> maybe<00:00:16.710> 60<00:00:17.220> 70<00:00:17.250> runs

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
this engine only had maybe 60 70 runs

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.980 
this engine only had maybe 60 70 runs
and<00:00:19.310> I<00:00:21.650> found<00:00:22.650> some<00:00:23.400> valves<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.359> were<00:00:24.539> not

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
and I found some valves that were not

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.080 
and I found some valves that were not
very<00:00:25.260> good<00:00:25.380> shape<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:28.160> actually<00:00:29.160> bad<00:00:29.760> enough

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
very good shape and actually bad enough

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.950 
very good shape and actually bad enough
if<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.420> look<00:00:30.449> at<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.880> get<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> close<00:00:33.270> picture

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
if you look at this get a close picture

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.000 
if you look at this get a close picture
that<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.860> valve<00:00:35.809> from<00:00:36.809> what<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.140> tell<00:00:37.350> is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
that that valve from what I can tell is

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.850 
that that valve from what I can tell is
cracked<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.270> whole<00:00:39.510> way<00:00:39.690> around<00:00:40.140> there<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
cracked the whole way around there that

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.330 
cracked the whole way around there that
head<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.730> some<00:00:42.329> point<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:43.590> coming<00:00:43.980> off<00:00:44.719> and

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
head at some point was coming off and

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
head at some point was coming off and
quite<00:00:47.340> honestly<00:00:47.480> now<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.690> I'm<00:00:48.809> seeing<00:00:49.110> this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
quite honestly now that I'm seeing this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.549 
quite honestly now that I'm seeing this
I'm<00:00:49.620> starting<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.070> wonder<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:54.140> in<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
I'm starting to wonder if that in the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.639 
I'm starting to wonder if that in the
long<00:00:55.739> run<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.010> rod<00:00:56.460> bearing<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.379> spun<00:00:58.379> may

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
long run that rod bearing that spun may

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.869 
long run that rod bearing that spun may
have<00:00:58.800> been<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> bit<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> mixed<00:00:59.730> blessing

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
have been a bit of a mixed blessing

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.080 
have been a bit of a mixed blessing
because<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:01.430> well<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.579> caused<00:01:02.820> some

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
because that well that caused some

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.010 
because that well that caused some
damage<00:01:03.559> was<00:01:04.559> nothing<00:01:05.519> compared<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.360> this

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
damage was nothing compared to what this

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.539 
damage was nothing compared to what this
on<00:01:07.350> valve<00:01:07.680> head<00:01:07.950> coming<00:01:08.250> off<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.869> say<00:01:09.869> 68<00:01:10.650> 7,000

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
on valve head coming off it say 68 7,000

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.030 
on valve head coming off it say 68 7,000
rpms<00:01:12.000> would<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.360> been<00:01:13.189> and<00:01:14.509> these<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
rpms would have been and these are the

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.460 
rpms would have been and these are the
either<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.250> valves<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.170> AFR<00:01:19.170> supplies<00:01:21.470> are

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
either the valves that AFR supplies are

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.289 
either the valves that AFR supplies are
the<00:01:22.680> AFR<00:01:24.560> 7255<00:01:26.390> made<00:01:27.390> by<00:01:28.100> died<00:01:29.100> car<00:01:29.759> valve

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the AFR 7255 made by died car valve

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.679 
the AFR 7255 made by died car valve
which<00:01:31.369> if<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> little<00:01:33.030> bit<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.299> research

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
which if you do a little bit of research

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.230 
which if you do a little bit of research
these<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.409> particular<00:01:34.790> set<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.909> heads<00:01:36.060> was

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
these this particular set of heads was

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.109 
these this particular set of heads was
bought<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.590> 2006<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.340> has<00:01:38.520> changed<00:01:38.549> I

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
bought in 2006 so this has changed I

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.660 
bought in 2006 so this has changed I
think<00:01:39.420> since<00:01:39.720> then<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.799> these<00:01:41.040> particular

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
think since then but these particular

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.850 
think since then but these particular
valve<00:01:41.970> would<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.540> been<00:01:42.750> made<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.020> believe<00:01:43.320> in

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
valve would have been made I believe in

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.069 
valve would have been made I believe in
India

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
India

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:52.100 
India
yeah<00:01:46.079> typical<00:01:48.380> not<00:01:49.380> sure<00:01:50.329> why<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.899> an

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
yeah typical not sure why this was an

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.030 
yeah typical not sure why this was an
issue<00:01:52.320> why<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.009> happened<00:01:53.490> also<00:01:53.939> got<00:01:55.040> an

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
issue why that happened also got an

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.760 
issue why that happened also got an
exhaust<00:01:56.430> valve<00:01:56.880> here<00:01:59.060> with<00:02:00.110> some<00:02:01.110> cracks<00:02:01.469> as

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
exhaust valve here with some cracks as

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.600 
exhaust valve here with some cracks as
well

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
well

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.860 
well
see<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.420> smaller<00:02:04.780> is<00:02:04.960> due<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:07.330> other<00:02:07.480> one<00:02:07.660> had

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
see the smaller is due the other one had

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.440 
see the smaller is due the other one had
ya<00:02:08.650> heard

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
ya heard

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.300 
ya heard
yeah<00:02:10.450> I've<00:02:10.900> got<00:02:10.960> some<00:02:11.140> exhaust<00:02:11.680> valves<00:02:12.190> with

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
yeah I've got some exhaust valves with

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.880 
yeah I've got some exhaust valves with
some<00:02:12.490> cracking<00:02:13.090> -<00:02:13.330> let's<00:02:13.810> spin<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:14.680> around

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
some cracking - let's spin this around

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.380 
some cracking - let's spin this around
slowly<00:02:15.520> see<00:02:16.210> if<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.420> can<00:02:16.630> see<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.050> cracks

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
slowly see if you can see the cracks

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.060 
slowly see if you can see the cracks
it's<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.480> little<00:02:19.660> bit<00:02:19.810> tough<00:02:20.080> filled<00:02:20.350> with<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
it's a little bit tough filled with the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.120 
it's a little bit tough filled with the
glare<00:02:21.520> but<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:22.120> think<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.290> see<00:02:23.590> if<00:02:23.710> I<00:02:23.890> turn

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
glare but I think you can see if I turn

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.230 
glare but I think you can see if I turn
this<00:02:24.340> low<00:02:24.640> enough<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:29.700> kind<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.790> see<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.120> off

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
this low enough you kind of see it off

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.560 
this low enough you kind of see it off
to<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.510> side<00:02:31.810> there<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:34.320> yeah<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.970> valve<00:02:37.360> is

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
to the side there but yeah that valve is

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.980 
to the side there but yeah that valve is
cracked<00:02:37.990> dues<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:39.100> vomit<00:02:39.610> cracked<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.270> then

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
cracked dues to vomit cracked and then

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.280 
cracked dues to vomit cracked and then
this<00:02:41.260> one<00:02:41.500> here<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:43.120> exhaust<00:02:43.660> valve<00:02:43.990> has

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
this one here this exhaust valve has

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.880 
this one here this exhaust valve has
this<00:02:44.740> funny<00:02:45.190> bubbling<00:02:45.970> on<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:47.260> back<00:02:47.470> side<00:02:47.860> of

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
this funny bubbling on the back side of

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.250 
this funny bubbling on the back side of
it<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.490> don't<00:02:49.000> know<00:02:49.090> what's<00:02:49.300> what's<00:02:49.870> up<00:02:50.080> with

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
it I don't know what's what's up with

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.910 
it I don't know what's what's up with
that<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:52.180> can<00:02:52.330> see<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.690> there<00:02:52.990> that's<00:02:53.740> not

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
that you can see it there that's not

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.800 
that you can see it there that's not
like<00:02:54.130> these<00:02:54.340> valves<00:02:54.790> have<00:02:54.880> been<00:02:55.030> overheated<00:02:55.690> I

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
like these valves have been overheated I

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.290 
like these valves have been overheated I
mean<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.980> way<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.130> clean<00:02:57.550> these<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.910> put<00:02:58.120> them

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
mean I the way I clean these I put them

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.830 
mean I the way I clean these I put them
in<00:02:58.480> my<00:02:58.560> wave<00:02:59.560> fired<00:03:00.250> up<00:03:00.460> to<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.730> highest<00:03:01.360> speed

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
in my wave fired up to the highest speed

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.200 
in my wave fired up to the highest speed
and<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.140> use<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.410> fine<00:03:02.920> scotch<00:03:03.370> brite<00:03:03.670> pad<00:03:03.700> on<00:03:04.180> it

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
and I use a fine scotch brite pad on it

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.430 
and I use a fine scotch brite pad on it
and<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:06.310> literally<00:03:06.610> took<00:03:06.880> no<00:03:07.090> time<00:03:07.390> at<00:03:07.420> all<00:03:07.690> it

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
and it literally took no time at all it

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.960 
and it literally took no time at all it
took<00:03:08.620> all<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.980> pause<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.340> off<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.790> can

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
took all the pause this off and you can

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.110 
took all the pause this off and you can
see<00:03:10.380> it's<00:03:11.380> not<00:03:11.530> like<00:03:11.590> these<00:03:12.430> valves<00:03:12.910> have<00:03:13.000> been

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
see it's not like these valves have been

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.350 
see it's not like these valves have been
overheated<00:03:13.600> or<00:03:14.430> anything<00:03:15.430> like<00:03:15.730> that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
overheated or anything like that

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.250 
overheated or anything like that
I<00:03:16.390> mean<00:03:16.600> it's<00:03:18.120> look<00:03:19.120> like<00:03:19.330> a<00:03:19.360> happy<00:03:19.600> but<00:03:19.989> used

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
I mean it's look like a happy but used

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.880 
I mean it's look like a happy but used
actually<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:22.260> such<00:03:23.260> good<00:03:23.530> shape

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
actually so such good shape

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.580 
actually so such good shape
you<00:03:24.340> know<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.520> seat<00:03:24.790> isn't<00:03:25.000> pitted<00:03:25.570> or<00:03:25.810> you

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
you know the seat isn't pitted or you

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.560 
you know the seat isn't pitted or you
know<00:03:26.650> say<00:03:27.100> like<00:03:27.280> if<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.550> exhaust<00:03:28.000> valve<00:03:28.360> had

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
know say like if this exhaust valve had

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.650 
know say like if this exhaust valve had
been<00:03:28.720> overheated<00:03:29.550> then<00:03:30.550> you<00:03:31.120> would<00:03:31.239> be<00:03:31.360> seeing

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
been overheated then you would be seeing

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.720 
been overheated then you would be seeing
signs<00:03:31.959> of<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.320> somewhere<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:33.250> seat<00:03:33.520> would

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
signs of that somewhere the seat would

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.380 
signs of that somewhere the seat would
be<00:03:34.500> pretty<00:03:35.500> bad<00:03:35.680> shape<00:03:36.070> or<00:03:36.520> you<00:03:37.270> know<00:03:39.390> you

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
be pretty bad shape or you know you

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.030 
be pretty bad shape or you know you
would<00:03:40.540> have<00:03:40.570> some<00:03:43.080> edging<00:03:44.080> on<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.320> face<00:03:44.590> of<00:03:44.620> it

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
would have some edging on the face of it

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.729 
would have some edging on the face of it
so<00:03:45.459> on<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:45.850> forth<00:03:46.300> so<00:03:46.600> this<00:03:47.290> thing<00:03:47.530> hasn't

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
so on and so forth so this thing hasn't

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.979 
so on and so forth so this thing hasn't
been<00:03:47.920> overheated<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.760> don't<00:03:49.690> know<00:03:49.750> what's

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
been overheated I don't know what's

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.680 
been overheated I don't know what's
going<00:03:50.260> on<00:03:50.760> this<00:03:51.760> fells<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:53.220> same<00:03:54.220> way<00:03:54.690> excellent

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
to call a Fr a Monday I'm just digging

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.380 
to call a Fr a Monday I'm just digging
around<00:04:11.140> on<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.530> internet<00:04:11.860> some<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:12.490> through

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
around on the internet some and through

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.300 
around on the internet some and through
my<00:04:13.540> own<00:04:13.660> personal<00:04:14.170> experience<00:04:14.800> when<00:04:15.280> I

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
my own personal experience when I

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.099 
my own personal experience when I
originally<00:04:16.299> purchased

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
originally purchased

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.899 
originally purchased
heads<00:04:17.469> and<00:04:17.620> they<00:04:17.680> had<00:04:17.889> the<00:04:18.039> wrong<00:04:18.189> valve<00:04:18.579> locks

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
heads and they had the wrong valve locks

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:23.879 
heads and they had the wrong valve locks
on<00:04:19.150> them<00:04:19.769> I<00:04:20.769> think<00:04:22.229> they'll<00:04:23.229> probably<00:04:23.259> make

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
on them I think they'll probably make

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.089 
on them I think they'll probably make
things<00:04:24.580> right<00:04:24.969> on<00:04:25.000> these<00:04:25.360> three<00:04:25.750> valves<00:04:26.319> but<00:04:26.710> I

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
things right on these three valves but I

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:28.770 
things right on these three valves but I
don't<00:04:27.550> have<00:04:27.729> a<00:04:27.759> whole<00:04:27.969> lot<00:04:28.000> of<00:04:28.240> faith<00:04:28.449> in<00:04:28.689> the

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
don't have a whole lot of faith in the

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.839 
don't have a whole lot of faith in the
other<00:04:28.930> ones<00:04:29.199> the<00:04:29.860> other<00:04:29.889> ones<00:04:30.159> look<00:04:30.310> good<00:04:30.550> I

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
other ones the other ones look good I

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.730 
other ones the other ones look good I
mean<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.360> haven't<00:04:31.659> seen<00:04:31.930> anything<00:04:32.229> else<00:04:32.530> and

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
mean I haven't seen anything else and

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.820 
mean I haven't seen anything else and
the<00:04:32.830> other<00:04:32.949> ones<00:04:33.189> that<00:04:34.080> would<00:04:35.080> cause<00:04:35.259> me<00:04:35.530> think

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
the other ones that would cause me think

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.619 
the other ones that would cause me think
there's<00:04:36.009> any<00:04:36.189> sort<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.550> problem<00:04:37.060> but<00:04:37.449> at<00:04:37.539> the

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
there's any sort of problem but at the

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.980 
there's any sort of problem but at the
same<00:04:37.840> time<00:04:38.169> I<00:04:38.560> have<00:04:39.219> three<00:04:39.580> of<00:04:39.699> them<00:04:39.990> that

same time I have three of them that

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.110 
same time I have three of them that
doggone<00:04:41.439> near<00:04:41.710> failed<00:04:42.069> in<00:04:43.889> 60<00:04:44.889> to<00:04:44.919> 70<00:04:45.460> runs<00:04:45.699> I'm

doggone near failed in 60 to 70 runs I'm
not<00:04:46.330> sure<00:04:46.569> I<00:04:46.629> want<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:46.990> trust<00:04:47.199> all<00:04:47.439> the<00:04:47.560> rest<00:04:47.740> of

has<00:04:53.830> any<00:04:54.069> domestically<00:04:54.909> made<00:04:55.090> valves<00:04:55.659> anymore

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
has any domestically made valves anymore

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.700 
has any domestically made valves anymore
as<00:04:56.500> far<00:04:56.529> as<00:04:56.860> domestic<00:04:57.159> forgings<00:04:57.939> and

domestically machine probably not

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.589 
domestically machine probably not
maybe<00:05:02.110> faria<00:05:02.650> but<00:05:03.550> i<00:05:03.580> looked<00:05:03.849> in<00:05:03.969> her<00:05:04.090> catalog

maybe faria but i looked in her catalog

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:05.969 
maybe faria but i looked in her catalog

and i couldn't find any that were the

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.119 
and i couldn't find any that were the
same<00:05:06.569> length<00:05:07.569> is<00:05:07.840> what<00:05:08.020> these<00:05:08.229> valves<00:05:08.710> are<00:05:08.860> I

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:09.129 
same length is what these valves are I

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.820 
same length is what these valves are I
don't<00:05:09.479> if<00:05:10.479> I<00:05:10.659> can<00:05:10.689> help<00:05:11.050> but<00:05:11.229> I<00:05:11.349> don't<00:05:11.529> want<00:05:11.740> to

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
don't if I can help but I don't want to

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.230 
don't if I can help but I don't want to
change<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.009> length<00:05:15.219> on<00:05:15.460> them<00:05:15.580> you<00:05:15.699> I<00:05:15.729> do<00:05:15.879> that

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
change the length on them you I do that

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.790 
change the length on them you I do that
I'm<00:05:16.509> gonna<00:05:16.629> have<00:05:16.779> to<00:05:16.870> get<00:05:16.990> new<00:05:17.050> lengths<00:05:17.469> push

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
I'm gonna have to get new lengths push

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.339 
I'm gonna have to get new lengths push
rods<00:05:18.099> and<00:05:18.460> all<00:05:19.029> that<00:05:19.270> messing<00:05:19.539> around<00:05:19.779> and

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
rods and all that messing around and

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.339 
rods and all that messing around and
probably<00:05:20.860> have<00:05:21.009> to<00:05:21.690> do<00:05:22.690> quite<00:05:22.960> a<00:05:22.990> bit<00:05:23.050> more

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
probably have to do quite a bit more

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.670 
probably have to do quite a bit more
shimming<00:05:23.860> I'd<00:05:24.069> rather<00:05:24.310> have<00:05:24.639> to<00:05:24.849> do<00:05:25.029> on<00:05:25.680> my

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
shimming I'd rather have to do on my

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.999 
shimming I'd rather have to do on my
valve<00:05:26.949> springs<00:05:27.719> but<00:05:28.719> yeah<00:05:28.990> that's<00:05:29.289> kind<00:05:29.949> of

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
valve springs but yeah that's kind of

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:31.159 
valve springs but yeah that's kind of
disappointing

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
disappointing

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.529 
disappointing
and<00:05:32.169> also<00:05:32.560> when<00:05:33.039> I<00:05:33.069> disassembled<00:05:33.909> all<00:05:34.000> this

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
and also when I disassembled all this

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:37.709 
and also when I disassembled all this
I<00:05:34.569> found<00:05:35.440> a<00:05:35.620> valve<00:05:35.860> lock<00:05:36.219> that<00:05:36.819> was<00:05:36.969> split<00:05:37.419> as

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 
I found a valve lock that was split as

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.159 
I found a valve lock that was split as
well<00:05:38.199> and<00:05:39.389> you<00:05:40.389> know<00:05:40.449> we're<00:05:40.629> not<00:05:40.719> talking

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
well and you know we're not talking

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.920 
well and you know we're not talking
about<00:05:41.289> I<00:05:41.789> can<00:05:42.789> see<00:05:43.000> if<00:05:43.089> this<00:05:43.270> will<00:05:43.479> say<00:05:43.690> like<00:05:43.870> a

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
about I can see if this will say like a

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.969 
about I can see if this will say like a

super stock spec cam where you've got

solid<00:05:55.089> roller<00:05:55.270> cam<00:05:55.659> I<00:05:55.689> think<00:05:57.389> I<00:05:58.389> think<00:05:58.810> they

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
solid roller cam I think I think they

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.499 
solid roller cam I think I think they
call<00:05:59.139> it<00:05:59.169> the<00:05:59.259> XC<00:05:59.740> 292<00:06:00.610> whether<00:06:01.710> 621<00:06:02.710> intake

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
call it the XC 292 whether 621 intake

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.050 
call it the XC 292 whether 621 intake
627<00:06:04.509> left<00:06:04.689> exhaust<00:06:05.139> and<00:06:05.680> I<00:06:06.639> can't<00:06:06.879> remember

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
627 left exhaust and I can't remember

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.510 
627 left exhaust and I can't remember
exactly<00:06:07.569> what<00:06:07.719> 50,000<00:06:08.589> station<00:06:09.069> is<00:06:09.189> I<00:06:09.310> think

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
exactly what 50,000 station is I think

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.149 
exactly what 50,000 station is I think
it's<00:06:09.669> like<00:06:09.849> 258<00:06:10.569> and<00:06:10.689> 262<00:06:11.500> somewhere<00:06:12.039> in<00:06:12.099> that

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
it's like 258 and 262 somewhere in that

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:18.890 
it's like 258 and 262 somewhere in that
area<00:06:13.560> but<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.990> only<00:06:17.469> turning<00:06:17.860> this<00:06:17.979> saying

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
area but and only turning this saying

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.409 
area but and only turning this saying
6800<00:06:19.900> rpm<00:06:20.319> maybe<00:06:20.740> 7000<00:06:21.610> just<00:06:21.789> a<00:06:21.879> couple<00:06:22.089> times

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
6800 rpm maybe 7000 just a couple times

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.439 
6800 rpm maybe 7000 just a couple times
and<00:06:22.629> find<00:06:22.839> it<00:06:22.930> then<00:06:23.080> run<00:06:23.259> it<00:06:23.349> quicker<00:06:23.589> so<00:06:24.449> 6,800

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
and find it then run it quicker so 6,800

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.219 
and find it then run it quicker so 6,800
was<00:06:25.569> my<00:06:25.690> shift<00:06:25.959> point<00:06:26.259> from<00:06:26.620> there<00:06:26.800> on<00:06:26.919> out

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
was my shift point from there on out

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:29.839 
was my shift point from there on out
seems<00:06:28.499> to<00:06:28.650> me<00:06:28.770> like<00:06:28.979> this<00:06:29.159> stuff<00:06:29.430> should<00:06:29.610> last

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
seems to me like this stuff should last

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:34.459 
seems to me like this stuff should last
longer<00:06:30.180> than<00:06:30.449> what<00:06:31.080> it<00:06:31.199> did<00:06:32.180> but<00:06:33.180> I<00:06:33.509> just

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469 
longer than what it did but I just

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:36.679 
longer than what it did but I just
thought<00:06:34.650> I'd<00:06:34.830> show<00:06:34.919> you<00:06:35.159> this<00:06:35.430> and<00:06:35.759> I'll<00:06:36.479> be

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:36.689 
thought I'd show you this and I'll be

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:40.100 
thought I'd show you this and I'll be
calling<00:06:36.870> AFR<00:06:37.529> a<00:06:37.560> Monday<00:06:38.009> and<00:06:38.479> they'll<00:06:39.479> send<00:06:39.960> me

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
calling AFR a Monday and they'll send me

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.659 
calling AFR a Monday and they'll send me
some<00:06:40.319> they're<00:06:40.650> not<00:06:40.740> I<00:06:40.770> replace<00:06:41.159> all<00:06:41.400> of<00:06:41.460> them

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669 
some they're not I replace all of them

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.540 
some they're not I replace all of them
I'm<00:06:41.849> sure<00:06:42.060> because<00:06:42.449> they're<00:06:42.719> not<00:06:42.810> all<00:06:42.990> junk

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
I'm sure because they're not all junk

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.249 
I'm sure because they're not all junk
but<00:06:44.550> hopefully<00:06:45.150> he'll<00:06:45.210> send<00:06:45.599> me<00:06:45.659> these<00:06:45.870> three

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
but hopefully he'll send me these three

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.050 
but hopefully he'll send me these three
new<00:06:46.680> ones<00:06:46.889> and<00:06:47.159> then<00:06:47.249> I'm<00:06:47.400> gonna<00:06:47.520> have<00:06:47.610> to<00:06:47.699> make

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
new ones and then I'm gonna have to make

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.550 
new ones and then I'm gonna have to make
a<00:06:48.090> determination<00:06:48.479> on<00:06:48.960> whether<00:06:49.169> I<00:06:49.319> want<00:06:49.499> to

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
a determination on whether I want to

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.339 
a determination on whether I want to
trust<00:06:49.770> all<00:06:50.009> the<00:06:50.099> rest<00:06:50.340> of<00:06:50.490> them<00:06:50.610> I<00:06:50.699> may<00:06:50.879> just

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
trust all the rest of them I may just

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.040 
trust all the rest of them I may just
scrap<00:06:52.349> this<00:06:52.590> whole<00:06:52.650> batch<00:06:53.009> of<00:06:53.039> Valve's<00:06:53.669> and

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
scrap this whole batch of Valve's and

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.730 
scrap this whole batch of Valve's and
find<00:06:55.050> something<00:06:55.349> else

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
find something else

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.260 
find something else
of<00:06:55.860> course<00:06:56.069> that's<00:06:56.219> another<00:06:56.430> expense<00:06:56.849> I

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
of course that's another expense I

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.260 
of course that's another expense I
really<00:06:57.659> wasn't<00:06:57.900> expecting<00:06:58.139> but<00:06:59.270> that's

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
really wasn't expecting but that's

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.649 
really wasn't expecting but that's
engine<00:07:00.629> building<00:07:01.699> well<00:07:02.699> here's<00:07:02.939> that<00:07:03.029> the

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:03.659 
engine building well here's that the

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:07.670 
engine building well here's that the
specs<00:07:04.020> on<00:07:04.169> that<00:07:04.319> cam<00:07:05.189> that<00:07:05.759> I'm<00:07:05.849> using<00:07:06.499> as<00:07:07.499> you

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
specs on that cam that I'm using as you

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.429 
specs on that cam that I'm using as you
can<00:07:07.860> see<00:07:08.159> it's<00:07:08.870> certainly<00:07:09.870> nothing<00:07:10.080> radical

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:10.439 
can see it's certainly nothing radical

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:13.909 
can see it's certainly nothing radical
and<00:07:11.270> the<00:07:12.270> valve<00:07:12.509> springs<00:07:12.900> I've<00:07:13.229> actually

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 
and the valve springs I've actually

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:17.679 
and the valve springs I've actually
after<00:07:14.789> I<00:07:14.909> rechecked<00:07:15.569> the<00:07:15.719> valve<00:07:15.930> springs<00:07:16.319> I

00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:17.689 
after I rechecked the valve springs I

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:19.700 
after I rechecked the valve springs I
found<00:07:18.689> they<00:07:18.900> were<00:07:18.960> actually<00:07:19.409> in<00:07:19.469> pretty
