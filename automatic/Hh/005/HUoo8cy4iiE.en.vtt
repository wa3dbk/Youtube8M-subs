00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.229
 make sure you take the sword no sword i 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.490
 did not take the normal way now 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:12.689
 try something let's say so here 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:16.470
 the sword and so here I am on 1 creative breaks and 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:20.009
 doesn't work well after all now when 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.530
 player opens and the stones or cutting torch in 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.200

 now when we fly as you see it 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.180

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.619
 we could ok guys move around 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.720

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.369

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.500
