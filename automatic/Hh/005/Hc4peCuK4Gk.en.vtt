00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.460 
now of course like I said the next
generation<00:01:48.030> game<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.450> grand<00:01:48.780> theft<00:01:48.810> auto<00:01:48.990> 5<00:01:49.259> is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
generation game of grand theft auto 5 is

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.960 
generation game of grand theft auto 5 is
going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:50.009> remastered<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
going to be remastered so it's going to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.600 
going to be remastered so it's going to
have<00:01:51.119> more<00:01:51.360> things<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> game<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.100> think

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
have more things in the game but I think

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.609 
have more things in the game but I think
as<00:01:53.790> far<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.210> more<00:01:54.420> will<00:01:54.600> go<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.530> go

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
as far as more will go is going to go

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.800 
as far as more will go is going to go
beyond<00:01:55.950> more<00:01:56.490> pedestrians<00:01:57.030> denser<00:01:57.390> traffic

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
beyond more pedestrians denser traffic

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.590 
beyond more pedestrians denser traffic
increase<00:01:58.740> drawback<00:01:59.189> everything<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
increase drawback everything like that I

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
increase drawback everything like that I
think<00:02:01.079> we're<00:02:01.170> going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.409> getting<00:02:01.530> DLC

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.580 
and I think they're going to carry on
doing<00:02:19.299> this<00:02:19.480> throughout<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.959> year<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:20.200> not

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
as often but if they do carry this
