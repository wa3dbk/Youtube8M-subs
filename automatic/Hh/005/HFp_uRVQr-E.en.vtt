00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
getting which aren't gonna be soaked

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.410 
getting which aren't gonna be soaked
outdated<00:03:54.959> looking<00:03:55.530> good<00:03:56.160> know<00:03:57.000> what<00:03:57.180> maybe

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
outdated looking good know what maybe

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.110 
outdated looking good know what maybe
what's<00:03:57.959> up<00:03:58.200> ladies<00:03:58.709> how<00:03:58.920> working<00:03:59.580> out<00:03:59.820> trying

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
what's up ladies how working out trying

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.060 
what's up ladies how working out trying
to<00:04:00.180> get<00:04:00.269> these<00:04:00.420> off<00:04:00.630> good<00:04:01.170> maybe<00:04:01.830> it'd<00:04:02.040> be

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
to get these off good maybe it'd be

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.740 
to get these off good maybe it'd be
easier<00:04:02.160> if<00:04:02.519> we<00:04:02.610> actually<00:04:02.790> chop<00:04:03.209> some<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.630> these

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
easier if we actually chop some of these

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.440 
easier if we actually chop some of these
cuz<00:04:04.320> they're<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.950> mean<00:04:05.160> it's<00:04:05.940> like<00:04:06.060> just<00:04:06.299> a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
cuz they're so I mean it's like just a

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.240 
cuz they're so I mean it's like just a
big<00:04:06.690> mess<00:04:06.930> up<00:04:07.140> here<00:04:07.320> so<00:04:07.500> maybe<00:04:07.709> if<00:04:07.860> we<00:04:07.920> chop

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
big mess up here so maybe if we chop

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.910 
big mess up here so maybe if we chop
this<00:04:08.519> like<00:04:09.060> half<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.570> this<00:04:09.690> post<00:04:09.959> town<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.440> think

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
this like half of this post town I think

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.230 
this like half of this post town I think
that'd<00:04:11.040> be<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.280> best<00:04:11.400> way<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.730> do<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.150> without

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
that'd be the best way to do it without

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.330 
that'd be the best way to do it without
breaking<00:04:12.540> all<00:04:12.900> these<00:04:13.110> branches<00:04:13.709> yeah<00:04:13.980> cuz

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
breaking all these branches yeah cuz

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.199 
breaking all these branches yeah cuz
it's<00:04:14.520> probably<00:04:14.760> gonna<00:04:14.880> read<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.030> little

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
it's probably gonna read a little

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.440 
it's probably gonna read a little
difficult<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.750> try<00:04:15.990> to

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
difficult to try to

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:23.890 
difficult to try to
get<00:04:16.540> that<00:04:16.690> out<00:04:16.750> of<00:04:16.900> there

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.600 

by<00:04:23.960> travelpod<00:04:24.380> member

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.310 

alright<00:04:29.610> guys<00:04:29.910> so<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.480> think<00:04:30.600> if<00:04:30.900> we<00:04:31.020> get<00:04:31.170> off

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
alright guys so I think if we get off

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.740 
alright guys so I think if we get off
these<00:04:31.530> side<00:04:31.830> plates<00:04:32.220> we'll<00:04:33.030> just<00:04:33.150> maybe<00:04:33.450> pop

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
these side plates we'll just maybe pop

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.840 
these side plates we'll just maybe pop
these<00:04:33.960> rivets<00:04:34.260> out<00:04:34.530> then<00:04:35.160> hopefully<00:04:35.580> we<00:04:35.700> can

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
these rivets out then hopefully we can

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.850 
these rivets out then hopefully we can
maybe<00:04:35.970> get<00:04:36.120> this<00:04:36.300> sidebar<00:04:36.720> off<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.260> then<00:04:37.740> the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
maybe get this sidebar off and then the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.070 
maybe get this sidebar off and then the
top<00:04:38.130> of<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:39.060> awning<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.570> then<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.810> rest<00:04:39.990> of

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
top of the awning and then the rest of

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.510 
top of the awning and then the rest of
the<00:04:40.140> framework<00:04:40.380> it's<00:04:41.070> not<00:04:41.160> going<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.370> be<00:04:41.430> the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
the framework it's not going to be the

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.880 
the framework it's not going to be the
easiest<00:04:41.820> tour<00:04:42.180> that's<00:04:42.480> for<00:04:42.660> sure<00:04:42.810> no<00:04:43.320> sir<00:04:43.680> but

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
easiest tour that's for sure no sir but

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:56.820 
easiest tour that's for sure no sir but
it's<00:04:44.040> going<00:04:44.190> to<00:04:44.250> be<00:04:44.370> sweet<00:04:47.870> there<00:04:48.870> we<00:04:49.230> go

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.249 

goodbye<00:04:57.830> roof<00:04:59.710> all<00:05:00.710> right<00:05:00.919> here<00:05:01.250> last<00:05:01.639> pieces

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
goodbye roof all right here last pieces

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.869 
goodbye roof all right here last pieces
to<00:05:03.259> make<00:05:03.409> the<00:05:03.590> framework<00:05:04.099> for<00:05:04.340> this<00:05:04.550> planter

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:04.879 
to make the framework for this planter

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.939 
to make the framework for this planter
box<00:05:05.120> yes<00:05:05.569> so<00:05:05.990> we<00:05:06.319> have<00:05:06.500> all<00:05:06.680> of<00:05:06.710> these

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
box yes so we have all of these

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.249 
box yes so we have all of these
different<00:05:07.129> compound<00:05:07.759> angles<00:05:08.180> on<00:05:08.810> these<00:05:09.020> but<00:05:09.229> I

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
different compound angles on these but I

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:10.959 
different compound angles on these but I
think<00:05:09.469> with<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.830> easiest<00:05:10.280> way<00:05:10.430> is<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.669> build

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:10.969 
think with the easiest way is to build

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:12.700 
think with the easiest way is to build
the<00:05:11.150> two<00:05:11.300> sides<00:05:11.569> up<00:05:11.810> first<00:05:12.050> yeah<00:05:12.349> then<00:05:12.620> we'll

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
the two sides up first yeah then we'll

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.439 
the two sides up first yeah then we'll
connect<00:05:13.009> it<00:05:13.159> all<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.580> framework<00:05:13.969> and<00:05:14.120> then

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
connect it all the framework and then

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.510 
connect it all the framework and then
we'll<00:05:14.569> just<00:05:14.719> face<00:05:14.960> it<00:05:14.990> with<00:05:15.379> the<00:05:15.560> cedar<00:05:15.889> cool

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
we'll just face it with the cedar cool

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.670 
we'll just face it with the cedar cool
like<00:05:16.639> it's<00:05:16.819> a<00:05:16.939> nice<00:05:17.210> flared<00:05:17.750> planter<00:05:18.469> look

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
like it's a nice flared planter look

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.089 
like it's a nice flared planter look
with<00:05:18.949> a<00:05:18.979> traditional<00:05:19.699> sighting<00:05:20.389> yeah<00:05:20.750> exactly

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
with a traditional sighting yeah exactly

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.499 
with a traditional sighting yeah exactly
excited<00:05:22.099> all<00:05:22.219> right<00:05:22.400> so<00:05:22.729> let's<00:05:23.030> go<00:05:23.240> ahead<00:05:23.270> and

00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:54.059 
we're going to use okay now this is what

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:57.049 
we're going to use okay now this is what
it<00:05:54.149> looks<00:05:54.389> like<00:05:54.629> oh<00:05:55.020> that's<00:05:55.919> beautiful<00:05:56.339> so<00:05:56.969> we

00:05:57.049 --> 00:05:57.059 
it looks like oh that's beautiful so we

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:58.279 
it looks like oh that's beautiful so we
actually<00:05:57.149> have<00:05:57.389> teak<00:05:57.539> on<00:05:57.719> the<00:05:57.809> top<00:05:58.020> and

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
actually have teak on the top and

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.279 
actually have teak on the top and
they're<00:05:58.559> actually<00:05:59.029> interlocking<00:06:00.029> deck<00:06:00.899> tiles

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
they're actually interlocking deck tiles

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.230 
they're actually interlocking deck tiles
so<00:06:02.009> it<00:06:02.129> has<00:06:02.159> this<00:06:02.339> nice<00:06:02.520> little<00:06:02.699> plastic
