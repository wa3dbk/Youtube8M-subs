an overview of the game just the setting
obviously<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.290> nations<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.770> guess<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.850> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
obviously we are nations I guess it's a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.240 
obviously we are nations I guess it's a
civilization<00:00:42.629> based<00:00:42.840> civilization<00:00:43.829> game<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
civilization based civilization game and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.029 
civilization based civilization game and
everybody<00:00:45.239> has<00:00:45.930> their<00:00:46.170> own<00:00:46.200> board<00:00:46.590> which

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
everybody has their own board which

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.430 
everybody has their own board which
represents<00:00:47.700> their<00:00:47.850> own<00:00:48.030> nation<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.870> you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
represents their own nation that you

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
represents their own nation that you
develop<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> game<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.719> try<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.750> make<00:00:52.050> it

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
develop in the game and try to make it

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.889 
develop in the game and try to make it
prosperous<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:54.739> basically<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.750> lots<00:00:57.750> of

what's a new that attracted you to the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.069 
what's a new that attracted you to the
game<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.409> made<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.619> want<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.890> publish<00:01:47.220> it

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
game that made you want to publish it

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.100 
game that made you want to publish it
well<00:01:49.079> let's<00:01:49.920> say<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.640> guess<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.329> german-style

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
well let's say I guess a german-style

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.649 
well let's say I guess a german-style
game

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
game

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.660 
game
the<00:01:54.969> basically<00:01:55.969> apart<00:01:56.509> from<00:01:56.749> the<00:01:56.899> other

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
the basically apart from the other

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.950 
the basically apart from the other
civilization<00:01:58.670> games<00:01:58.909> that<00:01:59.359> doesn't<00:01:59.810> have

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
civilization games that doesn't have

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.340 
civilization games that doesn't have
that<00:02:00.170> much<00:02:00.350> direct<00:02:00.799> conflict<00:02:01.789> as<00:02:02.149> a<00:02:02.210> as<00:02:02.899> far<00:02:03.229> as

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
that much direct conflict as a as far as

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.099 
that much direct conflict as a as far as
the<00:02:03.500> war<00:02:03.829> come<00:02:04.069> so<00:02:04.399> basically<00:02:05.000> it's<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:05.329> bit

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
the war come so basically it's a bit

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.550 
the war come so basically it's a bit
more<00:02:06.259> civil<00:02:06.590> game<00:02:06.829> in<00:02:07.069> that<00:02:07.340> way<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:08.560> other

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
more civil game in that way so other

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.470 
more civil game in that way so other
games<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:09.979> I've<00:02:10.190> played<00:02:10.399> we<00:02:10.670> were<00:02:10.849> I<00:02:11.120> didn't

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
games that I've played we were I didn't

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.580 
games that I've played we were I didn't
like<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.830> direct<00:02:13.519> conflict<00:02:14.319> only<00:02:15.319> so

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
like the the direct conflict only so

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.160 
like the the direct conflict only so
that's<00:02:15.890> probably<00:02:16.400> major<00:02:17.000> issue<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:17.599> me<00:02:17.930> but

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
that's probably major issue for me but

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.199 
that's probably major issue for me but
overall<00:02:18.590> everything<00:02:18.950> worked<00:02:19.760> very

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
overall everything worked very

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.500 
overall everything worked very
seamlessly<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.019> I<00:02:21.610> started<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.760> sound<00:02:23.239> like<00:02:23.450> a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
seamlessly so I started to sound like a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.770 
seamlessly so I started to sound like a
no-brainer<00:02:23.780> for<00:02:24.349> publishing<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.540> what's

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
no-brainer for publishing so so what's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.330 
no-brainer for publishing so so what's
the<00:02:26.959> setup<00:02:27.170> over<00:02:27.470> here<00:02:27.500> these<00:02:27.920> different

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the setup over here these different

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.530 
the setup over here these different
different<00:02:28.819> errors<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.269> we're<00:02:29.420> going

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
different errors that we're going

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.059 
different errors that we're going
through<00:02:29.660> or<00:02:29.989> how<00:02:30.019> are<00:02:30.530> these<00:02:30.620> latest

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
through or how are these latest

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.089 
through or how are these latest
basically<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.910> effort<00:02:32.329> each<00:02:32.599> each<00:02:33.319> round<00:02:33.650> we

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
basically the effort each each round we

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.630 
basically the effort each each round we
set<00:02:34.700> up<00:02:34.849> a<00:02:35.030> line<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.870> cards<00:02:36.349> and<00:02:36.560> from<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.370> row

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
set up a line of cards and from this row

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.610 
set up a line of cards and from this row
you<00:02:37.879> can<00:02:38.030> purchase<00:02:38.239> cards<00:02:38.750> for<00:02:38.959> one<00:02:39.110> money<00:02:39.379> and

units<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.609> the<00:03:04.849> you<00:03:05.450> can<00:03:05.599> upgrade<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:06.650> have

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
units that the you can upgrade you have

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.819 
units that the you can upgrade you have
the<00:03:07.239> some<00:03:08.239> of<00:03:08.359> the<00:03:08.389> basic<00:03:08.989> buildings<00:03:09.470> from

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
the some of the basic buildings from

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.210 
the some of the basic buildings from
yours<00:03:10.069> on<00:03:10.340> your<00:03:10.519> starting<00:03:10.940> starting<00:03:12.220> board

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
yours on your starting starting board

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.349 
yours on your starting starting board
and<00:03:13.569> also<00:03:14.569> a<00:03:14.599> very<00:03:15.440> simple<00:03:16.000> military<00:03:17.000> unit

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
and also a very simple military unit

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.740 
and also a very simple military unit
that<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:18.019> can<00:03:18.169> build<00:03:18.829> but<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.000> everything

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
that you can build but the everything

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.050 
that you can build but the everything
else<00:03:20.930> here<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.590> usually<00:03:22.099> always<00:03:22.370> better<00:03:22.849> and

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
else here is usually always better and

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.050 
else here is usually always better and
whence<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.959> pages<00:03:24.650> go<00:03:24.859> forward<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.700> they<00:03:25.880> get

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
whence the pages go forward and they get

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.420 
whence the pages go forward and they get
better<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.480> better<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.200> need<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.739> upgrade

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
better and better so you need to upgrade

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.659 
better and better so you need to upgrade
your<00:03:28.970> things<00:03:29.299> all<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.599> time<00:03:30.459> so<00:03:31.459> how<00:03:31.609> many

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
your things all the time so how many

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.270 
your things all the time so how many
cards<00:03:31.970> are<00:03:32.150> we<00:03:32.209> talking<00:03:32.510> about<00:03:32.569> in<00:03:32.840> terms<00:03:32.870> of

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
cards are we talking about in terms of

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.370 
cards are we talking about in terms of
what's<00:03:34.280> coming<00:03:34.430> out<00:03:34.669> here<00:03:34.880> her<00:03:35.269> age<00:03:35.630> we<00:03:36.139> have

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
what's coming out here her age we have

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.250 
what's coming out here her age we have
something<00:03:37.099> like<00:03:38.230> 60<00:03:39.230> cards<00:03:39.650> 70<00:03:40.099> cards<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:41.260> each

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
something like 60 cards 70 cards so each

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.960 
something like 60 cards 70 cards so each
age<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:43.040> each<00:03:43.160> game<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.639> going<00:03:43.819> to<00:03:43.910> be

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
age and each game is going to be

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.849 
age and each game is going to be
completely<00:03:44.450> different<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.440> the

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
completely different the the

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.970 
completely different the the
distribution<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.940> card<00:03:47.150> is<00:03:47.299> random<00:03:47.780> and

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
distribution of the card is random and

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.500 
distribution of the card is random and
when<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.069> have<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.370> many<00:03:49.609> cards<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.209> only

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
when you have that many cards and only

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.909 
when you have that many cards and only
only<00:03:51.169> about<00:03:51.560> 15<00:03:52.400> 20<00:03:52.549> are<00:03:52.910> used<00:03:53.510> for<00:03:54.230> age<00:03:54.410> so

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
only about 15 20 are used for age so

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.870 
only about 15 20 are used for age so
gives<00:03:55.879> a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
gives a

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.130 
gives a
lots<00:03:57.630> of<00:03:58.220> different<00:03:59.220> end<00:03:59.340> results<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.780> what

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
lots of different end results and what

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.570 
lots of different end results and what
were<00:04:01.410> we<00:04:01.650> tracking<00:04:01.980> on<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.280> board<00:04:02.460> here

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
were we tracking on the board here

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.070 
were we tracking on the board here
different<00:04:03.090> different<00:04:03.360> elements<00:04:03.720> have<00:04:03.870> the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
different different elements have the

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.800 
different different elements have the
other<00:04:04.200> tracking<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.830> military<00:04:05.370> power

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
stability accumulated culture and then

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.360 
stability accumulated culture and then
we<00:04:11.670> have<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.090> markers<00:04:12.570> for<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.840> rounds<00:04:13.710> we

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
we have the markers for the rounds we

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.820 
we have the markers for the rounds we
have<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.850> slots<00:04:15.660> for<00:04:15.840> architects<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.680> you

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
have the slots for architects that you

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.610 
have the slots for architects that you
need<00:04:17.010> for<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.430> building<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.470> building<00:04:19.470> the

need for the building of building the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.979 
need for the building of building the
wonders<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.370> then<00:04:20.700> we<00:04:20.910> have<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.360> difficulty

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
wonders and then we have this difficulty

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.130 
wonders and then we have this difficulty
level<00:04:22.290> that<00:04:22.700> you<00:04:23.700> can<00:04:23.850> have<00:04:24.420> different

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
level that you can have different

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.110 
level that you can have different
difficulties<00:04:25.770> for<00:04:26.010> beginners<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.790> experts

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
difficulties for beginners and experts

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.950 
difficulties for beginners and experts
so<00:04:27.950> what<00:04:28.950> changes<00:04:29.430> for<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.420> you're<00:04:30.810> just

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.600 
so what changes for that you're just
starting<00:04:31.260> components<00:04:31.860> or<00:04:31.980> other<00:04:32.220> other

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
starting components or other other
