00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
and apply the bleach on the back of the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.550 
and apply the bleach on the back of the
hair<00:02:14.220> as<00:02:14.400> well<00:02:14.819> this<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:15.720> ensuring<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
hair as well this is just ensuring that

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.550 
hair as well this is just ensuring that
your<00:02:17.220> entire<00:02:17.580> section<00:02:18.360> will<00:02:18.750> be<00:02:18.780> colored<00:02:19.440> and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.680 

now<00:02:25.560> I'm<00:02:25.770> taking<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.310> comb<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.330> combing

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
now I'm taking a comb and just combing

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.540 
now I'm taking a comb and just combing
through<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.260> section<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.370> just

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
through that section and this is just

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.040 
through that section and this is just
going<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.880> give<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.180> an<00:02:30.360> even<00:02:30.840> distribution

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
going to give you an even distribution

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.890 
going to give you an even distribution
so<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:32.280> don't<00:02:32.489> have<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.790> worry<00:02:33.030> about<00:02:33.209> certain

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
so you don't have to worry about certain

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.470 
so you don't have to worry about certain
areas<00:02:34.170> not<00:02:34.650> being<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.670> blonde<00:02:35.970> color<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.420> guess

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
areas not being a blonde color I guess

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.809 
areas not being a blonde color I guess
now<00:02:37.230> I'm<00:02:37.380> taking<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.770> piece<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.069> aluminum<00:02:38.550> foil

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
now I'm taking a piece of aluminum foil

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.839 
now I'm taking a piece of aluminum foil
and<00:02:39.270> folding<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.170> hair<00:02:40.440> into<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.860> foil<00:02:41.190> which

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
and folding the hair into the foil which

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.209 
and folding the hair into the foil which
will<00:02:42.090> allow<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.480> hair<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.900> process<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.890> turn

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
will allow the hair to process and turn

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.600 
will allow the hair to process and turn
the<00:02:44.489> color<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.819> wanted<00:02:45.239> to

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
the color I wanted to

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.940 
the color I wanted to
so<00:02:46.180> I'm<00:02:46.480> going<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.720> keep<00:02:46.930> doing<00:02:47.170> this<00:02:47.380> same

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
so I'm going to keep doing this same

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.920 
so I'm going to keep doing this same
step<00:02:48.340> throughout<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.910> entire<00:02:49.210> video<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.690> I

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
step throughout the entire video and I

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.090 
step throughout the entire video and I
want<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.170> speed<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:50.410> up<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.680> little<00:02:50.860> bit<00:02:51.010> because

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
want to speed it up a little bit because

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.820 
want to speed it up a little bit because
it's<00:02:51.400> pretty<00:02:52.060> self-explanatory<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:53.260> also

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
it's pretty self-explanatory so also

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.280 
it's pretty self-explanatory so also
when<00:02:54.310> using<00:02:54.580> such<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:54.970> strong<00:02:55.390> chemical<00:02:56.080> like

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
when using such a strong chemical like

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.230 
when using such a strong chemical like
bleach<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:57.100> want<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.400> make<00:02:57.520> sure<00:02:57.550> you<00:02:57.970> have<00:02:58.210> a

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
bleach you want to make sure you have a

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.930 
bleach you want to make sure you have a
pair<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.690> gloves<00:02:59.050> on<00:02:59.410> because<00:02:59.590> this<00:03:00.550> bleach

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
pair of gloves on because this bleach

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.110 
pair of gloves on because this bleach
burns<00:03:01.720> honey<00:03:02.320> I<00:03:02.560> mean<00:03:02.830> even<00:03:03.220> when<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.640> rinse

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
burns honey I mean even when you rinse

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.500 
burns honey I mean even when you rinse
it<00:03:04.330> out<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.750> still<00:03:05.110> burns<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.490> as<00:03:07.300> I'm

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
it out it still burns and as I'm

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.540 
it out it still burns and as I'm
applying<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:08.080> bleach<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.620> noticed<00:03:09.190> that<00:03:09.370> the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
applying the bleach I noticed that the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.120 
applying the bleach I noticed that the
hair<00:03:09.820> is<00:03:10.050> changing<00:03:11.050> colors<00:03:11.410> really<00:03:11.800> really

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
hair is changing colors really really

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.430
