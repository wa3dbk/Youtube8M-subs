 often what team i play play for 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.369
 the red team is very good but 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.560
 blue 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.880
 team player has already managed to collect a bonus well 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.030
 nothing scary we will recoup now 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.370
 quickly enough all already two bases from 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.890
 two out of five more precisely 2 2 5 have already been 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.230
 captured by our friends of ours 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.910
 team mates now I will be super naruto 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.670
 bonus if you haven't collected yet it runs 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.640
 collect padla collected my bonus what 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.820
 creates something to cook impudent that creates 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.250
 become still a bonus in he where and base 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.170
 there is also empty now we say 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.969
 it damn it is not so much hepe 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.739
 lost soup of need somehow 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.199
 more accurately fall and still aim 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.180
 better in water they are in solid blocks by type 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.500
 land but okay basically 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390
 I agree that she did not die, but everything else 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.189
 will follow 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.860
 grab this more base here we have already 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.159
 1000 points from blue we only have 700 but 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.320
 watch it all quickly equalized 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.030
 still get ahead and think we will win 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.310
 she bases captured three bases of light from us 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.950
 captured now I'm still picking up 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.220
 bonus and will let you know a lot of points 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.530
 let's get ahead, and so I guess, and jump 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.159
 so do not get centurions so hard here 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.040
 to climb 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.350
 still need to have some skill but I 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.600
 climbed let's the last base we 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.369
 now perry grab i run and perry 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.930
 grab damn I dropped typing this sucks 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.759
 this is an extremely figure that I fell into the water 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.420
 including an easy target for those people 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.250
 who stayed to play against me i don't 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.810
 may well kill me just by taking a look 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.090
 me some potion or someone's 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.500
 like nuu class magic there are like 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.430
 hard whales so this is our run means 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.740
 will help us now 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.710
 grab this base see another one of them 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.340
 base now we urgently her perry fast 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.600
 capture and everything will be cool fashion 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.940
 stylish and youth 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.190
 coming off a thousand points from ours 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.900
 blue team pursuers by points 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.490
 ultimate x times ran to the base 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.010
 now they will perry capture it 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.970
 very good I see another cone and 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.130
 now it will be mine 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.470
 Easy Wines Just By The Way Who Doesn't Know Yet 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.230
 the meaning of this game is very simple you 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.060
 you can capture them more bases and for 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.160
 each base captured you are charged 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.460
 points that team wins 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.530
 gaining more than 15 thousand points and who 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.600
 gaining them faster here by the way I 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.870
 already shot arrow damn does not just 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.620
 up grab the base and the last two blocks 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.480
 left all nice base captured blue 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.870
 there are running around trying to do something but 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.400
 I think that they will not succeed 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.050
 so i want to collect bonus thanks dude 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.190
 what did you ask me ahead it was with 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.930
 your hand is very beautiful 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.290
 attractively wanted to say before 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:10.170
 thank you bro I collect a bonus and another 300 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.970
 points in the treasury of our national team is not Bai Ling 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.010
 shooting just awful it infuriates me when 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.660
 honest by the way i like on this 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.840
 the server also does not spend here wandering around and 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.150
 In short, having fallen down, they tortured you 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.760
 armor you are not out of idle talk back 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.590
 recovered cool of course but it 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.990
 small so probably I even would teach 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.670
 I wanted maybe to reserve a little bit 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.890
 all the same 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.330
 could generally destroy 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.830
 man will run for a long time then we will be in each 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.270
 any he long runs it already there 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.160
 they beat me many times 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.960
 broken bib in principle me 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.730
 it seems to be a good idea 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.830
 any curl would be for this server 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.080
 the athlete would envy our team 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.290
 which is very quickly gaining weight 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.570
 points it is just really hard really 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.330
 hard bread there and under strained and 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.480
 really pulled out another 300 bonus points 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.520
 great thank you play you big and u 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.140
 we have an hour to be 10,000 I put in all 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.450
 pyaterochka on brothers basically so 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.310
 I already look at blue probably no chance 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.890
 even get even though different situations 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.690
 there are guys as they say in advance 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.920
 guessing is impossible because different 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.150
 situation is not enough now 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.030
 someone thread will fly online with our 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.310
 team and we will be in the minority and 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.100
 it turns out that we can lose 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.049
 want blue will have very much 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.200
 to sweat to win our team i 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.510
 straight away, I run for bonuses 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.640
 I collect straight bonuses really put 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.790
 right under my feet this enjoyable 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.260
 very pleasant have this side already 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.760
 hit a bonus but basically here 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.160
 nothing remains to be done as easy 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.050
 go and collect bonuses to speed up 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.420
 our victory because of the blue left 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.340
 already few of them just clamped all five bases 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.740
 our guys we just dry 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.160
 practically triumphs over blue 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.810
 commands by the way runs are recorded it will kill 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.300
 dude, I know that at home you probably have 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.550
 you ca n't kill me all the same you 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.740
 not such a good shooting skills not 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.660
 close he is very hard to see how he is 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.030
 I stood at one place this is his class 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.950
 guys he's there some kind of mine throw you here 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.090
 So here's a human stop and we really 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.950
 13500 has a half thousand left on 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.230
 brothers now it will be extremely fast 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.000
 just really very fast very much 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.940
 we are lagging behind in blue and benefits with tremendous 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.910
 overweight in glasses and there are only 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.740
 score 500 points and in my opinion now I 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.590
 I will have time to collect his last paint boss 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.870
 my boss will be the last yes he was 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.910
