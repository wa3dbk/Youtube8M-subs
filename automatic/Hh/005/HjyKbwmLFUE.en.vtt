we're<00:00:23.040> going<00:00:23.190> to<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.340> differentiating

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
we're going to be differentiating

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
we're going to be differentiating
between<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.390> different<00:00:24.690> pumps<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.020> are

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
between the different pumps that are

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.320 
between the different pumps that are
available<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.740> our<00:00:25.890> territory<00:00:26.369> hi<00:00:26.580> Nikolay<00:00:26.910> hi

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
available in our territory hi Nikolay hi

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.320 
available in our territory hi Nikolay hi
solo<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.860> tell<00:00:28.980> us<00:00:29.040> about<00:00:29.330> water

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
solo so what can you tell us about water

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.179 
solo so what can you tell us about water
pumps<00:00:30.720> -<00:00:30.869> well<00:00:31.380> okay<00:00:31.590> there<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.919> number<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
pumps - well okay there are a number of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.350 
pumps - well okay there are a number of
different<00:00:32.520> water<00:00:32.669> pumps<00:00:32.970> that<00:00:33.060> are<00:00:33.120> available

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
different water pumps that are available

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.000 
different water pumps that are available
right<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.020> we'll<00:00:34.140> talk<00:00:34.350> about<00:00:34.470> the<00:00:34.710> booster

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
right so we'll talk about the booster

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.920 
right so we'll talk about the booster
series<00:00:35.370> first<00:00:35.670> now<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.150> dab<00:00:36.450> boost<00:00:36.810> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
series first now this is a dab boost a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.690 
series first now this is a dab boost a
silent<00:00:37.350> fire<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:37.950> also<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> booster

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
silent fire we also have a booster

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.580 
silent fire we also have a booster
silent<00:00:39.090> three<00:00:39.390> available<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:40.380> makes

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
silent three available but what makes

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.990 
silent three available but what makes
some<00:00:40.800> difference<00:00:40.829> basically<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
some difference basically it's in the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.050 
some difference basically it's in the
horsepower<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.900> this<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.320> has<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:44.190> 1.3

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
horsepower so this one has a 1.3

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.540 
horsepower so this one has a 1.3
horsepower<00:00:45.660> motor<00:00:46.170> which<00:00:46.980> might<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> little

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
horsepower motor which might be a little

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.540 
horsepower motor which might be a little
bit<00:00:47.670> better<00:00:47.790> suited<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.660> small<00:00:49.550> commercial

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
bit better suited to a small commercial

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.220 
bit better suited to a small commercial
building<00:00:51.120> or<00:00:51.270> maybe<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> large<00:00:51.750> residential

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
building or maybe a large residential

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.890 
building or maybe a large residential
home<00:00:52.680> as<00:00:53.070> opposed<00:00:53.400> to<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.580> booster<00:00:54.240> silent<00:00:54.600> 3

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
home as opposed to be booster silent 3

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.420 
home as opposed to be booster silent 3
which<00:00:55.380> has<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> three-quarter<00:00:56.070> horsepower

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
which has a three-quarter horsepower

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.550 
which has a three-quarter horsepower
motor<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:57.330> that<00:00:57.900> might<00:00:58.080> be<00:00:58.110> a<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.470> bit

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
motor and that might be a little bit

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.050 
motor and that might be a little bit
better<00:00:58.680> suited<00:00:59.130> to<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.340> small<00:00:59.610> residential

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
better suited to a small residential

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.360 
better suited to a small residential
home<00:01:00.420> ok<00:01:00.810> so<00:01:00.990> let's<00:01:01.170> talk<00:01:01.320> about<00:01:01.650> some<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.220> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
home ok so let's talk about some of the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.009 
home ok so let's talk about some of the
features<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.850> make<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> little<00:01:03.870> bit

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
features that make this a little bit

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.600 
features that make this a little bit
unique<00:01:04.379> from<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.650> ones<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.070> were<00:01:05.189> typically

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
unique from the ones that were typically

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.280 
unique from the ones that were typically
used<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.970> well<00:01:06.299> first<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.689> all<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.140> might

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
used to well first of all what you might

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.469 
used to well first of all what you might
notice<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.430> has<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.700> 2<00:01:09.270> litre

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
notice here is that this has a 2 litre

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.550 
notice here is that this has a 2 litre
pressure<00:01:10.140> tank

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
pressure tank

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.260 
pressure tank
right<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:11.009> we're<00:01:11.189> used<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> 18<00:01:12.060> litre

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
right now we're used to the 18 litre

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.780 
right now we're used to the 18 litre
pressure<00:01:12.600> tanks<00:01:12.990> which<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.320> quite<00:01:13.650> large<00:01:13.890> so

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
pressure tanks which is quite large so

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.060 
pressure tanks which is quite large so
basically<00:01:15.330> what<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.840> does<00:01:16.109> it's<00:01:16.499> it<00:01:16.829> gives

sink okay excellent so let's talk a
little<00:01:27.359> bit<00:01:27.600> more<00:01:27.869> about<00:01:28.109> this<00:01:28.289> water<00:01:28.560> cool

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
little bit more about this water cool

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.550 
little bit more about this water cool
feature<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.759> pump<00:01:30.090> right<00:01:30.359> it<00:01:30.990> gives<00:01:31.409> you

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
feature of this pump right it gives you

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.559 
feature of this pump right it gives you
options<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.759> said<00:01:32.819> earlier<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.359> can

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
options so like I said earlier you can

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:34.700 
options so like I said earlier you can
either<00:01:33.689> put<00:01:33.929> it<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.170> outside<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.679> your

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710

either put it on the outside of your
house<00:01:34.950> or<00:01:35.219> on<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> inside<00:01:35.969> of<00:01:36.119> your<00:01:36.210> house<00:01:36.390> if

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
house or on the inside of your house if

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.050 
house or on the inside of your house if
it's<00:01:36.869> an<00:01:36.960> enclosed<00:01:37.499> space<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.520> don't<00:01:38.729> need

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
it's an enclosed space you don't need

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.020 
it's an enclosed space you don't need
that<00:01:39.270> free<00:01:39.569> flow<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.840> air<00:01:40.109> right<00:01:40.950> now<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.490> so

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that free flow of air right now it's so

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.550 
that free flow of air right now it's so
what<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> cooling<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.170> would<00:01:43.259> actually

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
what the cooling that would actually

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.109 
what the cooling that would actually
extend<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:43.950> life<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.249> the<00:01:44.310> motor<00:01:44.490> over<00:01:44.609> it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
extend the life of the motor over it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.450 
extend the life of the motor over it
well<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.719> will<00:01:45.960> exactly<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.799> everybody<00:01:47.189> wants

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
well it will exactly and everybody wants

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.819 
well it will exactly and everybody wants
cost<00:01:47.639> savings<00:01:48.030> right<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.719> that's<00:01:49.079> definitely

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
cost savings right so that's definitely

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:50.569 
cost savings right so that's definitely
a<00:01:49.859> plus

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
a plus

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.279 
a plus
all<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.299> another<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:51.780> good<00:01:52.049> feature

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
all right so another really good feature

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.529 
all right so another really good feature
of<00:01:52.499> this<00:01:52.679> is<00:01:52.889> that<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.249> really<00:01:53.639> quite<00:01:54.030> quiet

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
of this is that it is really quite quiet

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.389 
of this is that it is really quite quiet
so<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.469> choose<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.829> place<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
so if you choose to place it on the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.249 
so if you choose to place it on the
inside<00:01:56.429> of<00:01:56.789> your<00:01:57.060> home<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.600> definitely<00:01:58.109> a

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
positive thing that you're gonna want so

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.139 
positive thing that you're gonna want so
exactly<00:02:01.469> what<00:02:01.740> material<00:02:02.249> is<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.369> made<00:02:02.639> of<00:02:02.670> ok

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
exactly what material is this made of ok

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.779 
exactly what material is this made of ok
so<00:02:04.049> she's<00:02:04.289> made<00:02:04.499> out<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.219> polymer<00:02:05.579> material

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
so she's made out of a polymer material

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.849 
so she's made out of a polymer material
and<00:02:06.389> what<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.810> simply<00:02:07.139> means<00:02:07.319> is<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.649> it's

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
and what that simply means is that it's

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.440 
and what that simply means is that it's
a<00:02:07.920> hundred<00:02:08.069> percent<00:02:08.280> rust<00:02:08.910> proof

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
a hundred percent rust proof

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.570 
a hundred percent rust proof
100%<00:02:10.229> rust<00:02:10.470> 100%

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
100% rust 100%

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.960 
100% rust 100%
okay<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.890> means<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.280> could<00:02:14.340> take<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.760> my

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970

okay so that means I could take it to my
beach<00:02:15.120> house<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.630> stuff<00:02:15.870> in<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.140> air<00:02:16.290> oh<00:02:16.320> boy

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
you know sometimes we have water

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.920 
you know sometimes we have water

sometimes we don't have water and Wassa

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.910 
sometimes we don't have water and Wassa
is<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:35.240> it's<00:02:36.240> annoying<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:37.020> what<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.620> really

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
is so it's annoying and what is really

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.350 
is so it's annoying and what is really
good<00:02:38.040> about<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.460> is<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.700> there's<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.090> dry

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
good about this is that there's a dry

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.450 
good about this is that there's a dry
run<00:02:39.630> feature<00:02:39.870> now<00:02:40.680> what<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.040> simply<00:02:41.310> means

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
run feature now what that simply means

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.030 
run feature now what that simply means
is<00:02:41.760> if<00:02:42.240> you<00:02:42.510> have<00:02:42.540> no<00:02:43.080> water<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.620> your<00:02:43.770> tongue

that's right
so<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.150> motor<00:02:48.330> doesn't<00:02:48.660> get<00:02:48.750> burned<00:02:48.990> out<00:02:49.200> or

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230

like them slip right okay so let's talk

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.400 
like them slip right okay so let's talk
a<00:03:35.640> little<00:03:35.760> bit<00:03:35.940> about<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.330> line<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.140> foam

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
a little bit about this line of foam

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.229 
a little bit about this line of foam
this<00:03:37.620> belongs<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.190> submersible<00:03:38.670> line<00:03:39.090> of

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
this belongs to a submersible line of

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.490 
this belongs to a submersible line of
plums<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.900> diverter<00:03:40.410> on

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
plums this is the diverter on

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.370 
plums this is the diverter on
submersible<00:03:41.220> sump<00:03:41.489> pump<00:03:41.790> as<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.959> can<00:03:43.140> see

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
submersible sump pump as you can see

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.260 
submersible sump pump as you can see
similar<00:03:43.800> to<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.100> booster<00:03:44.430> series<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.060> made

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
similar to the booster series it is made

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.060 
similar to the booster series it is made
from<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.630> polymer<00:03:46.020> material<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.770> can<00:03:46.920> see

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
from that polymer material I can see

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.340 
from that polymer material I can see
those<00:03:47.190> right<00:03:47.370> which<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.390> rust<00:03:48.630> resistance<00:03:49.140> is

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
those right which is rust resistance is

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.900 
those right which is rust resistance is
this<00:03:49.530> stainless<00:03:49.950> steel<00:03:50.130> by<00:03:50.280> chance<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.670> is

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
this stainless steel by chance it is

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.370 
this stainless steel by chance it is
stainless<00:03:51.180> steel<00:03:51.330> at<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.630> base<00:03:51.840> right<00:03:52.080> hand

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
stainless steel at the base right hand

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.690 
stainless steel at the base right hand
that's<00:03:52.560> really<00:03:52.890> what's<00:03:53.040> against<00:03:53.310> suction

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
that's really what's against suction

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.360 
that's really what's against suction
that's<00:03:53.850> true<00:03:54.120> um<00:03:54.840> okay<00:03:55.410> this<00:03:55.739> is<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.010> out<00:03:56.130> take

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
that's true um okay this is the out take

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.540 
that's true um okay this is the out take
a<00:03:56.610> right<00:03:57.590> where<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.709> fits<00:03:58.980> in<00:03:59.190> your<00:03:59.310> town

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
a right where it fits in your town

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.860 
a right where it fits in your town
because<00:03:59.910> it's<00:04:00.060> submerged<00:04:00.390> it<00:04:00.540> goes<00:04:00.690> all<00:04:00.840> the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
because it's submerged it goes all the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.750 
because it's submerged it goes all the
way<00:04:00.989> down<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.440> bottom<00:04:01.560> right<00:04:02.190> basically

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
way down to the bottom right basically

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.120 
way down to the bottom right basically
so<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.180> sits<00:04:03.390> flush<00:04:03.630> just<00:04:04.170> like<00:04:04.320> this<00:04:04.440> that's

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
so it sits flush just like this that's

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.680 
so it sits flush just like this that's
right<00:04:05.340> it's<00:04:05.489> about<00:04:05.790> like<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.420> if<00:04:06.540> your

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
right it's about like that so if your

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.750 
right it's about like that so if your
tank<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.080> a<00:04:07.110> little<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.620> will<00:04:08.100> suction<00:04:08.400> up<00:04:08.610> all

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
tank is a little it will suction up all

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.880 
tank is a little it will suction up all
that<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.540> bottom<00:04:09.840> there<00:04:09.989> as<00:04:10.110> well<00:04:10.290> right

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
that to the bottom there as well right

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.009 
that to the bottom there as well right
to<00:04:11.130> be<00:04:11.310> able<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.489> use<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:11.850> it<00:04:12.000> has<00:04:12.450> an<00:04:12.600> internal

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
to be able to use it it has an internal

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.370 
to be able to use it it has an internal
motor<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.590> one<00:04:13.920> horsepower<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.820> it's<00:04:15.060> all

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
motor of one horsepower and it's all

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.670 
motor of one horsepower and it's all
a<00:04:15.710> water-cooled<00:04:16.459> pump<00:04:16.730> right<00:04:17.150> so<00:04:17.530> experiment

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
a water-cooled pump right so experiment

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.800 
a water-cooled pump right so experiment
obviously<00:04:19.280> you're<00:04:19.430> exactly<00:04:19.970> yo<00:04:20.209> and<00:04:20.450> fluid

also has a super silent feature super
silent<00:04:30.560> super<00:04:31.250> silent<00:04:31.670> if<00:04:31.760> you<00:04:31.820> think<00:04:32.030> the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
silent super silent if you think the

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.850 
silent super silent if you think the
boosters<00:04:32.540> were<00:04:32.750> silent<00:04:33.200> this<00:04:33.350> is<00:04:33.500> really

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
boosters were silent this is really

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.350 
boosters were silent this is really
really<00:04:34.010> silent<00:04:34.490> let<00:04:34.640> me<00:04:34.700> tell<00:04:34.880> you<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.150> once

really silent let me tell you so once

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.090 
really silent let me tell you so once
it's<00:04:35.510> submerge<00:04:35.810> enough<00:04:36.080> woods<00:04:36.350> oh<00:04:36.470> you<00:04:36.860> can't

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
it's submerge enough woods oh you can't

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.950 
it's submerge enough woods oh you can't
hear<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.340> thing<00:04:37.490> if<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.180> have<00:04:38.480> an<00:04:38.600> underground

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
hear a thing if you have an underground

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.050 
hear a thing if you have an underground
chunk<00:04:39.320> right<00:04:40.010> oh<00:04:40.040> if<00:04:40.340> you're<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.550> part<00:04:40.850> of<00:04:40.970> the

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
chunk right oh if you're a part of the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.910 
chunk right oh if you're a part of the
agricultural<00:04:41.200> industry<00:04:42.200> and<00:04:42.230> you<00:04:42.590> need<00:04:42.740> to

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
agricultural industry and you need to

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.740 
agricultural industry and you need to
submerge<00:04:43.430> this<00:04:43.670> in<00:04:43.730> a<00:04:43.910> well<00:04:44.150> maybe<00:04:44.660> a

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
submerge this in a well maybe a

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.930 
submerge this in a well maybe a
reservoir<00:04:45.350> this<00:04:45.650> is<00:04:45.710> probably<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.700> best

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
reservoir this is probably the best

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.160 
reservoir this is probably the best
option<00:04:47.090> -<00:04:47.540> okay

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170

bottom and work our way up in terms of

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.280 
bottom and work our way up in terms of
describing<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.720> features<00:04:59.870> of<00:05:00.080> this

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
describing the features of this

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.810

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
a cast iron front to the front hair okay

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.010 
a cast iron front to the front hair okay
um<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.220> also<00:05:07.430> is<00:05:07.850> ready<00:05:08.420> to<00:05:08.630> mate<00:05:08.780> it's<00:05:08.960> a

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
um it also is ready to mate it's a

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.610 
um it also is ready to mate it's a
plug-and-play

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
plug-and-play

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.180 
plug-and-play
comes<00:05:10.370> completely<00:05:11.180> together<00:05:11.420> it<00:05:12.320> also<00:05:12.500> has<00:05:12.890> a

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
comes completely together it also has a

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.300 
comes completely together it also has a
polymer<00:05:13.960> backing<00:05:14.960> right<00:05:15.320> here<00:05:15.530> okay<00:05:15.980> right

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
polymer backing right here okay right

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
polymer backing right here okay right
that's<00:05:16.580> where<00:05:16.760> the<00:05:16.880> fun<00:05:17.060> is

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
that's where the fun is

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.510 
that's where the fun is
Roselli<00:05:18.320> so<00:05:18.560> well<00:05:18.680> that<00:05:18.800> is<00:05:18.920> what<00:05:19.070> you<00:05:19.310> know

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
Roselli so well that is what you know

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.920 
Roselli so well that is what you know
what<00:05:19.940> the<00:05:20.060> answer<00:05:20.180> is

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
what the answer is

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.750 
what the answer is
now<00:05:21.110> if<00:05:21.170> you<00:05:21.260> come<00:05:21.410> up<00:05:21.530> here<00:05:21.710> this<00:05:22.010> is<00:05:22.190> a<00:05:22.220> global

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
now if you come up here this is a global

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.180 
now if you come up here this is a global
water<00:05:22.940> solution<00:05:23.570> pressure<00:05:23.930> vessel<00:05:24.530> right

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
water solution pressure vessel right

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.010 
water solution pressure vessel right
it's<00:05:25.370> 18<00:05:25.790> litres<00:05:25.970> which<00:05:26.360> is<00:05:26.480> why<00:05:26.600> you<00:05:26.660> know

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
it's 18 litres which is why you know

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.330 
it's 18 litres which is why you know
about<00:05:27.260> the<00:05:27.440> little<00:05:27.560> bit<00:05:27.740> more<00:05:27.890> this<00:05:28.100> is<00:05:28.190> what

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
about the little bit more this is what

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.970 
about the little bit more this is what
we<00:05:28.430> usually<00:05:28.550> see<00:05:28.910> at<00:05:29.090> sign<00:05:29.330> okay<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.410> what<00:05:30.800> is

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
we usually see at sign okay and what is

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.920 
we usually see at sign okay and what is
really<00:05:31.430> really<00:05:31.550> quite<00:05:31.820> good<00:05:31.940> about<00:05:32.150> this<00:05:32.480> one

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
really really quite good about this one

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.040 
really really quite good about this one
it's<00:05:33.470> probably<00:05:33.860> why<00:05:34.070> it's<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.370> most<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:35.330> most

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
it's probably why it's the most the most

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.710 
it's probably why it's the most the most
widely<00:05:36.650> used<00:05:36.880> is<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.090> have<00:05:38.240> a<00:05:38.270> five<00:05:38.540> year

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
widely used is that I have a five year

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.140 
widely used is that I have a five year
warranty<00:05:38.890> really<00:05:39.890> outside<00:05:40.460> their<00:05:40.670> warranty

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
warranty really outside their warranty

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.990 
warranty really outside their warranty
right<00:05:41.750> so<00:05:42.020> other<00:05:42.470> typical<00:05:42.860> vessels<00:05:43.580> tend<00:05:43.880> to

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
right so other typical vessels tend to

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.290 
right so other typical vessels tend to
have<00:05:44.180> a<00:05:44.210> two<00:05:44.480> year<00:05:44.510> warranty<00:05:44.720> this<00:05:45.530> one<00:05:46.180> it's<00:05:47.180> a

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
have a two year warranty this one it's a

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.120 
have a two year warranty this one it's a
lot<00:05:47.480> more<00:05:47.630> yeah<00:05:47.930> okay<00:05:48.470> so<00:05:48.530> that's<00:05:48.860> additional

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
lot more yeah okay so that's additional

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.950 
lot more yeah okay so that's additional
savings<00:05:49.580> after<00:05:50.090> you<00:05:50.180> guys<00:05:50.390> so<00:05:51.020> this<00:05:51.440> basically

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
savings after you guys so this basically

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.960 
savings after you guys so this basically
has<00:05:52.229> every<00:05:52.530> horsepower<00:05:52.860> to<00:05:53.639> suit<00:05:53.819> your

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
has every horsepower to suit your

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.390 
has every horsepower to suit your
specific<00:05:54.030> needs<00:05:54.690> so<00:05:55.229> so<00:05:55.650> lunch<00:05:55.860> tell<00:05:56.220> me<00:05:56.310> about

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
specific needs so so lunch tell me about

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.850 
specific needs so so lunch tell me about
this<00:05:56.669> bumper<00:05:57.090> was<00:05:58.020> looking<00:05:58.259> at<00:05:58.380> it<00:05:58.500> I<00:05:58.590> realized

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
this bumper was looking at it I realized

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.339 
this bumper was looking at it I realized
as<00:05:59.160> things<00:05:59.550> are<00:05:59.789> obviously<00:06:00.630> okay<00:06:01.020> so<00:06:01.229> yeah

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
as things are obviously okay so yeah

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.439 
as things are obviously okay so yeah
definitely<00:06:02.160> obvious<00:06:02.819> differences<00:06:03.270> between

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
definitely obvious differences between

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.960 
definitely obvious differences between
these<00:06:03.750> two<00:06:04.050> pumps<00:06:04.370> clearly<00:06:05.370> this<00:06:05.520> one<00:06:05.699> has<00:06:05.940> a

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
these two pumps clearly this one has a

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.730 
these two pumps clearly this one has a
pressure<00:06:06.330> vessel<00:06:06.569> and<00:06:06.960> this<00:06:07.139> one<00:06:07.319> does<00:06:07.470> not

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
pressure vessel and this one does not

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.370 
pressure vessel and this one does not
this<00:06:08.160> is<00:06:08.370> called<00:06:08.610> a<00:06:08.729> smart<00:06:08.940> head<00:06:09.270> and<00:06:09.509> it's

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
this is called a smart head and it's

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.409 
this is called a smart head and it's
basically<00:06:11.190> detects<00:06:11.580> when<00:06:11.759> water's<00:06:12.090> flowing

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
basically detects when water's flowing

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.480 
basically detects when water's flowing
so<00:06:12.840> you<00:06:12.900> have<00:06:13.050> your<00:06:13.139> faucet<00:06:13.500> on<00:06:13.650> it's<00:06:14.250> going<00:06:14.400> to

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
so you have your faucet on it's going to

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.920 
so you have your faucet on it's going to
kick<00:06:14.639> into<00:06:14.910> play<00:06:15.090> when<00:06:15.330> you<00:06:15.389> have<00:06:15.419> you<00:06:15.599> toss<00:06:15.750> it

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
kick into play when you have you toss it

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.659 
kick into play when you have you toss it
off<00:06:16.080> it's<00:06:16.590> going<00:06:16.710> to<00:06:16.800> automatically<00:06:17.280> come<00:06:17.520> off

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
off it's going to automatically come off

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.129 
off it's going to automatically come off
so<00:06:17.849> it's<00:06:17.940> pretty<00:06:18.120> simple<00:06:18.449> so<00:06:18.810> as<00:06:18.870> you<00:06:18.960> can<00:06:19.080> see

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
so it's pretty simple so as you can see

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:21.230 
so it's pretty simple so as you can see
the<00:06:19.349> bases<00:06:19.710> are<00:06:19.830> pretty<00:06:20.009> similar<00:06:20.460> right

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
the bases are pretty similar right

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.629 
the bases are pretty similar right
as<00:06:21.479> we<00:06:21.990> have<00:06:22.139> that<00:06:22.229> posture<00:06:22.770> in<00:06:22.919> front<00:06:23.220> just

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
as we have that posture in front just

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.189 
as we have that posture in front just
like<00:06:23.819> in<00:06:23.970> this<00:06:24.090> one<00:06:24.330> and<00:06:24.630> we<00:06:24.750> have<00:06:24.930> that

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
like in this one and we have that

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.589 
like in this one and we have that
technol<00:06:25.620> polymer<00:06:26.009> backing<00:06:26.820> which<00:06:27.090> houses<00:06:27.330> the

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
technol polymer backing which houses the

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:29.990 
technol polymer backing which houses the
fan<00:06:27.840> because<00:06:28.199> this<00:06:28.320> is<00:06:28.470> an<00:06:28.590> air-cooled<00:06:29.310> not<00:06:29.970> a

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
fan because this is an air-cooled not a

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.680 
fan because this is an air-cooled not a
water-cooled

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
water-cooled

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.990 
water-cooled
