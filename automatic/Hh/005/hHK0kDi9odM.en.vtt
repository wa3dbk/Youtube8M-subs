a<00:01:52.610> very<00:01:52.940> does<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.540> really<00:01:53.780> great<00:01:53.930> job<00:01:54.050> of

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
a very does a really great job of

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.530 
a very does a really great job of
buffing<00:01:54.830> into<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.250> skin<00:01:55.550> as<00:01:55.670> well<00:01:55.910> I<00:01:56.270> also

buffing into the skin as well I also

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.530 
buffing into the skin as well I also
like<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.170> fact<00:01:57.440> that<00:01:57.650> it's<00:01:58.370> more<00:01:58.760> of<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:59.000> medium

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
like the fact that it's more of a medium

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.830 
like the fact that it's more of a medium
to<00:02:00.110> full<00:02:00.530> coverage<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:01.700> could<00:02:02.150> go<00:02:02.330> light<00:02:02.630> if

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
to full coverage you could go light if

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.050 
to full coverage you could go light if
you<00:02:02.990> use<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.140> little<00:02:03.470> bit<00:02:03.560> less<00:02:03.860> but<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.460> right

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
you use a little bit less but it right

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.820

off<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.330> back<00:02:05.510> just<00:02:05.840> using<00:02:06.140> like<00:02:06.260> a<00:02:06.320> pump<00:02:06.619> like

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
off the back just using like a pump like

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.320 
off the back just using like a pump like

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
you normally would you would get like

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.750 
you normally would you would get like
more<00:02:08.570> of<00:02:08.630> a<00:02:09.080> medium<00:02:09.590> coverage<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:12.640> just<00:02:13.640> got

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
more of a medium coverage and I just got

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.460 
more of a medium coverage and I just got
a<00:02:13.790> text<00:02:14.000> message<00:02:14.030> should<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.080> turned<00:02:15.290> that

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
a text message should have turned that

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.460 
a text message should have turned that
off<00:02:15.650> anyways<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:17.180> yeah<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.050> it's<00:02:18.170> more<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.350> a

but the foundation was still on my skin

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.310 
but the foundation was still on my skin
so<00:04:43.860> it<00:04:44.490> does<00:04:44.730> have<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.150> long<00:04:45.630> wearing<00:04:45.930> powder

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320

all<00:05:19.440> that<00:05:19.800> extra<00:05:20.160> stuff<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:20.730> by<00:05:20.850> the<00:05:20.910> time<00:05:21.090> I

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
all that extra stuff so by the time I

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.420 
all that extra stuff so by the time I
got<00:05:21.270> out<00:05:21.420> of<00:05:21.480> work<00:05:21.630> I<00:05:21.870> still<00:05:22.410> looked<00:05:22.980> a<00:05:23.160> little

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
got out of work I still looked a little

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.070 
got out of work I still looked a little
bit<00:05:23.550> glowy<00:05:23.820> because<00:05:24.270> this<00:05:24.450> foundation<00:05:24.990> is

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
bit glowy because this foundation is

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.990 
bit glowy because this foundation is
more<00:05:25.410> of<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.590> satin<00:05:25.860> finish<00:05:26.190> so<00:05:26.520> it<00:05:26.640> does<00:05:26.820> look

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
more of a satin finish so it does look

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.360 
more of a satin finish so it does look
kind<00:05:27.240> of<00:05:27.330> more<00:05:27.480> like<00:05:27.510> skin<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.050> little<00:05:28.440> tiny<00:05:29.100> bit

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
kind of more like skin a little tiny bit

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.910 
kind of more like skin a little tiny bit
of<00:05:29.400> glow<00:05:29.640> eNOS<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:30.090> it<00:05:30.210> but<00:05:30.870> it<00:05:31.230> wasn't<00:05:31.650> like<00:05:31.770> I

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
of glow eNOS to it but it wasn't like I

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.380 
of glow eNOS to it but it wasn't like I
was<00:05:32.130> a<00:05:32.160> grease<00:05:32.490> ball<00:05:32.790> or<00:05:32.910> anything<00:05:33.120> like<00:05:33.360> that

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
was a grease ball or anything like that

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.690 
was a grease ball or anything like that
so<00:05:33.840> I<00:05:33.870> really<00:05:34.380> really<00:05:34.710> love<00:05:35.190> this<00:05:35.490> foundation

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700
