like I said just any gear oil this is an

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.870 
like I said just any gear oil this is an
example<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.180> say<00:01:15.390> 80<00:01:15.750> -<00:01:16.710> 85<00:01:16.920> 90<00:01:19.009> 80<00:01:20.009> 90<00:01:20.520> 85

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
example it's I say 80 - 85 90 80 90 85

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.550 
example it's I say 80 - 85 90 80 90 85
90<00:01:21.710> 90<00:01:22.710> 90<00:01:22.740> gear<00:01:23.670> oil<00:01:23.880> basically<00:01:24.229> will<00:01:25.229> work<00:01:25.409> in

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
90 90 90 gear oil basically will work in

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.700 
90 90 90 gear oil basically will work in

should<00:02:20.049> never<00:02:20.200> have<00:02:20.409> to<00:02:20.530> take<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.859> one<00:02:21.010> I

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
should never have to take that one I

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.770 
should never have to take that one I
think<00:02:21.250> that's<00:02:21.549> where<00:02:21.760> accessing<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.359> shifter

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
think that's where accessing the shifter

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.089 
think that's where accessing the shifter
or<00:02:22.810> something<00:02:23.290> back<00:02:23.469> in<00:02:23.650> there<00:02:23.769> I've<00:02:23.890> never
