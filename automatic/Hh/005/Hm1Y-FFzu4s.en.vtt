howdy everyone joke here so it is come
time<00:00:03.969> to<00:00:04.420> taste<00:00:04.690> the<00:00:05.500> Cooper's<00:00:06.100> it's<00:00:06.760> better

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:07.030 
time to taste the Cooper's it's better

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.480 
time to taste the Cooper's it's better
we<00:00:07.240> brewed<00:00:07.450> up<00:00:07.600> I<00:00:07.840> had<00:00:08.530> it<00:00:08.680> ferment<00:00:09.130> for<00:00:09.310> about

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
we brewed up I had it ferment for about

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.410 
we brewed up I had it ferment for about
a<00:00:09.520> week

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
a week

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.759 
a week
it's<00:00:10.750> now<00:00:10.930> been<00:00:11.140> sitting<00:00:11.470> in<00:00:11.650> the<00:00:11.860> keg<00:00:12.130> for

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
it's now been sitting in the keg for

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.920 
it's now been sitting in the keg for
almost<00:00:14.769> three<00:00:15.099> full<00:00:15.340> weeks<00:00:15.370> so<00:00:15.970> I<00:00:16.209> figured<00:00:16.840> it

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
almost three full weeks so I figured it

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.090 
almost three full weeks so I figured it
was<00:00:17.020> time<00:00:17.170> to<00:00:17.350> give<00:00:17.470> it<00:00:17.560> a<00:00:17.650> taste

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
was time to give it a taste

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.340 
was time to give it a taste
the<00:00:18.400> initial<00:00:19.060> gravity<00:00:19.539> burning<00:00:19.990> gravity<00:00:20.260> on

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
the initial gravity burning gravity on

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.370 
the initial gravity burning gravity on
the<00:00:20.410> Sun<00:00:20.560> was<00:00:20.970> 1040<00:00:21.970> then<00:00:22.600> the<00:00:22.750> final<00:00:23.050> gravity

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
the Sun was 1040 then the final gravity

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.439 
the Sun was 1040 then the final gravity
was<00:00:23.590> 1010<00:00:24.190> so<00:00:24.400> we're<00:00:24.520> sitting<00:00:24.730> at<00:00:24.789> about<00:00:24.820> 4%

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
was 1010 so we're sitting at about 4%

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.900 
was 1010 so we're sitting at about 4%
alcohol<00:00:25.840> by<00:00:26.230> volume<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:27.460> a<00:00:27.520> little<00:00:27.730> lower

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
alcohol by volume it's a little lower

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.189 
alcohol by volume it's a little lower
than<00:00:28.000> what<00:00:28.300> I'm<00:00:28.449> used<00:00:28.690> to

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
than what I'm used to

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.380 
than what I'm used to
what<00:00:29.470> I<00:00:29.500> typically<00:00:29.890> make<00:00:30.160> I<00:00:30.310> typically<00:00:30.670> get<00:00:31.150> my

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
what I typically make I typically get my

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.380 
what I typically make I typically get my
gun<00:00:31.570> on<00:00:31.750> a<00:00:31.840> six<00:00:32.140> 6s<00:00:32.649> range<00:00:32.949> seven<00:00:33.370> ish<00:00:33.429> range<00:00:33.670> so

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
gun on a six 6s range seven ish range so

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.939 
gun on a six 6s range seven ish range so
without<00:00:34.870> further<00:00:35.170> ado<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:37.690> it<00:00:37.809> is<00:00:37.899> ready<00:00:38.800> to

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
without further ado here it is ready to

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:50.830 
without further ado here it is ready to
go<00:00:39.929> clean<00:00:40.929> glass

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:59.910 

holy<00:00:51.440> smokes

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.950 

okay<00:01:03.269> guess<00:01:04.269> we're<00:01:04.420> going<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.600> have<00:01:04.720> to<00:01:04.809> let

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
okay guess we're going to have to let

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:14.310 
okay guess we're going to have to let
this<00:01:05.080> one<00:01:05.229> sit<00:01:05.440> for<00:01:05.650> a<00:01:05.680> second<00:01:06.159> I<00:01:13.020> guess<00:01:14.020> we<00:01:14.170> can

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
this one sit for a second I guess we can

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.999 
this one sit for a second I guess we can
start<00:01:14.500> talking<00:01:14.860> about<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.159> right<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.890> I'm<00:01:17.979> not

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
start talking about it right so I'm not

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.080 
start talking about it right so I'm not
sure<00:01:18.100> if<00:01:18.310> you<00:01:18.369> can<00:01:18.460> see<00:01:18.729> it's<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.090> nice<00:01:21.090> dark

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:32.880 
sure if you can see it's a nice dark
orange<00:01:22.750> color<00:01:25.860> got<00:01:26.860> some<00:01:27.009> red<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.430> it<00:01:31.890> looks

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
orange color got some red in it looks

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.800 
orange color got some red in it looks
pretty<00:01:33.130> good<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:35.200> not<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.509> biggest

see it if you look close not sure if

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.830 
see it if you look close not sure if
it'll<00:01:44.380> pick<00:01:44.590> up<00:01:44.740> on<00:01:44.920> there<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:46.360> we<00:01:46.479> do<00:01:46.630> have

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.690 

it's<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.500> lot<00:02:52.650> Multi<00:02:53.100> er<00:02:53.130> than<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.400> thought<00:02:53.550> it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
it's a lot Multi er than I thought it

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.770 
it's a lot Multi er than I thought it
would<00:02:53.790> be<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:55.580> wonder<00:02:56.580> if<00:02:56.670> that's<00:02:56.790> because<00:02:57.030> in

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
would be I wonder if that's because in

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.260 
would be I wonder if that's because in
the<00:02:57.930> recipe<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.320> did<00:02:58.620> we<00:02:58.770> have<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.100> can<00:02:59.370> of

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
the recipe I did we have the can of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.780 
the recipe I did we have the can of
extract<00:03:00.780> with<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.410> which<00:03:01.620> had<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.100> hops<00:03:02.400> in

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
extract with that which had the hops in

they're just pure corn or I added a

they're just pure corn or I added a

up<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.120> alcohol<00:04:33.330> content<00:04:33.630> but<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.320> bet<00:04:35.100> if<00:04:35.250> you

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
up the alcohol content but I bet if you

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.480 
up the alcohol content but I bet if you
added<00:04:35.990> just<00:04:36.990> pure<00:04:37.260> corn<00:04:37.530> sugar<00:04:37.770> dexterous<00:04:38.280> you

added just pure corn sugar dexterous you
get<00:04:38.669> I<00:04:38.940> I<00:04:39.480> think<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.350> hops<00:04:40.530> would<00:04:40.770> be<00:04:40.860> off

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
get I I think the hops would be off

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.760 
get I I think the hops would be off
balance<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:41.790> I<00:04:42.200> don't<00:04:43.200> think<00:04:43.350> that'd<00:04:43.470> be<00:04:43.560> very

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
balance and I don't think that'd be very

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.560 
balance and I don't think that'd be very
good<00:04:43.980> but<00:04:44.100> this<00:04:44.280> is<00:04:44.430> actually<00:04:44.790> the<00:04:44.910> hops<00:04:45.120> are

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
good but this is actually the hops are

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.050 
good but this is actually the hops are
just<00:04:45.900> bitter<00:04:46.169> enough<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:47.160> give<00:04:47.760> that<00:04:47.910> nice

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
just bitter enough to give that nice

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.250 
just bitter enough to give that nice
full<00:04:48.450> flavor<00:04:49.669> with<00:04:50.669> without<00:04:51.090> being<00:04:51.900> like<00:04:52.080> an

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.980 
it was a very very quick kid in
comparison<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.270> all<00:05:19.360> grain<00:05:19.600> ones<00:05:19.810> I've

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
comparison to the all grain ones I've

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.110 
comparison to the all grain ones I've
done<00:05:20.199> the<00:05:20.560> last<00:05:20.770> several<00:05:21.070> videos<00:05:21.190> you<00:05:22.030> know

done the last several videos you know
those<00:05:22.330> does<00:05:22.660> take<00:05:22.900> anywhere<00:05:23.199> between<00:05:23.370> four<00:05:24.370> to

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
those does take anywhere between four to

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.100 
those does take anywhere between four to
six<00:05:24.550> hours<00:05:25.090> depending<00:05:25.479> on<00:05:25.570> how<00:05:25.630> fast<00:05:25.870> I'll

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
six hours depending on how fast I'll

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.629 
six hours depending on how fast I'll
crank<00:05:26.260> out<00:05:26.380> there<00:05:26.530> and<00:05:26.620> when<00:05:26.710> I<00:05:26.770> film<00:05:27.010> it<00:05:27.160> it's

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639
