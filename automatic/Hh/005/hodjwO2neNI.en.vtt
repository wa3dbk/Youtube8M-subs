whoop-dee-doo<00:02:14.549> but<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.000> slides<00:02:15.299> up<00:02:15.480> each<00:02:15.660> time

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
whoop-dee-doo but it slides up each time

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.850 
whoop-dee-doo but it slides up each time
so<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.760> mean<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.269> don't<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.019> mean<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.560> looks

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
so I mean I don't know I mean it looks

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.009 
so I mean I don't know I mean it looks
kind<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.370> treadmill<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.970> me<00:02:21.269> so<00:02:21.900> we're

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
kind of like a treadmill to me so we're

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.240 
kind of like a treadmill to me so we're
gonna<00:02:22.140> change<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.739> animations<00:02:23.310> on<00:02:23.519> this<00:02:23.790> and

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
gonna change the animations on this and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.280 
gonna change the animations on this and
yeah<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:27.000> right<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.420> will<00:02:27.630> take<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> look<00:02:27.930> here

yeah so right you will take a look here
at<00:02:28.470> our<00:02:28.500> main<00:02:28.860> controller<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.730> our<00:02:30.299> main

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
at our main controller and our main

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.500 
at our main controller and our main
storyboard<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.610> go<00:02:32.610> ahead<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.940> see<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.299> see

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
storyboard and go ahead you see you see

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.660 
storyboard and go ahead you see you see
these<00:02:33.660> lines<00:02:34.019> right<00:02:34.560> here<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:35.370> then<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.549> got

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
these lines right here and then you got

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.610 
these lines right here and then you got
another<00:02:35.700> one<00:02:36.120> coming<00:02:36.480> back<00:02:36.690> behind<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.470> and

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
another one coming back behind it and

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.550 
another one coming back behind it and
back<00:02:37.769> in<00:02:38.180> select<00:02:39.180> one<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.570> those<00:02:39.720> right<00:02:40.530> here

present model II and now you have

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.990 
present model II and now you have
presentation<00:03:02.260> like<00:03:02.710> what<00:03:03.520> do<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:03.610> want<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.880> to

presentation like what do you want it to

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.820 
presentation like what do you want it to
look<00:03:04.120> like<00:03:04.180> kinda<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.080> mean<00:03:05.110> that's<00:03:05.500> kind<00:03:05.740> of

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
what it is supposed to be I'm just gonna

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.740 
what it is supposed to be I'm just gonna
go<00:03:08.200> default<00:03:08.620> transition<00:03:09.160> we<00:03:10.120> have<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.270> couple

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
go default transition we have a couple

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.090 
go default transition we have a couple
of<00:03:10.840> different<00:03:11.080> transitions<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.710> we<00:03:11.770> can<00:03:11.980> do

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
of different transitions that we can do

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.370 
of different transitions that we can do
we<00:03:12.490> do<00:03:12.640> partial<00:03:12.970> curl<00:03:13.420> I'm<00:03:14.020> going<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.200> show<00:03:14.320> you

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
we do partial curl I'm going to show you

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:30.850 
we do partial curl I'm going to show you
this<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:17.370> let's<00:03:18.370> get<00:03:18.580> it<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.820> load<00:03:18.970> again

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.980 

all<00:03:31.430> right

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.650 

so<00:03:34.620> now<00:03:34.800> when<00:03:35.340> we<00:03:35.670> click<00:03:36.450> on<00:03:36.780> our<00:03:37.140> change<00:03:37.500> icon

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
so now when we click on our change icon

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.440 
so now when we click on our change icon
would<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:39.750> look<00:03:39.900> at<00:03:39.990> that<00:03:40.400> now<00:03:42.050> this<00:03:43.050> still

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
would you look at that now this still

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.230 
would you look at that now this still
goes<00:03:45.450> up<00:03:45.480> but<00:03:46.320> we<00:03:46.440> can<00:03:46.590> change<00:03:46.770> that<00:03:47.060> go<00:03:48.060> ahead

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
goes up but we can change that go ahead

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.740 
goes up but we can change that go ahead
click<00:03:48.600> on<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.870> other<00:03:49.080> arrow<00:03:50.420> we<00:03:51.420> can<00:03:51.450> go<00:03:51.690> to

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
click on the other arrow we can go to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.490 
click on the other arrow we can go to
present<00:03:52.440> model<00:03:52.590> II<00:03:52.830> and<00:03:54.770> we<00:03:55.770> can<00:03:55.920> do<00:03:57.500> cross

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
present model II and we can do cross

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.339 
present model II and we can do cross
dissolve<00:03:59.450> we<00:04:00.450> do<00:04:00.660> that

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.239 

so<00:04:06.950> now<00:04:07.159> it<00:04:07.790> flips<00:04:08.150> up<00:04:08.799> there<00:04:09.799> just<00:04:10.040> kind<00:04:10.219> of

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:10.249 
so now it flips up there just kind of

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.369 
so now it flips up there just kind of
fades<00:04:10.639> in<00:04:10.939> the<00:04:11.030> next<00:04:11.299> one<00:04:11.450> or<00:04:11.689> you<00:04:12.170> can<00:04:12.290> take

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
fades in the next one or you can take

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.530 
fades in the next one or you can take
both<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.709> them<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.549> just<00:04:14.120> make<00:04:14.269> it<00:04:14.299> so<00:04:14.510> that

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
both of them and just make it so that

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.529 
both of them and just make it so that
they<00:04:14.719> can<00:04:14.900> animate<00:04:15.729> which<00:04:16.729> doesn't<00:04:17.419> really

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
they can animate which doesn't really

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.629 
they can animate which doesn't really
look<00:04:17.750> good<00:04:17.810> on<00:04:18.139> an<00:04:18.259> app<00:04:18.440> Apple<00:04:19.009> definitely

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
look good on an app Apple definitely

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.300 
look good on an app Apple definitely
does<00:04:20.090> not<00:04:20.120> like<00:04:20.449> it<00:04:20.479> when<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.810> do<00:04:20.930> that<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.919> I

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
does not like it when you do that so I

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.950 
does not like it when you do that so I
wouldn't<00:04:22.849> recommend<00:04:22.970> it<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:25.570> mean<00:04:26.570> that's<00:04:26.750> what

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
wouldn't recommend it I mean that's what

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.930 
wouldn't recommend it I mean that's what
happens<00:04:27.289> when<00:04:27.560> it's<00:04:28.099> not<00:04:28.310> animated<00:04:28.699> we're

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
happens when it's not animated we're

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.029 
happens when it's not animated we're
gonna<00:04:29.030> go<00:04:29.180> ahead<00:04:29.360> let<00:04:29.539> it<00:04:29.630> animate<00:04:30.080> though<00:04:30.289> so

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
gonna go ahead let it animate though so

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.180 
gonna go ahead let it animate though so
that's<00:04:31.520> just<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:31.880> basic<00:04:32.030> way<00:04:32.479> to<00:04:32.509> change<00:04:33.190> the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
that's just a basic way to change the

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.820 
that's just a basic way to change the
way<00:04:34.759> how<00:04:35.120> it<00:04:37.810> just<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:38.960> way<00:04:39.080> how<00:04:39.259> it<00:04:39.410> animates

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
way how it just the way how it animates

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.120 
way how it just the way how it animates
very<00:04:40.490> basic<00:04:41.000> very<00:04:41.360> simple<00:04:41.419> no<00:04:42.259> programming<00:04:42.979> in

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
very basic very simple no programming in

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.510 
very basic very simple no programming in
this<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:44.120> for<00:04:44.419> these<00:04:44.539> animations<00:04:45.289> now<00:04:46.070> maybe

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
this and for these animations now maybe

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.550 
this and for these animations now maybe
in<00:04:46.669> the<00:04:46.759> future<00:04:46.910> we'll<00:04:47.330> go<00:04:47.509> into<00:04:47.660> detail<00:04:48.259> on

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
in the future we'll go into detail on

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.540
