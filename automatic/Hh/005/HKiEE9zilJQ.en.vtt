 daring to give life to a dead person

 serpents that were the symbol of their power 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.740

 if not for the snakes born in 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.210
 Epidaurus descendants of the snake

 originating the numerous hospitals of the 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.940
 ancient world could not have exercised 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.940
 its functions 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.810
 the presence of the deity was essential

 course of which the god himself 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.380
 cure 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.300
 these esoteric and religious beliefs 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.560
 are part of the origins of the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.560
 modern medical science 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.790
 anyway a good doctor of the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.000

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.599

 in epidaurus thus he remained patient 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.010
 besides the magic maybe the Greeks 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.489
 they were the first people who used 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.489
 Surgery 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.000
 certainly epidaurus constituted a 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.310
 sanatorium perfectly organized and 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.190
 fully equipped 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.810
 it was a sanctuary city where 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.599
 the care of the body was a matter 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.390
 priority that is reduced from the bathrooms 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.800
 thermal gyms and the stadium where 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.890
 they practiced different modalities 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.750
 sports the Greeks were the 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.700
 first to understand that the exercise 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.700
 physical is basic to our well-being
