but<00:00:33.300> if<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:34.170> carefully<00:00:35.180> remove<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.210> plant

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
but if you carefully remove the plant

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.530 
but if you carefully remove the plant
from<00:00:37.110> its<00:00:37.230> container<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.239> insert<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.390> into

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
from its container and insert it into

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.049 
from its container and insert it into
the<00:00:39.719> ground<00:00:39.989> at<00:00:40.379> level<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.460> planted

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the ground at level that it's planted

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.000 
the ground at level that it's planted
and<00:00:42.300> then<00:00:42.420> water<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.110> well<00:00:43.140> you'll<00:00:43.680> find

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and then water it in well you'll find

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.060 
and then water it in well you'll find
that<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> plant<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:45.570> take<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.770> garden

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
that the plant will take to the garden

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.430 
that the plant will take to the garden
environment<00:00:48.800> readily<00:00:50.149> readily<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.660> it's

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
environment readily readily and so it's

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.750 
environment readily readily and so it's
not<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:53.430> difficult<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.539> most<00:00:54.600> people<00:00:55.520> make<00:00:56.520> out

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
not as difficult as most people make out

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.420 
not as difficult as most people make out
it's<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> matter<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.620> delicate

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
it's really more a matter of delicate

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.510 
it's really more a matter of delicate
and<00:00:59.670> yet<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> same<00:01:00.870> time<00:01:01.079> firm<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.100> these

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
and yet at the same time firm and these

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.420 
and yet at the same time firm and these
are<00:01:02.789> not<00:01:02.969> too<00:01:03.530> bunched<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.890> I'm<00:01:05.040> going<00:01:05.309> to

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
are not too bunched so I'm going to

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.980 
are not too bunched so I'm going to
actually<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.909> even<00:01:06.030> bother<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.420> separate

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
actually not even bother to separate

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.500 
actually not even bother to separate
them<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.500> because<00:01:08.340> their<00:01:08.549> root<00:01:08.790> crops<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
them and because their root crops the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.800 
them and because their root crops the
root<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.830> crop<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.549> essence<00:01:12.090> you

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
root is the the crop in essence you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.410 
root is the the crop in essence you
don't<00:01:13.049> need<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.560> plant<00:01:13.950> them<00:01:14.220> far<00:01:14.640> apart

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
don't need to plant them far apart

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.140 
don't need to plant them far apart
because<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.680> leaf<00:01:16.890> parts<00:01:17.369> which<00:01:17.549> are<00:01:17.700> edible

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
because the leaf parts which are edible

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.510 
because the leaf parts which are edible
and<00:01:18.330> highly<00:01:18.689> nutritious<00:01:18.869> will<00:01:19.530> not<00:01:20.040> take<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and highly nutritious will not take up a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.340 
and highly nutritious will not take up a
lot<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.670> space<00:01:20.970> over<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> ground<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.900> roughly

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
lot of space over the ground so roughly

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.030 
lot of space over the ground so roughly
about<00:01:22.530> three<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.979> four<00:01:23.159> inches<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.670> space<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
about three to four inches of space and

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.120 
about three to four inches of space and
then<00:01:26.040> I'm<00:01:26.340> taking<00:01:26.549> my<00:01:26.939> finger<00:01:27.900> my<00:01:28.619> thumb<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
then I'm taking my finger my thumb and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.609 
then I'm taking my finger my thumb and
my<00:01:29.220> forefinger<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.150> I'm<00:01:30.420> going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.439> base

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
my forefinger and I'm going to the base

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.560 
my forefinger and I'm going to the base
of<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.890> plant<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.460> giving<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.000> little<00:01:33.210> bit

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
of the plant and giving it a little bit

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.080 
of the plant and giving it a little bit
of<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.869> nudge<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.950> into<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> ground<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
of a nudge there into the ground so to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.660 
of a nudge there into the ground so to
make<00:01:36.329> sure<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.990> interface<00:01:37.470> between

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
make sure that that interface between

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.300 
make sure that that interface between
the<00:01:38.670> material<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.740> growing<00:01:40.740> material<00:01:41.220> in

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the material that a growing material in

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.550 
the material that a growing material in
the<00:01:41.400> container<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.659> soil<00:01:42.899> itself<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the container and the soil itself have a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
the container and the soil itself have a
nice<00:01:43.860> nice<00:01:44.399> marriage<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.329> there's<00:01:45.540> no

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
nice nice marriage and that there's no

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.859 
nice nice marriage and that there's no
air<00:01:45.869> pockets<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:47.100> I'm<00:01:47.310> also<00:01:47.869> leveling

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
air pockets and then I'm also leveling

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.050 
air pockets and then I'm also leveling
out<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.170> surface<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> soil<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.880> make

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
out the surface of the soil just to make

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.910 
out the surface of the soil just to make
sure<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.600> stays<00:01:51.899> even<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> makes<00:01:52.740> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
sure that it stays even it makes it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.789 
sure that it stays even it makes it
easier<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.579> deal<00:01:53.790> with<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.210> plants<00:01:54.740> as<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
easier to deal with the plants as a

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
easier to deal with the plants as a
whole<00:01:56.219> they<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:56.670> equal<00:01:56.939> treatment<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.540> you

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
whole they get equal treatment if you

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.870 
whole they get equal treatment if you
will<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> as<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.530> said<00:01:58.710> because<00:01:59.310> these<00:01:59.490> are<00:01:59.670> not

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
will and as I said because these are not

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.719 
will and as I said because these are not
heavily<00:02:00.659> bunched<00:02:01.229> I'm<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.770> going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.159> not

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
heavily bunched I'm just going to not

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.850 
heavily bunched I'm just going to not
even<00:02:02.880> bother<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.659> separate<00:02:04.259> them<00:02:04.439> out<00:02:04.530> oops<00:02:04.740> I

isn't streaming out too strongly you
notice<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:48.920> plants<00:02:49.220> will<00:02:49.340> be<00:02:49.370> bent<00:02:49.670> over

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
notice that the plants will be bent over

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.270 
notice that the plants will be bent over
here<00:02:50.329> for<00:02:50.599> a<00:02:50.660> little<00:02:50.690> bit<00:02:51.049> but<00:02:51.859> they<00:02:52.040> will

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
here for a little bit but they will

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.280 
here for a little bit but they will
eventually<00:02:52.579> sit<00:02:53.239> upright<00:02:53.390> once<00:02:53.900> they<00:02:54.140> get

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
eventually sit upright once they get

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.819 
eventually sit upright once they get
established<00:02:54.470> give<00:02:55.040> them<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.250> few<00:02:55.459> hours<00:02:56.739> it's<00:02:57.739> a

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
established give them a few hours it's a

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.259 
established give them a few hours it's a
windy<00:02:58.069> day<00:02:58.250> here<00:02:58.280> at<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.609> nursery<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.150> I'm

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
windy day here at the nursery so I'm

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.690 
windy day here at the nursery so I'm
planting<00:02:59.540> these<00:02:59.870> indoors<00:03:00.379> and<00:03:00.650> that's<00:03:00.829> so

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
planting these indoors and that's so

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.550 
planting these indoors and that's so
that<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.090> wind<00:03:02.359> won't<00:03:02.629> whip<00:03:02.959> these<00:03:03.170> plants

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
that the wind won't whip these plants

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.289 
that the wind won't whip these plants
about<00:03:03.829> if<00:03:04.099> that<00:03:04.280> were<00:03:04.459> if<00:03:04.609> it<00:03:04.700> were<00:03:04.819> windy<00:03:05.180> and

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
about if that were if it were windy and

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.460 
about if that were if it were windy and
you<00:03:05.359> were<00:03:05.510> planting<00:03:05.959> them<00:03:06.140> you'd<00:03:06.290> probably

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
you were planting them you'd probably

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.500 
you were planting them you'd probably
want<00:03:06.829> to<00:03:06.920> provide<00:03:07.310> some<00:03:07.609> sort<00:03:07.819> of<00:03:07.879> shelter<00:03:08.150> so

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
want to provide some sort of shelter so

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.759 
want to provide some sort of shelter so
that<00:03:08.540> they're<00:03:08.810> not<00:03:08.930> getting<00:03:09.079> whipped<00:03:09.440> about

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
that they're not getting whipped about

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.580 
that they're not getting whipped about
and<00:03:10.099> they<00:03:10.819> have<00:03:10.849> a<00:03:10.970> chance<00:03:11.299> to<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.900> recover<00:03:12.290> and

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
and they have a chance to to recover and

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.650 
and they have a chance to to recover and
I<00:03:13.370> think<00:03:13.609> that<00:03:13.760> these<00:03:13.879> are<00:03:14.060> going<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.209> do<00:03:14.420> well

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
I think that these are going to do well

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.559 
I think that these are going to do well
that's<00:03:15.200> at<00:03:15.590> about<00:03:15.890> maybe<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.910> week<00:03:17.209> I'm<00:03:17.480> going
