00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
the one thing that bothers me the most

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.750 
the one thing that bothers me the most
is<00:02:40.139> the<00:02:40.290> fact<00:02:40.439> that<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.739> oversized<00:02:41.189> it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
is the fact that it's oversized it

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
doesn't look too bad in this shot I

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.770 
doesn't look too bad in this shot I
suppose<00:02:43.379> but<00:02:43.650> it's<00:02:43.889> quite<00:02:44.159> big<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:45.480> it's<00:02:45.629> made

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
suppose but it's quite big and it's made

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.740 
suppose but it's quite big and it's made
of<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.989> very<00:02:46.139> soft<00:02:46.430> rubbery<00:02:47.430> plastic<00:02:47.669> and<00:02:48.329> in<00:02:48.629> my

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
of a very soft rubbery plastic and in my

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.629 
of a very soft rubbery plastic and in my
opinion<00:02:49.139> it's<00:02:49.319> just<00:02:49.409> not<00:02:49.829> as<00:02:49.919> detailed<00:02:50.129> as<00:02:50.549> it

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
opinion it's just not as detailed as it

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.210 
opinion it's just not as detailed as it
probably<00:02:51.000> could<00:02:51.209> be<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.720> probably<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.980> only

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
probably could be and probably the only

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.830 
probably could be and probably the only
thing<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.819> saga<00:02:54.150> legends<00:02:54.569> shock
