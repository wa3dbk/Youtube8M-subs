00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.400 
world it doesn't seem to have too many
options<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.910> yeah<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:18.630> getting<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.289> it

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.310 
options so yeah it's it's getting to it
I<00:00:19.500> guess<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.480> basically<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> think

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
I guess so basically you have to I think

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.109 
I guess so basically you have to I think
survive<00:00:22.920> because<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.760> torch<00:00:23.939> you

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
survive because you do have a torch you

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.910 
survive because you do have a torch you
can<00:00:24.150> turn<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.660> off<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.470> place

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
can turn it on and off and you can place

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.589 
can turn it on and off and you can place
blocks<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.550> I've<00:00:26.670> also<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.000> do<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.300> can

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
blocks so I've also to do that I can

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.320 
blocks so I've also to do that I can
place<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.380> as<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.340> see<00:00:29.400> there<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.210> that's

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
place it as you can see there so that's

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.550 
place it as you can see there so that's
pretty<00:00:30.570> cool

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560

honest there's like a few yeah I think

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.950 
honest there's like a few yeah I think
this<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.910> survival<00:00:51.390> type<00:00:51.719> game

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
this is really just a survival type game

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.779 
this is really just a survival type game
and<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.289> think<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.860> turn<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> torch<00:00:53.430> off<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and I think in turn the torch off the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.389 
and I think in turn the torch off the
zombies<00:00:54.149> go<00:00:54.329> clueless<00:00:54.750> as<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.399> he

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
if you can eat food I think I just

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.050

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
really don't know this game it's just a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.480 
really don't know this game it's just a
free<00:01:30.960> thing<00:01:31.350> from<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> app<00:01:31.950> store<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.460> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
free thing from the app store so I

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.060 
free thing from the app store so I
thought<00:01:32.759> I'll<00:01:32.850> check<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:34.680> torch<00:01:34.890> is

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
thought I'll check it out the torch is

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.640 
thought I'll check it out the torch is
pretty<00:01:35.310> cool<00:01:35.520> house<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.470> brightens<00:01:37.470> your

pretty cool house like brightens your
way<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.890> guess<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.670> can't<00:01:39.000> find<00:01:39.390> any<00:01:39.689> other

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
way I guess I can't find any other

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.319 
way I guess I can't find any other
zombies<00:01:40.200> where<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> hell<00:01:40.590> are<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:42.439> well<00:01:44.329> if
