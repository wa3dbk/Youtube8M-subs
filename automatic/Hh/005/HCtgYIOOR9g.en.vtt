00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
I think this this might be medium brown

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.020 
I think this this might be medium brown
as<00:05:28.629> well<00:05:28.719> and<00:05:29.680> yeah<00:05:30.099> same<00:05:30.490> technique<00:05:30.849> again

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
as well and yeah same technique again

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.180 
as well and yeah same technique again
but<00:05:31.360> I<00:05:31.389> use<00:05:31.539> this<00:05:31.629> pencil<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:32.229> compared<00:05:33.099> to

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
but I use this pencil and compared to

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.140 
but I use this pencil and compared to
the<00:05:33.750> M<00:05:35.069> Brown<00:05:36.069> Universal<00:05:36.639> pan<00:05:36.789> until<00:05:36.879> it's

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
the M Brown Universal pan until it's

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.920 
the M Brown Universal pan until it's
much<00:05:37.330> softer<00:05:37.949> um<00:05:39.300> and<00:05:40.300> obviously<00:05:40.419> it's<00:05:40.810> not

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
much softer um and obviously it's not

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.779 
much softer um and obviously it's not
likely<00:05:41.169> because<00:05:41.770> it's<00:05:41.949> a<00:05:42.039> powder<00:05:42.280> that's<00:05:42.669> the

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
likely because it's a powder that's the

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.890 
likely because it's a powder that's the
brow<00:05:43.680> universal<00:05:44.680> pen<00:05:44.770> slots<00:05:45.039> do<00:05:45.550> you<00:05:45.699> want<00:05:45.900> so
