 series of giant transformers robots 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.250
 It is the same highlight of the week is directed 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.320
 once again by the director who is afraid 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.850
 michael bay the island of extinction 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 has as a great attraction the presence of 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.320
 metal dinosaurs from the box in 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.090
 story the autobots were once again 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.770
 placed on the margins of society by 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.760
 human beings and again a very bad 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.410
 hour 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.910
 because the apparently distinct 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.320
 I'm coming back to life. 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.030
 plan to dominate the world as always 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.799
 now counting on the reinforcement of a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.810
 intergalactic bounty hunter 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.460
 that settled in the past on earth as 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.770
 happened in the other three films 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.240
 the robots led by optimus prime that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.250
 also raises need help 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.049
 thankless humanity but this time not 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.150
 alone as the debates will serve as 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.799
 support in some way only that even with 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.540
 the addition of dinosaurs and the changes 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.460
 in the cast with mark wahlberg taking 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.439
 place of shia lebeouf the new long 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.909
 footage was widely criticized out there 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.770
 apparently the staff did not like it very much 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.900
 the way the story is even written in the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.400
 almost three hour film and michael bay 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.689
 seems to have not learned to make a 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.790
 fight scene with robots in the club 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.500
 be able to distinguish the characters 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.000
 Complaints aside the new transformers 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.200
 It must be one of those good movies to 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.670
 turn off the brain watched as 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.710

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.259

 fire the rescue sequence of animation 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.439
 2013 and pretty much like that fun 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.049
 cars but 49 predominating place of 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.909
 land vehicles is clear to assume the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.860
 shows the plane's journey from 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.469
 who left the tracks running skies 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.209
 and you need to change your profession so 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.770
 some adjustments or engines it finishes 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.209
 becoming a firefighter entered a 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.350
 fire brigade where you know your 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.850
 new team 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.130
 the taxpayer rangers pun at the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.840

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.310
 to fight a gigantic fire while 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.360
 takes some life lessons like everything 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.980
 good design from disney 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.540
 If you need an example, just remember 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.220
 of the cars themselves and that soon ivory 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.110

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.340
 last in cuba to close another 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.380

 in another film of the genre in his 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.620
 The two careers now interpret a 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.270
 man a woman who in a first 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.950
 very frustrating encounter as you can see 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.810
 in training but by some chance of fate 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.100

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.430
 high confusions of the African continent 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.990
 involving animals some dances 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.340
 movies that should do a lot 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.080
 success in the afternoon session than some 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.940
