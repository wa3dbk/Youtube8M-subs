00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.519
 We look forward to the sports board 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.519
 the fc bavaria here is matthias sammer 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.280
 even those in an English newspaper 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.380
 given an interview and will be with it 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.880
 quoted various things says 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.820
 First of all godfather change was like one 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.710
 heart attack and then he says referring to 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.650
 the duel with the fc bayern munich 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.050
 it's like it's at james bond 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.420
 except that she is the bavarian the other 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.940
 So guys are the villain, so to speak 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.760
 and he still says I think in 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.500
 this moment must be the world of football 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.330
 be on our side 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.210
 he means that in this sense so here 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.610
 So be robbie not and da king john 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.560
 so to speak the evil had that in 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:22.160
 germany english led me 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.160
 faith has failed 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:34.070
 we have freedom of expression in 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:40.789
 Germany and accordingly may he 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:49.039
 expresses itself on certain topics and and 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:51.649
 We do not in the English newspaper as 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.780
 villain insults indirectly and 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.100
 Ultimately, the whole world is going to tell us 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.049
 the thumb we press the others all 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.209
 the bavaria is so angry 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.709
 I have to address them who a real one 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:05.599
 But that's what they do 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:07.340
 she is good too and the whole world behind 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:15.319
 to resist is also a form of 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:17.209
 modesty the rivalry yes or so 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.329
 so it can be carried out there was yes 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.890
 also and again and again examples 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.599
 where I find it about almost something 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.400
 I think that's humorous 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.500
 history if remember 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.880
 Bayern Munich met in the semi-final of the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.950
 Champions League on Barcelona 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.670
 they will remember and there was 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.319
 of course one or the other 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.850
 surmise if maybe matthias 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.170
 sammer before the guardiola calls and 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.489
 she picked up some tips and the bavaria 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.620
 you need the law quartet 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.350
 I am not allowed to answer on the way 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.230
 he has one to answer for 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.109
 betrayed behind 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.730
 where is it showing here that did not exist 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.150
 others here shows that you have to show 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.930
 that would bury my ass on it 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.180
 that sammer and guardiola very well 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.910
 Maybe they are still talking about this 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.769
 to answer so i can say here 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.700
 we did not telephone so also 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.409
 not indirectly 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.989
 Let us talk about the game 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.280
 and about that like all football fans 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.500
 outside in germany this game 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.209
 look at it works because they can 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.090
 now ask here if you want 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.700
 Most think in this game is going 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.010
 it really is the question of who is 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.299
 Germany's true number 1 has that 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.659
 play this role also in theirs 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:32.730
 eyes first 25 points ahead 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.730
 in the championship yes 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.010
 and when we reach our top level 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:51.250
 There can be no other day 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:51.250
 winner is that 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.280
 a clear statement one notices that so 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:02.209
 actually this rivalry is permanent 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:05.510
 there I was, yes it was back then 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.819
 of course also influenced by 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.640
 of a certain rivalry however it has 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.440
 yes, despite all this the football is not 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.639
 harmed that brin we have to 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.290
 easy today also come to the 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.910
 At the present time, I also think of it 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:26.700
 no matter what happened 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.560
 to deal with style that demand the people 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.430
 and I just agree 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.110
 to make the current time next to all this 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.910
 we do it well and one thing I can do 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.580
 Do not even say after the game 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.770
 something during the 90 or 120 minutes or 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.550
 with 11 penalty shoot everything happen 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.100
 but it can also show afterwards 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:51.860
 who in certain style is god pressure 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.860
 huge but there will be 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.589
 what role does they play themselves? 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.029
 sometimes players have one too 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:00.889
 champions league finals also won 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:02.929
 what role does the player play in the game? 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.059
 moment on this motivation that some 

00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:06.889
 the player now for the third time in 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:08.269
 play for four years and before 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.649
 thomas miller has lost twice to 

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:10.999
 For example , I do not want to be that 

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:12.769
 deb in the story of one of the ladies 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:15.009
 lost final and there he is, he is 

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:16.999
 not he will not be independent of this 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.279
 finalspiels the quality and the 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:22.519
 Substance of this team and also the 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:24.349
 Spirit will continue for years 

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:26.330
 definitely lead to someday 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.979
 a great title already most 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:34.369
 It's clear, but it will be 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:38.349
 sure to happen again completely 

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:38.349
 thanks to matthias sammer
