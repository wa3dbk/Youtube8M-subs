hurricane he wants to go into muck
that's<00:05:21.340> okay<00:05:21.910> i<00:05:22.360> think<00:05:22.690> i<00:05:22.960> should<00:05:23.140> predict<00:05:23.350> him

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
that's okay i think i should predict him

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.660 
that's okay i think i should predict him
to<00:05:23.500> go<00:05:23.590> on<00:05:23.650> a<00:05:23.710> joke<00:05:23.890> counting<00:05:24.220> I've<00:05:24.370> him<00:05:24.490> power

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
to go on a joke counting I've him power

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.580 
to go on a joke counting I've him power
ground<00:05:24.970> so<00:05:25.720> that's<00:05:25.900> why<00:05:26.050> I'm<00:05:26.230> going<00:05:26.440> for

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
ground so that's why I'm going for

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.470 
ground so that's why I'm going for
become<00:05:26.890> mega<00:05:27.190> pick<00:05:27.460> up<00:05:27.700> but<00:05:27.850> i<00:05:27.940> think<00:05:28.330> the

become mega pick up but i think the

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.880 
become mega pick up but i think the
hidden<00:05:28.750> power<00:05:28.900> agree<00:05:29.170> i<00:05:29.200> have<00:05:29.380> in<00:05:29.500> background

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
fo sho and I I figured he meant go to

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
instead and now here I'm pretty sure

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.310 
instead and now here I'm pretty sure
hurricane<00:05:37.210> will<00:05:37.330> take<00:05:37.450> modest<00:05:37.870> range<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:38.290> I

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
hurricane will take modest range so I

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.530

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 
and leafy defense that he has but I go

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.070 
and leafy defense that he has but I go
to<00:07:11.190> Mach<00:07:11.340> 5<00:07:11.639> and<00:07:12.090> if<00:07:12.240> I<00:07:12.300> say<00:07:12.479> that<00:07:12.509> what<00:07:12.810> had<00:07:12.960> I

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
to Mach 5 and if I say that what had I

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.689 
to Mach 5 and if I say that what had I
guess<00:07:13.289> a<00:07:13.319> shot<00:07:13.710> but<00:07:14.009> that<00:07:14.069> early<00:07:14.490> enough<00:07:14.580> i

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 
guess a shot but that early enough i

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:16.279 
guess a shot but that early enough i
would<00:07:14.909> have<00:07:15.030> because<00:07:15.569> i<00:07:15.659> think<00:07:15.810> he<00:07:15.960> could<00:07:16.139> just

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:16.289 
would have because i think he could just

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:18.110 
would have because i think he could just
kill<00:07:16.500> me<00:07:16.650> within<00:07:16.860> our<00:07:17.220> ice<00:07:17.400> from<00:07:17.699> guilty<00:07:18.030> on
