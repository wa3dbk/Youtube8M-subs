00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
let's now move on to some more

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.230 
let's now move on to some more
techniques<00:00:02.429> where<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.760> tongue<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.090> actually

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
techniques where the tongue is actually

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.690 
techniques where the tongue is actually
traveling<00:00:03.989> on<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.380> off<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.680> harmonica<00:00:05.280> our

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
traveling on and off the harmonica our

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.089 
traveling on and off the harmonica our
goal<00:00:06.030> is<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.180> go<00:00:06.390> between<00:00:06.540> chords<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.560> single

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
goal is to go between chords and single

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.199 
goal is to go between chords and single
notes<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.580> that's<00:00:08.639> something<00:00:08.879> that's<00:00:09.089> very

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:09.209 
notes and that's something that's very

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.730 
notes and that's something that's very
commonly<00:00:09.839> used<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.379> blues<00:00:10.559> harmonica

playing or traditional folk for the slap
by<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.280> way<00:00:14.490> there's<00:00:14.669> three<00:00:14.940> common

about<00:00:19.650> blues<00:00:20.010> right<00:00:20.190> now<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.210> slap<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
about blues right now is the slap the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.690 
about blues right now is the slap the
pull<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.440> the<00:00:22.620> octave<00:00:23.100> we've<00:00:23.490> already

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
pull and the octave we've already

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.430 
pull and the octave we've already
explored<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.390> octave<00:00:24.780> let's<00:00:25.050> take<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.230> look<00:00:25.380> at

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
explored the octave let's take a look at

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.290 
explored the octave let's take a look at
a<00:00:25.470> slap<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> standard<00:00:26.640> tongue<00:00:26.940> block<00:00:27.150> is

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
a slap so a standard tongue block is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.790 
a slap so a standard tongue block is
where<00:00:27.450> my<00:00:27.600> lips<00:00:27.780> are<00:00:27.900> over<00:00:28.050> four<00:00:28.260> holes<00:00:28.470> I'm

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
where my lips are over four holes I'm

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.680 
where my lips are over four holes I'm
gonna<00:00:28.980> block<00:00:29.190> holes<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:29.700> two<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.000> three

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.279 

sounds<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.929> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.199> harmonica<00:00:36.289> okay

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
sounds like this on the harmonica okay

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.410 
sounds like this on the harmonica okay
now<00:00:37.739> if<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.039> precede<00:00:38.519> that<00:00:38.670> single<00:00:39.089> note<00:00:39.269> with

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
now if I precede that single note with

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.840 
now if I precede that single note with
my<00:00:39.570> tongue<00:00:39.749> off<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.199> harmonica<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.859> I<00:00:41.429> exhale

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
my tongue off the harmonica and I exhale

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.669 
my tongue off the harmonica and I exhale
in<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.149> case<00:00:42.359> you'll<00:00:42.719> hear<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.929> chord<00:00:43.320> sound

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:43.679 
in this case you'll hear a chord sound

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.069 
in this case you'll hear a chord sound
and<00:00:44.070> then<00:00:44.249> my<00:00:44.370> tongue<00:00:44.640> will<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:45.149> placed<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and then my tongue will be placed on the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.899 
and then my tongue will be placed on the
face<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.499> harmonica<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.249> you<00:00:47.309> get<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> chord

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
face of the harmonica so you get a chord

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:55.099 
face of the harmonica so you get a chord
leading<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.449> single<00:00:48.839> note<00:00:49.019> on<00:00:53.659> the<00:00:54.659> harmonic

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
leading to a single note on the harmonic

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:00.439 
leading to a single note on the harmonic
it<00:00:55.229> sounds<00:00:55.499> like<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:58.850> you<00:00:59.850> can<00:00:59.999> do<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.269> on<00:01:00.389> a

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
it sounds like this you can do that on a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.000 
it sounds like this you can do that on a
draw<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:00.899> well<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.499> do<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
draw as well and we do do it on the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.870 
draw as well and we do do it on the
draws<00:01:02.219> well<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.739> technique<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.309> identical

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
draws well the technique is identical

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.310 
draws well the technique is identical
we're<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.240> changing<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.689> direction<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.200> our

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
we're just changing the direction of our

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.200 
we're just changing the direction of our
Airstream

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
Airstream

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.200 
Airstream
blow<00:01:10.880> draw<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:13.340> know<00:01:14.340> we're<00:01:14.610> calling<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
blow draw I know we're calling this a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.389 
blow draw I know we're calling this a
slap<00:01:16.020> where<00:01:16.469> we're<00:01:16.619> hitting<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.009> really<00:01:17.100> hard

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
slap where we're hitting it really hard

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.429 
slap where we're hitting it really hard
well<00:01:17.700> we're<00:01:17.880> not<00:01:17.969> in<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> nard<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.079> slap<00:01:19.409> is

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
well we're not in a nard the slap is

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.170 
well we're not in a nard the slap is
just<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.890> term<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.219> gave<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.729> many<00:01:20.880> years<00:01:20.969> ago

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
just a term I gave to it many years ago

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
just a term I gave to it many years ago
because<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.320> motion<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.890> time

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
because that was the motion that time

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.859 
because that was the motion that time
was<00:01:23.189> traveling<00:01:23.610> again<00:01:24.000> always<00:01:24.329> use<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> light

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
was traveling again always use a light

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.350 
was traveling again always use a light
touch<00:01:25.079> that's<00:01:25.380> very<00:01:25.649> important<00:01:26.130> now<00:01:26.909> from

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
touch that's very important now from

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
touch that's very important now from
that<00:01:27.600> slap<00:01:27.990> technique<00:01:28.320> which<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.950> used<00:01:28.979> all

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that slap technique which is used all

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.990 
that slap technique which is used all
over<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.549> place<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.909> blues<00:01:30.090> harmonica

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
over the place in blues harmonica

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.039 
over the place in blues harmonica
we<00:01:33.000> could<00:01:33.149> also<00:01:33.299> do<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> technique<00:01:33.930> called

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
we could also do the technique called

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.569 
we could also do the technique called
the<00:01:34.200> flutter<00:01:34.380> that's<00:01:35.039> where<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> tongue

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the flutter that's where the tongue

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.599 
the flutter that's where the tongue
comes<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> off<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.630> harmonica<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.609> that

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
comes on and off the harmonica is that

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.849 
comes on and off the harmonica is that
same<00:01:38.880> slap<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.570> multiple<00:01:40.140> times<00:01:40.409> over<00:01:40.740> again

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
same slap just multiple times over again

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.190 
same slap just multiple times over again
using<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.369> light<00:01:41.549> touch<00:01:41.759> make<00:01:42.600> sure<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.960> hole

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
using a light touch make sure that hole

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080 
using a light touch make sure that hole
on<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> right<00:01:43.679> side<00:01:43.740> stays<00:01:44.369> open<00:01:44.579> all<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
on the right side stays open all the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.840 
on the right side stays open all the
time<00:01:45.350> in<00:01:46.350> slaps<00:01:46.710> will<00:01:46.950> commonly<00:01:47.369> use<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> little

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
time in slaps will commonly use a little

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.459 
time in slaps will commonly use a little
bit<00:01:47.969> of<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.149> puff<00:01:48.359> of<00:01:48.509> air<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:51.420> pronounce<00:01:52.200> each

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
bit of a puff of air to pronounce each

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.830 
bit of a puff of air to pronounce each
one<00:01:52.679> those<00:01:52.799> slaps<00:01:56.210> each<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.539> those<00:01:57.600> slaps

excuse<00:03:04.230> me<00:03:04.350> on<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.620> tongue<00:03:04.860> block<00:03:05.070> trainer

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
excuse me on the tongue block trainer

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.450 
excuse me on the tongue block trainer
slowly<00:03:09.620> yeah<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:10.830> you're<00:03:11.010> alternating

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
slowly yeah so you're alternating

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.760 
slowly yeah so you're alternating
between<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.090> 1<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.540> 4<00:03:12.720> another<00:03:13.500> way<00:03:13.710> to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
between the 1 and the 4 another way to

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.500 
between the 1 and the 4 another way to
do<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.220> use<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.430> lighter<00:03:14.910> touch<00:03:15.150> just

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
do it is to use a lighter touch just

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.850 
do it is to use a lighter touch just
using<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.810> very<00:03:15.990> tip<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.380> tongue<00:03:16.620> so

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
using the very tip of the tongue so

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.680 
using the very tip of the tongue so
you're<00:03:16.980> getting<00:03:17.250> more<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.490> a<00:03:17.640> chord<00:03:18.150> as<00:03:18.390> it

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
you're getting more of a chord as it

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.450 
you're getting more of a chord as it
goes<00:03:18.900> across<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.560> face<00:03:19.710> of<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:19.920> harmonica

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
goes across the face of the harmonica

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.940 
goes across the face of the harmonica
with<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.300> harmonica<00:03:24.440> with<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> tongue<00:03:25.740> block

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
with the harmonica with the tongue block

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
with the harmonica with the tongue block
trainer<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.770> see<00:03:32.010> more<00:03:32.280> corridor

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
trainer so you see more corridor

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.150 
trainer so you see more corridor
multiple<00:03:33.510> notes<00:03:33.720> happening<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.860> way<00:03:34.980> that

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
multiple notes happening the way that

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.860 
multiple notes happening the way that
Joe<00:03:35.340> Phyllis<00:03:35.700> Coe<00:03:35.850> performs<00:03:36.330> this<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.780> if

interview at blues harmonica calm as a

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.490 
interview at blues harmonica calm as a
post<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.940> their<00:03:42.120> tongue<00:03:42.360> basically<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.380> an

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
post to their tongue basically in an

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.200 
post to their tongue basically in an
octave<00:03:43.890> embouchure<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.700> tongue<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.030> in

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
octave embouchure so the tongue is in

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.930 
octave embouchure so the tongue is in
holes<00:03:45.840> 2<00:03:46.110> &amp;<00:03:46.260> 3<00:03:46.320> for<00:03:46.650> example<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.250> then<00:03:47.850> the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
holes 2 &amp; 3 for example and then the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.250 
holes 2 &amp; 3 for example and then the
tongue<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.450> middle<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.870> tongue<00:03:49.050> if<00:03:49.200> I

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
tongue in the middle of the tongue if I

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.340 
tongue in the middle of the tongue if I
change<00:03:49.560> my<00:03:49.710> angle<00:03:50.100> moves<00:03:50.880> left<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:51.540> right<00:03:51.660> as

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
change my angle moves left and right as

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.010 
change my angle moves left and right as
the<00:03:52.710> tongue<00:03:52.950> stays<00:03:53.310> stationary<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.810> tip

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
the tongue stays stationary on the tip

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.440 
the tongue stays stationary on the tip
so<00:03:55.740> what<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:56.040> does<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.490> it<00:03:56.640> closes<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.300> hole

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
so what that does is it closes the hole

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.330 
so what that does is it closes the hole
off<00:03:57.690> on<00:03:57.870> this<00:03:58.020> side<00:03:58.230> only<00:03:58.620> sounds<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.100> side

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
off on this side only sounds the side

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.430 
off on this side only sounds the side
tongue<00:03:59.910> moves<00:04:00.150> this<00:04:00.300> way<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.960> opens<00:04:01.290> up

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
tongue moves this way and it opens up

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.140 
tongue moves this way and it opens up
that<00:04:01.590> hole<00:04:01.800> so<00:04:02.010> you're<00:04:02.460> getting<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.820> pinging

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
that hole so you're getting that pinging

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.540 
that hole so you're getting that pinging
effect<00:04:03.660> by<00:04:03.870> moving<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.440> body<00:04:04.740> or<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.160> center

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
effect by moving the body or the center

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.120 
effect by moving the body or the center
over<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.880> tongue<00:04:06.090> left<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:07.050> right<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.500> wish<00:04:08.010> I

over the tongue left to right I wish I

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.620 
over the tongue left to right I wish I
could<00:04:08.310> demonstrate<00:04:08.460> it<00:04:08.940> because<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.180> can't<00:04:09.450> do

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
could demonstrate it because I can't do

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.840 
could demonstrate it because I can't do
it<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.930> way<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:10.350> sometimes<00:04:11.190> this<00:04:11.400> technique

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
it that way so sometimes this technique

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.120 
it that way so sometimes this technique
some<00:04:12.480> people<00:04:12.750> find<00:04:12.990> the<00:04:13.140> on<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.530> off<00:04:13.650> motion

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
some people find the on and off motion

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.500 
some people find the on and off motion
more<00:04:14.280> comfortable<00:04:14.820> that's<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.240> way<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:15.450> I

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
more comfortable that's the way that I

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.539 
more comfortable that's the way that I
play<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.049> most<00:04:16.620> players<00:04:16.920> play<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.370> and

play it and most players play it and

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.520 
play it and most players play it and
some<00:04:18.120> find<00:04:18.390> it<00:04:18.510> more<00:04:18.630> comfortable<00:04:19.140> to<00:04:19.200> move

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530

they will tend to use the side-to-side
motion<00:04:27.889> more<00:04:28.280> often<00:04:28.610> than<00:04:28.819> they<00:04:28.939> all<00:04:29.120> on<00:04:29.270> and

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.270 
motion more often than they all on and
off<00:04:29.569> so<00:04:30.169> that's<00:04:30.319> an<00:04:30.409> interesting<00:04:30.710> technique

further so that all the holes get

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.170 
further so that all the holes get
blocked<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.860> that<00:05:40.009> when<00:05:40.129> the<00:05:40.219> tongue<00:05:40.430> release

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
blocked so that when the tongue release

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.999 
blocked so that when the tongue release
is<00:05:41.389> off<00:05:41.539> the<00:05:41.750> face<00:05:41.930> of<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.169> harmonica<00:05:42.770> we<00:05:42.889> get

is off the face of the harmonica we get

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.070 
is off the face of the harmonica we get
a<00:05:43.039> nice<00:05:43.219> articulation<00:05:43.690> this<00:05:44.690> is<00:05:44.839> what<00:05:44.990> it

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
a nice articulation this is what it

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.909 
a nice articulation this is what it
sounds<00:05:45.469> like

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
here's if I do the slap on the downbeat

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.350 
here's if I do the slap on the downbeat
and<00:05:48.319> the<00:05:48.500> lift<00:05:48.800> on<00:05:49.039> the<00:05:49.279> upbeat<00:05:49.310> let<00:05:50.089> me<00:05:50.180> do<00:05:50.270> it
