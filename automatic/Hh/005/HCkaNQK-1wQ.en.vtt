alright guys this is what I did to this
thing<00:00:03.960> when<00:00:04.960> I<00:00:04.990> initially<00:00:05.259> decided<00:00:06.009> I<00:00:06.070> was

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.160 
thing when I initially decided I was

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.449 
thing when I initially decided I was
gonna<00:00:06.340> remove<00:00:06.880> the<00:00:07.150> stock<00:00:07.540> 50cc<00:00:08.259> two<00:00:08.980> cycle

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:09.459 
gonna remove the stock 50cc two cycle

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.299 
gonna remove the stock 50cc two cycle
engine<00:00:10.230> rather<00:00:11.230> than<00:00:11.440> rebuild<00:00:11.589> I<00:00:11.950> was<00:00:12.099> gonna

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
engine rather than rebuild I was gonna

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.299 
engine rather than rebuild I was gonna
put<00:00:12.459> a<00:00:12.490> Briggs<00:00:12.789> and<00:00:12.969> Stratton<00:00:12.999> engine<00:00:13.509> on<00:00:13.809> it

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
put a Briggs and Stratton engine on it

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.310 
put a Briggs and Stratton engine on it
well<00:00:15.309> you<00:00:15.699> see<00:00:15.999> where<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.270> stock<00:00:16.539> frame<00:00:17.019> was

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
well you see where the stock frame was

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.560 
well you see where the stock frame was
right<00:00:17.590> here

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
right here

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.720 
right here
so<00:00:19.980> obviously<00:00:20.980> that<00:00:21.220> wasn't<00:00:21.369> gonna<00:00:21.550> work

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
so obviously that wasn't gonna work

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.749 
so obviously that wasn't gonna work
because<00:00:22.449> the<00:00:22.720> height<00:00:22.929> of<00:00:23.050> the<00:00:23.109> motor<00:00:23.349> so<00:00:23.759> opted

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
because the height of the motor so opted

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.300 
because the height of the motor so opted
to<00:00:24.789> put<00:00:25.000> this<00:00:25.119> half-inch<00:00:25.740> rigid<00:00:26.740> pipe<00:00:26.949> in<00:00:27.130> here

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
to put this half-inch rigid pipe in here

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.669 
to put this half-inch rigid pipe in here
with<00:00:27.429> elbow<00:00:27.849> to<00:00:28.779> create<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.169> backbone<00:00:29.650> of

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:29.679 
with elbow to create the backbone of

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.760 
with elbow to create the backbone of
this<00:00:29.980> thing<00:00:30.630> well<00:00:31.630> now<00:00:31.990> I'm<00:00:32.110> gonna<00:00:32.230> use<00:00:32.349> this

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
this thing well now I'm gonna use this

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.570 
this thing well now I'm gonna use this
Honda<00:00:33.460> clone<00:00:33.850> motor<00:00:34.150> and<00:00:34.950> it'll<00:00:35.950> actually<00:00:36.070> fit

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
Honda clone motor and it'll actually fit

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.660 
Honda clone motor and it'll actually fit
in<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:36.850> stock<00:00:37.150> frame<00:00:37.540> area<00:00:41.310> let's<00:00:42.310> take<00:00:42.490> this

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
in the stock frame area let's take this

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.550 
in the stock frame area let's take this
original<00:00:43.270> piece<00:00:43.450> I<00:00:43.660> did<00:00:43.840> cut<00:00:44.200> out<00:00:44.380> of<00:00:44.500> the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
original piece I did cut out of the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.310 
original piece I did cut out of the
frame<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:46.120> weld<00:00:46.480> it<00:00:46.660> back<00:00:47.110> in<00:00:47.710> place<00:00:47.980> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
frame and weld it back in place and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.050 
frame and weld it back in place and
frame<00:00:50.320> was<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.710> little<00:00:51.040> tweaked<00:00:51.310> when<00:00:51.550> I<00:00:51.580> welded

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
frame was a little tweaked when I welded

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.450 
frame was a little tweaked when I welded
that<00:00:52.090> on<00:00:52.420> cuz<00:00:53.080> it's<00:00:53.260> pretty<00:00:53.650> loose<00:00:56.340> see<00:00:57.340> it

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
that on cuz it's pretty loose see it

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.180 
that on cuz it's pretty loose see it
moves<00:00:57.670> around<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:58.120> lot<00:00:58.150> there<00:00:59.010> look<00:01:00.010> at<00:01:00.040> that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
moves around a lot there look at that

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.259 
moves around a lot there look at that
half-inch<00:01:00.640> pipe<00:01:02.310> so<00:01:03.310> what<00:01:03.490> I'm<00:01:03.580> gonna<00:01:03.700> do<00:01:03.880> like

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
half-inch pipe so what I'm gonna do like

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.200 
half-inch pipe so what I'm gonna do like
I<00:01:04.390> said<00:01:04.449> I'm<00:01:04.690> weld<00:01:04.989> this<00:01:05.170> back<00:01:05.470> in<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:06.760> front

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
I said I'm weld this back in up front

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.070 
I said I'm weld this back in up front
first<00:01:07.510> right<00:01:07.960> there<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.940> then<00:01:10.570> tweak<00:01:10.900> the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
first right there and then tweak the

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.240 
first right there and then tweak the
frame<00:01:11.320> back<00:01:11.560> holds<00:01:12.400> it<00:01:12.520> place<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.690> weld<00:01:14.250> that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
frame back holds it place and weld that

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.310 
frame back holds it place and weld that
all<00:01:15.430> back<00:01:15.640> together<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.240> then<00:01:16.870> this<00:01:17.050> motor

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
all back together and then this motor

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.130 
all back together and then this motor
will<00:01:17.530> fit<00:01:17.770> underneath<00:01:18.100> there<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.750> what<00:01:19.960> we'll

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
will fit underneath there and what we'll

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.300 
will fit underneath there and what we'll
do<00:01:20.290> is<00:01:20.320> just<00:01:20.680> get<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:20.890> standard<00:01:21.340> go-kart<00:01:22.210> clutch

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
do is just get a standard go-kart clutch

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.610 
almost completely stock other than the
fact<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.549> it's<00:02:25.790> got<00:02:25.909> a<00:02:25.989> big-ass<00:02:26.989> five

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
fact that it's got a big-ass five

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.059 
fact that it's got a big-ass five
horsepower<00:02:28.010> engine<00:02:28.609> on<00:02:28.730> as<00:02:28.909> opposed<00:02:29.239> to<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
horsepower engine on as opposed to the

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.670 
horsepower engine on as opposed to the
little<00:02:31.069> uh<00:02:31.659> fifty<00:02:32.659> CC<00:02:33.049> that<00:02:33.200> was<00:02:33.290> on<00:02:33.439> there<00:02:33.650> I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
little uh fifty CC that was on there I

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.080 
little uh fifty CC that was on there I
think<00:02:33.920> those<00:02:34.069> are<00:02:34.099> like<00:02:34.310> 100<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:34.879> something

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
think those are like 100 and something

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.940 
think those are like 100 and something
cc's<00:02:35.629> almost<00:02:36.590> 200<00:02:37.159> cc's<00:02:38.049> so<00:02:39.049> could<00:02:39.829> be<00:02:39.919> a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
cc's almost 200 cc's so could be a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.360 
cc's almost 200 cc's so could be a
little<00:02:40.010> bit<00:02:40.310> quicker

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
little bit quicker

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.110 
little bit quicker
alright<00:02:43.370> let's<00:02:43.519> see<00:02:43.669> if<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.879> thing's

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
alright let's see if this thing's

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.050 
alright let's see if this thing's
working<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:44.659> that's<00:02:45.499> Cameron<00:02:45.980> Wallace<00:02:46.579> Weldon

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
and he quit just stopped recording so I

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.879 
and he quit just stopped recording so I
don't<00:02:51.769> know<00:02:51.889> if<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.129> was<00:02:53.079> from<00:02:54.079> the<00:02:54.139> arc<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.829> the

so<00:03:11.950> I'm<00:03:12.040> going<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.220> try<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.430> again<00:03:12.580> see<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.270> got

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
so I'm going to try it again see I got

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.840 
so I'm going to try it again see I got
that<00:03:13.660> piece<00:03:13.840> welded<00:03:14.110> on<00:03:14.440> go<00:03:15.400> ahead<00:03:15.490> and<00:03:15.670> cut

this half inch pipe all the way off and

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.430 
this half inch pipe all the way off and
then<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:18.970> can<00:03:19.150> tweak<00:03:19.330> this<00:03:19.540> frame<00:03:19.840> around<00:03:20.230> and

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
then I can tweak this frame around and

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.690 
then I can tweak this frame around and
line<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.340> up<00:03:22.740> welded<00:03:23.740> on<00:03:23.860> this<00:03:24.040> side<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.520> flip
