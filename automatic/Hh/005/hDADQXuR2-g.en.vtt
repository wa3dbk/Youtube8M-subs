00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
we're going to do is measure our space

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.769 
we're going to do is measure our space
the<00:00:26.460> wall<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.910> we're<00:00:27.060> working<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.420> today

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the wall that we're working with today

is<00:00:28.050> 70<00:00:28.590> inches<00:00:28.890> wide<00:00:29.130> we're<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> look

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
is 70 inches wide we're going to look

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.730 
is 70 inches wide we're going to look
for<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.330> midpoint<00:00:30.630> which<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.439> going<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> be

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
just took out a little wood what this

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.410 
just took out a little wood what this
allows<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.250> board<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.550> precisely<00:01:42.120> fit

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
allows is for the board to precisely fit

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.930 
allows is for the board to precisely fit
on<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.880> display<00:01:46.130> if<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.250> want<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> board<00:01:47.880> to
