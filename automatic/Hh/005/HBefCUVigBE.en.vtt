ball<00:01:39.200> one<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.770> that's<00:01:40.190> why<00:01:40.310> we<00:01:40.340> call<00:01:40.610> it<00:01:40.640> to

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
ball one and that's why we call it to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.540 
ball one and that's why we call it to
vote<00:01:41.119> too<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:42.200> can<00:01:42.410> see<00:01:42.590> both<00:01:42.800> mobiles<00:01:43.220> are

pretty much the same in size although
the<00:01:46.910> turbo<00:01:47.750> too<00:01:48.590> it's<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:49.010> little<00:01:49.130> bit<00:01:49.280> slimmer

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
the turbo too it's a little bit slimmer

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.530 
the turbo too it's a little bit slimmer
than<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:49.940> 201<00:01:50.720> only<00:01:51.340> 7.1<00:01:52.340> millimeters<00:01:53.000> making

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540

it<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.750> very<00:01:54.020> slim<00:01:54.470> mobile<00:01:54.800> another<00:01:55.670> big

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
it a very slim mobile another big

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.460 
it a very slim mobile another big
difference<00:01:56.210> between<00:01:56.509> them<00:01:56.720> is<00:01:56.869> that<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.290> true

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
difference between them is that the true

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.940 
difference between them is that the true
are<00:01:58.090> cons<00:01:59.090> with<00:02:00.020> retro<00:02:00.590> illuminated<00:02:01.930> buttons
