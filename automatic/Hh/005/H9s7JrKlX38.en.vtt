and<00:00:00.089> one<00:00:00.599> of<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.810> biggest<00:00:01.020> problems<00:00:01.560> with<00:00:01.740> our

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
and one of the biggest problems with our

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.280 
and one of the biggest problems with our
grid<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.520> that<00:00:02.970> we<00:00:03.060> have<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.240> keep<00:00:03.689> fueling

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
grid is that we have to keep fueling

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.289 
grid is that we have to keep fueling
power<00:00:04.560> plants<00:00:05.100> even<00:00:05.819> when<00:00:05.970> we're<00:00:06.120> not<00:00:06.150> using

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
power plants even when we're not using

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.259 
power plants even when we're not using
the<00:00:06.779> energy<00:00:07.069> so<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> lot<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.370> electricity<00:00:08.849> goes

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
the energy so a lot of electricity goes

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.230 
the energy so a lot of electricity goes
to<00:00:09.540> waste<00:00:10.160> but<00:00:11.160> what<00:00:11.309> if<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.490> could<00:00:11.639> store<00:00:11.969> that

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
to waste but what if we could store that

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.169 
to waste but what if we could store that
electricity<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:13.080> really<00:00:14.009> big<00:00:14.280> batteries<00:00:14.880> and

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
electricity in really big batteries and

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.510 
electricity in really big batteries and
what<00:00:16.139> if<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:16.350> could<00:00:16.500> make<00:00:16.740> those<00:00:17.010> giant

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
what if we could make those giant

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.689 
what if we could make those giant
batteries<00:00:17.970> dirt<00:00:18.900> cheap<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.369> only<00:00:20.490> way<00:00:20.640> I

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
batteries dirt cheap and the only way I

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.340 
batteries dirt cheap and the only way I
know<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.970> make<00:00:21.180> something<00:00:21.420> dirt<00:00:21.720> cheap<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.140> to

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
know to make something dirt cheap is to

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.439 
know to make something dirt cheap is to
make<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.830> from<00:00:22.920> dirt<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.060> that's<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
make it from dirt and so that's the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.210 
make it from dirt and so that's the
approach<00:00:24.689> I'm<00:00:24.900> taking<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.320> mind<00:00:25.500> from<00:00:25.980> dirt

make<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.609> from<00:00:26.789> dirt<00:00:27.000> from<00:00:27.240> American<00:00:27.869> dirt<00:00:28.369> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
make it from dirt from American dirt the
