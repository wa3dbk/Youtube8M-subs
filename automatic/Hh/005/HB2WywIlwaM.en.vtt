get everything for about $1100 but

get everything for about $1100 but
then<00:04:27.090> I'm<00:04:27.210> probably<00:04:27.419> gonna<00:04:27.690> have<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:28.080> replace

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
then I'm probably gonna have to replace

then I'm probably gonna have to replace
the<00:04:28.560> headers<00:04:28.830> or<00:04:29.699> at<00:04:29.910> least<00:04:30.210> go<00:04:30.690> true<00:04:31.350> dual<00:04:31.650> out

right<00:04:32.520> now<00:04:32.639> it's<00:04:32.819> single<00:04:33.120> exhaust<00:04:33.650> this<00:04:34.650> is

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
right now it's single exhaust this is

right now it's single exhaust this is
why<00:04:34.860> I'm<00:04:35.009> trying<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.340> side<00:04:35.580> what<00:04:35.729> I<00:04:35.759> want<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.000> do

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
why I'm trying to side what I want to do

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.850 
why I'm trying to side what I want to do
because<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:36.750> just<00:04:36.780> put<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.169> glass<00:04:37.380> pack<00:04:37.680> on

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
because I just put a glass pack on

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.930 
because I just put a glass pack on
that's<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.400> other<00:04:38.490> thing<00:04:38.639> I<00:04:38.699> haven't

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
that's the other thing I haven't

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.110 
that's the other thing I haven't
finished<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.449> had<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.289> cut<00:04:40.919> out<00:04:40.949> the<00:04:41.340> pipe<00:04:41.880> going

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
finished I had to cut out the pipe going

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.800 
finished I had to cut out the pipe going
over<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.509> axle<00:04:43.759> obviously<00:04:44.759> because<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.630> was

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
over the axle obviously because it was

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.909 
over the axle obviously because it was
an<00:04:45.960> offset<00:04:46.560> exhaust<00:04:47.060> so<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.560> can<00:04:49.560> get<00:04:49.710> under

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
an offset exhaust so I can get under

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:57.469 
an offset exhaust so I can get under
here<00:04:54.800> there's<00:04:55.800> an<00:04:55.889> offset<00:04:56.310> exhaust<00:04:56.699> so<00:04:56.970> when<00:04:57.449> I

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
here there's an offset exhaust so when I

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.240 
here there's an offset exhaust so when I
put<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.840> glass<00:04:58.050> back<00:04:58.380> in<00:04:58.620> it<00:04:58.830> didn't<00:04:59.039> line<00:04:59.220> up

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
put the glass back in it didn't line up

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.580 
put the glass back in it didn't line up
so<00:04:59.940> I<00:04:59.970> gotta<00:05:00.180> have<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.389> new<00:05:00.570> pipe<00:05:00.780> made<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.259> was

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
so I gotta have a new pipe made I was

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.020 
so I gotta have a new pipe made I was
actually<00:05:01.770> getting<00:05:02.370> ready<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:02.699> bring<00:05:02.820> this<00:05:02.940> to

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
actually getting ready to bring this to

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.240 
actually getting ready to bring this to
the<00:05:03.090> muffler<00:05:03.360> shop<00:05:03.599> the<00:05:03.780> next<00:05:03.960> day<00:05:04.380> when<00:05:05.220> I

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250

broke<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.759> motor<00:05:06.000> mount<00:05:06.830> so<00:05:07.880> there's<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.970> few

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
broke the motor mount so there's a few

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.999 
broke the motor mount so there's a few
things<00:05:09.180> I<00:05:09.539> need<00:05:09.599> to<00:05:09.750> do<00:05:11.270> exhaust<00:05:12.620> well<00:05:13.650> motor

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
things I need to do exhaust well motor

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.850 
things I need to do exhaust well motor
mount<00:05:14.300> exhaust<00:05:15.349> then<00:05:16.349> I<00:05:16.380> might<00:05:16.620> talk<00:05:16.800> about

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
mount exhaust then I might talk about

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.510 
mount exhaust then I might talk about
performance<00:05:17.639> but<00:05:18.570> right<00:05:19.139> now<00:05:19.320> this<00:05:20.130> is<00:05:20.190> what's

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
performance but right now this is what's

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.680 
performance but right now this is what's
going<00:05:20.669> on<00:05:20.849> with<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.120> car<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:24.330> original

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690
