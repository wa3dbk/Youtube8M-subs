start a successful lifestyle while

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.939 
start a successful lifestyle while
they're<00:01:03.930> broad<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.619> their<00:01:04.799> own

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
they're broad all on their own

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.700 
they're broad all on their own
and<00:01:05.189> many<00:01:05.790> only<00:01:06.000> come<00:01:06.240> after<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.290> know<00:01:07.380> having

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
and having never lived alone so it's a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.800 
and having never lived alone so it's a
novel<00:01:11.430> experience<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.750> people

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
novel experience but I think people

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.940 
novel experience but I think people
should<00:01:12.960> make<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> most<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.560> it

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
should make the most of it

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.440 
should make the most of it
because<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.700> an<00:01:14.850> invaluable<00:01:15.240> opportunity

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
because it's an invaluable opportunity

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.469 
because it's an invaluable opportunity
and<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.439> university<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.310> Cardiff<00:01:17.729> very
