00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.729
 ah 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.920
 hello youtube friends welcome to a 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.410
 new windows 10 tutorial in this 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.960
 opportunity let's explore a little the 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.630
 benefits offered by the new 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.000
 original and native Windows application 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.270
 10 to synchronize the files that 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.730
 we have in our ipad android phone 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.230
 iphone or windows phones 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.180
 as you know one of the great 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.780
 What's new in Windows is that now 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.540
 allows us 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.910
 and connect our mobile equipment to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.760
 can transfer information and install 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.720
 applications well the first thing we will 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.070
 to do is to direct us 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.550
 let's go here to the engine of 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.230
 search for this and we will search 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.720
 phone add-on 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.460
 this is the application that we are going to 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.650
 use to synchronize our data 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.110
 well here we can see that windows 10 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.870
 it works with all three systems 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.220
 operatives mentioned in this case 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.080
 let's do the test with the ipad 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.610
 newspapers 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.530
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.110
 connect our device 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.330
 it is important to mention this at the moment 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.760
 to connect always we will appear a 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.460
 notification in the case of years if 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.330
 trust or not trust the team 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.280
 we choose to trust of course well now 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.390
 we select the system the type of 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.890
 terminal that would be iphone or ipad 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.570
 we wait a few seconds and well we see what 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.560
 that we have available here we have 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.540
 good cutting is still not 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.369
 available for Latin America but it is 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.940
 possible if we change the region 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.640
 Spain we have a raid that is for 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.170
 save storage in the cloud this 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.539
 new application to listen to music 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.050
 that is still not available 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.210
 we have onenote 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.300
 Tasks to create task lists 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.780
 skype that we can produce of course 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.520
 in the microsoft office suite 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.900
 he is also present with word excel and 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.430
 power point and of course or cloud in the 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.700
 good email application 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.470
 let's do the test with office 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.910
 we click on production and good if 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.100
 We have not yet logged in with 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.480
 our account will ask us 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.910
 logically that we do we are going to 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.870
 register our data the mail 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.120
 electronic 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.150
 of course the connection to 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.150
 Internet 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.940
 to make this possible well let's 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.830
 log in 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.630
 although it asks for the windows password 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.569
 if you have a password and the digit and 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.849
 if you do not just give him the following 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.730
 and well let's save to see what it is 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.930
 what happens good 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.900
 we have to change the account 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.939
 microsoft 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.040
 and you have to continue the march 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.840
 shortly we see it 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.459
 and well we already started session and the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.360
 computer with our account 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.310
 microsoft 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.170
 we can change it again an account 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.060
 local if it is enough for us 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.820
 uncomfortable having to depend on the internet 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.760
 to learn the computer we press 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.460
 if it's me and well now we choose the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.230
 applications that appear to us that we're going 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.390
 to choose word nothing else but we can 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.070
 choose the other two remember that they are 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.140
 free both for iphone and for 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.030
 ipad and also for android and 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.190
 logically for windows phones 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.050
 click on next 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.770
 well we choose the type of device 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.830
 ipad and we put an email account 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.040
 electronic and good let's put the 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.900
 next and well let's start 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.099
 session in the word application 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.099
 we put next 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.200
 and ready 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:00.700
 this means that we have already been able 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:05.990
 install word on our device 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.240
 let's see that here the bar is in progress 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.820
 that means that the process is being 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.800
 doing now we just have to 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.510
 wait until the installation proceeds 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.970
 that simple and easy they can 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.829
 install the original applications that 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.650
 we have in 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.750
 microsoft that gives us for our 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.610
 mobile devices what will be interesting 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.740

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.900
 finally we come back once again to the 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.240
 application home page 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.550
 phone add-on and we see that in 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.610
 this bottom part we have the option of 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.009
 show to import photos and videos 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.020

 transfer other files from the 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.789

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.490
