missions daily missions or weekly
missions<00:01:10.350> depends<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.689> let's<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.439> turn

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
missions depends so let's just turn

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.130 

since<00:01:18.190> this<00:01:18.430> is<00:01:18.640> my<00:01:18.670> first<00:01:18.880> time<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.780> it

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
since this is my first time and it

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.170 
since this is my first time and it
didn't<00:01:20.650> really<00:01:21.070> show<00:01:21.310> this<00:01:21.460> in<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.730> livestream

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
didn't really show this in a livestream

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.470 
didn't really show this in a livestream
so<00:01:22.780> this<00:01:22.960> is<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.170> really<00:01:23.620> cool<00:01:24.270> environment<00:01:25.270> we

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
so this is a really cool environment we

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.670 
so this is a really cool environment we
have<00:01:25.720> our<00:01:27.000> Gotham<00:01:28.000> under<00:01:28.390> siege<00:01:28.660> returned<00:01:29.530> to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
have our Gotham under siege returned to

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.950 
have our Gotham under siege returned to
last<00:01:29.890> location<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:31.120> teleport<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.930> the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
last location and teleport to the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.940 
last location and teleport to the
watchtower

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
watchtower

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.460 
watchtower
