they had CGI they had little claim like
figures<00:01:45.830> called<00:01:46.490> automation<00:01:47.300> when<00:01:47.899> they

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
figures called automation when they

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.920 
figures called automation when they
would<00:01:48.110> do<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.410> claymation<00:01:48.710> characters<00:01:49.930> they

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
would do the claymation characters they

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.719 
would do the claymation characters they
would<00:01:51.080> move<00:01:51.200> one<00:01:51.440> piece<00:01:51.680> at<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.890> time<00:01:51.950> or<00:01:52.700> just

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
would move one piece at a time or just

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.120 
would move one piece at a time or just
feel<00:01:52.970> like<00:01:53.060> legs<00:01:53.470> remember<00:01:54.470> they<00:01:54.800> would<00:01:54.950> come

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
feel like legs remember they would come

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.790 
feel like legs remember they would come
alive<00:01:55.340> then<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.270> hands<00:01:56.450> would<00:01:56.660> stop<00:01:56.960> just<00:01:57.140> a

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
alive then the hands would stop just a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.740 
alive then the hands would stop just a
head<00:01:57.950> with<00:01:58.130> movement<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:58.729> look<00:01:59.270> over<00:01:59.540> the

fighting<00:02:08.200> for<00:02:08.440> every<00:02:08.740> single<00:02:09.010> second<00:02:09.310> they're

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
fighting for every single second they're

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.740 
fighting for every single second they're
just<00:02:09.640> moving<00:02:09.760> the<00:02:09.970> parts<00:02:10.210> that<00:02:10.300> were<00:02:10.479> needed

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
just moving the parts that were needed

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.170 
just moving the parts that were needed
to<00:02:10.780> move<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.800> what<00:02:11.920> happens<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.460> it<00:02:12.610> created<00:02:13.060> a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
to move and what happens is it created a

into<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.590> sandbagging<00:02:42.130> idea<00:02:42.790> of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
into the sandbagging idea of

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.620 
into the sandbagging idea of
everything's<00:02:43.240> wanted<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.790> everything<00:02:46.000> like

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
everything's wanted and everything like

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.810 
everything's wanted and everything like
that<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.960> whole<00:02:47.110> time<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:51.010> robot<00:02:51.340> comes<00:02:51.580> into

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
that the whole time the robot comes into

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.520 
that the whole time the robot comes into
play<00:02:51.970> is<00:02:52.150> like<00:02:52.300> I<00:02:52.330> said<00:02:52.600> you're<00:02:52.750> isolating<00:02:53.350> so

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
play is like I said you're isolating so

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.850 
play is like I said you're isolating so
think<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:53.920> even<00:02:54.340> as<00:02:54.670> you're<00:02:54.880> moving<00:02:55.300> with<00:02:55.660> this

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
think of even as you're moving with this

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.230 
think of even as you're moving with this
character<00:02:56.860> or<00:02:57.660> 5<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.990> 10<00:02:59.140> he<00:02:59.320> you<00:02:59.740> might<00:02:59.920> stop

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.490 

and<00:03:04.240> this<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.570> where<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.750> becomes<00:03:04.840> illusion<00:03:05.410> up

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
and this is where it becomes illusion up

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.500 
and this is where it becomes illusion up
so<00:03:05.710> your<00:03:05.860> dime<00:03:06.040> stopping<00:03:06.580> stopping<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.240> the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
so your dime stopping stopping is the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.890 
so your dime stopping stopping is the
whole<00:03:07.720> purpose<00:03:07.990> is<00:03:08.260> not

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
whole purpose is not

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.190 
whole purpose is not
character<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.709> life<00:03:09.890> but<00:03:10.099> to<00:03:10.280> look<00:03:10.430> Unruh<00:03:11.200> so
