00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:18.359
 mod 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.390
 do not 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.179
 hello I'm billy crash 5m 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.569
 watching there I want to deal with the phrasing topic of your xbox three console 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.359
 settlements the bank in xbox the iss plus a datum of because if you want games 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.540
 interactive you should buy an xbox 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.210
 well the first thing you should know is what tray you have if it is one of those that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.510
 appear on the screen can be flashed 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.880
 besiege or as you say 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.390
 if it is not one of these you will not be able to hack 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.120
 does not want to be marked because there are those who say that filipas must be sanctioned 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.900
 your fucking mother 'xd 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.840
 second there are two types of chip the virtual 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.160
 that is modify the firmware and the physical 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.360
 which then deceives the reader to pass the pirates as original 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.089
 the bad thing is that with the physical you lose your guarantee 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.870
 If you still have your guarantee, use the virtual 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.650
 If you no longer have a guarantee, use the physical chip 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.910
 although I recommend the virtual one even if you do not have a guarantee 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.690
 since in the physical they could move something important of the xbox 4 put it chip in a 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.960
 place of trust since someone can change your console 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.580
 Do something that causes your console to fail and remember that you try to 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.690
 phrasing in your presence usually does not take more than an hour 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.320
 5th is not necessary for accessories ie controls 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.000
 memories and in addition 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.720
 guitars 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.530
 etc 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.880
 6th only plays with sterile copies 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.880
 If you do not know how to write, you write 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.360
 well also play with games from your region if you live in Mexico like me or in 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.159
 the rest of america uses ntsc copies and if you live in europe use pal copies 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.100
 there is also fry 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.130
 but it is preferable that it be from your region search forums, by the way not all 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.260
 games are sterile so they prefer almost this is the tone 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.190
 and an error of mine from this one that is the fifth are measures so that you do not go 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.630
 Eden 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.609
 but hear I'm human I have errors 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:11.639
 do not do not play games before the official departure officer 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:16.229
 do not do this with 7th originals the updates downloaded by 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.739
 internet matched those in tubes with a cd or dvd disc 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.099
 the console will recognize them 8ยบ do not play too many games in one 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.950
 day since snot of the will investigate and possibly you will be banned 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.170
 9ยบ do not play sen xbox the iss with pirates only do it with originals by the way 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.410
 even connect your ethernet when you play pirate games if you want to play in 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.870
 the ifa when you finish playing a pirate game 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.049
 turn off your console 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.180
 connect the card and then turn it on and now if you play with originals in the ihf 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.739
 now happened to say methods to fade art 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.510
 these methods is but never rener than using them 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.660
 the first one to change the mother card to your xbox since what hanescu is worth 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.480
 solano tuca treats me the next is to call the technical service of microsoft 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:00.999
 left the number in the description 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.359
 and the script that more or less should follow 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.700
 well I only know those two methods 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.160
 my recommendation to play in the ihf is that only with three original games 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.370
 worth playing in the iffhs like jairo 3 whose software 2 among others 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.480
 seeing his hygiene that is about the three red lights 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.580
 if you have a guarantee, call the microsoft service center if you no longer have 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.319
 guarantee also calls but do not say that you have a problem other than that of the 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.360
 three red lights if they ask you what color is the regulator bulb 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.939
 energy if you tell him it's red because you got fucked 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.749
 what you have to say is that when it's off it's orange and when it's on 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:40.420
 it's green and they'll process your request and they'll change your console in nine days 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:41.199
 skillful 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.719
 if your console overheats buy those back fans and now 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:50.979
 because you have to buy an active xbox 360 and not a wii for the project 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.779
 natal will be something similar to wii moutaz 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:56.829
 but surely with better graphics and covers 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.209
 well I say goodbye 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.290
 and I tell them I have not put chip arm and xbox 360 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.359
 for lack of money since I am saving to avoid jerod ward tour 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.209
 I preferred to buy this one before the gil or three 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.080
 since the guitar gently will bring me a guitar and the genil or three pairs in a 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.940
 car dig a few months ago to be still living the jubilation 3 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.860
 the next day they bought it and after a while they brought 2g and the 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.410
 three I have also seen that it has happened with other games in order I say goodbye and 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.970
 happy holidays and merry christmas
