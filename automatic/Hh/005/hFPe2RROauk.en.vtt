donate one dollar to charity which I

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.820 
donate one dollar to charity which I

think it's a really good thing for them

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.759 
think it's a really good thing for them
and<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.099> kind<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.700> lets<00:02:37.660> people<00:02:37.900> throw<00:02:38.680> away

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
and it kind of lets people throw away

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.940 
and it kind of lets people throw away
stuff<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.700> don't<00:02:39.880> really<00:02:40.209> need<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.830> at<00:02:41.830> the
