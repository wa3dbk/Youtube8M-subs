00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.180 

so<00:00:28.990> today<00:00:29.260> we're<00:00:29.470> going<00:00:29.560> to<00:00:29.650> be<00:00:29.740> talking<00:00:30.070> about

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
so today we're going to be talking about

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.310 
so today we're going to be talking about
paper<00:00:30.550> and<00:00:30.850> when<00:00:31.360> you<00:00:31.420> go<00:00:31.510> into<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.780> art<00:00:31.960> store

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
paper and when you go into the art store

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.319 
paper and when you go into the art store
you're<00:00:32.529> gonna<00:00:32.649> see<00:00:33.520> something<00:00:33.760> kind<00:00:34.030> of<00:00:34.180> like

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
you're gonna see something kind of like

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.639 
you're gonna see something kind of like
this<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.870> might<00:00:38.050> make<00:00:38.170> you<00:00:38.289> feel<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.500> bit

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
this it might make you feel a bit

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.290 
this it might make you feel a bit
overwhelmed<00:00:39.190> just<00:00:39.430> to<00:00:39.610> choose<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.150> right

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
overwhelmed just to choose the right

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.560 
overwhelmed just to choose the right
paper<00:00:40.660> but<00:00:40.960> it's<00:00:41.590> simple<00:00:42.150> look<00:00:43.150> for<00:00:43.390> one<00:00:43.540> of

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
paper but it's simple look for one of

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.080 
paper but it's simple look for one of
these<00:00:43.750> two<00:00:44.110> types<00:00:44.440> of<00:00:44.590> pads<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:45.070> drawing<00:00:45.370> pad<00:00:45.700> or

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
these two types of pads a drawing pad or

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.210 
these two types of pads a drawing pad or
a<00:00:46.120> sketch<00:00:46.570> pad<00:00:46.810> now<00:00:47.110> when<00:00:47.739> you<00:00:47.829> get<00:00:47.980> in<00:00:48.070> there

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
a sketch pad now when you get in there

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.350 
a sketch pad now when you get in there
you're<00:00:48.430> still<00:00:48.579> going<00:00:48.760> to<00:00:48.820> have<00:00:48.910> lots<00:00:49.210> of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
you're still going to have lots of

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.900 
you're still going to have lots of
options<00:00:49.810> in<00:00:49.989> these<00:00:50.140> two<00:00:50.350> categories<00:00:50.590> but<00:00:51.250> just

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
options in these two categories but just

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.330 
options in these two categories but just
grab<00:00:52.120> anything<00:00:52.360> for<00:00:52.690> now<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.860> difference

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
grab anything for now the difference

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.549 
grab anything for now the difference
between<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.880> two<00:00:55.059> is<00:00:55.270> a<00:00:55.510> drawing<00:00:55.870> pad<00:00:56.200> has<00:00:56.530> a

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
between the two is a drawing pad has a

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.790 
between the two is a drawing pad has a
little<00:00:57.010> bit<00:00:57.130> thicker<00:00:57.520> paper<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:59.320> since<00:00:59.590> we're

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
little bit thicker paper but since we're

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.950 
little bit thicker paper but since we're
learning<00:00:59.980> and<00:01:00.370> quite<00:01:00.790> possibly<00:01:01.000> crumpling<00:01:01.809> up

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
learning and quite possibly crumpling up

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.079 
learning and quite possibly crumpling up
lots<00:01:02.290> of<00:01:02.469> paper<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:03.010> recommend<00:01:03.640> starting<00:01:03.880> with

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
lots of paper I recommend starting with

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.100 
lots of paper I recommend starting with
a<00:01:04.180> sketch<00:01:04.479> pad<00:01:05.219> here's<00:01:06.219> a<00:01:06.310> quick<00:01:06.549> tip<00:01:06.930> most<00:01:07.930> of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
a sketch pad here's a quick tip most of

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.959 
a sketch pad here's a quick tip most of
us<00:01:08.229> are<00:01:08.500> gonna<00:01:08.770> start<00:01:09.100> drawing<00:01:09.430> on<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.729> first

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
us are gonna start drawing on the first

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.179 
us are gonna start drawing on the first
sheet<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.360> paper<00:01:10.570> when<00:01:10.899> you<00:01:10.990> open<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.350> pad<00:01:11.560> but

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
sheet of paper when you open the pad but

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:13.739 
sheet of paper when you open the pad but
this<00:01:12.340> can<00:01:12.549> leave<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.880> impression<00:01:13.479> of<00:01:13.569> your

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:13.749 
this can leave the impression of your

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:17.370 
this can leave the impression of your
drawing<00:01:14.079> on<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.590> next<00:01:14.920> 10<00:01:15.340> pages<00:01:15.929> it's<00:01:16.929> super

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
drawing on the next 10 pages it's super

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.260 
drawing on the next 10 pages it's super
annoying<00:01:17.590> so<00:01:18.039> instead<00:01:18.700> of<00:01:18.759> drawing<00:01:19.060> on<00:01:19.179> the

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
annoying so instead of drawing on the

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.149 
annoying so instead of drawing on the
first<00:01:19.509> sheet<00:01:19.719> draw<00:01:20.259> on<00:01:20.499> the<00:01:20.619> last<00:01:20.859> sheet

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
first sheet draw on the last sheet

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.219 
first sheet draw on the last sheet
because<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.909> back<00:01:22.149> of<00:01:22.389> these<00:01:22.509> pads<00:01:22.779> has<00:01:23.200> a

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
because the back of these pads has a

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.709 
because the back of these pads has a
hard<00:01:23.740> board<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.490> it's<00:01:24.939> perfect<00:01:25.329> for<00:01:25.359> drawing

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
hard board and it's perfect for drawing

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:33.269 
hard board and it's perfect for drawing
up<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:29.219> I'm<00:01:30.219> back<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.119> this<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.100> bit

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:33.279 
up so I'm back to this it's a bit

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:36.539 
up so I'm back to this it's a bit
wasteful<00:01:33.729> but<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.619> know<00:01:35.709> I<00:01:35.770> do<00:01:36.159> like<00:01:36.399> to

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
wasteful but you know I do like to

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.419 
wasteful but you know I do like to
repurpose<00:01:36.880> things<00:01:37.209> so<00:01:37.659> maybe<00:01:38.049> maybe<00:01:39.039> maybe

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
repurpose things so maybe maybe maybe

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.940 
repurpose things so maybe maybe maybe
maybe<00:01:39.700> oh<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:42.549> know<00:01:43.060> I<00:01:43.389> know<00:01:43.689> all<00:01:44.049> right<00:01:44.229> off<00:01:44.889> to

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
maybe oh I know I know all right off to

00:01:44.950 --> 00:02:33.449 
maybe oh I know I know all right off to
the<00:01:45.340> studio

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.459 

mmm
