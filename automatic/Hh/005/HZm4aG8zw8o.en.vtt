important<00:03:35.350> I<00:03:35.410> just<00:03:35.440> push<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.160> hair<00:03:36.400> back<00:03:36.730> up

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.420 
important I just push the hair back up
this<00:03:37.570> is<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.900> allow<00:03:38.200> your<00:03:38.380> hair<00:03:38.620> not<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:38.950> slip

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
this is to allow your hair not to slip

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.910 
this is to allow your hair not to slip
this<00:03:39.970> is<00:03:40.180> also<00:03:40.600> why<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.810> want<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.410> braid<00:03:41.680> your

hair<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.670> ends<00:03:43.090> because<00:03:43.240> when<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.630> push

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
hair to the ends because when you push

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.510 
hair to the ends because when you push
back<00:03:44.050> up<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:44.560> don't<00:03:44.680> want<00:03:44.920> to<00:03:44.980> push<00:03:45.130> your<00:03:45.310> hair

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
alright let's show the technique of

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.409 
alright let's show the technique of
twisting<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.860> marley<00:04:51.160> hair<00:04:51.310> on<00:04:51.520> again<00:04:51.880> small

twisting the marley hair on again small

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.939 
twisting the marley hair on again small
piece<00:04:52.720> going<00:04:52.960> down<00:04:53.229> the<00:04:53.410> braid

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
piece going down the braid

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.710

wrap the marley hair around the base a
couple<00:04:56.110> of<00:04:56.320> times<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:56.949> then<00:04:57.520> you'll<00:04:57.699> proceed

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
couple of times and then you'll proceed

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.120 
couple of times and then you'll proceed
to<00:04:58.090> wrap<00:04:58.449> the<00:04:58.660> hair<00:04:58.930> down<00:04:59.800> the<00:05:00.220> braid<00:05:01.949> push<00:05:02.949> it

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
to wrap the hair down the braid push it

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.710 
to wrap the hair down the braid push it
up<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.430> make<00:05:03.580> sure<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.000> hair<00:05:04.210> is<00:05:04.240> on

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720

up to make sure that the hair is on
there<00:05:05.050> tightly<00:05:05.470> and<00:05:05.710> it's<00:05:05.860> not<00:05:06.039> going<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:06.310> have

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
there tightly and it's not going to have

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:35.210 
there tightly and it's not going to have
any<00:05:06.580> gaps<00:05:06.850> or<00:05:07.060> holes<00:05:07.150> in<00:05:07.780> it

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.760 

now<00:05:36.220> for<00:05:36.790> that<00:05:37.030> tricky<00:05:37.450> thing<00:05:37.720> as<00:05:37.990> you<00:05:38.350> can<00:05:38.500> see

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.090 
in order for that not to be seen I
twisted<00:05:43.660> past<00:05:43.960> where<00:05:44.260> I<00:05:44.290> needed<00:05:44.530> to<00:05:44.620> fold<00:05:44.950> the

like that this is another technique I'm

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.630 
like that this is another technique I'm
going<00:06:05.020> to<00:06:05.110> be<00:06:05.200> adding<00:06:05.440> a<00:06:05.680> knot<00:06:05.860> into<00:06:06.250> this<00:06:06.400> one

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
going to be adding a knot into this one

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.490 
going to be adding a knot into this one
the<00:06:07.120> knots<00:06:07.330> are<00:06:07.540> really<00:06:07.840> really<00:06:08.110> a<00:06:08.140> cool<00:06:08.440> thing

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
the knots are really really a cool thing

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.200 
the knots are really really a cool thing
to<00:06:08.800> add<00:06:08.950> because<00:06:09.220> they<00:06:09.490> give<00:06:09.670> you<00:06:09.820> added

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
to add because they give you added

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.820 
to add because they give you added
character<00:06:10.510> in<00:06:10.750> your<00:06:10.870> locs<00:06:11.110> like<00:06:11.320> real<00:06:11.590> locks

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
character in your locs like real locks

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.190 
character in your locs like real locks
and<00:06:12.100> it<00:06:12.790> ensures<00:06:13.240> that<00:06:13.480> you<00:06:13.720> don't<00:06:13.900> have<00:06:14.080> to

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
and it ensures that you don't have to

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.230 
and it ensures that you don't have to
use<00:06:14.380> glue<00:06:14.650> in<00:06:14.860> or<00:06:15.130> burn<00:06:15.340> your<00:06:15.520> hair<00:06:15.730> it<00:06:16.180> looks
