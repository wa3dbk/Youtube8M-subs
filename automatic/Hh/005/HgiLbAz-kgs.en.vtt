00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:20.360
 the guys that liz parkes and today the video 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.250
 will have a very specific theme that 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.860
 due to the coming of the new generation of 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.710
 consoles and decided to do a series of 25 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.510
 facts or spoke of playstations and other 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.730
 talking about xbox 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.920
 Today's video is about the playstations 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.960
 then ball is mere fact in 1990 with the 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.850
 The presence of super nintendo was giant 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.340
 He decided to try for the second time 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.590
 copying CD players or your console and 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.390
 That's why she hired sony too. 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.430
 for the second time 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.340
 they had tried to do this before 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.130
 but the cds of the time were very low 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.510
 quality and could be deleted 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.940
 easily this has made the project 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.240
 abandoned the ness and to be 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.920
 announced in May 1991 but the 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.869
 president of nintendo decided to read the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.970
 original contract there from that first 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.520
 time they hired Sony and 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.860
 he said that sony owns the total 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.170
 control over securities launched in the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.850
 cd format and then it was there and here it 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.070
 all your plans 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.560
 and to the surprise of the crew and announced 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.420
 partnership with philips and good creator 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.280
 of the playstation considered the project already 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.010
 too advanced to be thrown out 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.840
 then began to launch the peripheral 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.340
 like a tabletop console 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.070
 It was there that in 1994 in Japan and in 1995 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.900
 in the United States and Europe was launched 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.750
 the first playstation 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.240
 but before that Sony tried to launch the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.940
 console by mowing but she preferred 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.600
 invest in sega cd you know it was 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.930
 a completely stupid choice 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.570
 the fact the playstation was the console that 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.119
 scored a lot myself sparks have 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.830
 excellent memories with the ps one and 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.590
 had the opportunity to have it again 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.470
 I would certainly grab and good it 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.289
 has been so successful but so successful that 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.590
 was the first I spoke first console 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.760
 is to sell more than 100 million units 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.950
 just so you have a better idea 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.159
 yet things have been sold around 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.130
 22 million gamecube units 33 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.510
 millions of nintendo 64 and 24 million 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.569
 first xbox 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.549
 the sum of it all there 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.909
 approaching more than 100 million 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:34.359
 playstation 1 sold xbox 360 itself 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:38.379
 which was released in 2005 until today sold 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:41.499
 only about 77.2 million units and 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:44.170
 of playstation 3 have been sold almost 79 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:46.540
 millions both there much less than the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.519
 building is no secret to anyone the ps1 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.349
 really sold it for me 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.719
 and to complete another nice side 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.269
 respect to playstations is that 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:57.519
 then ps two 'keeps record of 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.719
 sales among all the other consoles 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.760
 what's out there 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.950
 the other thing all this data that I 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.939
 I spoke there they were divulged by the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.199
 companies 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.329
 I'll leave links to these 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:09.579
 information here in the video description 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.349
 so if you're curious, you want 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.409
 see valley below 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.060
 The third fact did you know that this 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.409
 control screen could have belonged 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.449
 to playstation 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.699
 because it was the prototype made for the 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:23.620
 ps1 and loaded features 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:26.530
 of Super Nintendo Control 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.139
 format and even positioning 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.729
 buttons but thank god the control 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.099
 did not look like the ears of the 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:34.930
 mickey and became famous of the shock 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.579
 the console designer said he chose 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.949
 for the symbols buttons instead of 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.229
 because memorization becomes 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:43.239
 he also said that each 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:45.549
 symbol has its meaning the 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.069
 triangle represents point of view 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.780
 direction the square is the representation of 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.389
 a piece of paper that would be 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.479
 related to less and documents at the end 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.759
 circles x represents yes decisions 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:59.439
 and that's not where the other curiosity comes in 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.569
 about control 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.479
 In Japan, it is common to use the 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.209
 circle as a symbol of right and x to 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:09.519
 wrong since in the West we usually 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.310
 use x to set correct options 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:16.829
 and we see the ball with 10 for that reason 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:22.030
 there and helmets for ball x are inverse 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.530
 room number 2418 this is the number of 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.479
 games that have been released for 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.150
 playstation 1 and this amount of games 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:31.270
 is greater than that of the little nintendinho 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.580
 nintendo and nintendo 64 together sum 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.060
 that is around 1809 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.960
 the official games well below ps 1 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.300
 now if you found 2418 absurd number 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.909
 It's because you probably do not know. 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.229
 how many were released for ps2 that is 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:51.969
 the total is 3,870 games much more than 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:56.409
 that for the first playstation 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:05:00.370
 already the ps3 has a list of 772 games 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:02.349
 among which 621 are multi-platform 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.460
 It is so much a game that comes from the 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.879
 brain 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.219
 5th, one of the fields of science that 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:12.580
 more processing are the 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:14.860
 three-dimensional simulations and astrophysics 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.900
 is one of the fields that deals most with this 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.120
 now did you know that playstation 3 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.009
 is being used by scientists to 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.960
 these kinds of experiences 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.300
 because the console was given the function of 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.550
 solve mysteries involving waves 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.099
 gravitational forces and occurs when the 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.560
 black weighing more than million 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.689
 times the mass of the sun swallows a star 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.289
 all this is done through a cluster 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:40.870
 of 8 ps3 interconnected use of video game 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.879
 scientific research was due to the 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.699
 fact that they are planned equipment 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.979
 for a high computational volume due to 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:51.159
 to its processor created in partnership with 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:53.919
 sony and bm and toshiba and manages to deliver 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:56.620
 to it a power of data but that this is 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:00.009
 comparable to the supercomputer that has the 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.839
 hundreds of times taller without 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:04.150
 that the price is very attractive in 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:05.979
 comparison to industrial clusters 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.289
 other thing that influenced the use of 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.839
 console is that the sony platform is 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:13.330
 relatively open to changes which 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:15.759
 facilitates its use in the laboratory 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.789
 This is really interesting and 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:20.529
 Sony itself supports the idea that's it 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.449
 guys having at least five facts today by 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:24.580
 here if you have not yet enrolled in my 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.949

 leaves your like leaves your favorite 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:33.909
 the other thing no description for 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.080
 other links as fan page twitter network 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:36.969
 with etc 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.319
 I hope you guys in the next video one 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.319
 big hug i went
