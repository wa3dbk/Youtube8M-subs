so<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> took<00:00:25.439> my<00:00:25.830> shirt<00:00:26.160> folded<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.730> half<00:00:27.029> and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
so I took my shirt folded in half and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.029 
so I took my shirt folded in half and
measured<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> length<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> neck<00:00:28.650> down<00:00:29.010> to

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
measured the length of the neck down to

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.460 
measured the length of the neck down to
the<00:00:29.340> armpit<00:00:29.670> down<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.630> length<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> chest

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
the armpit down the length of the chest

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.260 
the armpit down the length of the chest
and<00:00:31.710> made<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> top<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.640> length<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.239> I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
and made the top the length that I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:44.330 
and made the top the length that I
wanted<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.050> be<00:00:34.260> cropped<00:00:43.129> pattern<00:00:44.129> should

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
wanted it to be cropped pattern should

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.520 
wanted it to be cropped pattern should
look<00:00:44.399> exactly<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.079> cut<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
look exactly like this so then I cut it

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.680 
look exactly like this so then I cut it
out<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.770> opened<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.760> made<00:00:48.000> sure<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.510> cut

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
out and opened it and made sure to cut

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.450 
out and opened it and made sure to cut
it<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:48.930> fold<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.680> both<00:00:49.950> sides<00:00:50.250> would<00:00:50.399> be

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it on fold so that both sides would be

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:05.230 
it on fold so that both sides would be
perfectly<00:00:51.059> symmetrical

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.140 

then<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.930> straps<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.150> facing

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
then to make the straps and the facing

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.480 
then to make the straps and the facing
for<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.660> garment<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.740> measured<00:01:11.130> one

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
for this garment I just measured one

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.610 
for this garment I just measured one
inch<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.030> made<00:01:12.210> straight<00:01:12.540> lines<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.020> cut<00:01:13.440> out

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
inch and made straight lines and cut out

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.520 
inch and made straight lines and cut out
strips<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.430> paper<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.420> cut<00:01:15.630> out<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> fabric

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
strips of paper to cut out of the fabric

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.950 
strips of paper to cut out of the fabric
then<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.550> cut<00:01:17.790> them<00:01:17.940> out<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.270> fabric<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
then I cut them out of the fabric and I

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.290 
then I cut them out of the fabric and I
made<00:01:19.140> two<00:01:19.440> one<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.190> top<00:01:20.400> opening<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.090> for

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
made two one for the top opening one for

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.359 
made two one for the top opening one for
the<00:01:21.360> bottom<00:01:21.660> opening<00:01:21.990> then<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.590> made<00:01:22.830> two<00:01:23.130> more

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the bottom opening then I made two more

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.010 
the bottom opening then I made two more
straps<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.910> I<00:01:24.030> could<00:01:24.210> face<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.720> outer

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
straps so that I could face the outer

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
straps so that I could face the outer
edges<00:01:25.440> so<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> could<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> clean<00:01:26.760> looking

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
edges so I could have a clean looking

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.780 
edges so I could have a clean looking
edge<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:28.320> by<00:01:28.530> now<00:01:28.740> these<00:01:29.130> are<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.340> pattern

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
edge so by now these are the pattern

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.120 
edge so by now these are the pattern
pieces<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.510> should<00:01:30.690> have<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.770> halter

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
pieces that you should have the halter

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.370 
pieces that you should have the halter
front<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.060> two<00:01:33.300> strips<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.960> are<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.229> go

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
front and the two strips that are to go

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.370 
front and the two strips that are to go
through<00:01:34.649> the<00:01:34.770> top<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.340> bottom<00:01:42.140> then<00:01:43.140> I

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
through the top and bottom then I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.370 
through the top and bottom then I
pinched<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.130> pinned<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.090> added<00:01:45.570> darts<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
pinched and pinned and added darts to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380 
pinched and pinned and added darts to
the<00:01:46.500> bus<00:01:46.770> which<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.220> optional<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.090> just

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the bus which is optional but I just

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.300 
the bus which is optional but I just
wanted<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.050> so<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.950> adjust

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
wanted to do it so you can and adjust

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.910 
wanted to do it so you can and adjust
them<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.520> your<00:01:50.729> bust<00:01:51.119> size<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:52.050> I<00:01:52.259> chose<00:01:52.590> two

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
them to your bust size but I chose two

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.290 
them to your bust size but I chose two
and<00:01:53.190> so<00:01:53.490> that's<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:53.910> it<00:01:54.000> would<00:01:54.119> look<00:01:54.240> like

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
and so that's what it would look like

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.320 
and so that's what it would look like
and<00:01:54.810> then<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.440> added<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> strips<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.490> facing<00:01:57.030> to

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
and then I added the strips of facing to

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.999 
and then I added the strips of facing to
the<00:01:57.360> side<00:01:57.750> which<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.560> measure<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
the side which you just measure the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.150 
the side which you just measure the
length<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.399> your<00:01:59.789> bodice<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:01.560> fold<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.070> over

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
length of your bodice and I fold it over

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.430 
length of your bodice and I fold it over
the<00:02:02.399> strips<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.270> pin<00:02:03.660> them<00:02:03.869> down<00:02:03.930> so

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
the strips and then pin them down so

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.109 
the strips and then pin them down so
that<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> could<00:02:04.830> sew<00:02:05.100> them<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.520> have<00:02:05.700> clean

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
that I could sew them and have clean

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.199 
that I could sew them and have clean
edges<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:06.990> both<00:02:07.530> sides<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.369> opposed<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:08.940> raw

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
edges on both sides as opposed to raw

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.490 
edges on both sides as opposed to raw
edges

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.610 

and<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.570> what<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.840> looks<00:02:18.110> like<00:02:18.230> when<00:02:18.590> I

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
and so this is what it looks like when I

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.790 
and so this is what it looks like when I
finish<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.250> edges<00:02:19.460> so<00:02:20.210> then<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.510> took<00:02:20.800> the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
finish the edges so then I took the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.340 
finish the edges so then I took the
garment<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.370> folded<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.060> over<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.810> half<00:02:24.170> an

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
garment and folded it over a half an

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.740 
garment and folded it over a half an
inch<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.070> could<00:02:25.280> put<00:02:25.610> my<00:02:25.790> two<00:02:25.850> strips

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
inch so that I could put my two strips

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.230 
inch so that I could put my two strips
that<00:02:26.990> I've<00:02:27.140> made<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.800> go<00:02:28.340> through<00:02:28.730> them<00:02:28.970> and

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
that I've made to go through them and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.080 
that I've made to go through them and
make<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.110> tunnel<00:02:30.590> for<00:02:30.770> them<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.580> these<00:02:31.790> are<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
make a tunnel for them so these are the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.630 
make a tunnel for them so these are the
strips<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.840> have<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.500> they're<00:02:34.370> in<00:02:34.550> an

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
strips that I have and they're in an

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.370 
strips that I have and they're in an
inch<00:02:34.790> long<00:02:35.090> each<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:35.630> when<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.810> fold<00:02:36.140> them<00:02:36.230> over

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
inch long each so when I fold them over

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.990 
inch long each so when I fold them over
and<00:02:36.680> sew<00:02:36.890> them<00:02:37.130> they'll<00:02:37.370> be<00:02:37.550> able<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.820> go

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
and sew them they'll be able to go

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.500 
and sew them they'll be able to go
through<00:02:38.240> this<00:02:38.360> 1/2<00:02:39.140> inch<00:02:39.620> long<00:02:40.400> tunnel<00:02:41.270> that

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
through this 1/2 inch long tunnel that

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.260 
through this 1/2 inch long tunnel that
I'm<00:02:41.630> making<00:02:42.050> right<00:02:42.260> now<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:43.670> as<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:43.940> can<00:02:44.060> see<00:02:44.240> I

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
I'm making right now so as you can see I

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.500 
I'm making right now so as you can see I
folded<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.930> over<00:02:45.640> just<00:02:46.640> like<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.360> then

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
folded it over just like that and then

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.880 
folded it over just like that and then
you're<00:02:47.630> just<00:02:47.780> going<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.930> top<00:02:48.290> stitch<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.680> down

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
you're just going to top stitch it down

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.400 
you're just going to top stitch it down
really<00:02:49.520> close<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.060> edge<00:02:50.330> after<00:02:50.870> pinning

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
really close to the edge after pinning

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.070 
really close to the edge after pinning
it<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.180> that's<00:02:53.180> going<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.540> be<00:02:53.660> what<00:02:53.870> your

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
it and that's going to be what your

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.449 
it and that's going to be what your
strips<00:02:54.410> are<00:02:54.530> going<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.709> go<00:02:54.830> through<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.430> to

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
strips are going to go through so to

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.390 
strips are going to go through so to
make<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.000> strip's<00:02:59.600> into<00:02:59.900> straps<00:03:00.650> I've<00:03:00.980> folded

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
make the strip's into straps I've folded

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.870 
make the strip's into straps I've folded
them<00:03:01.760> over<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.420> then<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:02.900> pinned<00:03:03.350> them<00:03:03.590> all<00:03:04.580> the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
them over and then I pinned them all the

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.760 
them over and then I pinned them all the
way<00:03:05.000> down<00:03:05.330> so<00:03:05.900> that<00:03:06.020> I<00:03:06.050> could<00:03:06.320> seal<00:03:06.590> them

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
way down so that I could seal them

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.510 
way down so that I could seal them
really<00:03:07.100> close<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.730> edge<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.980> use<00:03:09.980> the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
really close to the edge and use the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.610 
really close to the edge and use the
safety<00:03:10.910> pin<00:03:11.330> technique<00:03:12.020> that<00:03:12.290> I've<00:03:12.410> used

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
safety pin technique that I've used

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:21.820 
safety pin technique that I've used
before<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:20.570> once<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:20.900> finish<00:03:21.200> sewing<00:03:21.470> close

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
before so once you finish sewing close

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.100 
before so once you finish sewing close
to<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.100> edge<00:03:22.310> you<00:03:22.340> can<00:03:22.850> trim<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.570> excess

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
to the edge you can trim the excess

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.199 
to the edge you can trim the excess
fabric<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:24.920> wasn't<00:03:25.340> included<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.030> then

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
fabric that wasn't included and then

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.360 
fabric that wasn't included and then
start<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.720> safety<00:03:27.200> pin<00:03:27.410> technique<00:03:27.800> so<00:03:28.340> you

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
start the safety pin technique so you

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.150 
start the safety pin technique so you
just<00:03:28.670> pin<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.209> safety<00:03:29.600> pin<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.260> edge<00:03:30.560> and

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
just pin the safety pin to the edge and

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.720 
just pin the safety pin to the edge and
then<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.239> twist<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.260> over<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:34.010> push<00:03:34.550> the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
then you twist it over and push the

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.850 
then you twist it over and push the
safety<00:03:34.910> pin<00:03:35.300> inside<00:03:35.870> of<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.200> tube<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.709> you

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
safety pin inside of the tube that you

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.630 
safety pin inside of the tube that you
created<00:03:37.280> as<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:39.350> can<00:03:39.530> see

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
created as you can see

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.690 
created as you can see
and<00:03:40.730> then<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.630> push<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:42.500> then<00:03:42.860> scrunch<00:03:43.340> and

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
and then you push and then scrunch and

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.720 
and then you push and then scrunch and
then<00:03:44.420> pull<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:45.170> you<00:03:45.230> put<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.620> inside<00:03:45.770> and<00:03:46.370> then

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
then pull so you put it inside and then

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.090 
then pull so you put it inside and then
push<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.240> safety<00:03:47.450> pin<00:03:47.840> inside<00:03:48.560> of<00:03:48.740> the<00:03:48.860> tube

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
push the safety pin inside of the tube

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.880 
push the safety pin inside of the tube
along<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:50.030> then<00:03:50.450> pull<00:03:50.840> out<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.350> excess

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
along and then pull out the excess

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.890 
along and then pull out the excess
fabric<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:52.670> then<00:03:52.790> keep<00:03:53.000> scrunching<00:03:53.600> until

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
fabric and then keep scrunching until

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.140 
fabric and then keep scrunching until
you<00:03:53.990> get<00:03:54.170> to<00:03:54.320> the<00:03:54.440> end<00:03:54.740> of<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.520> fabric<00:03:55.760> loop

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
you get to the end of the fabric loop

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.760 
you get to the end of the fabric loop
and<00:03:56.420> then<00:03:56.540> pull<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:56.960> and<00:03:57.170> you'll<00:03:57.320> have<00:03:57.500> pulled

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
and then pull it and you'll have pulled

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.770 
and then pull it and you'll have pulled
it<00:03:57.890> inside<00:03:58.340> out<00:03:58.520> so<00:03:58.970> that<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.210> can't<00:03:59.510> see<00:03:59.660> the

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
it inside out so that you can't see the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.300 
it inside out so that you can't see the
stitching<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.320> instead<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:00.830> can<00:04:00.950> see<00:04:01.190> the

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
stitching and instead you can see the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.230 
stitching and instead you can see the
finished<00:04:01.700> edge<00:04:03.220> then<00:04:04.220> you'll<00:04:04.400> guide<00:04:04.760> the

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
finished edge then you'll guide the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.720 
finished edge then you'll guide the
safety<00:04:05.690> pin<00:04:05.960> through<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:07.070> loop<00:04:07.340> that<00:04:07.550> you

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
safety pin through the loop that you

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.090 
safety pin through the loop that you
made<00:04:07.940> in<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.270> garment<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.050> same<00:04:09.290> way<00:04:09.650> with

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
made in the garment the same way with

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.400 
made in the garment the same way with
the<00:04:10.220> safety<00:04:10.670> pin<00:04:10.910> push<00:04:11.300> it<00:04:11.510> through<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.050> then

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
the safety pin push it through and then

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.590 
the safety pin push it through and then
you'll<00:04:12.590> have<00:04:12.770> one<00:04:13.160> strap<00:04:13.610> across<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.240> neck<00:04:14.420> so

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
you'll have one strap across the neck so

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.880 
you'll have one strap across the neck so
that<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.810> can<00:04:14.990> tie<00:04:15.200> it<00:04:15.230> around<00:04:15.410> your<00:04:15.740> neck

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
that you can tie it around your neck

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.920 
that you can tie it around your neck
with<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.370> this<00:04:16.760> is<00:04:16.820> how<00:04:17.090> it<00:04:17.239> should<00:04:17.269> look<00:04:17.660> so

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
with and this is how it should look so

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.770 
with and this is how it should look so
far<00:04:18.169> you<00:04:18.650> have<00:04:18.769> finished<00:04:19.190> edges<00:04:19.459> darts<00:04:20.419> if<00:04:20.630> you

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
far you have finished edges darts if you

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.840 
far you have finished edges darts if you
wanted<00:04:21.079> them<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:21.560> then<00:04:21.980> a<00:04:22.010> tie<00:04:22.370> around<00:04:22.580> the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
wanted them and then a tie around the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.120 
wanted them and then a tie around the
neck<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:23.570> can<00:04:23.750> wear<00:04:24.200> it

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.540 

always

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.160 

so<00:04:33.550> then<00:04:33.670> I'm<00:04:33.760> going<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:33.970> fold<00:04:34.330> up<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:35.140> bottom

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
so then I'm going to fold up the bottom

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.830 
so then I'm going to fold up the bottom
about<00:04:35.950> a<00:04:36.010> half<00:04:36.340> inch<00:04:36.550> that<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.030> can<00:04:37.270> do<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:37.540> same

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
about a half inch that I can do the same

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.720 
about a half inch that I can do the same
that<00:04:37.990> I've<00:04:38.140> done<00:04:38.350> from<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.800> top<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:39.610> the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
bottom and make a tunnel so then I'm

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.950 
bottom and make a tunnel so then I'm
going<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:41.830> fold<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.250> up<00:04:42.460> pin<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.060> down<00:04:43.090> and<00:04:43.600> then

going to fold it up pin it down and then

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.920 
going to fold it up pin it down and then
sew<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.590> 1/2<00:04:45.040> inch<00:04:45.400> really<00:04:46.360> close<00:04:46.600> to<00:04:46.810> the

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
sew the 1/2 inch really close to the

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.150 
sew the 1/2 inch really close to the
edge<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:47.970> then<00:04:48.970> add<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.660> strip<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.770> turn<00:04:50.980> into

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
edge and then add a strip to turn into

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.740 
edge and then add a strip to turn into
his<00:04:51.340> straps<00:04:51.670> that<00:04:51.880> I<00:04:51.970> can<00:04:52.150> pull<00:04:52.390> it<00:04:52.420> through

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
the tunnel that I've created so that I

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.270 
the tunnel that I've created so that I
can<00:05:01.870> put<00:05:02.110> this<00:05:02.260> strap<00:05:02.710> that<00:05:02.920> I'm<00:05:03.040> going<00:05:03.250> to

make<00:05:03.490> through<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:04.720> use<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.080> same

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
make through and I use the same

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.560 
make through and I use the same
technique<00:05:05.350> with<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.190> safety<00:05:06.580> pin<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:06.970> push

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
technique with the safety pin to push

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.870 
technique with the safety pin to push
scrunch<00:05:08.170> and<00:05:08.350> pull<00:05:08.650> it<00:05:08.770> through<00:05:08.800> the<00:05:09.160> ends<00:05:09.730> and

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
then I take the safety pin attached to

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.040 
then I take the safety pin attached to
the<00:05:12.160> strap<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:12.790> push<00:05:13.120> it<00:05:13.300> through<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.660> bottom
