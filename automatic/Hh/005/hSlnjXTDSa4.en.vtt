00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.980
 hello to all these disorders I hope 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.720
 that you're fine 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.370
 and today I propose you the 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.349
 last video on the series about 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.790
 guns so I will not do 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.590
 the executor in this series because I 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.509
 consider a little more than me do japan 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.869
 so I think I will not do it 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.099
 in the category shotguns 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.899
 if not the next series I think it 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.829
 is going to be on machine guns because I 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.840
 think it's going a lot more you 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.850
 interested and that the guns finally we 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.100
 will see well so in the meantime let's go back 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.680
 at 40 cac then cac 40 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.110
 it is a lot like auger 18 of 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.880
 modern warfare 2 to know that its recoil 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.220
 and straight up 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.530
 that it is important enough but that it is 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.970
 very easily manageable and we will see 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.560
 that he still has a very very big 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.570
 flaws and I'll tell you that later 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.550
 so giving up on things that you 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.040
 therefore interest the damage then the cac 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.440
 40 a guy who's me 45 to 19 c is 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.660
 exactly the same as b 23 m except 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.880
 that this rifle is a this pistol sorry 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.790
 is a gun is completely 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.880
 automatic so what makes it very 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.829
 very powerful and especially when when they 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.960
 kill lÃ©zignan 3 balls and who there he 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.700
 has a very high rate of fire then 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.289
 then let's talk about the then wearing the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.539
 door and it's pretty much the same 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.609
 also that the 23 March have 12 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.990
 m for a shot with three balls of internet 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.990
 to attract four balls 32 meters 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.100
 for a shot with five balls and more he 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.350
 you will need six bullets to kill your 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.520
 opponent 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.219
 you have to know that it's still a 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.829
 gun that is going to be useful to long 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.600
 scope you will be able to make 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.209
 delicate with this gun even though he's going 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.490
 have to shoot a parent bursts you 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:45.579
 go get there normally just need 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.920
 manage the decline then has the 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.060
 pace of those of his pistols and 9 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.649
 cents per minute 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.540
 so to give you an idea 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.729
 900 ball per minute is the rate of 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.770
 mps is for example 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.570
 so it's very high and the big 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.039
 advantage is that unlike 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.930
 submachine guns that have the same rate of 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.640
 shot and who she killing four bullets is 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.679
 this gun is going to make you only in 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.050
 three balls that's who it is 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.630
 to allow him to surpass 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.090
 short-range machine guns and 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.950
 that's what makes it so strong 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.440
 so then like all the guns 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.910
 of course he has a multiplier of 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.800
 headshots that is 40% extra 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.680
 and a speed of movement that 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.470
 stay at 100% so all pretty classic 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.989
 now then the biggest advantage 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.010
 of this pistol it's his recoil that as 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.140
 I say it just now as it is 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.250
 all right up you're training very 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.220
 easily to shoot in the head 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.480
 without forcing we'll say and this is the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.290
 Hostage concert for the rise of Iran 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.360
 it was very very easy for me by 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.060
 against it has a very big fault next 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.090
 is that the size of its charger is 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.280
 really minimal ie he did not 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.959
 than fifteen bullets in the magazine and 15 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.940
 ball with its rate of fire you empty it 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.019
 in a split second and it's really 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.060
 a big problem of what you have 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.170
 two enemies in front of you but 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.959
 when you have an enemy that you 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.579
 miss that we missed some of 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.480
 losses they shoot you it's very 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.970
 difficult to catch up behind and 2 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.650
 and manage to manage that then what I 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.269
 can you advise for that it is there 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.250
 two things either you use them 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.569
 fast chargers so that allows you 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.060
 to reload quickly once weighed 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.069
 empty your loader either you use 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.840
 the large capacity loads that can 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.310
 to be useful also after these questions 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.170
 taste with capacity loads 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.620
 you will have more facilities to 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.760
 manage to handle two enemies but with the 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.049
 fast chargers you are going to have 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.150
 you will have more luck 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.160
 to chain the enemies one to the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.470
 following others so that's it 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.579
 really a matter of taste then 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.540
 then at the level of the other three 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.530
 accessories what i can you 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.569
 advise is the laser sight 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.190
 possibly if you want to do us 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.750
 let's judge it's like all the others 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.540
 people it is very practical and very very 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.769
 useful then you can of course 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.810
 use the silencer that will us 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.579
 to stay out of the radar 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.379
 and you have to know that the silencer you 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.660
 but a penalty of 10% on the scope of 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.799
 our weapon what is not what is 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.030
 be negligible for this gun 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.560
 knowing that it has a fairly large reach 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.319
 and that 10% is still enough 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.579
 weak enough by cons what I can 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.049
 advise against it is to put the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.959
 old reflexes like on all the others 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.730
 pistols they have a second viewfinder of 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.430
 base and put a reflex viewfinder is not going 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.720
 that make things worse 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.979
 you can also use the kimbo 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.539
 but then there kembo I will advise 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.510
 more if you use this gun in 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.979
 air as primary because they a 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.510
 main you are going to have to do some 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.919
 mid-range shots and make 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.440
 third-party middle distance in team work 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.280
 it's impossible 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.289
 so now I was talking to you about a 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.280
 something that I did not mention in the 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.500
 previous episodes 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.700
 it's the reload time so he 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.830
 be aware that the reloading time 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.010
 a gun is around 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.060
 between 1.2 and 1.8 seconds so that's it 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.780
 depends on a lot of things it depends 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.860
 if they remain bullets in the 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.630
 charger if you are void and 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.380
 reloading 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.700
 there are plenty there are plenty of settings 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.310
 who go against it but in good standing 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.450
 general you put on average a 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.910
 second draws to recharge your 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.590
 gun so that is halved if 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.060
 you use fast chargers 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.220
 so that concludes our series on 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.310
 pistols so to conclude i'm going 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.170
 still 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.310
 give my opinion on the happiest 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.260
 all these guns so it's still 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.780
 the cac40 the one that remains the most 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.920
 effective for my taste simply by 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.720
 does because it's the one that happens to 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.880
 read the best with machine guns and 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.410
 as we see in all parts of 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.780
 back office of what we actually do 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.360
 it's limit raid that are used but 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.130
 clearly the most widely all the 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.960
 world uses would limit in this 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.650
 episode of black ops call of duty 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.300
 pardon and it must finally the goal is to 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.980
 surpass the machine guns so that's 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.760
 why this track is this pistol 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.470
 which remains the best for me then in 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.850
 second place in this ranking if we 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.610
 can say guns I will put the 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.460
 23rd just not by his 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.780
 ease of use and non players 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.760
 experienced people will be able to take 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.700
 hand very easily and make doing 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.780
 fairly honorable scores with everything 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.770
 just because he kills in one 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.360
 burst and that's really a very 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.800
 great strength 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.430
 so the next series that reassures 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.660
 the machine guns 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.790
 as I told you just now 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.770
 so I'm going to try to do something 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.300
 enough objective enough thing do you 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.100
 compare their characteristics in order to 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.450
 tell you what she is where she is where 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.110
 what are the best submachine 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.460
 of this black ops 2 I hope you have 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.290
 liked this video that you will have been 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.030
 useful if this is the case do not hesitate to 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:20.310
 put a like I subscribe to my 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.310
 chain and I tell you to go more hi
