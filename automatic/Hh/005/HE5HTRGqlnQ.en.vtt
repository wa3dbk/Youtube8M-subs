those<00:00:46.020> leaves<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:47.809> usually<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.170> would<00:00:49.320> be

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
those leaves and usually this would be

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.410 
those leaves and usually this would be
the<00:00:49.590> other<00:00:49.680> way<00:00:49.890> round<00:00:50.129> if<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.940> watch<00:00:51.120> my

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the other way round if you watch my

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.229 
the other way round if you watch my
assembling<00:00:52.079> video<00:00:52.460> you'll<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
assembling video you'll see that I

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.899 
assembling video you'll see that I
actually<00:00:54.449> turned<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.980> backboard<00:00:56.519> upside

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
actually turned the backboard upside

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.700 
actually turned the backboard upside
down<00:00:57.150> so<00:00:57.570> they<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:57.839> two<00:00:58.019> holes<00:00:58.290> at<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
down so they have two holes at the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.110 
down so they have two holes at the
corners<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.940> put<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.329> heat<00:01:01.050> mats<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.879> or<00:01:02.879> heat

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
corners to put the heat mats in or heat

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.660 
corners to put the heat mats in or heat
mat<00:01:03.589> usually<00:01:04.589> they're<00:01:04.800> at<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> top<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.489> guess

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
mat usually they're at the top I guess

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.600 
mat usually they're at the top I guess
that's<00:01:05.940> if<00:01:06.240> you're<00:01:06.540> using<00:01:06.840> lighting<00:01:07.580> but<00:01:08.580> I

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that's if you're using lighting but I

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.060 
that's if you're using lighting but I
put<00:01:08.790> at<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.940> bottom<00:01:09.240> because<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:10.080> lead<00:01:10.680> for

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
put at the bottom because the lead for

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.760 
put at the bottom because the lead for
my<00:01:11.190> heat<00:01:11.429> mat<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:12.450> didn't<00:01:12.720> reach<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.380> plug<00:01:13.590> if

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
my heat mat we didn't reach the plug if

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.469 
my heat mat we didn't reach the plug if
you<00:01:13.830> had<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.039> go<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.340> way<00:01:14.429> up<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:14.850> then

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you had to go all the way up there then

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.830 
you had to go all the way up there then
all<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.810> way<00:01:15.899> across<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> plug<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
all the way across and to the plug so I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.820 
all the way across and to the plug so I
did<00:01:19.470> that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.800 

if<00:01:24.220> you<00:01:24.370> watch<00:01:24.550> my<00:01:24.760> assembling<00:01:25.240> video<00:01:25.510> you'll

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
if you watch my assembling video you'll

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.120 
if you watch my assembling video you'll
know<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:26.110> is<00:01:26.200> really<00:01:26.680> easy<00:01:27.070> to<00:01:27.430> assemble<00:01:28.360> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
know it is really easy to assemble this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.590 
know it is really easy to assemble this
really<00:01:30.130> straightforward<00:01:30.400> instructions<00:01:31.330> but

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
really straightforward instructions but

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.440 
really straightforward instructions but
I<00:01:31.660> did<00:01:31.900> like<00:01:32.080> a<00:01:32.110> minute<00:01:32.470> video<00:01:32.740> really<00:01:33.550> sped<00:01:34.300> up

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
I did like a minute video really sped up

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.160 
I did like a minute video really sped up
just<00:01:35.050> so<00:01:35.200> you<00:01:35.260> could<00:01:35.470> see<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:36.730> simple<00:01:37.240> way<00:01:38.140> of

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
just so you could see the simple way of

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.810 
just so you could see the simple way of
yeah<00:01:39.130> pull<00:01:39.370> it<00:01:39.400> together

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:54.910 

okay<00:01:44.570> cons<00:01:46.150> listen<00:01:47.150> to<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:54.530> happens

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
okay cons listen to this that happens

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.510 
okay cons listen to this that happens
every<00:01:55.070> time<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:56.300> open<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:57.050> door<00:01:57.260> at<00:01:58.070> first<00:01:58.370> I

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
every time you open the door at first I

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.460 
every time you open the door at first I
thought<00:01:58.670> maybe<00:01:58.880> it's<00:01:59.060> just<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.300> substrate<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.200> I

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
thought maybe it's just a substrate so I

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.860 
thought maybe it's just a substrate so I
cleaned<00:02:00.740> all<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:01.070> out<00:02:01.250> but<00:02:02.090> no<00:02:02.300> it<00:02:02.570> still

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
cleaned all that out but no it still

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.690 
cleaned all that out but no it still
does<00:02:03.050> it<00:02:03.260> I<00:02:03.350> don't<00:02:03.560> know<00:02:03.620> why<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.310> it's<00:02:04.430> very

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
does it I don't know why but it's very

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.109 
does it I don't know why but it's very
annoying<00:02:04.910> so<00:02:05.740> as<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:06.920> also<00:02:07.040> scares<00:02:07.430> my<00:02:07.700> geckos

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
annoying so as it also scares my geckos

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.740 
annoying so as it also scares my geckos
and<00:02:08.560> I<00:02:09.560> have<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.920> lift<00:02:10.160> this<00:02:10.460> up<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.970> move<00:02:11.510> it

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
and I have to lift this up and move it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.390 
and I have to lift this up and move it
along<00:02:12.460> every<00:02:13.460> time<00:02:14.320> another<00:02:15.320> thing<00:02:18.400> another

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
along every time another thing another

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.260 
along every time another thing another
thing<00:02:19.520> is<00:02:20.020> when<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.050> bought<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.280> thought<00:02:22.970> that

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
thing is when I bought it I thought that

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.790 
thing is when I bought it I thought that
there<00:02:23.420> was<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.600> handle<00:02:24.050> on<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.320> just<00:02:24.620> going

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
there was a handle on it just going

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.880 
there was a handle on it just going
along<00:02:25.070> in<00:02:25.870> fact<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.080> was<00:02:27.230> actually<00:02:27.530> one<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.680> the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
along in fact it was actually one of the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.490 
along in fact it was actually one of the
vents<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.490> background<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.840> when<00:02:29.990> I<00:02:30.020> got<00:02:30.320> it

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
vents in the background so when I got it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.490 
vents in the background so when I got it
and<00:02:30.650> there<00:02:30.920> was<00:02:31.040> no<00:02:31.160> handles<00:02:31.640> I'll<00:02:31.880> spit<00:02:32.270> up

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
and there was no handles I'll spit up

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
and there was no handles I'll spit up
now<00:02:33.500> gotta<00:02:33.709> buy<00:02:33.860> some<00:02:34.130> more

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
now gotta buy some more

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.120 
now gotta buy some more
so<00:02:35.239> I'd<00:02:35.360> buy<00:02:35.600> four<00:02:35.930> because<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.350> had<00:02:36.530> two

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
so I'd buy four because I had two

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.300 
so I'd buy four because I had two
variants<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.480> cost<00:02:38.630> be<00:02:38.780> free<00:02:39.020> 50<00:02:39.500> which<00:02:40.070> I

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
variants and it cost be free 50 which I

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.820 
variants and it cost be free 50 which I
guess<00:02:40.459> isn't<00:02:40.730> too<00:02:40.970> bad<00:02:41.150> but<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:42.230> know<00:02:42.380> it's

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
guess isn't too bad but you know it's

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.670 
guess isn't too bad but you know it's
just<00:02:42.950> another<00:02:43.220> thing<00:02:43.520> you've<00:02:43.790> got<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:43.940> pay<00:02:44.360> for

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
just another thing you've got to pay for

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.890 
just another thing you've got to pay for
so<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.739> got<00:02:45.920> them<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.940> this<00:02:47.300> is<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.510> bit<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.840> a

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
so I got them that this is a bit of a

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.830 
so I got them that this is a bit of a
con<00:02:48.080> really<00:02:48.680> not<00:02:49.670> great<00:02:49.820> then<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:50.420> buy<00:02:50.570> it<00:02:50.600> and

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
con really not great then you buy it and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.440 
con really not great then you buy it and
then<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.050> have<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.230> buy<00:02:51.350> handle<00:02:51.680> separately

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
then you have to buy handle separately

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.360 
then you have to buy handle separately
also<00:02:53.450> whether<00:02:53.900> where<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.800> vents<00:02:55.160> are

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
also whether where the vents are

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.810 
also whether where the vents are
positioned<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.560> substrate<00:02:57.560> can<00:02:57.860> come<00:02:58.610> out<00:02:58.790> of

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
positioned a substrate can come out of

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.060 
positioned a substrate can come out of
it<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.600> where<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.049> hole<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.560> our<00:03:00.709> position

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
it and where the hole is in our position

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.530 
it and where the hole is in our position
and<00:03:01.220> I'd<00:03:01.459> say<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:01.850> is<00:03:01.970> my<00:03:02.180> fault<00:03:02.480> for

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
and I'd say that is my fault for

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.520 
and I'd say that is my fault for
changing<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.910> crickets<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.269> dirt<00:03:06.170> can

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
changing it crickets and the dirt can

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.650 
changing it crickets and the dirt can
come<00:03:07.040> out<00:03:07.160> of<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.519> if<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:07.850> did<00:03:08.330> want<00:03:08.570> to

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
come out of it so if you did want to

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.449 
come out of it so if you did want to
change<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:09.170> holes<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.560> bottom<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.280> the

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
change the holes to the bottom so the

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.539 
change the holes to the bottom so the
vivarium<00:03:10.760> could<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:12.500> heatmap<00:03:12.739> could<00:03:13.190> reach

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
vivarium could the heatmap could reach

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.539 
vivarium could the heatmap could reach
the<00:03:14.000> plug<00:03:14.410> you'd<00:03:15.410> have<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.680> block<00:03:16.130> them<00:03:16.400> up

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
the plug you'd have to block them up

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.640 
the plug you'd have to block them up
because<00:03:16.820> they're<00:03:17.090> all<00:03:17.360> like<00:03:17.870> sand<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.560> that

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
because they're all like sand and that

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.789 
because they're all like sand and that
would<00:03:18.980> escape<00:03:19.549> out<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.269> holes<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:20.840> another

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
would escape out of the holes so another

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.220 
would escape out of the holes so another
thing<00:03:21.890> which<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.489> probably<00:03:22.970> it's<00:03:23.840> really

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
thing which is probably it's really

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.710 
thing which is probably it's really
nothing<00:03:24.440> but<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.040> just<00:03:25.190> bugs<00:03:25.400> me<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.880> little<00:03:26.150> bit

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
nothing but it just bugs me a little bit

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.440 
nothing but it just bugs me a little bit
if<00:03:31.030> it's<00:03:32.030> got<00:03:32.180> their<00:03:32.299> names<00:03:32.540> on<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.900> glass<00:03:33.110> and

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
if it's got their names on the glass and

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.400 
if it's got their names on the glass and
that's<00:03:35.450> all<00:03:35.600> well<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:35.810> good<00:03:35.989> if<00:03:36.110> you're

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
that's all well and good if you're

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.590 
that's all well and good if you're
trying<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.799> sell<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.280> vivarium<00:03:37.580> in<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.299> shop

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
trying to sell the vivarium in a shop

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.039 
trying to sell the vivarium in a shop
but<00:03:39.320> to<00:03:39.470> have<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:39.680> as<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:41.239> don't<00:03:41.600> know<00:03:41.690> just<00:03:41.930> that

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
but to have it as I don't know just that

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.630 
but to have it as I don't know just that
how<00:03:42.290> it's<00:03:42.590> just<00:03:42.739> a<00:03:42.769> bit<00:03:42.920> of<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.100> pain<00:03:43.340> really

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
how it's just a bit of a pain really

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.880 
how it's just a bit of a pain really
it's<00:03:43.910> just<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.120> bit<00:03:44.239> like<00:03:44.500> just<00:03:45.500> get<00:03:45.709> off<00:03:45.769> my

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
it's just a bit like just get off my

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.430 
it's just a bit like just get off my
tank<00:03:46.930> another<00:03:47.930> con<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.970> most<00:03:50.260> Bavarians<00:03:51.260> what

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
tank another con is most Bavarians what

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.250 
tank another con is most Bavarians what
the<00:03:51.500> ones<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:51.769> have<00:03:51.980> have<00:03:52.549> these<00:03:52.870> downsides<00:03:53.870> and

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
the ones I have have these downsides and

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.960 
the ones I have have these downsides and
it<00:03:54.470> makes<00:03:54.680> this<00:03:54.950> shutting<00:03:55.400> it's<00:03:55.549> really

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
it makes this shutting it's really

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.430 
it makes this shutting it's really
secure

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
secure

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.150 
secure
these<00:03:57.890> don't<00:03:58.190> so<00:03:58.700> when<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:58.910> shy<00:03:59.090> out<00:04:00.160> that

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
these don't so when you shy out that

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.760 
these don't so when you shy out that
horrible<00:04:01.430> sound<00:04:01.870> it<00:04:02.870> just<00:04:02.930> kind<00:04:03.290> of<00:04:03.320> goes<00:04:03.500> to

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
horrible sound it just kind of goes to

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.160 
horrible sound it just kind of goes to
that<00:04:03.950> and<00:04:04.460> if<00:04:05.000> you've<00:04:05.210> got<00:04:05.450> any<00:04:05.510> substrate<00:04:06.020> in

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
that and if you've got any substrate in

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.750 
that and if you've got any substrate in
it<00:04:06.290> that's<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.620> little<00:04:06.740> gap<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.310> if<00:04:07.520> you've<00:04:07.640> got

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
it that's a little gap and if you've got

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.750 
it that's a little gap and if you've got
a<00:04:07.820> particularly<00:04:08.210> strong<00:04:08.600> gecko<00:04:08.960> which<00:04:09.140> I<00:04:09.380> mean

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
a particularly strong gecko which I mean

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.870 
a particularly strong gecko which I mean
you<00:04:10.760> may<00:04:10.910> do<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:12.350> they<00:04:13.010> can't<00:04:13.250> start<00:04:13.490> opening

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
you may do and they can't start opening

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.320 
you may do and they can't start opening
and<00:04:14.060> it's<00:04:14.180> just<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:14.570> bit<00:04:17.530> I<00:04:18.880> prefer<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:20.209> have

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
and it's just a bit I prefer to have

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.039 
and it's just a bit I prefer to have
something<00:04:20.600> there

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
something there

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.980 
something there
also<00:04:21.590> what<00:04:21.980> these<00:04:22.130> little<00:04:22.280> wedge<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:23.360> put<00:04:23.780> here

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
also what these little wedge to put here

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.670 
also what these little wedge to put here
to<00:04:24.170> stop<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.560> tank<00:04:25.220> opening<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:27.050> don't

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
to stop the tank opening and don't

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.320 
to stop the tank opening and don't
crickets<00:04:27.980> come<00:04:28.130> out<00:04:28.280> to<00:04:28.760> be<00:04:28.850> honest<00:04:29.120> I

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
crickets come out to be honest I

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.530 
crickets come out to be honest I
couldn't<00:04:29.930> probably<00:04:30.230> all<00:04:30.650> right<00:04:30.860> might<00:04:31.100> do<00:04:31.540> but

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
couldn't probably all right might do but

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.320 
couldn't probably all right might do but
through<00:04:33.380> hit<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:34.190> wedge<00:04:34.400> hardly<00:04:34.850> even<00:04:34.970> stays

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
through hit the wedge hardly even stays

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.050 
through hit the wedge hardly even stays
in<00:04:35.480> it<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.840> bit<00:04:35.990> pointless<00:04:36.440> but

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.580 

okay<00:04:42.600> prose<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:44.160> words<00:04:44.370> pretty<00:04:44.610> solid<00:04:44.880> and

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
okay prose and words pretty solid and
