00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.290 
the most success and most improvements
with<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.320> pitch<00:01:30.500> on<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.710> inside<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:31.430> with<00:01:32.150> any

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
with the pitch on the inside so with any

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.520 
with the pitch on the inside so with any
time<00:01:32.480> you're<00:01:32.630> dealing<00:01:32.840> with<00:01:32.870> a<00:01:32.990> heavier<00:01:33.260> bat

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
time you're dealing with a heavier bat

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.380 
time you're dealing with a heavier bat
and<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.280> pitch<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.670> away<00:01:34.790> from<00:01:34.940> you<00:01:35.240> it's

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
and the pitch is away from you it's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.090 
and the pitch is away from you it's
easier<00:01:35.660> it's<00:01:35.960> easier<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.440> just<00:01:36.620> lift<00:01:36.830> up<00:01:36.950> and

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
easier it's easier to just lift up and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.340 
easier it's easier to just lift up and
go<00:01:37.520> but<00:01:38.330> as<00:01:38.420> you're<00:01:38.570> dealing<00:01:38.660> with<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.990> inside

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
go but as you're dealing with the inside

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.900 
go but as you're dealing with the inside
pitch<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.710> got<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.830> second<00:01:40.220> put<00:01:40.370> your<00:01:40.490> hands<00:01:40.700> in

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
pitch you got a second put your hands in

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.680 
pitch you got a second put your hands in

this this p89 28 inch pad will make me

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.050 
this this p89 28 inch pad will make me
do<00:02:32.930> is<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.770> will<00:02:33.860> make<00:02:34.130> me<00:02:34.310> bring<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.910> ball

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
do is it will make me bring the ball

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.910 
do is it will make me bring the ball
back<00:02:35.090> in<00:02:35.360> my<00:02:35.600> stance<00:02:35.720> with<00:02:36.200> my<00:02:36.320> power<00:02:36.590> drills

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
back in my stance with my power drills

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.160 
back in my stance with my power drills
so<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.550> I'm<00:02:37.760> not<00:02:37.910> constantly<00:02:38.450> out<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:38.930> front

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
so that I'm not constantly out in front

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.260 
so that I'm not constantly out in front
reaching<00:02:39.620> for<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.890> ball<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.550> will<00:02:40.760> make<00:02:41.030> me

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
reaching for the ball it will make me

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.030 
reaching for the ball it will make me
shorten<00:02:41.720> up<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.020> hit<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.140> ball<00:02:42.350> deep<00:02:42.590> as<00:02:43.010> a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
shorten up and hit the ball deep as a

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.979 
shorten up and hit the ball deep as a
hitter<00:02:43.400> obviously<00:02:44.270> our<00:02:44.390> number<00:02:44.600> one<00:02:44.780> goal<00:02:44.930> is

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
hitter obviously our number one goal is

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.870 
hitter obviously our number one goal is
to<00:02:45.110> get<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.320> good<00:02:45.440> pitch<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.650> hit<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.160> we<00:02:46.730> don't

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
to get a good pitch to hit and we don't

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.920 
to get a good pitch to hit and we don't
know<00:02:46.970> what<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.209> picture<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.510> going<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.720> throw

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
know what the picture is going to throw

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.900 
know what the picture is going to throw
so<00:02:48.320> one<00:02:48.800> of<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.920> things<00:02:49.070> that<00:02:49.220> p89<00:02:49.520> is<00:02:49.790> going

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
so one of the things that p89 is going

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.070 
so one of the things that p89 is going
to<00:02:49.970> let<00:02:50.090> us<00:02:50.180> do<00:02:50.330> with<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:50.600> drill<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:50.930> going

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
to let us do with this drill it's going

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.080 
to let us do with this drill it's going
to<00:02:51.140> work<00:02:51.320> on<00:02:51.560> doing<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:52.610> letting<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:52.940> ball

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
to work on doing is letting the ball

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.750 
to work on doing is letting the ball
travels

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
travels

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.520 
travels
better<00:02:54.000> pitch<00:02:54.239> recognition<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:55.260> we<00:02:55.379> can
