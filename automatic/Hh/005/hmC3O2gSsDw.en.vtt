00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:09.900
 Hi people, I'm going to talk about a 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.730
 little game that I really like that it is so 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.680
 good to spend time teaching 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.279
 people call clash of kings has clash 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.350
 Angles, right? 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.900
 I just do not know why I liked it. 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.070
 clash only then is a game in time 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:30.840
 that the purpose of it is 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.390
 you raise your level to meet new 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.880
 people have joined an alliance that is a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.739
 Allies group is not here to install with 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.000
 You can help in the battle in the missions. 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.950
 and everything then and there the game he has 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.789
 an empire with seven fantasy kingdoms 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:54.210
 In this game you will train your 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.920
 soldiers is collecting wood food you 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 Will meet new people because 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.030
 being there will have two types of chat going 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.909
 have a dodo chat of your alliance and nt 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.400
 of the whole river is every clash player 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.939
 who are online then talking then 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.310
 you will find everything from Japanese to Arabic 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.869
 everything Chinese to clean then you can 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.310
 make several units continue the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.439
 united states people 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.080
 I have here from Brazil and Brazil. 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.049
 so in my alliance that little by little 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.060
 going on evolving and it may be 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.860
 depends on the level you reach goes 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.200
 appear in the alliance where 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.509
 there are the best alliances of the game 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.610
 and if I'm not mistaken first of all it 's 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.159
 Of course there's Chinese. It's not just the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.960
 Chinese who gave birth to a grandson is a little game 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.470
 they can not 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.479
 God damn it, people are Brazil, so people are. 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.909
 I hardly really like this one. 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.560
 game helps a lot to pass the time calls 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.780
 so also used because types 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.990
 Brazilians as always the Andrew 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.460
 gringos there they understood nothing 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.750
 so it's very funny to chat with you 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.060
 just use only rarely 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.130
 a Brazilian appears he is always 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.299
 outsiders but I really like 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.840
 talk to the people in my alliance 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.330
 they help me a lot and it 's the following 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.630
 there are going to have daily events you can 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.630
 to comply you will win more 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.090
 every day you walk in there you win 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.600
 an award has the source of desire that gives 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.840
 right to win is not to do 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.640
 Five orders there, you get five 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.270
 items for you that is the source of 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.580
 free wishes are there then you have 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.460
 that raise your castle's 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.860
 your farm 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.900
 our of his tower of its soldiers 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.860
 barracks has the college where you do 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.060
 research that will help to evolve throughout 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.600
 your kingdom 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.580
 Anyway, I 'm here because I 'm still 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.310
 I really wanted to say that I think 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.080
 very cool then understands who plays or 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.300
 who will lower the drop mainly 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.740
 who likes anything that links 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.450
 medieval period which is what I like 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.260
 So much so, all songs that make me 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.270
 that make me associate this time 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.550
 movie / video anything knows who does 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.050
 Remember, it 's really delicious for me. I like it. 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.330
 much younger than that has a 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.610
 music very well beginner 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.050
 So these are people where I have one. 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.260
 real time you know several 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.840
 people you can is fight against 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.720
 monsters have multiple ad levels 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.670
 They have to their level and always attacks ever 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.440
 taka one of the highest level that I otherwise 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.340
 this troop will be defeated and that 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.920
 happens 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.320
 The soldier was injured will have to 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.990
 leave the hospital and suddenly it takes a 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.260
 little it heal and and is also 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.120
 always good protected your castle 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.650
 Your little place because it 's a lot of people. 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.560
 with the highest level the gringos 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.209
 especially joão attack and you will 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.370
 losing many soldiers there will begin to 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.709
 To catch fire there, you have to test your 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.030
 coins you hardly ever get there 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.990
 for you to have more here you have to 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.400
 purchase 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.620
 we have to get a different type 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.030
 Or you could end up losing everything. 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.900
 because people can steal your 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.310
 wood only food but it's cool 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.350
 I always advise when you enter the 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.940
 game you people an alliance that group 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.570
 friends and allies who vote for you 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.580
 to help 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.770
 Then what you can do you can have 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.859
 transported to near the kingdom 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.290
 stay close by because that's where 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.410
 suddenly someone attacking alliance 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.630
 will attack the person also kills 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.120
 or iron is not only know these people 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.130
 then the person can also call the alliance 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.310
 if he's too bumpy he'll 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.760
 to end it all is fuck 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.470
 Any people, this is cool, okay? 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.580
 there are even you can put up a 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.340
 your photo of an avatar since the 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.710
 system it will approve or not 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.670
 The system is then left to be able to 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.020
 your back is such 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.610
 It's going to take a while because I think 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.980
 what a lot of people are looking at why not 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.170
 can condemned these things as nudity 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.030
 disrespect to other users 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.920
 also the game itself 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.600
 so this is it folks I really like 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.190
 very funny there all this is 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.370
 used with these very people. 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.800
 Nice, there are the chickens, lakes and woods. 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.300
 monsters and even a lot to 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.960
 do a lot to get up 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.030
 level and is the goal of my alliance 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.830
 climb up the ranking appears one of the 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.670
 first that nobody messes with the 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.620
 people right 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.780
 but for the time being it was already much attacked in the 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.570
 start attack on each deputy at the level 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.490
 1 until at each step level 10 m 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.660
 I'll call him that we can 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.540
 talk right 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.370
 There you click the send letter it's the chat 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.580
 private with the person of the type who speaks 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.290
 prison and paraná attacked and such he or 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.970
 did even more even talk to him 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.650
 between a little bit of my alliance 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.260
 then to help and I fucked up 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.610
 dynamic and then personal in mine mine 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.470
 Alliance was trying to help me 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.270
 only the guy he was already strong then 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.919
 He killed several soldiers in the class. 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:56.890
 whole is difficult then people is this is 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:59.200
 well cool and whoever wants to play today plays 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.850
 mass pro france to pass the 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.250
 coordinates for people to exchange for 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.290
 exchange an idea and this is what plays 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.210
 cell phone that is always good has any 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.140
 place to need the internet because 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.450
 online 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.370
 only thrill in the case in the court of 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.800
 We then went and mouth runs a 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.419
 would put me up I think 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.890
 that the graph could improve 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.570
 little more time with the 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.580
 family the game was getting more like this 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.080
 known step is sure to 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.640
 they will improve, hopefully not 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.040
 buggy because I really like this game 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.500
 I hope I do not have to install people there. 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.870

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.729
