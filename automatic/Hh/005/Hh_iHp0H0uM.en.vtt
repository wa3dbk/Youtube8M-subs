00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:11.250
 Hello everyone, let's touch the question again 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:13.200
 radiator caps ask me questions 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.560
 why vomits on pipes 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.900
 not necessarily in this place in another 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.510
 place our guys as i said and 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.769
 the video was on the radiator cap see 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.439
 much depends on the radiator cap and 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.510
 radiator tears and maybe the stove to jerk 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.480
 the game is shorter where there is a weak spot there and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.079
 will tear at this time will show just 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.600
 simply about how we understand what we 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.329
 fully tested test this cap 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.829
 we will not spend but here is obviously working 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.920
 cover means how to check it out machine 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.719
 cold car is completely cold not 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.649
 started it today did not go 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.109
 it means just take even so i think 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.780
 even to warm some kind of pressure 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.640
 still remain in the system will be even easier 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.580
 check hold the nozzle 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:19.560
 hear the sound if we hold two 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:21.799
 hands valve will be even better 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.270
 this sound is grunt 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:29.100
 it works the valve of the cap that is 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.549
 it opens and it skips the antifreeze 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.790
 here that is, relieves pressure here 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.320
 this pressure should be enough 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.890
 for opening the valve cover that I create 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.890
 manually here 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.810
 that is, I think so if with this 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.469
 pressure 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.920
 valve does not open then we will 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.600
 tearing up in a weak spot will 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.439
 tear to put a new pipe will 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.759
 tear search next place where 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:10.090
 pressure easier to get out do not forget 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:15.069
 it means more about the expansion cap 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:20.680
 tank must be sure to check 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:23.860
 and and be sure to clean and take off this 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.040
 rubber valve see if it works 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.880
 lid if here we are all coked 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:35.799
 tightly closed too dump 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.010
 pressure will have nowhere to go with the following 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:45.750
 all the consequences that you already 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:50.470
 probably notice well, in general, all 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.109
 check radiator cap should 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.200
 work adequately for all bye 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:03:00.060
 subscribe to the VKontakte group and 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.060
 my channel is good luck on the roads
