00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.800
 good i am dani these blocked we have 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.320
 minecraft 1.5 around the corner and 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.540
 a boy from the canal and the rest angle of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.160
 my collaborators told me that he has 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.529
 there was a rather curious change in the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.520
 behavior other pistons I have there 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.340
 behind me a small prototype and a tree 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.760
 how to say a scaffolding here for 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.430
 show that it is the change we have a 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.559
 series of blocks of the rest posts 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.780
 above a series of solid blocks and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.370
 underneath I have a couple of lamps and a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.989
 couple of pistons 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 how are you seeing the lamps 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.430
 function as the function 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.530
 pistons will ignite if they are 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.870
 gives them a signal directly or if they are given 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.510
 signal and directly contacting a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.680
 block that has a signal to the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.329
 pistons have changed the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.329
 behavior I do not know if it's a mold or 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.249
 is changed to posta 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.289
 a piston will now be extended when 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.000
 be given a signal directly when you are 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.130
 give a signal directly or when 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.230
 touching a piston even if it's two signal 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.540
 directly or indirectly 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.270
 as here these two see 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.680
 the fourth piston is not touching any 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.960
 who is giving direct signal or 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.740
 indirect but the other three have 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.369
 fired 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.490
 uses of this as tachán tachán the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.250
 Doors doors double based game 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.670
 of raster even more solid block ideals 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.140
 to make secret entries and you can 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.380
 make it much easier now that 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.380
 before 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.840
 let's see how constructed of 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.609
 these 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.140
 the piston game is still running 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.929
 exactly as before ie 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.869
 we need four pistons forming one 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.960
 wall and touching those pistons we're going to 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.700
 have the two pistons that will not move 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.590
 the solid block and the two blocks 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.640
 solid all these pistons are 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.210
 sticky 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.250
 then the subject is now the signal only 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.979
 you need to move it over the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.820
 pistons let's throw it by touching the two 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.990
 that are going to move the set that makes the 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.240
 plug 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.910
 let's place subtract above 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.500
 those two pistons then when I 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.930
 This piece points out the circuit as 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.150
 you can see he is going to stretch the two 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.750
 pistons that move the plug in their 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.500
 position and plug 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.810
 well here is where the trick comes 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.760
 we are seeing that when the signal is given 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.470
 in that particular block the plug 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.000
 extends and puts its position is worth 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.000
 let's put a repeater 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.240
 joining a bit of reston on top of the 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.820
 plug 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.030
 in such a way that giving signal in that 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.740
 block we are going to extend the pistons that 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.520
 move the plug with your position and the 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.720
 stopper to place it in its position 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.570
 you are seeing that it has spread but 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.550
 I do not know against him because it's because of the 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.620
 marinera of always to move a piston 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.620
 it has to be contracted we have not 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.740
 given time to the piston to contract 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.990
 then it is hard to be able to 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.730
 pull the plug to put it towards the 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.519
 wall 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.700
 how do we arrange this very simple in the 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:25.540
 repeater up we raise you delay to 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.040
 to give time to the stopper say to 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.760
 contract before the others 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.360
 pistons pull well and we already have then 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.980
 what is a secret door of 2 x 1 if 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.209
 we want to make it 2 for 2 you only have 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.780
 to repeat the circuit in a mirror 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.010
 stuck to the side 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.329
 it would only be enough to throw 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.310
 what is the wall where will that 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.590
 door and if you want to put a second 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.049
 lever on the outside side just like 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.000
 has mounted the lever putting one by 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.920
 each side of the solid block 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.170
 inside and outside are made of such 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.540
 way you can close the door 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.450
 secret from outside but you can not 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.700
 open it if it is not open from inside 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.109
 if we wanted a lever with that 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.609
 we could with either of the two 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.349
 open and close the door 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.389
 you have to look at a system like that of 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.489
 the combined keys of a video that 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.380
 Click here recently I leave the link in the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.720
 comments and here I leave the 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.360
 tutorial if you do not want to miss this video 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.979
 saved save it in favorites if 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.289
 you want me to warn you when they rise more 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.570
 things of these subscribe if you like 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.539
 like if you do not like islay comments 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.699
 doubt what you already know how it works 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.750
 this we see in the next video 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.750
