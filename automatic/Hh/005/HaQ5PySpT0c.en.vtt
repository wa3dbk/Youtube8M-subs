00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.030
 weird weird you will think that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.160
 this letter q belongs to a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.210
 well known German manufacturer all 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.570
 also premium 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.699
 well not at all this letter that is 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.119
 associated with infiniti since launch 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:29.789
 of the first model of the brand ass 45 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.219
 almost a quarter of a century ago and well 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.969
 infiniti is super dynamic and has succeeded 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.469
 to seduce me 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.550
 so how simply two 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.559
 ways firstly they are 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.910
 partners in formula 1 and sebastian 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.450
 vettel even participated in the development 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.950
 of 7.50 and secondly they managed to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.170
 produce a car that is frankly 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.780
 superb beautiful lines facing vendres 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.059
 which goes back very very broadly 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.020
 little muzzle of a formula 1 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.600
 it's very funny 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.390
 the line is very fluid the chopsticks 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.149
 chrome flashing reminders and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.100
 rims sober enough big good 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.930
 cut and then especially here it's a 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.150
 hybrid motorization we have a super 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.070
 gasoline engine associated with denis bride on 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.510
 go see what it gives 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.060
 externally the resemblance to the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.280
 three concept car presented since four 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.409
 years by the brand is no doubt 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.180
 with taut surfaces and lines 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.549
 as fluid as dynamic 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.270
 the infiniti that 50 stands out from the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.479
 German triumvirate 4 m long 79 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.880
 wide by 1 meter 80 from its height of 1 m 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.450
 45 gives it a modernity almost 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.299
 classical 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.880
 it has a wheelbase of 2 m 85 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.490
 the most important segment other 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.280
 successes in this hybrid version the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.640
 trunk of 400 liters which was able to resist 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.640
 to batteries with 1641 kg empty 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.680
 its cx of 0.26 makes it easier for 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.720
 penetration into the air then the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.399
 continuous satisfaction inside 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.670
 frankly it's very very well finished 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.770
 the materials are of very good quality 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.229
 the fit is perfect the line on 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.090
 arm is not super extravagant but 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.159
 it is well done with the small drawings 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.110
 digital the paddles driving it 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.929
 must really very very sport this is 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.090
 very good at his 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.560
 option then a super screen in the middle 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.319
 of a touch screen a bit like a 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.629
 tablet with gps booster here with 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.400
 several options including the drive mode 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.409
 can actually it is a model 4 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.260
 drive wheels besides being hybrid on 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:27.379
 can choose different personal modes 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.359
 standard sport eco driving on snow and 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.790
 the particularity since it is a 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.920
 hybrid from the beginning that I you 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.480
 speak there the engine turns 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.670
 lewis is a small electric motor 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.060
 son of pietro accelerator and hop I'm 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.670
 spear 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.129
 it's quiet it's really good at 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.500
 inside the double dashboard 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.169
 wave and the asymmetric central section 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.480
 reminds a cockpit the soft lines 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.790
 the contrasts and the precision of the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.290
 finish are the result of a design 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.069
 welcoming and oriented towards 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.359
 driver 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.909
 the main orders are 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.919
 positioned to be used 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.530
 without having to change position 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:05.629
 driving butt 50 has two screens 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.510
 tactile content and functions 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.650
 on the top screen 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.049
 include the most applications 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.229
 frequently used as maps of 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.780
 navigation the ass 50 offers a wide 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:20.419
 space both front and back 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.459
 for example that of the knees at the back 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.459
 is one of the best in the category 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.720
 so it's very well done it's very 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.010
 intuitive all below the sea the 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.049
 orders works well 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.610
 the touch screen is perfect there are full 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.260
 of functions the detector of 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.690
 line crossing the detector 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.420
 obstacles and lights that 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.799
 are in the amounts recit frankly 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.129
 it's really good 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.450
 it's complete an absolute silence a 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.879
 royal comfort 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.799
 now it will have to test the 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.890
 engine the gearbox is the leader 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.890
 who 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:06.010
 the ass 50 has a v6 3 liters 5 2 3 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.930
 164 horses her torque reaches 350 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.490
 newtons meters plus the 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.860
 67 horses of hybridization in total 431 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.160
 horses that gives him a speed of 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.200
 250 km hour peak on circuit well 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.840
 sure similar level of performance 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.990
 is associated with remarkable efficiency 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.020
 its consumption is 6 liters 200 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.170
 km in mixed cycle with emissions of 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.410
 co2 of 142 4 grams per kilometer the ass 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.900
 53 liters 5h is available in 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.380
 propulsion and all-wheel drive 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.460
 Europe 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.680
 the q5 in 2 3 liters 5h of 3 164 horses 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.650
 share the same clutch control 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.870
 intelligent double and the same box 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.690
 7-speed automatic speeds that the 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.670
 m35h but with notable changes 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.700
 to improve performance 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.010
 increase the operating range in mode 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.350
 electric and offer a capacity of 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.200
 exceptional loading for a vehicle 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.030
 hybrid in this category the 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.400
 automatic transmission with passage of 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.010
 adaptive speed offers a double 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.980
 automatic declutching and a manual mode 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.290
 by means of magnesium pallets 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.850
 in solidarity with the steering column 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.410
 for the engine gearbox 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.010
 so frankly I took a big 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.440
 slap 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.810
 I thought we're going to test today 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.710
 a nice sedan ok she is pretty 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.710
 she is well finished 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.260
 but an incredible engine coupled with a 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.400
 robotic seven- speed box the 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.440
 palettes driving falling 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.240
 perfectly on hand and it grows 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.540
 but that pushes the cameraman he is there 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.730
 to judge me it does not stop I had 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.820
 the chance to try a lot of 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:50.180
 vehicles fountains and very rarely 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.220
 I keep in memory like that too 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.630
 good times paris with others well 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.670
 sure but here I am seduced the direction 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.640
 innovates with technology 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.590
 this shot by wire this direction is also 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.080
 light and gentle maneuvering that more 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.780
 firm and more agile in sporty driving 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.120
 and on difficult course this all 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.550
 first adaptive direction of ares 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.650
 offers different settings options 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.080
 via simple onscreen controls 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.330
 touch unique assets in the category 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.700
 it is possible to set at its 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.960
 convenience both the strength and the 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.330
 management response 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.400
 all the settings specific to each 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.280
 driver being stored in the 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.560
 memory of ass 50 the ace is proposed 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.210
 in series on infiniti we would not say 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.760
 like that she looks a little clumsy 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.810
 she and she 's no bling bling are there 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.630
 no red seam 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.730
 we will say that 5 sports vehicles but that 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:47.950
 does the wheel in an incredible way 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.950
 the ground connection is great 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:53.999
 even more I berd 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:57.149
 I want this one in my garage 

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:58.879
 it's validated no yellow card no 

00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:00.959
 red card of the valley 

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:02.639
 here is the first car too 

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:04.499
 ecological technologies 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:06.449
 it brings a real innovation by 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:08.879
 these driving aids that in a 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:11.969
 showcase of the most trendy but not me 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:14.039
 you saw this infiniti that deserves 50 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:17.729
 linger on it before taking a 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:21.889
 purchase decision infiniti range that 50 to 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.889
 from 34 1915 euros
