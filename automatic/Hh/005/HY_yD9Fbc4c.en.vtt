00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
rifles which I was actually quite

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.420 
rifles which I was actually quite
surprised<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.479> some<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.720> these<00:01:39.810> are

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
surprised that some of these are

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.380 
surprised that some of these are
accessible<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> grenade<00:01:42.000> launchers

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
accessible for the grenade launchers

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.319 
accessible for the grenade launchers
well<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:44.640> was<00:01:44.729> different<00:01:44.880> from<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> wii

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
well that was different from the wii

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.100 
well that was different from the wii
version<00:01:45.860> but<00:01:46.860> overall<00:01:47.630> ak-47<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.750> not<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
version but overall ak-47 is not the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.889 
version but overall ak-47 is not the
greatest<00:01:49.409> my<00:01:50.189> burn<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.790> my<00:01:50.820> opinion<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.600> i

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
greatest my burn in my opinion so i

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.469 
greatest my burn in my opinion so i
would<00:01:52.140> probably<00:01:52.500> stay<00:01:53.310> away<00:01:53.520> from<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
would probably stay away from that the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
would probably stay away from that the
most<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.409> will<00:01:55.590> probably<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.950> using<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
most that you will probably be using is

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.340 
most that you will probably be using is
the<00:01:56.759> gun<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:56.939> i'm<00:01:57.149> using<00:01:57.180> which<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.630> known<00:01:58.170> as

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the gun that i'm using which is known as

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.289 
the gun that i'm using which is known as

really<00:02:04.229> great<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.399> do<00:02:05.810> resent<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.079> it's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
really great and I do resent that it's

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.219 
really great and I do resent that it's
gotten<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.489> fast<00:02:08.940> rate<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.330> fire<00:02:09.539> great

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
gotten really fast rate of fire great

gotten really fast rate of fire great
range<00:02:10.679> damage<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> little<00:02:12.060> bit<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.239> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
range damage is a little bit in the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.890 
range damage is a little bit in the
middle

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.020 
middle
the<00:02:13.680> accuracy<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.129> a<00:02:14.250> little<00:02:14.430> bit<00:02:14.549> low<00:02:14.730> there

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
the accuracy is a little bit low there

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.809 
the accuracy is a little bit low there
but<00:02:15.780> overall<00:02:16.409> the<00:02:16.739> kalos<00:02:17.129> is<00:02:17.280> probably<00:02:17.640> going

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
but overall the kalos is probably going

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.479 
but overall the kalos is probably going
to<00:02:17.909> be<00:02:18.000> your<00:02:18.209> best<00:02:18.510> choice<00:02:19.040> when<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.129> comes<00:02:20.189> to

severely<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:04.769> this<00:03:04.950> game<00:03:05.189> my<00:03:05.489> opinion<00:03:05.939> the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
severely in this game my opinion the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.960 
severely in this game my opinion the
grade<00:03:06.659> of<00:03:06.689> fire<00:03:07.049> is<00:03:07.319> a<00:03:08.010> little<00:03:08.400> bit<00:03:08.489> good<00:03:08.700> but

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
grade of fire is a little bit good but

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.599 
grade of fire is a little bit good but
you<00:03:09.359> only<00:03:09.599> be<00:03:09.840> able<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.109> fire<00:03:10.709> three<00:03:11.069> bursts<00:03:11.430> of

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
you only be able to fire three bursts of

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.199 
you only be able to fire three bursts of
it<00:03:11.849> instead<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.239> like<00:03:12.510> full<00:03:12.959> auto<00:03:14.060> range<00:03:15.060> is

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
it instead of like full auto range is

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.240 
it instead of like full auto range is
still<00:03:15.389> pretty<00:03:15.569> good<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:16.379> surprisingly<00:03:17.040> got

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
still pretty good it surprisingly got

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.170 
still pretty good it surprisingly got
really<00:03:17.549> good<00:03:17.639> accuracy<00:03:18.829> it<00:03:19.829> comes<00:03:20.639> times<00:03:20.970> when

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
really good accuracy it comes times when

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.580 
really good accuracy it comes times when
you<00:03:21.269> were<00:03:21.389> like<00:03:21.510> like<00:03:21.780> long<00:03:22.019> distance<00:03:22.230> it's

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
you were like like long distance it's

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.050 
you were like like long distance it's
really<00:03:22.829> good<00:03:22.980> for<00:03:23.099> that<00:03:23.280> but<00:03:23.549> for<00:03:23.819> mid-range

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
really good for that but for mid-range

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.050 
really good for that but for mid-range
it's<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.599> little<00:03:24.750> bit<00:03:24.840> hard<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.109> control<00:03:26.060> that

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
it's a little bit hard to control that

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.170 
it's a little bit hard to control that
