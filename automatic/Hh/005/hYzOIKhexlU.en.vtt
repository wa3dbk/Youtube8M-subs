00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.749
 new looking 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.939
 i think he 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.659
 on this earth your possibilities are truly 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:22.650
 unlimited 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.110
 countless millennia you 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.480
 watched it break this land 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.859
 waiting for the appearance of the first people 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.100
 those who are destined to be yours 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.310
 followed by a goal of the second Russian gas 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:37.590
 filled up 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.210
 when we reached victory yesterday 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.540
 settling down they flourished 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.960
 created whole civilizations 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.620
 people deduct you above all else 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.309
 and even a little snow is possible 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.350
 great inserts 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.980
 some time people involved 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.250
 but that time has passed 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.080
 they had good intentions but she did not 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.090
 it would be great for us 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.129
 before your eyes civilization 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.120
 office visitors 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.540
 a group of unknown hunger and even ferocious 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.550
 decide 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.080
 watching the suffering of people you 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.250
 suddenly you understand 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.600
 people need guidance 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.280
 we must not only observe lead them 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.340
 during the period 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.360
 if you could install with them 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.730
 connection push in the right 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.140
 direction 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 wouldn't that help solve the best 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.820
 but how can you manage huge 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.200
 civilizations 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.540
 you need and the hero of man and woman 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.190
 that will lead people behind the fence 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.710
 heroes will be your hands with them you 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.740
 build a new world 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.970
 but now you need to wait for the appearance 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.690
 people not able to become heroes 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.750
 and this day has come 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.180
 there was a young leader who dreams 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.380
 build a great kingdom 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.710
 he and his associates have everything 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.220
 required qualities 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.360
 under your supervision they will be able to create 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.729
 new flourishing now 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.599
 yet determine the future kingdom 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.540
 people are ready to take your leadership 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.229
 their fate is in your hands 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.629
