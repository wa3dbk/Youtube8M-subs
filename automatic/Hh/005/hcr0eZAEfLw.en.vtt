 we have changed about 4 times the water and already 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.800
 they were sweet then it means that no 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.580
 bitter but still retains 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.880

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.049

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.840
 the fennel 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.689
 all this we have washed previously 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.689
 what is 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.620
 we already had it prepared 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.620
 for what it is 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.590
 garlic cloves 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.819
 the orange peels 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.650
 and a pretty good handful of 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.450
 oregano 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.090
 and the salt 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.040
 also a handful 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.219
 this is done as 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.689
 everything was done in the past the hand is the 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:54.689
 best measure 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.050
 and finally 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.519
 she is my mother 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.000
 it depends on each one the taste that 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.640
 want to give if you want him stronger 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.890
 for example flavored with bone vinegar 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.730
 and it is already 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.680
 well then we only have to 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.489
 fill him 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.489
 of water 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.650
 a little more vinegar then nothing that 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:36.830
 it's because he likes vinegar 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:39.800
 water is natural water without chlorine and 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.039
 simply when it is full then the 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.039
 we're 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.600
 here takes 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.510
 and now what is left 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.810
 it's a time to rest 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.800
 and already in a few days you can eat without 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.800
 no problem 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.670
