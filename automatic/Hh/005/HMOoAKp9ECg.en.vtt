especially when you're dealing with a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.860 
especially when you're dealing with a
fiberglass<00:00:50.760> hood<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.719> had<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
fiberglass hood because if you had a

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.869 
fiberglass hood because if you had a
rigid<00:00:52.230> mount<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.680> fiberglass<00:00:53.309> hood<00:00:53.489> will<00:00:53.699> tend

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
rigid mount a fiberglass hood will tend

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.459 
rigid mount a fiberglass hood will tend
to<00:00:53.940> crack<00:00:54.180> around<00:00:54.570> its<00:00:54.780> mouths<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
to crack around its mouths not to

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.590 
to crack around its mouths not to
mention<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.309> also<00:00:56.489> an<00:00:56.670> isolator<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.449> it's

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
mention this is also an isolator so it's

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.479 
mention this is also an isolator so it's
going<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> eliminate<00:00:57.930> any<00:00:58.289> rattles<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.280> best

I've<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.220> some<00:01:20.369> big<00:01:20.520> plans<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.119> thing

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
I've got some big plans for this thing

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.140 
I've got some big plans for this thing
but<00:01:21.659> right<00:01:21.869> now<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.950> time<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.220> get<00:01:23.460> busy<00:01:23.640> now

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.340 

the<00:01:27.150> first<00:01:27.479> step<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.869> process<00:01:28.320> is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the first step in the process is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.870 
the first step in the process is
figuring<00:01:28.860> out<00:01:28.979> exactly<00:01:29.130> where<00:01:29.700> you're<00:01:29.820> gonna

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
figuring out exactly where you're gonna

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.640 
figuring out exactly where you're gonna
mount<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.509> hood<00:01:30.689> pins<00:01:30.990> now<00:01:31.229> generally

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
mount the hood pins now generally

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.530 
mount the hood pins now generally
speaking<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.189> core<00:01:32.460> support<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.360> best

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
speaking the core support is the best

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.420 
speaking the core support is the best
choice<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.170> regardless<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.829> want<00:01:35.159> something

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
choice but regardless you want something

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
choice but regardless you want something
solid<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.049> move<00:01:37.229> now

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
solid it's not going to move now

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.569 
solid it's not going to move now
depending<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> particular

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
may need to build some brackets off of

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.760 
may need to build some brackets off of
the<00:01:42.329> core<00:01:42.509> support<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.140> order<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.500> properly

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the core support in order to properly

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.249 
the core support in order to properly
locate<00:01:44.250> them<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> hood<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.140> can

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
locate them with the hood but as you can

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.899 
locate them with the hood but as you can
see<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> couple<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.729> hoods

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
see here we have a couple of hoods

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.340 
see here we have a couple of hoods
number<00:01:48.210> locations<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.899> are<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> serve

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
number locations that are going to serve

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.139 
number locations that are going to serve
as<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.560> perfect<00:01:50.189> potential<00:01:50.460> mounts<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.030> our

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
as the perfect potential mounts for our

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.480 
as the perfect potential mounts for our
hood<00:01:51.360> pins<00:01:51.659> now<00:01:52.049> these<00:01:52.320> simply<00:01:52.649> unscrew<00:01:53.189> like

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
hood pins now these simply unscrew like

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.880 
hood pins now these simply unscrew like
so<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.420> hole<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:55.200> even<00:01:55.409> pretty<00:01:55.590> close<00:01:55.740> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
so and the hole is even pretty close to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.620 
so and the hole is even pretty close to
the<00:01:55.979> right<00:01:56.130> size<00:01:56.399> now<00:01:57.000> we're<00:01:57.149> gonna<00:01:57.270> use<00:01:57.329> this

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the right size now we're gonna use this

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.300 
the right size now we're gonna use this
outboard<00:01:58.079> mount<00:01:58.350> rather<00:01:58.649> than<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.860> inboard

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
outboard mount rather than the inboard

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.280 
outboard mount rather than the inboard
location<00:01:59.820> because<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.540> interferes

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
location because this one interferes

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.780 
location because this one interferes
with<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> white<00:02:01.710> stripe<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> hoods

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
with the white stripe on the hoods

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.850 
with the white stripe on the hoods
so<00:02:03.750> now<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:03.960> we've<00:02:04.170> determined<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.649> pin

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
so now that we've determined the pin

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.679 
so now that we've determined the pin
location<00:02:05.369> what<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.640> need<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.149> mount<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
location what we need to do is mount the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.510 
location what we need to do is mount the
hood<00:02:06.810> pins<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.229> core<00:02:07.469> support<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.069> then

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
hood pins to the core support and then

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.190 
hood pins to the core support and then
determine<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.149> location<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.810> mark<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.140> drill

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
determine the location to mark and drill

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.670 
determine the location to mark and drill
the<00:02:10.349> hole<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> hood<00:02:10.950> itself

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
the headlight so to do that we had to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.970 
the headlight so to do that we had to
remove<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.900> grille<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.440> then<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.769> front

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
now we can install the hood pin now we

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.259 
now we can install the hood pin now we
don't<00:02:48.440> know<00:02:48.590> exactly<00:02:48.799> what<00:02:49.430> height<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:50.030> needs

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
to be just yet but that's alright we can

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.430 
to be just yet but that's alright we can
adjust<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:52.549> later<00:02:52.870> now<00:02:53.870> once<00:02:54.049> we<00:02:54.170> get<00:02:54.290> this

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
adjust that later now once we get this

and<00:02:57.440> then<00:02:57.769> we<00:02:58.519> can<00:02:58.549> mark<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.000> hood<00:03:00.160> it's

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
and then we can mark the hood it's

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.310 
and then we can mark the hood it's
pretty<00:03:01.370> good
