I can leave the lid off because I just

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
I can leave the lid off because I just
want<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:56.990> try<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.230> reduce<00:02:57.440> some<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.680> the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
want to try and reduce some of the

want to try and reduce some of the
moisture<00:02:57.950> out<00:02:58.220> of<00:02:58.400> there<00:02:58.640> so<00:02:58.820> we<00:02:58.940> just<00:02:59.120> left

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
moisture out of there so we just left

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.350 
moisture out of there so we just left
more<00:03:00.080> or<00:03:00.320> less<00:03:00.350> with<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.160> cooked<00:03:02.090> cauliflower

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
more or less with the cooked cauliflower

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.240 
more or less with the cooked cauliflower
just<00:03:03.140> enough<00:03:03.380> liquids<00:03:03.740> to<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:03.950> into<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.160> very

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
just enough liquids to it into a very

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.860 
just enough liquids to it into a very
thick<00:03:04.880> super<00:03:05.240> consistency<00:03:10.480> okay<00:03:11.480> can<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:11.690> see

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
thick super consistency okay can you see

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.570 
thick super consistency okay can you see
the<00:03:12.020> sustained<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.500> color<00:03:12.680> up<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.070> starting

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
the sustained to color up and starting

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.520 
the sustained to color up and starting
to<00:03:13.610> blister<00:03:13.910> I've<00:03:14.750> just<00:03:14.810> popped<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.290> little

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
to blister I've just popped a little

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.990 
to blister I've just popped a little
more<00:03:15.650> water<00:03:15.860> in<00:03:16.100> there<00:03:16.280> as<00:03:16.430> all<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.730> sugars

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
more water in there as all the sugars

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
more water in there as all the sugars
gone<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.360> bottom<00:03:17.570> starting<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.900> actually

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
gone to the bottom starting to actually

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.600 
gone to the bottom starting to actually
caramelize<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:18.890> we<00:03:18.980> want<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.160> loosen<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.550> up

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
caramelize so we want to loosen that up

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.490 
caramelize so we want to loosen that up
just<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:20.060> little<00:03:20.209> next<00:03:21.080> thing<00:03:21.230> I'm<00:03:21.320> going<00:03:21.350> to

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
just a little next thing I'm going to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.960 
just a little next thing I'm going to
talk<00:03:21.709> about<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.280> starting<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.180> cook<00:03:23.330> some<00:03:23.540> pork

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
talk about is starting to cook some pork

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.949 
talk about is starting to cook some pork
so<00:03:25.970> I'm<00:03:26.030> just<00:03:26.150> going<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:26.390> season<00:03:26.570> that<00:03:26.840> up

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
so I'm just going to season that up

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.330 
so I'm just going to season that up
really<00:03:27.170> nicely<00:03:27.470> with<00:03:27.800> a<00:03:27.830> lot<00:03:27.980> of<00:03:28.070> pepper<00:03:28.250> and

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
really nicely with a lot of pepper and

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.380 
really nicely with a lot of pepper and
I'm<00:03:28.459> going<00:03:28.580> to<00:03:28.610> take<00:03:28.760> some<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:28.970> these<00:03:29.120> sage

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
I'm going to take some of these sage

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.990 
I'm going to take some of these sage
leaves<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.020> push<00:03:30.709> them<00:03:30.890> right<00:03:31.070> into<00:03:31.310> there<00:03:31.580> so

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
leaves and push them right into there so

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.850 
leaves and push them right into there so
this<00:03:32.150> is<00:03:32.180> like<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.480> pork<00:03:32.810> chop<00:03:32.870> or<00:03:33.200> pork<00:03:33.440> cutlet

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
this is like a pork chop or pork cutlet

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.090 
this is like a pork chop or pork cutlet
with<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.400> bone<00:03:34.700> off<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.590> reckon<00:03:36.860> we<00:03:36.980> can

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
with a bone off and I reckon we can

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.250 
with a bone off and I reckon we can
almost<00:03:37.340> start<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.880> think<00:03:38.120> about<00:03:38.239> puree<00:03:38.900> a

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
almost start to think about puree a

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.070 
almost start to think about puree a
power<00:03:39.440> source<00:03:39.650> for<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:39.980> cauliflower<00:03:41.050> now<00:03:42.050> I

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
power source for the cauliflower now I

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.729 
power source for the cauliflower now I
need<00:03:42.470> those<00:03:42.680> little<00:03:42.920> red<00:03:43.100> clampy<00:03:43.610> things<00:03:44.739> so

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
need those little red clampy things so

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.259 
need those little red clampy things so
it's<00:03:45.860> funny<00:03:46.070> working<00:03:46.489> there<00:03:46.640> so<00:03:46.880> many<00:03:47.000> little

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
it's funny working there so many little

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.240 
it's funny working there so many little
inventions<00:03:47.810> these<00:03:48.019> days<00:03:48.230> but<00:03:48.500> we<00:03:48.680> in<00:03:48.860> kitchens

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
inventions these days but we in kitchens

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.860 
inventions these days but we in kitchens
use<00:03:49.459> really<00:03:49.790> basic<00:03:50.180> things<00:03:50.420> like<00:03:50.570> we<00:03:50.780> don't

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
use really basic things like we don't

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.290 
use really basic things like we don't
have<00:03:51.019> any<00:03:51.110> other<00:03:51.410> gadgets<00:03:51.800> I<00:03:52.040> use<00:03:52.280> them<00:03:52.580> for

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
have any other gadgets I use them for

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.390 
have any other gadgets I use them for
