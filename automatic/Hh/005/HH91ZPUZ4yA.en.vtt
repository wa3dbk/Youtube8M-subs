00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.610
 and today we are with the swing 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.650
 of babies bunny swing of luxe that is 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.920
 a super cute object the truth is that 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.789
 has even some little lions and a little monkey and 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.420
 I think that last one is a toucan is 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.880
 a toucan and is especially useful for 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.710
 those those people who are 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.170
 like to play the sims but do not like 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.260
 take care of babies or not particularly 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.690
 these are your favorites as someone who 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.239
 I know, the truth is that this 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.329
 object is extremely useful for those 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.940
 people who simply want to spend 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.350
 from that stage of life to the next 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.329
 but in a very painless way then for 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.489
 buy it again I tell you this is 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.440
 only reviewing a object 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.059
 you can buy at the sims store 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.500
 I leave a link in the description to the place 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.680
 Exactly where you can buy this 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.350
 If you are interested and when 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.969
 they install what their sims can buy 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.909
 through the buy mode as any 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.210
 another object in the children's section 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.700
 they will find it where the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.429
 furniture and there will be the swing of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.159
 baby bunny swing from luxe costs 60 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.060
 cm or leonesas and that for their sims is a 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.250
 bargain 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.530
 if they do not have installed impossible 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.569
 want to use it and the description says 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.670
 Keep your baby or your baby happy 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.259
 with this fun swing thanks to its 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.030
 great variety of options in the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.979
 your child's happiness will be in your power 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.689
 attention the highest option can 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.459
 cause dizziness and nobody likes a 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.859
 child with nausea to nobody the truth not 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.170
 There are different colors so that 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.840
 choose if you do not want to customize 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.689
 it's nice to notice it's beautiful more 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.090
 of jungle that the green in fact and 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.770
 let's see it in blue nothing else because if 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.829
 It is a very simple object to use 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.150
 by the way and as I say it is one of the most 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.250
 useful that I have had 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.810
 was the version for girls very cute 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.550
 but you can change the colors that 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.920
 you prefer there is no problem in that 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.860
 then we are going to use it with our 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.080
 small as it is called mateo we are going to 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.410
 bring matteo in the to upload it in the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.670
 swing and let's see how it works 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.490
 because I tell them it 's pretty good 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.560
 then I kill unfortunately not 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.330
 has many low needs but 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.060
 now they will see what is going to 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.910
 happen or I hope it can be appreciated 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.040
 then he's going to take Mateo and he's going to 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.880
 put on the swing and let's do 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.800
 extremely happy extremely happy 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.540
 although it is already batting here then the 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.700
 interactions that we have available 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.890
 they are to turn it on or to turn on the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.959
 swing to hold mateos to remove it from 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.459
 there to watch Matteo then we go to 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.940
 turn on the swing at slow speed 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.040
 because in the fast you can get dizzy and 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.050
 let's say it 's more fun but the 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.519
 truth is that a baby with dizziness is not 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.620
 good seriously 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.170
 they vomit everywhere then we can 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.790
 turn on that and start to get 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.410
 we do not automatically have to be 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.269
 here if we do not want to ours if we do not 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.030
 You can go anywhere but the 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.880
 advantage is that we can not send it 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.110
 to cook or whatever and for as long as 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.150
 baby apart that it will be fine 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.340
 careful will start receiving a 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.920
 benefit in their needs as they see 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.380
 has all the needs have 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.480
 green arrows and in fact she already 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.760
 I left there drunk and Matthew fell asleep because 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.260
 babies can sleep if they are 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.750
 sufficiently tired can be 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.110
 sleep but at the same time during I think 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.700
 that lasts two hours 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.860
 I was going to say tour but it's 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.260
 they really do not advance but the action is 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.840
 to get in I think it lasts two hours without and 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.790
 for as long as he's going to have and I'm 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.460
 getting almost with zinc seriously is 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.900
 very relaxing to see it is going to have that 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.540
 benefit of the needs for not 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.280
 roll up so much then it's also 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.590
 to bathe or it is perfect if 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.800
 existed this in reality we are going to 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.840
 come here we will bring our 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.580
 simple because it not only seems that 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.920
 all the benefits that mate gives you or you 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.709
 the father takes them away we can not only 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.600
 receive the benefit for the baby that in 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.550
 that moment is asleep I do not know what 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.170
 also going to react maybe 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.650
 we should slap it so that it 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.650
 wake up 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.730
 let's hold it and let's remove it 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.270
 because if they were fixed at the beginning 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.400
 Awakens Matthew more clicks 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.639
 well that option to monitor attentive 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.530
 let's put it on and let's monitor it and 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.240
 also the father will receive but 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.789
 we should turn it on first to see 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.770
 slow speed lets see no no no no no 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:39.080
 do not go to the bathroom and then watch it 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.449
 then the father is also going to 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.009
 interact with your baby and that's great 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.479
 because sometimes we have no relationship with 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.550
 We babies simply put them to 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.500
 play on the floor and the only way to 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.240
 relate to him as he already has the 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.360
 social going person knows but at 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.919
 principle they just noted that they were 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.169
 filling the social and I was also 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.659
 is at this moment filling it with 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.190
 fun so for parents it 's 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.229
 good because they can form a relationship 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.970
 more easily with your children and at the same 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.310
 time to have fun as they see nothing else left 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.370
 to watch him and immediately watched 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.289
 and immediately began to lower this if 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.090
 I put it back spam again 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.889
 these arrows are going to disappear because 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.620
 is getting fun and social 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.110
 then for me for me this is one of 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.000
 the best objects in the store in 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.900
 serious to me as I do not like so much to take care of 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.990
 to the children sim well the truth that I 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.199
 it comes in handy and it also serves with babies 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.069
 that is, not just with the infants but 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:39.289
 also with babies can sleep there 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.880
 they meet their needs if they have a 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.400
 sim to adult who want to live with 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.240
 your baby also serves them perfect 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.470
 that already falls asleep again so good 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.449
 nothing more out of curiosity before 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.370
 dismiss this surely they will want 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.169
 see the fast speed so let's go to 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.969
 do what 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.800
 let's make it mix quickly 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:00.840
 nothing more so that they do not remain with the doubt 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.520
 and that's the normal speed and 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.729
 suddenly going to start the fast speed 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.740
 there is 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.589
 I 'm not sure that it gets dizzy but it can be 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.259
 that they get dizzy actually woke up and they 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:15.229
 It seems fun but if it is dangerous 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:16.939
 then this object as I always do 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.339
 our series I have to qualify it as 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:21.319
 a funny or bizarre useful object what 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:24.319
 I put as one of the most useful objects 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:26.150
 and fun then a little blackboard for 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:30.979
 nothing is not is not a strange object 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:33.139
 not weird or anything but useful I give everything 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:36.860
 everything that can be useful and even one 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:39.649
 more is super useful fun for them 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.199
 yes but especially the strong point is your 

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.490
 utility then with this I say goodbye 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.080
 I hope you liked that object 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.449
 think about it if you are interested 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.889
 look at arrived at the mother if you are interested 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.559
 get it I will leave the link that the 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:53.180
 description as I said and for now I 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:54.559
 dismiss many thanks for having 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.180
 seen this video and I wait for you in the 

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:58.180
