00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
thought they gave here they said in a

BTech<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:07.170> do<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:08.040> lot<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.309> practical<00:00:08.700> work<00:00:08.849> and

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
BTech you do a lot of practical work and

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.030 
BTech you do a lot of practical work and
you<00:00:09.300> learn<00:00:09.540> by<00:00:09.750> doing<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.769> think<00:00:10.830> that's

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
you learn by doing and I think that's

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.339 
you learn by doing and I think that's
something<00:00:11.429> that's<00:00:11.580> very<00:00:11.670> true<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.049> whole

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
something that's very true to the whole

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.289 
something that's very true to the whole
like<00:00:13.710> ethos<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.460> school<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.089> learn

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
like ethos of the school that you learn

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.240 
like ethos of the school that you learn
by<00:00:15.509> doing<00:00:15.570> rather<00:00:16.080> than<00:00:16.260> just<00:00:16.560> sitting<00:00:16.800> down

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
by doing rather than just sitting down

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.810 
by doing rather than just sitting down
writing<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:17.970> lessons<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:19.550> think<00:00:20.550> that's<00:00:20.670> really

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
writing in lessons I think that's really

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.920 
writing in lessons I think that's really
really<00:00:21.060> great<00:00:21.180> about<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.539> school<00:00:21.779> isn't

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
really great about this school isn't

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.730 
really great about this school isn't
that<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.769> free<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:24.080> creative<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
that you can be free and creative and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.990 
that you can be free and creative and
genuinely<00:00:27.019> do<00:00:28.019> work<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.710> enriches<00:00:29.429> both<00:00:29.849> of

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
genuinely do work that enriches both of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.580 
genuinely do work that enriches both of
the<00:00:30.060> lives<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> students<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.380> staff

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the lives of the students and the staff

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.770 
the lives of the students and the staff
and<00:00:31.830> also<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.250> kind<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.520> wider<00:00:32.700> community

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
and also the kind of wider community

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.190 
and also the kind of wider community
I<00:00:34.070> think<00:00:35.070> thing<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:36.480> Brit<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.930> that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
I think thing is about the Brit is that

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.040 
I think thing is about the Brit is that
it's<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> only<00:00:37.739> free<00:00:38.280> school<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.329> gives<00:00:39.690> me

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
it's the only free school that gives me

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.260 
it's the only free school that gives me
the<00:00:40.559> opportunity<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.520> something<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.000> love

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the opportunity to do something I love

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.500 
the opportunity to do something I love

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
as much as I can I don't know of any

as much as I can I don't know of any
other<00:00:45.750> schools<00:00:46.140> apart<00:00:46.469> from<00:00:46.680> fee-paying<00:00:47.010> ones

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550

that's never happened it correct me if
I'm<00:01:26.340> wrong<00:01:26.369> never<00:01:26.789> happened<00:01:27.119> before<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
I'm wrong never happened before in the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.760 
I'm wrong never happened before in the
history<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.899> the<00:01:28.020> earth<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.410> you<00:01:28.440> can't

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
history of the earth so you can't

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.529 
history of the earth so you can't
predict<00:01:29.220> something<00:01:29.550> like<00:01:29.910> that<00:01:30.149> you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.509> I

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
predict something like that you know I

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.060 
predict something like that you know I
mean<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:31.050> just<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.380> done<00:01:31.530> very<00:01:31.770> well<00:01:31.800> for

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
mean that's just just done very well for

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:44.320 
mean that's just just done very well for
herself

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.840 

I<00:01:44.620> think<00:01:45.620> I<00:01:45.830> hadn't<00:01:46.160> come<00:01:46.370> here<00:01:46.550> I<00:01:46.610> wouldn't

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
I think I hadn't come here I wouldn't

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.000 
I think I hadn't come here I wouldn't
had<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.330> when<00:01:48.170> I've<00:01:48.260> had<00:01:48.290> that<00:01:48.530> growth<00:01:48.770> as<00:01:48.980> a

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
had that when I've had that growth as a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.950 
had that when I've had that growth as a
dancer<00:01:49.550> so<00:01:49.760> I<00:01:49.910> think<00:01:49.970> it's<00:01:50.270> really<00:01:50.450> pushed<00:01:50.750> me

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
dancer so I think it's really pushed me

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.220 
dancer so I think it's really pushed me

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
think that it's definitely been the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.850 
think that it's definitely been the
teachers<00:02:09.080> because<00:02:09.470> they're<00:02:09.619> so

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
teachers because they're so

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.530 
teachers because they're so
inspirational<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.790> just<00:02:10.910> learn<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.390> much

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
inspirational and you just learn so much

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.030 
inspirational and you just learn so much
from<00:02:11.720> them

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.920 

it's<00:02:16.040> also<00:02:16.160> making<00:02:16.760> do<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.060> do<00:02:17.300> rock<00:02:17.750> melody

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
it's also making do you do rock melody

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.750 
it's also making do you do rock melody
if<00:02:18.830> you've<00:02:19.070> been<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.460> position<00:02:19.610> that

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
if you've been in the position that

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.700 
if you've been in the position that
you're<00:02:19.910> in<00:02:20.000> now<00:02:20.240> which<00:02:20.840> has<00:02:20.990> makes<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.320> like<00:02:21.530> so

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
you're in now which has makes it like so

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.510 
I think it's teachers get just as much
out<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.610> than<00:02:26.030> as<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.390> students<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.110> think

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.000 
out of it than as the students I think
students<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.970> teachers<00:02:29.960> and<00:02:30.200> leaders<00:02:30.680> of
