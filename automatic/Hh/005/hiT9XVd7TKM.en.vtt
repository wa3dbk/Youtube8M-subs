00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.810 

okay<00:00:08.050> so<00:00:08.109> a<00:00:08.320> quick<00:00:08.650> introduction<00:00:09.130> to<00:00:09.430> the

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
okay so a quick introduction to the

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.430 
okay so a quick introduction to the
cutting<00:00:10.270> implements<00:00:10.780> you're<00:00:10.900> likely<00:00:11.080> to<00:00:11.290> use

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
cutting implements you're likely to use

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.850 
cutting implements you're likely to use
on<00:00:11.889> these<00:00:12.370> sorts<00:00:12.730> of<00:00:12.790> craft<00:00:13.059> materials<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
on these sorts of craft materials the

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.170 
on these sorts of craft materials the
first<00:00:14.889> thing<00:00:15.250> I'm<00:00:15.370> going<00:00:15.490> to<00:00:15.549> look<00:00:15.700> at<00:00:15.910> is<00:00:16.150> a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
first thing I'm going to look at is a

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.290 
first thing I'm going to look at is a
craft<00:00:16.570> knife<00:00:16.780> with<00:00:17.470> a<00:00:17.740> number<00:00:18.130> 11<00:00:18.730> craft<00:00:19.119> knife

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
craft knife with a number 11 craft knife

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.870 
craft knife with a number 11 craft knife
blade<00:00:19.600> and<00:00:20.190> the<00:00:21.190> thing<00:00:21.369> you'll<00:00:21.550> notice<00:00:21.730> about

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
blade and the thing you'll notice about

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.429 
blade and the thing you'll notice about
the<00:00:22.210> blade<00:00:22.420> is<00:00:22.630> that<00:00:22.810> it's<00:00:22.960> generally<00:00:23.410> a

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
the blade is that it's generally a

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.080 
the blade is that it's generally a
little<00:00:23.710> bit<00:00:23.830> thicker<00:00:24.130> than<00:00:24.279> say<00:00:24.759> its

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
little bit thicker than say its

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.419 
little bit thicker than say its
counterparts<00:00:25.779> and<00:00:25.929> the<00:00:26.050> scalpels<00:00:26.560> and<00:00:26.830> this

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
counterparts and the scalpels and this

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:28.650 
counterparts and the scalpels and this
allows<00:00:27.699> you<00:00:27.849> to<00:00:27.939> put<00:00:28.060> a<00:00:28.089> little<00:00:28.359> bit<00:00:28.509> more

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
allows you to put a little bit more

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.880 
allows you to put a little bit more
pressure<00:00:28.929> when<00:00:29.349> cutting

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
pressure when cutting

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.249 
pressure when cutting
although<00:00:30.220> care<00:00:30.460> should<00:00:30.669> be<00:00:30.699> taken<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:32.230> other

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
although care should be taken the other

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.930 
although care should be taken the other
thing<00:00:32.560> is<00:00:32.680> that<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.950> body<00:00:33.160> is<00:00:33.400> generally

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
thing is that the body is generally

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.060 
thing is that the body is generally
round<00:00:34.510> which<00:00:34.990> means<00:00:35.290> it's<00:00:35.530> a<00:00:35.590> little<00:00:35.710> bit<00:00:35.920> more

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
round which means it's a little bit more

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.069 
round which means it's a little bit more
comfortable<00:00:36.490> to<00:00:36.760> use<00:00:37.030> over<00:00:37.360> long<00:00:37.540> periods<00:00:37.990> of

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
comfortable to use over long periods of

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.050 
comfortable to use over long periods of
time<00:00:38.350> it<00:00:39.040> cuts<00:00:39.310> cardboard<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.920> all<00:00:42.100> sorts<00:00:42.550> very

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
time it cuts cardboard of all sorts very

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.300 
time it cuts cardboard of all sorts very
very<00:00:43.300> easily<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:43.930> very<00:00:44.560> comfortably<00:00:45.040> and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
very easily and very comfortably and

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.670 
very easily and very comfortably and
even<00:00:45.910> manages<00:00:46.330> to<00:00:46.450> cut<00:00:46.660> foam<00:00:46.930> although<00:00:47.500> you'll

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
even manages to cut foam although you'll

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.930 
even manages to cut foam although you'll
probably<00:00:47.830> find<00:00:48.100> you<00:00:48.340> need<00:00:48.490> to<00:00:48.610> do<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:48.760> little

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
probably find you need to do a little

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.000 
probably find you need to do a little
sawing<00:00:49.570> motion<00:00:50.110> to<00:00:50.290> get<00:00:50.440> through<00:00:50.680> it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
sawing motion to get through it

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.470 
sawing motion to get through it
but<00:00:51.970> a<00:00:52.180> very<00:00:52.450> good<00:00:52.630> all-rounder<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.520> as<00:00:54.910> I<00:00:55.270> said

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
but a very good all-rounder so as I said

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.210 
but a very good all-rounder so as I said
the<00:00:55.600> equivalent<00:00:55.990> blade<00:00:56.200> in<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.500> scalpel<00:00:57.010> is

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
the equivalent blade in the scalpel is

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.600 
the equivalent blade in the scalpel is
the<00:00:57.610> 10a<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:59.710> I<00:00:59.830> said<00:01:00.010> it's<00:01:00.220> a<00:01:00.280> little<00:01:00.460> bit

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
the 10a and as I said it's a little bit

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.480 
the 10a and as I said it's a little bit
more<00:01:00.820> bendy<00:01:01.270> but<00:01:02.200> pretty<00:01:02.560> much<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:02.950> same<00:01:03.130> job

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
more bendy but pretty much the same job

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.580 
more bendy but pretty much the same job
the<00:01:04.030> only<00:01:04.210> thing<00:01:04.360> you'll<00:01:04.510> notice<00:01:04.689> is<00:01:04.989> that<00:01:05.049> the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
the only thing you'll notice is that the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.310 
the only thing you'll notice is that the
top<00:01:06.430> of<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.850> handle<00:01:07.330> is<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.630> little<00:01:08.049> bit<00:01:08.140> more

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
top of the handle is a little bit more

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.320 
top of the handle is a little bit more
comfortable<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:09.100> use<00:01:09.280> over<00:01:09.640> time<00:01:09.850> as<00:01:10.119> it's

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
comfortable to use over time as it's

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.630 
comfortable to use over time as it's
quite<00:01:10.570> thin<00:01:10.840> but<00:01:11.620> pretty<00:01:12.010> much<00:01:12.070> performs

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
quite thin but pretty much performs

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.570 
quite thin but pretty much performs
exactly<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.300> same<00:01:13.890> again<00:01:14.890> one<00:01:15.160> of<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.340> things

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
exactly the same again one of the things

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.770 
exactly the same again one of the things
you<00:01:15.730> notice<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.360> if<00:01:16.450> you're<00:01:16.570> cutting

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
you notice is that if you're cutting

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.470 
you notice is that if you're cutting
things<00:01:17.080> quite<00:01:17.350> deeply<00:01:17.800> this<00:01:18.550> area<00:01:19.000> tends<00:01:19.270> to

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
things quite deeply this area tends to

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.330 
things quite deeply this area tends to
get<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.660> little<00:01:19.870> bit<00:01:20.110> stuck<00:01:20.410> in<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.770> material

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
get a little bit stuck in the material

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.720 
get a little bit stuck in the material
and<00:01:21.460> can<00:01:21.790> impede<00:01:22.150> your<00:01:22.360> cutting<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.890> if<00:01:24.250> we

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
and can impede your cutting so if we

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.390 
and can impede your cutting so if we
look<00:01:24.880> at<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.090> number<00:01:25.360> 11<00:01:25.750> blade<00:01:26.230> on<00:01:26.560> exactly

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
look at the number 11 blade on exactly

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.399 
look at the number 11 blade on exactly
the<00:01:27.520> same<00:01:27.700> handle<00:01:28.150> we<00:01:28.690> find<00:01:28.930> that<00:01:29.050> we've<00:01:29.200> got<00:01:29.380> a

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
the same handle we find that we've got a

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.290 
the same handle we find that we've got a
little<00:01:29.650> bit<00:01:29.770> more<00:01:29.800> ability<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.370> cut<00:01:30.760> deeper

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
little bit more ability to cut deeper

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.070 
little bit more ability to cut deeper
things<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:34.120> so<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.390> does<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.570> quite<00:01:34.900> a<00:01:34.930> bit

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
things and so it does it quite a bit

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.440 
things and so it does it quite a bit
better<00:01:35.460> however<00:01:36.460> one<00:01:36.700> thing<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:37.030> notice<00:01:37.210> about

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
better however one thing to notice about

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.420 
better however one thing to notice about
the<00:01:37.690> number<00:01:37.960> 11<00:01:38.290> blade<00:01:38.470> is<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:38.950> it's<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.220> lot

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
the number 11 blade is that it's a lot

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.240 
the number 11 blade is that it's a lot
thinner<00:01:39.760> which<00:01:40.720> means<00:01:41.050> it<00:01:41.680> becomes<00:01:42.040> quite

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
thinner which means it becomes quite

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.610 
thinner which means it becomes quite
bendy<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:43.390> indeed<00:01:43.690> this<00:01:43.870> can<00:01:44.050> be<00:01:44.170> quite<00:01:44.320> risky

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
bendy and indeed this can be quite risky

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.170 
bendy and indeed this can be quite risky
if<00:01:44.920> you<00:01:45.040> apply<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.370> lot<00:01:45.610> of<00:01:45.670> pressure

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
if you apply a lot of pressure

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.090 
if you apply a lot of pressure
it<00:01:46.360> is<00:01:46.570> liable<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.080> break<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:47.710> ping<00:01:47.950> off

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
it is liable to break and ping off

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.050 
it is liable to break and ping off
possibly<00:01:48.850> into<00:01:49.060> your<00:01:49.180> eyes<00:01:49.330> so<00:01:49.780> wear<00:01:49.960> goggles

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
possibly into your eyes so wear goggles

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.289 
possibly into your eyes so wear goggles
however<00:01:52.060> if<00:01:52.330> we<00:01:52.870> take<00:01:53.080> a<00:01:53.350> number<00:01:54.100> 10<00:01:54.490> which<00:01:55.150> is

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
however if we take a number 10 which is

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.440 
however if we take a number 10 which is
a<00:01:55.330> curved<00:01:55.659> blade<00:01:56.020> on<00:01:56.290> just<00:01:57.280> for<00:01:57.430> example<00:01:57.909> sake

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
a curved blade on just for example sake

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.469 
a curved blade on just for example sake
and<00:01:58.540> number<00:01:58.870> for<00:01:59.080> handle<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.909> really<00:02:01.360> isn't

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
and number for handle this really isn't

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.030 
and number for handle this really isn't
particularly<00:02:01.990> good<00:02:02.200> at<00:02:02.440> cutting<00:02:02.620> straight

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
particularly good at cutting straight

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.460 
particularly good at cutting straight
lines<00:02:03.340> in<00:02:03.760> that<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.030> blade<00:02:04.299> if<00:02:04.630> you're<00:02:05.260> ever

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
lines in that the blade if you're ever

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.170 
lines in that the blade if you're ever
so<00:02:05.680> slightly<00:02:05.950> out<00:02:06.190> it'll<00:02:06.520> follow<00:02:06.940> the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
so slightly out it'll follow the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.630 
so slightly out it'll follow the
direction<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.019> give<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.590> curve<00:02:08.920> now<00:02:09.519> of

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
direction and give you a curve now of

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.910 
direction and give you a curve now of
course<00:02:09.789> if<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.090> want<00:02:10.299> the<00:02:10.450> curve<00:02:10.659> and<00:02:11.560> this<00:02:11.739> is

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
course if you want the curve and this is

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.500 
course if you want the curve and this is
the<00:02:12.099> ideal<00:02:12.430> tool<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.269> you<00:02:13.360> can

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the ideal tool and that you can

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.739 
the ideal tool and that you can
exaggerate<00:02:13.810> these<00:02:14.290> things<00:02:15.150> again<00:02:16.150> as<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.689> said

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:16.749 
exaggerate these things again as I said

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.629 
exaggerate these things again as I said
four<00:02:17.139> straight<00:02:17.379> lines<00:02:17.590> really<00:02:18.040> not<00:02:18.279> the<00:02:18.400> best

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:18.639 
four straight lines really not the best

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.550 
four straight lines really not the best
but<00:02:19.450> foam<00:02:19.810> the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
but foam the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.220 
but foam the
is<00:02:20.620> perfect<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.520> can<00:02:21.670> cut<00:02:21.849> through

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
is perfect and that you can cut through

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.680 
is perfect and that you can cut through
very<00:02:23.230> very<00:02:23.290> cleanly<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.950> very<00:02:24.190> quickly<00:02:24.690> so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
very very cleanly and very quickly so

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.809 
very very cleanly and very quickly so
the<00:02:26.260> simple<00:02:26.590> thing<00:02:26.739> would<00:02:26.890> be<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.250> remember<00:02:27.400> is

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
the simple thing would be to remember is

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.880 
the simple thing would be to remember is
straight<00:02:28.510> lines<00:02:28.810> use<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.319> straight<00:02:29.650> blade

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
straight lines use a straight blade

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.600 
straight lines use a straight blade
curved<00:02:30.849> lines<00:02:31.090> use<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.810> curved<00:02:32.110> blade<00:02:32.610> simple

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
curved lines use a curved blade simple

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.990 
curved lines use a curved blade simple
as<00:02:33.700> that

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
as that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.170 
as that
and<00:02:34.090> take<00:02:34.510> care<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.840> wear<00:02:34.959> goggles
