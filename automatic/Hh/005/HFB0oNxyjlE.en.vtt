00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
computers in the internet now I mean

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.060 
computers in the internet now I mean
think<00:00:39.629> about<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.899> you're<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.710> conference

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070

starts drawing on a whiteboard to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.549 
starts drawing on a whiteboard to
explain<00:00:44.489> an<00:00:44.640> idea<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.660> course<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.289> can't

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
explain an idea but of course you can't

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.180 
explain an idea but of course you can't
see<00:00:46.739> anything

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
see anything

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.639 
see anything
it's<00:00:47.850> pretty<00:00:48.120> frustrating<00:00:48.329> they<00:00:49.320> might<00:00:49.500> take

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
it's pretty frustrating they might take

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.279 
it's pretty frustrating they might take
a<00:00:49.710> picture<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.640> email<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
a picture and email it to you but it

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.810 
a picture and email it to you but it
won't<00:00:52.410> make<00:00:52.500> much<00:00:52.559> sense<00:00:52.980> out<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.219> context

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
won't make much sense out of context

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.880 
won't make much sense out of context
right<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> missed<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> whole<00:00:55.140> point<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
right so you missed the whole point of

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.229 
right so you missed the whole point of
being<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> meeting<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.000> can't

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
being in the meeting because you can't

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.349 
being in the meeting because you can't
see<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> board<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:58.789> what<00:00:59.789> about<00:00:59.879> when<00:01:00.030> you're

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.299 
see the board or what about when you're
in<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:01.020> important<00:01:01.469> meeting<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.890> you

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
want to explain that brilliant idea you

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.690 
want to explain that brilliant idea you
draw<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.170> your<00:01:04.320> whiteboard<00:01:04.530> last<00:01:04.949> week<00:01:05.189> but

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
draw on your whiteboard last week but

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.840 
draw on your whiteboard last week but
you<00:01:05.820> can't<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.600> remember<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.049> details

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
you can't really remember the details

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.100 
you can't really remember the details
these<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.330> couple<00:01:09.360> problems<00:01:09.900> with

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
these are just a couple problems with

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.690 
these are just a couple problems with
not<00:01:10.409> being<00:01:10.619> connected<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:11.159> whiteboards

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
not being connected to your whiteboards

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.719 
not being connected to your whiteboards
plus<00:01:12.540> thinking<00:01:13.470> about<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.100> information

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
plus thinking about all the information

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.910 
plus thinking about all the information
that<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> erased<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.659> lost<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.080> every<00:01:16.470> cubicle

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that is erased and lost in every cubicle

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.820 
that is erased and lost in every cubicle
and<00:01:17.040> conference<00:01:17.460> room<00:01:17.610> every<00:01:18.299> day<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.680> when

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
and conference room every day and when

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.710 
and conference room every day and when
multiplied<00:01:20.369> over<00:01:20.610> an<00:01:20.970> entire<00:01:21.270> organization

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
multiplied over an entire organization

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.679 
multiplied over an entire organization
this<00:01:22.650> translates<00:01:23.220> into<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.700> lot<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> lost

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
this translates into a lot of lost

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.289 
this translates into a lot of lost
intellectual<00:01:25.409> property<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.070> mean<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:27.000> I

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
intellectual property I mean if I

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.270 
intellectual property I mean if I
collected<00:01:27.810> all<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.290> lost<00:01:28.500> ideas<00:01:28.920> from<00:01:29.130> those

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
collected all the lost ideas from those

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.039 
collected all the lost ideas from those
whiteboards<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.970> could<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.540> started<00:01:30.780> like

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
whiteboards I could have started like

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.940 
whiteboards I could have started like
five<00:01:31.470> companies<00:01:31.829> by<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:32.420> anyway<00:01:33.710> Lou<00:01:34.710> IDIA

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
five companies by now anyway Lou IDIA

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.350 
five companies by now anyway Lou IDIA
came<00:01:35.189> up<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.579> awesome<00:01:35.759> solution

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
came up with this awesome solution

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.590 
came up with this awesome solution
called<00:01:36.780> EB<00:01:37.079> Mitch<00:01:37.400> basically<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.939> small<00:01:39.270> I

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
called EB Mitch basically it's a small I

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.590 
called EB Mitch basically it's a small I
mean<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:40.380> small<00:01:41.250> device<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.270> crazy

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
mean really small device with this crazy

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.510 
mean really small device with this crazy
cool<00:01:42.869> technology<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.979> tracks<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> position

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
cool technology that tracks the position

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.710 
cool technology that tracks the position
of<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:44.939> markers<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> board<00:01:46.549> so<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.540> put

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
of your markers on the board so you put

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.469 
of your markers on the board so you put
it<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:48.899> any<00:01:49.110> whiteboard<00:01:49.710> tabletop<00:01:50.549> glass<00:01:51.180> wall

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
it on any whiteboard tabletop glass wall

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.690 
it on any whiteboard tabletop glass wall
I<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.409> whatever<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.220> use<00:01:53.430> when<00:01:53.610> you

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
