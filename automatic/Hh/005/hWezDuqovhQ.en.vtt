 No 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.279
 a sd-card reader OK de 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:18.320
 Although we have a bit quietly tested in detail 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.829
 However, we have again costs compared to RTL the model 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.720
 110 ax 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.819
 Blanket I became beautiful 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.669
 the new Acer Aspire One has with critical different from m 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.669
 Actually, it was only with us 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.530
 4 a black finish has been used 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.110
 promptly played the 17 Opel also present until the segment the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.700
 Surface is feminine mirror Final loose stay hanging 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.530
 and that's a big day and Sixt 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.640
 he has been built while packing 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.580
 This 6-cell battery thus allows a battery life of up to six 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.400
 Hours round therefore reaches the level of Azov until 7 9 and 1 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.010
 that's Nicolas Almagro an alternative, especially as it looks like 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.480
 otherwise all properties remain pretty much the same 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.050
 that is as a free man 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.200
 x 110 also has 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.560
 big and pleasant keyboard 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.120
 Unfortunately, a small touchpad continues to be the display with 800 9 inches 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.640
 Screen size is very bright 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.890
 outraged from this occupied mirror but can still be used in the club 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.820
 become 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.900
 inside there is an Intel Atom processor with 1 comes 6 gigahertz 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.340
 that's enough for office and internet tasks completely 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.140
 according to the list, that's Euronics' 110 guests 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.490
 In comparison to the remaining models very much costs 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.780
 it's the most expensive model in here with us 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.920
 the suggested retail price is 54 Euro 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.100
 the model 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.200
 the fire around 150 g XIV 160-gigabyte hard drive some model 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.540
 from 399 euros 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.170
 also note that the model from 110 gags is not a normal hard drive with 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.140
 160 gigabytes of capacity contains only one SSD flash disk module with twelve 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.259
 Gigabyte capacity 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:23.099
 from that is - sixth installed accordingly takes 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.709
 a lot of space way 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.359
 You should therefore be careful with the installation of programs 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.599
 so that you have enough memory to work on 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.480
 For on the go it is the Bioland its the 10 security 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.159
 most interesting solution 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:42.249
 Among them I sat at and models simply because of the long battery life 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:47.769
 and is therefore particularly suitable for 1 personal travel companion 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.129
 besides the memory is too little which can incidentally here also is bullshit 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.329
 People 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.599
 cheap is to buy the cards too is the HCK who is preparing and 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.400
 they are then automatically added to the disk space 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.109
 the complete review first as a baron 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.259
 you can already visit our website 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:11.959
 moved and popliteal d 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.639
 and he counts up box 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.400
 to be for the Austria and is often
