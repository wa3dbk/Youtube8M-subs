 since it's raining at sao paulo during 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.159
 match between sao paulo and palmeiras but 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.520
 police 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.530
 on the other hand, the reaction of the policewomen 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.700
 it's a little bit sometimes they have some 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.520
 luck sometimes much less 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.630

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.100
 happening have also advanced from the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.930
 technique it allows to discover 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.700

 member of his team except that all good 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.780

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.170
 the seams of the balloon printed on his 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.170

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.170
 offered by the Michelin Guide 2011 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.460
 out yesterday and who awarded one of these 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.490
 prestigious stars a restaurant 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.840
 called the beings in Seine-Maritime 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.410
 rewards a specially his cooking at 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.230
 taste of the day 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.360
 except that this restaurant has closed since 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.710
 to be up to date it is no longer 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.210
 so much fault to the lack of 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.830
 attendance would have had to go out on 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.900
 guide a little earlier a it would have 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.130
 helped the restorer is a small 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.450
 thought to those who read the guide 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.020
 michelin and who are going to be a little bit 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.020
 disappointed anyway 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:34.060
 the home already means because there is 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:36.300
 no one who came to notice in the 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.150
 guide had marked rustic badens 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.750
 super rustic are not missed 1 without 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.750

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.020
 there you have done for today and 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.460
 I think it's been a long time since we 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:56.020

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.510

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.510
 go
