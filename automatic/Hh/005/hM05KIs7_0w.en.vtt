was some discrepancy yes it happened a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.600 
was some discrepancy yes it happened a
few<00:01:43.020> tense<00:01:43.500> moments<00:01:43.650> while<00:01:44.160> they<00:01:44.280> debated

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
over the result but I think it's fair to

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.700 
over the result but I think it's fair to
say<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.700> final<00:01:48.000> final<00:01:48.690> result<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.590> all

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
say the final final result we can all

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.980 
say the final final result we can all
agree<00:01:49.830> it<00:01:50.040> was<00:01:50.160> the<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:52.759> I<00:01:53.759> assume<00:01:54.390> but

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.960 
agree it was the right one I assume but
