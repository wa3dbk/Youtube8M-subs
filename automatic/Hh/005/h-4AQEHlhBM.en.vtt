00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.990
 Halli hello people here is the pink 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.260
 panther 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:12.750
 yes and I test times grid 2 and the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.039
 The first thing that strikes you immediately is that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.609
 graphic when the paint on the car 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.410
 metallic or which is by painting 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.900
 then that's really epic the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.720
 whole reflections and so on the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.050
 are really great 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.180
 also the detail on the track 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.340
 pages is not bad either 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.579
 So at the speed to what extent 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.719
 the whole is then displayed in detail 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.780
 and runs reasonably smoothly 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.000
 Respectfully, we come to the division 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.100
 what is it for a game now? 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.350
 rather an act or rather a 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.170
 simulation game so I am the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.809
 opinion you can not do it right 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.629
 it's not cold but also divide 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.070
 no simulation but if then enough 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.390
 it rather in the acad direction rhine 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.869
 I just miss a little more 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.200
 feeling for the car really drifting 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.240
 is not the case in the game so it 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.680
 It is incredibly difficult to dare 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.900
 to get into the grip maybe 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.780
 it changes later when you do 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.430
 but I get other cars 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.500
 promised a bit more 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:32.820
 actually grip troja actually drift 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:36.180
 jan origin is somewhere but I'm missing 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.509
 there a bit so we have here now 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.119
 that is a live disconnect that is 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.040
 also that the distance during the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.159
 That's why you changed 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.110
 left and no mini map is located there 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.659
 usually one and you can 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.960
 stop to see how the track in 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.180
 further continues with this mode is 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.670
 that's not the case the route 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.399
 changes constantly then missing then 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.860
 here very clearly the cockpit view that 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.080
 So if I switch that through, that means 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.250
 sitting in the cockpit and the steering wheel 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.020
 see 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.180
 that does not exist that I find very much 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:21.450
 too bad it is absolutely not 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.140
 simulation game to the other that 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.310
 damage model is actually 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.900
 Enough is enough 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.480
 Here you can see for example the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.750
 paint I have a new extra 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.430
 varnishing chosen how changed the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.090
 colors in the sun 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.180
 yes and that is really our top though 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.150
 the whole now really 100 percent 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.170
 It would run smoothly so you can 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.160
 do not complain 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.780
 but it's just down and that's what it is 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.880
 I really pity my pc would have that 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.650
 actually really create and also in 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.160
 highest resolution what that too 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.350
 is set but in spite of all that 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.739
 I'm so mini lex and that is synonymous 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.890
 not only with me so soli ground 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:15.989
 Noises are great, too 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:18.830
 So you can not complain if you 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.010
 then a beautiful sound system then has 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:27.350
 it growls pretty well 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:30.000
 and then you have the possibility 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.970
 Now you can also go back to painting 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.570
 of the completely self select 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.299
 however you want that you have 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.880
 the possibilities to choose the colors 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.350
 I have three times has the possibility 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.579
 So you can use three different colors 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.239
 on the car on how to select and 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:53.209
 accordingly you have then also 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:57.540
 this reflection then on the carriage 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.590
 yes you should buy this game 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.829
 Yes or no 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.540
 So I think it is not 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.720
 Folder makes you do not have to 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.510
 necessarily have sold out at the time 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.200
 if not necessarily the hyper now 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.540
 driver is and simulation games already 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.310
 then you can drive something like that 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.650
 to buy 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.250
 for people the simulations 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.979
 no, just do not buy that is nothing 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.719
 what to do with simulation you can 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.759
 do not hire the car now 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:33.250
 you somehow the suspension or 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.840
 pack different tire types on it 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.110
 could or such stories 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.000
 that will not do and therefore grip 2 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.199
 it is also very strong then 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.719
 direction arcade racing game detail 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:50.710
 Categories yes my question is natural 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:52.539
 Do you still want to play the game? 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.930
 a little bit more you have the 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:57.719
 possibility here the story mode too 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.169
 drive and play 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:04.419
 yes unlike grid 1 has now 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.889
 not too much changed yet 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:11.370
 So I have the first part already 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:14.469
 played and there I do all this 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.599
 then you could get online 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:19.750
 to gamble against each other means all the more 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:22.259
 longer you drift and a drift 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.839
 repeatedly higher 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:28.750
 then multiplies that so the 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:30.580
 points that you collect then I have the 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.969
 multiplayer also already tried 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.860
 but yes with the servers somehow that 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.990
 does not work so well me 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.710
 do not know if its own server 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.449
 or if you yourself then as a server 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.250
 if you then play such a game 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.409
 I have to hold still find out when he 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.120
 me not so much with the multiplayer 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.430
 have been busy so far only two three 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.990
 drove race and there it was really 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:58.750
 great licking the requirements well 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.580
 for the pc is also quite violent 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.339
 because of the graphics because everything is just fine 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.629
 game reflects the smoke of the there 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:08.939
 is developed and so on 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:11.409
 Of course that makes a lot of difference 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:13.270
 yes I'm curious if there is now 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.759
 something else changes what annoyed me 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.189
 at grit 1 it was very easy that the 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:21.219
 servers were shut down someday 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:22.810
 I thought that was really a pity 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:25.539
 I hope that's not exactly the case here 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.550
 happened because I just believe it 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.129
 that the game is not so rough now 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.229
 will sell 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:33.449
 and it has to be reckoned somewhere 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:36.119
 Keep these server names running 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.879
 and then when the lcs come out and 

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:40.409
 or the first dlc comes out and there 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:42.179
 then just not much is bought 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:44.550
 then we probably will 

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:46.580
 just as sometime set as it is 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:51.029
 other games are also common 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.499
 Therefore, as I said my tip if if 

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:54.719
 you wait a while and it will be 

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:57.119
 cheaper or so and you want to 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:59.610
 pastime heating eight katrin game 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:01.949
 who then may make you the like of 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:05.009
 create but it is not for now 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:07.769
 people again often have any 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.949
 You do not have to play a racing game 

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:12.269
 necessarily have 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:15.869
 ok please write only in the comments 

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:18.029
 how you liked this test and 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:20.279
 if then thumb up if 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:21.899
 not thumb down and if you are 

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:23.429
 wanting to see more of it is writing time 

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:24.319
 sometimes in the comments then I know 

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:26.969
 decision 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:29.269
 therefore, thank you very much 

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:32.509
 for watching home in it 

00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:32.509
