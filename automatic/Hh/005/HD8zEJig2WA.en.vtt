00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
that since the water can't blow me up it

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.790 
that since the water can't blow me up it
can<00:00:40.500> blow<00:00:40.860> up<00:00:40.890> my<00:00:41.460> face<00:00:41.790> um<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:43.079> I'm<00:00:43.379> gonna<00:00:43.530> try

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.510 

and<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:09.380> don't<00:04:09.530> like<00:04:09.830> that<00:04:09.860> change<00:04:10.280> at<00:04:10.430> all

and I don't like that change at all

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.360 
and I don't like that change at all
actually<00:04:10.790> I<00:04:11.209> just<00:04:12.050> want<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.500> green<00:04:12.800> and<00:04:13.069> blue

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
actually I just want the green and blue

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:21.550 
actually I just want the green and blue
to<00:04:13.550> switch<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:15.160> little<00:04:16.160> bit<00:04:20.049> are<00:04:21.049> we<00:04:21.200> trying<00:04:21.440> to

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
to switch a little bit are we trying to

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:41.780 
to switch a little bit are we trying to
go

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:49.970 

and<00:04:42.030> I<00:04:42.060> think<00:04:42.870> we<00:04:43.020> might<00:04:43.170> be<00:04:43.350> good<00:04:48.710> that's<00:04:49.710> not
