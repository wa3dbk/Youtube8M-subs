00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
wouldn't want to be holding it you know

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.150 
wouldn't want to be holding it you know
like<00:05:42.020> this<00:05:42.440> you<00:05:42.560> just<00:05:42.590> kind<00:05:42.919> of<00:05:42.950> want<00:05:43.130> to

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
like this you just kind of want to

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.070 
like this you just kind of want to
swivel<00:05:43.430> it<00:05:43.640> up<00:05:44.320> and<00:05:45.970> then<00:05:46.970> up<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:47.750> just<00:05:47.870> kind

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
swivel it up and then up and just kind

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.890 
swivel it up and then up and just kind
of<00:05:48.110> keep<00:05:48.350> it<00:05:48.560> on<00:05:48.800> a<00:05:49.160> fixed<00:05:49.940> axis<00:05:52.150> like<00:05:53.150> so<00:05:53.480> and

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
of keep it on a fixed axis like so and

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.450 
of keep it on a fixed axis like so and
then<00:05:54.530> it<00:05:54.620> will<00:05:54.710> have<00:05:54.890> an<00:05:55.070> easier<00:05:55.250> time

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
then it will have an easier time

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.340 
then it will have an easier time
stitching<00:05:56.120> things<00:05:56.330> together<00:05:56.510> obviously<00:05:57.140> when

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
stitching things together obviously when

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.990 
stitching things together obviously when
i'm<00:05:57.440> close<00:05:57.650> up<00:05:57.830> like<00:05:57.980> this<00:05:58.390> it's<00:05:59.390> not<00:05:59.600> going<00:06:00.020> to

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
i'm close up like this it's not going to

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.140 
i'm close up like this it's not going to
show<00:06:02.000> you<00:06:02.060> guys<00:06:02.210> really<00:06:03.250> the<00:06:04.250> great<00:06:04.520> example

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
show you guys really the great example

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.400 
show you guys really the great example
here<00:06:05.360> something<00:06:05.690> to<00:06:05.720> stitch<00:06:05.960> things<00:06:06.200> together

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
here something to stitch things together

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.640 
here something to stitch things together
very<00:06:06.740> well<00:06:06.860> but<00:06:07.960> you<00:06:08.960> guys<00:06:09.080> sort<00:06:09.350> of<00:06:09.470> get<00:06:09.560> the

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
very well but you guys sort of get the

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.250 
very well but you guys sort of get the
picture<00:06:09.980> here<00:06:10.010> as<00:06:10.310> we<00:06:10.460> build<00:06:10.730> this<00:06:11.000> picture<00:06:11.570> of

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
picture here as we build this picture of

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.780 
picture here as we build this picture of
how<00:06:12.470> photosphere<00:06:13.040> works<00:06:13.250> it's<00:06:13.460> going<00:06:13.610> to<00:06:13.669> look

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
how photosphere works it's going to look

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.900 
how photosphere works it's going to look
awful<00:06:14.330> because<00:06:14.480> i'm<00:06:14.690> so<00:06:14.900> close<00:06:15.110> to<00:06:15.230> everything

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
awful because i'm so close to everything

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.220 
awful because i'm so close to everything
and<00:06:16.910> because<00:06:17.270> i'm<00:06:17.390> moving<00:06:17.690> the<00:06:17.810> camera<00:06:18.050> around

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
and because i'm moving the camera around

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.480 
and because i'm moving the camera around
so<00:06:18.650> it's<00:06:18.770> not<00:06:18.890> going<00:06:19.010> to<00:06:19.100> stitch<00:06:19.280> things

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
so it's not going to stitch things

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.100 
so it's not going to stitch things
together<00:06:19.730> properly<00:06:22.120> but<00:06:23.120> we<00:06:23.300> can<00:06:23.419> go<00:06:23.540> directly

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
together properly but we can go directly

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.010 
together properly but we can go directly
into<00:06:24.200> the<00:06:24.410> gallery<00:06:24.620> and<00:06:25.070> the<00:06:25.100> gallery<00:06:25.640> is<00:06:26.020> see

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
into the gallery and the gallery is see

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.050 
into the gallery and the gallery is see
there's<00:06:27.230> one<00:06:27.320> that<00:06:27.620> i<00:06:27.650> took<00:06:27.740> you<00:06:28.700> guys<00:06:28.820> can

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
there's one that i took you guys can

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.300 
there's one that i took you guys can
kind<00:06:29.240> of<00:06:29.300> see<00:06:29.510> how<00:06:30.380> that<00:06:30.560> turned<00:06:30.800> out<00:06:30.950> so<00:06:31.160> that

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
kind of see how that turned out so that

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.400 
kind of see how that turned out so that
turned<00:06:31.490> out<00:06:31.580> pretty<00:06:31.730> good<00:06:31.970> and<00:06:32.210> that<00:06:33.200> one

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
turned out pretty good and that one

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.520 
turned out pretty good and that one
didn't<00:06:33.919> turn<00:06:33.950> out<00:06:34.070> so<00:06:34.190> well<00:06:35.110> but<00:06:36.110> it<00:06:36.229> does<00:06:36.350> take

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
didn't turn out so well but it does take

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.490 
didn't turn out so well but it does take
some<00:06:36.710> practice<00:06:36.770> and<00:06:37.900> the<00:06:38.900> more<00:06:39.080> you<00:06:39.110> do<00:06:39.320> it<00:06:39.350> the

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
some practice and the more you do it the

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.420 
some practice and the more you do it the
better<00:06:39.590> you'll<00:06:39.919> get

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
better you'll get

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.300 
better you'll get
it<00:06:40.780> okay<00:06:41.780> we<00:06:41.930> can<00:06:42.080> go<00:06:42.110> into<00:06:42.320> the<00:06:42.530> clock<00:06:42.800> app<00:06:43.100> and

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
it okay we can go into the clock app and

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.800 
it okay we can go into the clock app and
I'll<00:06:43.370> show<00:06:43.520> you<00:06:43.550> guys<00:06:43.760> some<00:06:44.090> new<00:06:44.240> features<00:06:44.420> of

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.020 
I'll show you guys some new features of
the<00:06:45.020> clock<00:06:45.230> at<00:06:45.470> of<00:06:45.710> course<00:06:46.160> the<00:06:46.340> UI<00:06:46.520> has<00:06:46.670> been

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
the clock at of course the UI has been

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.400 
the clock at of course the UI has been
totally<00:06:47.360> changed<00:06:47.690> here<00:06:47.840> it<00:06:47.930> looks<00:06:48.110> a<00:06:48.230> whole

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
totally changed here it looks a whole

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.380 
totally changed here it looks a whole
lot<00:06:48.470> better<00:06:48.860> you<00:06:49.010> can<00:06:49.250> set<00:06:49.460> some<00:06:49.640> alarms<00:06:49.760> here

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
lot better you can set some alarms here

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.080 
lot better you can set some alarms here
and<00:06:50.600> if<00:06:50.990> you<00:06:51.020> go<00:06:51.200> over<00:06:51.230> you<00:06:51.680> have<00:06:51.860> a<00:06:51.890> timer<00:06:52.310> as

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
and if you go over you have a timer as

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.050 
and if you go over you have a timer as
you<00:06:53.270> can<00:06:53.390> actually<00:06:54.190> do<00:06:55.190> like<00:06:55.370> let's<00:06:55.610> say<00:06:55.730> you

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
you can actually do like let's say you

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.640 
you can actually do like let's say you
know<00:06:56.150> five<00:06:56.360> seconds<00:06:56.840> and<00:06:56.930> you<00:06:57.020> can<00:06:57.140> start<00:06:57.380> and

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
know five seconds and you can start and

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:03.070 
know five seconds and you can start and
that<00:06:57.940> will<00:06:58.940> time<00:06:59.780> you<00:07:00.020> for<00:07:00.290> five<00:07:00.440> seconds<00:07:02.080> like

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
that will time you for five seconds like

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.800 
that will time you for five seconds like
so<00:07:03.320> and<00:07:03.650> then<00:07:03.880> be<00:07:04.880> very<00:07:05.120> annoying<00:07:05.360> whenever

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
so and then be very annoying whenever

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.750 
so and then be very annoying whenever
you're<00:07:06.020> five<00:07:06.170> seconds<00:07:06.500> is<00:07:06.620> up<00:07:06.800> of<00:07:07.430> course<00:07:07.670> you

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
you're five seconds is up of course you

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.620 
you're five seconds is up of course you
have<00:07:07.880> a<00:07:07.910> stopwatch<00:07:08.180> here<00:07:10.450> looks<00:07:11.450> pretty

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
have a stopwatch here looks pretty

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.880 
have a stopwatch here looks pretty
pretty<00:07:12.200> cool<00:07:12.610> so<00:07:13.610> if<00:07:13.700> we<00:07:13.760> go<00:07:13.880> into<00:07:14.030> settings

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890 
pretty cool so if we go into settings

pretty cool so if we go into settings
you'll<00:07:15.890> notice<00:07:16.190> that<00:07:16.220> there<00:07:16.760> are<00:07:16.940> no<00:07:17.180> options

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 
you'll notice that there are no options

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.800 
you'll notice that there are no options
to<00:07:18.380> add<00:07:18.410> extra<00:07:18.890> users<00:07:19.460> that<00:07:19.640> will<00:07:19.820> be<00:07:19.970> only<00:07:20.300> in

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810 
to add extra users that will be only in

to add extra users that will be only in
the<00:07:20.960> tablet<00:07:21.560> UI<00:07:22.490> so<00:07:22.970> with<00:07:23.360> your<00:07:23.480> nexus<00:07:23.780> 10<00:07:23.990> your

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:24.140 
the tablet UI so with your nexus 10 your

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.500 
the tablet UI so with your nexus 10 your
nexus<00:07:24.410> 7<00:07:24.650> you'll<00:07:24.770> be<00:07:24.860> able<00:07:24.950> to<00:07:25.160> add<00:07:25.510> users

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.510 
nexus 7 you'll be able to add users

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.020 
nexus 7 you'll be able to add users
multiple<00:07:27.440> users<00:07:27.770> for<00:07:28.040> the<00:07:28.100> device<00:07:28.550> but<00:07:28.850> that's

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.030 
multiple users for the device but that's

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.420 
multiple users for the device but that's
not<00:07:29.360> happening<00:07:29.900> on<00:07:30.140> the<00:07:30.350> phone<00:07:30.560> the<00:07:31.160> reason

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:31.430 
not happening on the phone the reason

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.530 
not happening on the phone the reason
for<00:07:31.580> that<00:07:31.610> as<00:07:31.850> most<00:07:32.000> people<00:07:32.210> don't<00:07:32.360> share
