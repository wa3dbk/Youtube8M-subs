one-on-one with that horse and just kind
of<00:01:20.819> persistence<00:01:21.420> because<00:01:21.899> it's<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.920> know

you're gonna have those ups and those
downs<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.190> have<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
downs and you know you just have to you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.160 
downs and you know you just have to you
have<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.970> go<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.209> it<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.450> every<00:01:27.720> time<00:01:27.929> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
have to go with it and every time you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.660 
have to go with it and every time you
knock<00:01:28.349> down<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.709> learn<00:01:28.830> something<00:01:29.099> else<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
knock down you learn something else and

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.490 
knock down you learn something else and
you<00:01:29.759> get<00:01:30.000> better<00:01:30.149> so<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> think<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:30.990> you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
you get better so I think that's you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.690 
you get better so I think that's you
know<00:01:31.530> those<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.069> of<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.190> main<00:01:32.429> things

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
know those are kind of the main things

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.050 
know those are kind of the main things
oh<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:34.860> think<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.220> combination<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
oh I think it's a combination of a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.660 
oh I think it's a combination of a
number<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.450> things<00:01:36.660> I<00:01:36.899> mean<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.140> think<00:01:37.580> you<00:01:38.580> have

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
number of things I mean I think you have

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.300 
number of things I mean I think you have
to<00:01:38.759> be<00:01:38.849> athletic<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.989> to<00:01:40.080> be

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
to be athletic you have to be

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.440 
to be athletic you have to be
ambidextrous<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.489> think<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.179> be<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
ambidextrous I think to really be a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.880 
ambidextrous I think to really be a
really<00:01:42.840> really<00:01:42.989> good<00:01:43.140> rider<00:01:43.440> because<00:01:43.709> you

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
really really good rider because you

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.589 
really really good rider because you
have<00:01:44.069> to<00:01:44.190> be<00:01:44.280> able<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> mimic<00:01:44.729> everything

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:45.599 
have to be able to mimic everything

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.050 
have to be able to mimic everything
exactly<00:01:46.110> left<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.739> right<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.220> can't<00:01:47.910> be

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
exactly left and right and you can't be

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.990 
exactly left and right and you can't be
so<00:01:48.330> dominant<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.989> one<00:01:49.200> side<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.920> ride<00:01:50.520> all<00:01:50.849> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so dominant on one side and ride all the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.969 
so dominant on one side and ride all the
movements<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:51.509> your<00:01:51.690> dominant<00:01:52.110> side<00:01:52.259> then

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
movements from your dominant side then

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.680 
movements from your dominant side then
just<00:01:53.369> never<00:01:53.550> looks<00:01:53.759> balanced<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.300> if<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.509> have

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
just never looks balanced so if you have

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.339 
just never looks balanced so if you have
you<00:01:55.440> know<00:01:55.560> some<00:01:55.920> degree<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.759> ambidexterity

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
you know some degree of ambidexterity

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.070 
you know some degree of ambidexterity
then<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:59.160> is<00:01:59.489> really<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.209> a<00:02:00.239> plus<00:02:00.539> on<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
then that is really is a plus on the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.199 
then that is really is a plus on the
right<00:02:01.229> hand<00:02:01.380> side<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:02.610> then<00:02:02.789> I<00:02:02.819> think<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
right hand side and then I think you

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:05.990 
right hand side and then I think you
have<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.660> a<00:02:03.860> certain<00:02:04.860> natural<00:02:05.369> calmness

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
have to have a certain natural calmness

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.300 
have to have a certain natural calmness
so<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:06.780> don't<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.800> that<00:02:07.950> doesn't<00:02:08.250> go

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
so that you don't that that doesn't go

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.830 
so that you don't that that doesn't go
into<00:02:08.489> your<00:02:08.640> horse<00:02:08.789> if<00:02:09.030> you're<00:02:09.179> nervous<00:02:09.660> all

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
into your horse if you're nervous all

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.440 
into your horse if you're nervous all
the<00:02:09.869> time<00:02:10.050> or<00:02:10.440> you're<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.590> high-strung<00:02:11.450> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
the time or you're a high-strung and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.880 
the time or you're a high-strung and
then<00:02:12.660> after<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.260> just<00:02:13.440> have<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.860> a

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
then after that you just have to be a

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.720 
then after that you just have to be a
quick<00:02:14.520> thinker<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.450> slow<00:02:15.890> reactor<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.520> that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
quick thinker and a slow reactor so that

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.420 
quick thinker and a slow reactor so that
you<00:02:17.880> can<00:02:18.060> problem<00:02:18.450> solve<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.990> ring<00:02:19.430> when

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
you can problem solve in the ring when

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.740 
you can problem solve in the ring when
you<00:02:20.520> feel<00:02:20.730> something's<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.300> wrong<00:02:21.510> you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
you feel something's going wrong you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.180 
you feel something's going wrong you
make<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.350> decision<00:02:22.800> quickly

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
make a decision quickly

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.670 
make a decision quickly
but<00:02:23.850> then<00:02:24.000> your<00:02:24.120> body<00:02:24.330> reacts<00:02:24.720> slowly<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.650> that

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
but then your body reacts slowly so that

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.730 
but then your body reacts slowly so that
then<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.760> can<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.750> can<00:02:27.780> make<00:02:27.930> sure<00:02:28.320> that<00:02:28.650> you

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
then you can you can make sure that you

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.380 
then you can you can make sure that you
don't<00:02:28.890> surprise<00:02:29.460> your<00:02:29.640> horse<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.000> then<00:02:30.150> you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
don't surprise your horse and then you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.010 
don't surprise your horse and then you
get<00:02:30.540> more<00:02:30.720> attention<00:02:30.810> from<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:32.340> athletic

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
get more attention from that so athletic

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.810 
get more attention from that so athletic
yeah<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.080> quick<00:02:34.380> thinker<00:02:34.800> slow<00:02:35.070> reactor

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
yeah a quick thinker slow reactor

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.700 
yeah a quick thinker slow reactor
yeah<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.600> ambidextrous<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.380> think<00:02:37.590> would

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
yeah and ambidextrous I think would

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.440 
yeah and ambidextrous I think would
would<00:02:37.980> be<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.580> three<00:02:38.820> big<00:02:39.000> things<00:02:39.210> for

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
would be that the three big things for

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.610 
would be that the three big things for
me<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:41.030> think<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.810> what<00:02:43.020> makes<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.380> writer

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
me I think that what makes it writer

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.180 
me I think that what makes it writer
successful<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.520> not<00:02:45.000> only<00:02:45.930> working<00:02:46.650> hard<00:02:46.980> and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
successful is not only working hard and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.430 
successful is not only working hard and
of<00:02:47.370> course<00:02:47.640> going<00:02:48.600> out<00:02:48.780> there<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.080> doing<00:02:49.290> good

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
of course going out there and doing good

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.230 
of course going out there and doing good
in<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.680> ring<00:02:49.860> but<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.460> think<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.940> the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
in the ring but I think the the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.030 
in the ring but I think the the
motivation<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.110> keep<00:02:52.260> working<00:02:52.500> hard<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:52.890> to

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
motivation to keep working hard and to

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.550 
motivation to keep working hard and to
keep<00:02:53.220> moving<00:02:53.460> forward<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.750> do<00:02:55.200> not<00:02:55.380> look

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
keep moving forward and to do not look

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.080 
keep moving forward and to do not look
back<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.220> those<00:02:56.310> little<00:02:56.580> hiccups<00:02:56.730> you

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
back one of those little hiccups you

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.640 
back one of those little hiccups you

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
rider I think is what makes him special

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.020 
rider I think is what makes him special
him<00:03:10.950> or<00:03:11.070> her<00:03:11.160> special<00:03:12.920> consistency

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
him or her special consistency

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.140 
him or her special consistency
consistency<00:03:15.050> in<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:17.280> person<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
consistency in the person that the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.590 
consistency in the person that the
personality<00:03:18.630> stays<00:03:19.320> even<00:03:20.070> they<00:03:21.060> don't<00:03:21.270> over

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
personality stays even they don't over

personality stays even they don't over
react<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.220> situations<00:03:23.220> with<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.420> horses

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
react to situations with the horses

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.310 
react to situations with the horses
maybe<00:03:25.230> not<00:03:25.470> responding<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.190> right<00:03:26.370> way

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
maybe not responding the right way

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
that you try to deal with it and I think

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.979 
that you try to deal with it and I think
a<00:03:34.440> good<00:03:34.620> rider<00:03:34.890> will<00:03:35.600> overcome<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.810> highs<00:03:36.959> and

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
a good rider will overcome the highs and

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.460 
a good rider will overcome the highs and
the<00:03:37.230> lows<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.739> will<00:03:38.610> be<00:03:38.760> staying<00:03:39.030> in<00:03:39.989> his

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
the lows and will be staying in his

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.699 
the lows and will be staying in his
positive<00:03:40.950> attitude<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.910> try<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.320> move<00:03:43.320> on<00:03:43.560> or

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
positive attitude and try to move on or

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.940 
positive attitude and try to move on or
a<00:03:43.739> walk<00:03:43.980> up<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.459> next<00:03:44.670> level<00:03:44.760> again<00:03:45.270> I

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
a walk up to the next level again I

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.770 
a walk up to the next level again I
think<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.160> successful<00:03:47.550> dressage<00:03:48.209> rider<00:03:48.510> is

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
think a successful dressage rider is

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.780 
think a successful dressage rider is
someone<00:03:49.320> who<00:03:49.709> is<00:03:49.739> willing<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.459> really<00:03:50.670> work

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
someone who is willing to really work

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.490 
someone who is willing to really work
hard<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.570> think<00:03:51.690> there<00:03:51.930> are<00:03:52.019> people<00:03:52.140> who<00:03:52.320> are

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
hard I think there are people who are

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.560 
hard I think there are people who are
definitely<00:03:52.709> more<00:03:53.040> naturally<00:03:53.760> talented<00:03:53.970> than

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
definitely more naturally talented than

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.570 
definitely more naturally talented than
