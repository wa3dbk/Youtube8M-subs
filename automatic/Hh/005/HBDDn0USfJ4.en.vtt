will demonstrate on this house how to do
square<00:00:25.980> footage<00:00:26.400> calculation<00:00:27.300> here<00:00:28.260> in

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
square footage calculation here in

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.999 
square footage calculation here in
Sketchup<00:00:29.269> so<00:00:30.269> say<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.380> designed<00:00:31.859> this

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
Sketchup so say that you designed this

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.569 
Sketchup so say that you designed this
house<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.899> you<00:00:33.899> want<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.590> calculate<00:00:35.130> that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
house and you want to calculate that

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.250 
house and you want to calculate that
square<00:00:35.940> footage<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.690> haven't<00:00:36.960> done<00:00:37.020> your

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
square footage and you haven't done your

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.400 
square footage and you haven't done your
calculations<00:00:38.040> all<00:00:38.280> along<00:00:39.020> here's<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> quick

way to do so alright so you got your
model<00:00:43.980> right<00:00:44.219> now<00:00:45.350> make<00:00:46.350> sure<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
model right now make sure that the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.990 
model right now make sure that the
coloring<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.890> something<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.550> for

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
coloring is something you can see for

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.090 
coloring is something you can see for
right<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.780> see<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.289> can't<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.710> that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
right now you can see you can't see that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.779 
right now you can see you can't see that
coloring<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.800> know<00:00:55.800> I'm<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.250> gonna<00:00:56.399> change

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
coloring so I know I'm just gonna change

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:06.070 
coloring so I know I'm just gonna change
that<00:00:57.090> color

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.220

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
okay so now you see that the color is

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:16.480 
okay so now you see that the color is
something<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:09.980> can<00:01:10.190> you<00:01:10.550> can<00:01:10.730> see<00:01:13.660> so<00:01:15.490> then

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
something you can you can see so then

when then after that you would think
about<00:01:18.820> well<00:01:19.820> what<00:01:20.060> how<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.290> square

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
about well what how is the square

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.010 
about well what how is the square
footage<00:01:21.790> calculated<00:01:22.790> well<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:23.630> know<00:01:23.780> that

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
footage calculated well you know that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.470 
footage calculated well you know that
any<00:01:24.500> heated<00:01:25.130> square<00:01:25.670> footage<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:26.390> know

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
any heated square footage you know

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.890

have to exclude the garage and the porch
also<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:00.680> little<00:02:00.890> little<00:02:01.250> screened<00:02:02.000> area

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
also this little little screened area

also this little little screened area
here<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:02.870> can't<00:02:03.140> use<00:02:03.440> either<00:02:03.830> so<00:02:04.310> for<00:02:05.210> now<00:02:05.330> we

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
here you can't use either so for now we

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.160 
here you can't use either so for now we
will<00:02:07.570> for<00:02:08.570> now<00:02:08.720> we<00:02:08.780> will<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.290> know<00:02:09.440> just<00:02:11.170> close

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
will for now we will you know just close

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.600 
will for now we will you know just close
that<00:02:12.470> off<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:16.550> can<00:02:16.760> just<00:02:16.790> erase<00:02:18.280> nope<00:02:19.280> that

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
that off you can just erase nope that

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.449 
that off you can just erase nope that
didn't

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:37.910 

all<00:02:24.000> right<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.510> pretty<00:02:24.989> much<00:02:26.180> you've<00:02:27.180> got<00:02:27.450> that

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.490 

and<00:02:38.430> then<00:02:38.550> draw<00:02:38.880> off<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.240> garage<00:02:39.500> now

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
and then draw off the garage now

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.140 
and then draw off the garage now
something<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.250> came<00:02:41.490> out<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.910> pretty

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
something that came out is pretty

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.770 
something that came out is pretty
peculiar<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.080> learned<00:02:44.360> since<00:02:45.360> seven

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
peculiar that I learned since seven

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.610 
peculiar that I learned since seven
years<00:02:45.990> ago<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.590> CAD<00:02:46.860> class<00:02:47.310> that

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
years ago in a CAD class that

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.230 
years ago in a CAD class that
calculating<00:02:49.620> square<00:02:50.010> footage<00:02:50.490> you<00:02:50.730> actually

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
calculating square footage you actually

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.120 
calculating square footage you actually
calculate<00:02:51.450> from<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.080> exterior<00:02:52.770> wall<00:02:55.130> into

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
calculate from the exterior wall into

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.520 
calculate from the exterior wall into
the<00:02:56.370> N<00:02:56.490> word<00:02:56.700> because<00:02:57.600> at<00:02:57.810> first<00:02:58.050> people<00:02:58.260> would

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
the N word because at first people would

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.020 
the N word because at first people would
think<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.100> know<00:02:59.220> you'd<00:02:59.370> go<00:02:59.520> from<00:02:59.730> room

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
think that you know you'd go from room

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.410 
think that you know you'd go from room
to<00:03:00.330> room<00:03:00.360> or<00:03:01.100> inside<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.310> interior<00:03:02.820> exterior

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
to room or inside the interior exterior

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.840 
to room or inside the interior exterior
walls<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.440> know<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.830> calculate<00:03:05.370> your<00:03:05.520> square

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
walls you know to calculate your square

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.150 
walls you know to calculate your square
footage<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:06.530> learned<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.740> was<00:03:07.830> actually

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
footage I learned that it was actually

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.449 
footage I learned that it was actually
the<00:03:08.280> perimeter<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.120> house<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:11.190> it's<00:03:11.310> from

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
the perimeter of the house so it's from

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.220 
the perimeter of the house so it's from
the<00:03:11.580> outside<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:13.050> we<00:03:13.200> will<00:03:13.380> do<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.740> right<00:03:13.770> now

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
the outside so we will do that right now

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.170 
the outside so we will do that right now
so<00:03:16.230> right<00:03:16.260> now<00:03:16.650> we<00:03:16.709> have<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:17.340> know<00:03:17.489> we<00:03:17.670> closed

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
so right now we have you know we closed

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.490 
so right now we have you know we closed
off<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.920> this<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.550> this<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.989> what<00:03:22.170> we<00:03:22.290> want

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
off this this and this and what we want

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.500 
off this this and this and what we want
to<00:03:22.590> do<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:22.920> we<00:03:23.070> just<00:03:23.190> want<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.520> draw<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:23.850> shape

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.110 

then<00:03:27.510> we<00:03:27.600> go<00:03:27.750> from<00:03:27.959> corner<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.380> corner<00:03:29.120> some

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
then we go from corner to corner some

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.820 
then we go from corner to corner some
people<00:03:30.390> will<00:03:30.480> do<00:03:30.600> rectangles<00:03:31.320> but<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.650> just

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
people will do rectangles but it just

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.790 
people will do rectangles but it just
depends<00:03:32.250> on<00:03:32.430> how<00:03:32.489> many<00:03:33.200> how<00:03:34.200> many<00:03:34.380> corners

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
depends on how many how many corners

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.560 
depends on how many how many corners
you're<00:03:35.100> building<00:03:35.550> cameras<00:03:38.209> there's<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.300> few

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
you're building cameras there's a few

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.070 
you're building cameras there's a few
corners<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.140> know<00:03:40.170> rectangles<00:03:40.920> fine<00:03:41.810> but<00:03:42.810> I

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
corners you know rectangles fine but I

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.930 
corners you know rectangles fine but I
mean<00:03:43.380> if<00:03:43.530> there's<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.799> lot<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.160> corners<00:03:44.519> then

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
mean if there's a lot of corners then

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.170 
mean if there's a lot of corners then
you<00:03:45.420> probably<00:03:45.660> want<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.530> use<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.980> know<00:03:47.180> the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
you probably want to use you know the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.650 
you probably want to use you know the
line<00:03:48.390> tool<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.810> what<00:03:49.110> I'm<00:03:49.320> doing<00:03:49.590> right<00:03:49.769> now

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.850 

you<00:03:54.660> keep<00:03:54.870> doing<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.260> until<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.709> get<00:03:55.799> a

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
you keep doing that until you get a

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:05.199 
you keep doing that until you get a
shape<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:59.700> can<00:03:59.850> move<00:04:00.060> your<00:04:00.239> dwell<00:04:00.570> it

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.209 

all<00:04:05.689> right<00:04:05.900> so<00:04:06.170> it<00:04:06.260> looks<00:04:06.439> like<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:06.709> didn't<00:04:07.010> make

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:07.219 
all right so it looks like I didn't make

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:11.470 
all right so it looks like I didn't make
a<00:04:07.250> closed<00:04:07.700> figure<00:04:09.640> just<00:04:10.640> you<00:04:10.790> know<00:04:10.909> close<00:04:11.239> it

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
a closed figure just you know close it

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.689 
a closed figure just you know close it
off<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:11.989> there's<00:04:12.769> your<00:04:12.950> close<00:04:13.189> Traverse<00:04:15.699> and

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
off and there's your close Traverse and

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.960 
off and there's your close Traverse and
what<00:04:16.910> you'll<00:04:17.090> see<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.750> you'll<00:04:18.199> have<00:04:18.530> this<00:04:18.970> so

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
what you'll see is you'll have this so

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.480 
what you'll see is you'll have this so
easy<00:04:20.269> you're<00:04:20.630> right<00:04:20.840> click<00:04:21.139> on<00:04:22.009> it

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
easy you're right click on it

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.570 
easy you're right click on it
then<00:04:23.479> you<00:04:23.690> go<00:04:23.870> all<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.410> way<00:04:24.440> down<00:04:24.770> to<00:04:25.310> where<00:04:25.490> it

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
then you go all the way down to where it

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.650 
then you go all the way down to where it
says<00:04:25.729> area<00:04:26.500> just<00:04:27.500> say<00:04:27.680> selection<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.759> there

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
says area just say selection and there

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.390 
says area just say selection and there
you<00:04:29.810> have<00:04:30.020> it<00:04:30.259> that's<00:04:30.710> your<00:04:31.009> square<00:04:31.370> footage

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
you have it that's your square footage

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.590 
you have it that's your square footage
for<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.180> Builder<00:04:33.580> this<00:04:34.580> one<00:04:34.820> here<00:04:35.060> is<00:04:35.300> not

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
for the Builder this one here is not

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.050 
for the Builder this one here is not
quite<00:04:36.500> 2,000<00:04:37.370> square<00:04:37.550> feet<00:04:39.669> but<00:04:40.669> as<00:04:40.789> you<00:04:40.940> can

quite 2,000 square feet but as you can

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.420 
quite 2,000 square feet but as you can
see<00:04:41.330> it's<00:04:41.539> area<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:42.139> doesn't<00:04:42.710> include<00:04:42.889> any

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430
