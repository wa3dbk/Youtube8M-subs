these<00:00:07.799> once<00:00:08.429> before<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.510> found<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.870> video

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
these once before and I found the video

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.709 
these once before and I found the video
to<00:00:10.200> be<00:00:10.230> pretty<00:00:10.620> poorly<00:00:10.920> made<00:00:11.420> as<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.570> was<00:00:12.690> a

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
to be pretty poorly made as it was a

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.720 
to be pretty poorly made as it was a
little<00:00:12.809> bit<00:00:13.019> dark<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.620> not<00:00:13.769> really<00:00:14.040> an<00:00:14.160> HD<00:00:14.580> and

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
little bit dark and not really an HD and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
I didn't do much of a demo I think so

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.580 
I didn't do much of a demo I think so
I'm<00:00:16.800> doing<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.279> better<00:00:17.400> one<00:00:17.609> today<00:00:17.850> hopefully<00:00:18.590> I

good<00:00:28.560> use<00:00:29.119> quick<00:00:30.119> specs<00:00:30.390> 50<00:00:30.900> watts<00:00:31.109> RMS<00:00:31.590> I

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
good use quick specs 50 watts RMS I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.920 
good use quick specs 50 watts RMS I
believe<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.279> tower<00:00:32.430> impedance<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.000> 8<00:00:33.180> ohms<00:00:33.450> the

tweeter with a 5 inch mid-range driver I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.420 
tweeter with a 5 inch mid-range driver I
could<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.640> wrong<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> correct

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
could be wrong if you have the correct

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.380 
could be wrong if you have the correct
dimensions<00:00:41.430> please<00:00:41.730> let<00:00:41.940> me<00:00:42.000> know<00:00:42.120> I'd<00:00:42.270> be

put them in description and all that and
yeah<00:00:47.850> well<00:00:48.180> not<00:00:48.360> much<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.110> said<00:00:49.289> just

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
yeah well not much like I said just

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.619

we're<00:00:49.920> doing<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> video<00:00:50.309> today<00:00:50.430> more<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.329> demo

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
we're doing a video today more of a demo

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.000 
we're doing a video today more of a demo
then<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.289> guess<00:00:52.469> review<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:54.620> we<00:00:55.620> took<00:00:55.739> off<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
then I guess review so we took off the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.799 
then I guess review so we took off the
grills<00:00:56.250> as<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.640> see<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.059> because<00:00:57.449> I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
grills as you can see it's because I

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.510 
grills as you can see it's because I
didn't<00:00:58.469> want<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.680> show<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> process<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.399> doing

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
didn't want to show the process of doing

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.090 
didn't want to show the process of doing
that<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.910> pretty<00:01:00.449> complicated<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:01.530> me<00:01:01.680> that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
that is pretty complicated for me that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.759 
that is pretty complicated for me that
is<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:03.149> way<00:01:03.270> they<00:01:03.480> designed<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.559> guess

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
is the way they designed it and I guess

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.990 
is the way they designed it and I guess
they<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:04.949> didn't<00:01:05.339> want<00:01:05.519> them<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.820> taken

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
they just didn't want them to be taken

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
they just didn't want them to be taken
off<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.510> they're<00:01:07.439> removable<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.580> ever<00:01:08.700> do

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
off but they're removable if you ever do

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.300 
off but they're removable if you ever do
get<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.060> pair<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.390> these<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.560> anyways<00:01:10.920> moving
