00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.260 

now<00:00:03.689> one<00:00:03.929> error<00:00:04.859> that<00:00:05.279> many<00:00:05.580> students<00:00:06.120> have

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
now one error that many students have

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.290 
now one error that many students have
made<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.309> they<00:00:08.309> make<00:00:08.519> their<00:00:08.790> drawings

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
made is that they make their drawings

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.570 
made is that they make their drawings
and<00:00:09.920> first<00:00:10.920> angle<00:00:11.400> rather<00:00:12.090> than<00:00:12.480> third<00:00:12.840> angle

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
and first angle rather than third angle

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.359 
and first angle rather than third angle
so<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.059> demo<00:00:15.330> here<00:00:15.839> I'll<00:00:16.170> quickly<00:00:16.949> show

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
so in this demo here I'll quickly show

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.870 
so in this demo here I'll quickly show
you<00:00:17.400> how<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.300> change<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.990> drawing<00:00:19.260> from<00:00:19.880> first

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
you how to change a drawing from first

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.259 
you how to change a drawing from first
angle<00:00:21.300> view<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.900> third<00:00:22.109> angle<00:00:22.470> view<00:00:23.119> this<00:00:24.119> is

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
angle view to third angle view this is

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.349 
angle view to third angle view this is
the<00:00:24.359> part<00:00:24.630> I'll<00:00:24.990> make<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> drawing<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.430> can

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
the part I'll make a drawing of you can

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.200 
the part I'll make a drawing of you can
see<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.779> just<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.320> l<00:00:29.130> bracket<00:00:29.580> here<00:00:32.180> with<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
see it's just a l bracket here with a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.380 
see it's just a l bracket here with a
slot<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.960> one<00:00:34.230> side<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.890> two<00:00:35.520> holes<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
slot in one side and two holes on the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.799 
slot in one side and two holes on the
other<00:00:36.420> side<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> bracket<00:00:38.510> so<00:00:39.510> I'll<00:00:39.600> click

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
other side of the bracket so I'll click

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.180 
other side of the bracket so I'll click
on<00:00:39.960> new<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:41.070> I'll<00:00:41.160> make<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> new<00:00:41.610> drawing<00:00:46.190> so

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
on new and I'll make a new drawing so

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:56.270 
on new and I'll make a new drawing so
I'll<00:00:47.250> choose<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.730> bracket

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:13.350 

and<00:00:56.850> I'll<00:00:57.420> put<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:59.719> two<00:01:04.610> three<00:01:05.610> views

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.060 

now<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.420> make<00:01:14.720> this<00:01:14.900> a<00:01:14.960> bit<00:01:15.200> more<00:01:15.230> clear

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
now to make this a bit more clear

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.000 
now to make this a bit more clear
I'll<00:01:16.850> take<00:01:17.300> these<00:01:17.510> views<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:20.020> I'll<00:01:21.020> display

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
I'll take these views and I'll display

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.310 
I'll take these views and I'll display
hidden<00:01:22.250> feature<00:01:22.670> lines<00:01:23.060> as<00:01:23.510> dashed<00:01:24.290> lines<00:01:26.320> so

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
hidden feature lines as dashed lines so

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.120 
hidden feature lines as dashed lines so
I'll<00:01:27.410> zoom<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:27.860> here<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:30.650> can<00:01:30.800> see<00:01:30.980> the

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
I'll zoom in here and you can see the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.160 
I'll zoom in here and you can see the
three<00:01:31.370> views<00:01:31.930> now<00:01:32.930> by<00:01:33.230> default<00:01:33.830> with<00:01:34.610> the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
three views now by default with the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.470 
three views now by default with the
educational<00:01:36.170> version<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.680> SolidWorks<00:01:37.480> which

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
educational version of SolidWorks which

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.000 
educational version of SolidWorks which
is<00:01:38.720> what<00:01:39.350> I<00:01:39.380> have<00:01:39.680> here<00:01:40.010> same<00:01:40.760> version<00:01:41.210> in<00:01:41.390> the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
is what I have here same version in the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.180 
is what I have here same version in the
computer<00:01:43.010> labs<00:01:43.780> your<00:01:44.780> views<00:01:45.380> come<00:01:45.740> in<00:01:45.920> in

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
computer labs your views come in in

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.100 
computer labs your views come in in
first<00:01:46.940> angle<00:01:48.520> now<00:01:49.520> we<00:01:49.580> don't<00:01:49.880> use<00:01:50.180> first<00:01:50.600> angle

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
first angle now we don't use first angle

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.040 
first angle now we don't use first angle
here<00:01:51.770> in<00:01:51.890> North<00:01:52.100> America<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.660> we<00:01:53.810> want

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
here in North America and so we want

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.370 
here in North America and so we want
this<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.230> be<00:01:54.410> in<00:01:54.590> third<00:01:54.860> angle<00:01:59.020> what<00:02:00.020> I'll<00:02:00.170> do

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
this to be in third angle what I'll do

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:08.770 
this to be in third angle what I'll do
is<00:02:01.690> I'll<00:02:02.690> right<00:02:03.350> click<00:02:03.380> on<00:02:04.570> sheet1<00:02:07.540> click<00:02:08.540> on

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
first angle and third angle let's look

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.880 
first angle and third angle let's look
at<00:03:26.290> how<00:03:26.440> they<00:03:26.650> change<00:03:29.520> this<00:03:30.520> is<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.790> bracket

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
at how they change this is the bracket

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.280 
at how they change this is the bracket
projected<00:03:32.890> in<00:03:33.040> first<00:03:33.400> angle<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.140> the
