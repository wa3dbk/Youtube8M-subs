going back to the b cell development we

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
begin with a progenitor lymphoid cell

begin with a progenitor lymphoid cell
which<00:00:45.420> through<00:00:46.410> somatic<00:00:47.039> recombination<00:00:47.480> also

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
that binds to a specific antigen but

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.580 
that binds to a specific antigen but
this<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> itself<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> very<00:00:57.210> simple<00:00:57.780> diagram

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
this in itself is a very simple diagram

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.860 
this in itself is a very simple diagram
it's<00:00:59.460> actually<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> bit<00:00:59.940> more<00:00:59.969> complicated<00:01:00.750> in

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
it's actually a bit more complicated in

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.130 
it's actually a bit more complicated in
that<00:01:01.399> first<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.879> progenitor<00:01:03.300> lymphoid<00:01:03.840> cell

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
that first the progenitor lymphoid cell

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.390 
that first the progenitor lymphoid cell
can<00:01:04.710> become<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.970> predator<00:01:06.689> T<00:01:06.990> cell<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:08.280> this

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
can become a predator T cell or in this

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.859 
can become a predator T cell or in this
case<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.939> we're<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.210> looking<00:01:09.540> at<00:01:09.720> is

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
case what we're actually looking at is

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.570 
case what we're actually looking at is
that<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.260> progenitor<00:01:10.619> lymphoid<00:01:11.100> cell<00:01:11.340> can

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
that the progenitor lymphoid cell can

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.090 
that the progenitor lymphoid cell can
become<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.880> progenitor<00:01:12.299> B<00:01:12.659> cell<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.170> once<00:01:13.950> it

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
become a progenitor B cell and once it

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.679 
become a progenitor B cell and once it
becomes<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.460> prisoner<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> B<00:01:15.060> cell<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> will<00:01:15.540> go

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
becomes a prisoner to B cell it will go

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.749 
becomes a prisoner to B cell it will go
through<00:01:16.229> somatic<00:01:16.710> recombination<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
through somatic recombination of the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.609 
through somatic recombination of the
heavy<00:01:18.000> chain<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.960> there's<00:01:19.110> heavy<00:01:19.350> chain

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
heavy chain so there's heavy chain

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.670 
heavy chain so there's heavy chain
rearrangement<00:01:20.280> typically<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.630> progenitor<00:01:22.320> V

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
rearrangement typically the progenitor V

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.490 
rearrangement typically the progenitor V
cell<00:01:22.890> will<00:01:23.130> make<00:01:23.369> an<00:01:23.520> immunoglobulin<00:01:24.150> M

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
cell will make an immunoglobulin M

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.710 
cell will make an immunoglobulin M
antibody<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.430> pre<00:01:26.670> progenitor<00:01:27.509> visa

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
antibody and so this pre progenitor visa

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.590 
antibody and so this pre progenitor visa
will<00:01:27.990> become<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.500> precursor<00:01:29.400> B<00:01:29.610> cell<00:01:29.939> after

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
will become a precursor B cell after

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.960 
will become a precursor B cell after
somatic<00:01:30.990> recombination<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.680> heavy<00:01:31.890> chain

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
somatic recombination of the heavy chain

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.819 
somatic recombination of the heavy chain
when<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> becomes<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.479> precursor<00:01:33.840> B<00:01:34.049> salt<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
when it becomes a precursor B salt the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.580 
when it becomes a precursor B salt the
precursor<00:01:35.400> B<00:01:35.430> cell<00:01:35.790> will<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.119> undergo

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
precursor B cell will then undergo

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.050 
precursor B cell will then undergo
another<00:01:37.590> somatic<00:01:38.100> recombination<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.909> this

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
another somatic recombination but this

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.210 
another somatic recombination but this
time<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.659> light<00:01:39.869> chain<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.710> light<00:01:40.950> chains

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
time of the light chain so light chains

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.880 
time of the light chain so light chains
rearrangement<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.090> become<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.049> immature<00:01:43.680> B

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
rearrangement to become a immature B

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
rearrangement to become a immature B
cell<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.780> are<00:01:45.869> two

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
cell so as you can see there are two

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.620 
cell so as you can see there are two
somatic<00:01:46.619> recombination<00:01:46.860> occurring<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:48.390> in

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
somatic recombination occurring one in

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.649 
somatic recombination occurring one in
the<00:01:49.409> heavy<00:01:49.649> chain<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.189> two<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.450> light

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the heavy chain and two in the light

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.319 
the heavy chain and two in the light
chain<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.890> let's<00:01:53.070> go<00:01:53.220> back<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.700> where<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
chain so let's go back to where the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.690 
chain so let's go back to where the
progenitor<00:01:54.720> B<00:01:55.079> cell<00:01:55.320> will<00:01:55.710> undergo<00:01:56.009> its<00:01:56.399> first

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
progenitor B cell will undergo its first

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.330 
progenitor B cell will undergo its first
somatic<00:01:57.060> recombination<00:01:57.829> so<00:01:58.829> here<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.219> have

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
somatic recombination so here we have

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.670 
somatic recombination so here we have
the<00:01:59.430> DNA<00:01:59.670> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.180> germline<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.170> germline<00:02:01.469> DNA

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
the DNA of the germline so germline DNA

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.399 
the DNA of the germline so germline DNA

there are many B segments many D

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.640 
there are many B segments many D
segments<00:02:38.670> we<00:02:38.760> need<00:02:38.910> J<00:02:39.630> segments<00:02:40.140> but<00:02:40.530> we're

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.930 
process here so in the heavy chain gene
we<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.080> leader<00:02:46.380> segment<00:02:46.860> we<00:02:47.430> have<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.670> V

segment known as the variable region so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.830

the J segment the joining segment and we

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.360 
the J segment the joining segment and we

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
have the constant region on the heavy

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.729 
have the constant region on the heavy

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
chain gene the constant region is known

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.250 
chain gene the constant region is known
as<00:03:04.980> constant<00:03:05.580> mu<00:03:06.090> which<00:03:06.720> will<00:03:06.900> essentially

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
as constant mu which will essentially

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.910 
as constant mu which will essentially
make<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:08.040> antibody<00:03:08.670> for<00:03:08.910> immunoglobin<00:03:09.569> m<00:03:09.920> and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
make the antibody for immunoglobin m and

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.410 
make the antibody for immunoglobin m and
now<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.420> DNA<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:15.390> DNA

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
now this is in the DNA and the DNA

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.160 
now this is in the DNA and the DNA
contains<00:03:16.290> introns<00:03:16.860> obviously<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.720> point<00:03:19.019> to

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
contains introns obviously so a point to

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.930 
contains introns obviously so a point to
make<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.250> J<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.480> C<00:03:22.290> region<00:03:22.799> are<00:03:22.980> in

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
make is that the J and C region are in

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.300 
make is that the J and C region are in
close<00:03:24.239> proximity

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
close proximity

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.120 
close proximity
however<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:27.180> variable<00:03:27.750> region<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.260> the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
however the variable region and the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.460 
however the variable region and the
diversity<00:03:29.730> region<00:03:30.060> are<00:03:30.180> far<00:03:30.570> away<00:03:30.840> from<00:03:31.320> each

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
diversity region are far away from each

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.039 
diversity region are far away from each
other<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.910> first<00:03:33.120> process<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.720> occurs

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
other so the first process that occurs

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.270 
other so the first process that occurs
is<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:35.070> we<00:03:35.220> have<00:03:35.489> J<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.660> D<00:03:37.130> recombination<00:03:38.130> in

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
is that we have J and D recombination in

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.150 
is that we have J and D recombination in
the<00:03:38.640> heavy<00:03:38.850> chain<00:03:39.090> J<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.079> D<00:03:40.140> recombination<00:03:40.980> is

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
the heavy chain J and D recombination is

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.789 
the heavy chain J and D recombination is
where<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.610> J<00:03:41.910> will<00:03:42.360> bind<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.989> D<00:03:43.200> region<00:03:43.620> at

the D segment to bring C in close
proximity<00:03:48.650> next<00:03:49.650> we<00:03:49.829> have<00:03:50.010> vdj<00:03:50.940> recombination

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
proximity next we have vdj recombination

chain<00:04:11.880> consists<00:04:12.359> of<00:04:12.420> four<00:04:12.630> constant<00:04:13.079> regions

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
chain consists of four constant regions

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.140 
chain consists of four constant regions
following<00:04:16.260> vdj<00:04:16.890> recombination<00:04:17.220> this<00:04:18.000> will

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
following vdj recombination this will

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.960 
following vdj recombination this will
actually<00:04:18.479> produce<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:19.280> transcribe<00:04:20.280> for<00:04:20.459> an<00:04:20.549> RNA

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
actually produce a transcribe for an RNA

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.850 
actually produce a transcribe for an RNA
so<00:04:21.299> this<00:04:21.479> whole<00:04:23.090> sequence<00:04:24.090> now<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.690> VD<00:04:25.289> j<00:04:25.590> and

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
so this whole sequence now of VD j and

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.920 
so this whole sequence now of VD j and
constant<00:04:26.490> is<00:04:26.640> an<00:04:26.760> RNA

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
constant is an RNA

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.840 
constant is an RNA
and<00:04:28.020> because<00:04:28.410> it's<00:04:28.530> an<00:04:28.620> RNA<00:04:28.800> we<00:04:29.520> still<00:04:29.729> have

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
and because it's an RNA we still have

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.330 
and because it's an RNA we still have
introns<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.509> from<00:04:30.870> splicing<00:04:31.560> this<00:04:32.130> will

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
introns and from splicing this will

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.640 
introns and from splicing this will
remove<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:32.970> introns<00:04:33.570> within<00:04:34.500> this

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
remove the introns within this

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.129 
remove the introns within this
particular<00:04:34.919> gene<00:04:35.639> and<00:04:35.850> then<00:04:36.720> once<00:04:36.930> the

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
particular gene and then once the

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.409 
particular gene and then once the
introns<00:04:37.470> are<00:04:37.560> removed<00:04:37.620> it<00:04:38.370> will<00:04:38.430> become<00:04:38.759> mRNA

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
introns are removed it will become mRNA

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.870 
introns are removed it will become mRNA
which<00:04:39.870> will<00:04:40.050> then<00:04:40.199> make<00:04:40.590> protein<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.400> now

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
which will then make protein and now

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.840 
which will then make protein and now
this<00:04:42.479> is<00:04:42.690> essentially<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.380> protein<00:04:43.860> for<00:04:44.460> the

essentially this IgM antibody we find in
this<00:05:02.970> immature<00:05:03.389> B<00:05:03.539> cell<00:05:03.750> but<00:05:04.530> how<00:05:04.770> about<00:05:04.979> the

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
this immature B cell but how about the

this immature B cell but how about the
light<00:05:05.820> chains<00:05:06.180> because<00:05:06.509> we<00:05:06.570> don't<00:05:06.720> have<00:05:06.810> the

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
light chains because we don't have the

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.890 
light chains because we don't have the
light<00:05:07.080> chains<00:05:07.410> in<00:05:07.560> well<00:05:08.660> after<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.780> heavy

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
light chains in well after the heavy

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.830 
light chains in well after the heavy
chain<00:05:10.289> recombination<00:05:11.250> has<00:05:11.880> occurred<00:05:12.210> we<00:05:12.509> get

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
chain recombination has occurred we get

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.439 
chain recombination has occurred we get
a<00:05:12.870> precursor<00:05:13.289> B<00:05:13.500> cell<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:14.009> in<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.550> precursor

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
a precursor B cell and in the precursor

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.930 
a precursor B cell and in the precursor
B<00:05:15.479> so<00:05:15.810> we<00:05:16.229> have<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.410> gene<00:05:16.800> for<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.460> light<00:05:17.639> chain

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
B so we have a gene for the light chain

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.330 
B so we have a gene for the light chain
and<00:05:18.150> so<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:18.900> light<00:05:19.080> chain<00:05:19.349> gene<00:05:19.590> can<00:05:20.039> undergo

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
and so the light chain gene can undergo

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.550 
and so the light chain gene can undergo
somatic<00:05:20.880> recombination<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.720> J

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
somatic recombination the J

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.879 
somatic recombination the J
recombination<00:05:24.020> so<00:05:25.020> in<00:05:25.139> the<00:05:25.199> precursor<00:05:25.590> B<00:05:25.710> cell

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
recombination so in the precursor B cell

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.560 
recombination so in the precursor B cell
we<00:05:26.039> have<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.280> light<00:05:26.460> chain<00:05:26.699> gene<00:05:26.940> now<00:05:27.509> the

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
we have the light chain gene now the

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.360 
we have the light chain gene now the
light<00:05:27.750> chain<00:05:28.020> gene<00:05:28.259> is<00:05:28.410> different<00:05:29.099> to<00:05:29.280> the

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
light chain gene is different to the

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.010 
light chain gene is different to the
heavy<00:05:29.550> chain<00:05:29.820> gene<00:05:29.849> in<00:05:30.210> that<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:30.810> light

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
heavy chain gene in that the light

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.969 
heavy chain gene in that the light
changing<00:05:31.500> does<00:05:31.740> not<00:05:32.099> contain<00:05:32.940> ad<00:05:33.599> region<00:05:34.470> so

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
changing does not contain ad region so

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.439 
changing does not contain ad region so
we<00:05:35.099> still<00:05:35.310> have<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:35.550> variable<00:05:35.970> segment<00:05:36.330> the

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
we still have the variable segment the

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.600 
we still have the variable segment the
joining<00:05:36.780> region<00:05:37.110> segment<00:05:37.560> and<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:38.070> constant

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
joining region segment and the constant

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.730 
joining region segment and the constant
segment<00:05:38.940> but<00:05:39.780> we<00:05:39.930> don't<00:05:40.169> have<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.409> diversity

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.370 
segment but we don't have the diversity
segments<00:05:41.310> we<00:05:41.729> of<00:05:42.240> course<00:05:42.449> have<00:05:42.630> introns<00:05:43.169> in

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
segments we of course have introns in

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.100 
segments we of course have introns in
this<00:05:43.530> gene<00:05:43.740> because<00:05:44.039> it's<00:05:44.190> the<00:05:44.310> DNA<00:05:44.490> and

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
this gene because it's the DNA and

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.379 
this gene because it's the DNA and
remember<00:05:46.110> we<00:05:46.710> still<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.699> same<00:05:47.909> the<00:05:48.090> joining

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
remember we still the same the joining

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.460 
remember we still the same the joining

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.420 
close proximity but the variable region
is<00:05:51.449> far<00:05:51.630> away<00:05:51.750> now<00:05:52.470> what<00:05:52.590> first<00:05:52.830> happens<00:05:53.159> is<00:05:53.280> we

is far away now what first happens is we

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.730 
is far away now what first happens is we

transcribed to make RNA which we have
here<00:06:04.699> with<00:06:05.699> a<00:06:05.729> poly<00:06:05.970> or<00:06:06.060> a<00:06:06.120> tail<00:06:06.389> now<00:06:07.110> this<00:06:07.500> RNA

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
here with a poly or a tail now this RNA

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.339 
here with a poly or a tail now this RNA
with<00:06:08.280> the<00:06:08.460> V<00:06:08.669> and<00:06:08.909> J<00:06:09.180> bound<00:06:09.479> together<00:06:09.900> and<00:06:10.169> thus

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
with the V and J bound together and thus

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.350 
with the V and J bound together and thus
seen<00:06:10.590> close<00:06:10.830> proximity<00:06:11.220> will<00:06:11.580> then<00:06:11.729> undergo

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
seen close proximity will then undergo

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.020 
seen close proximity will then undergo
splicing<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.590> removal<00:06:14.250> of<00:06:14.430> the<00:06:14.550> introns

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
splicing the removal of the introns

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.450 
splicing the removal of the introns
simple<00:06:15.599> enough<00:06:15.810> and<00:06:16.020> so<00:06:16.740> now<00:06:16.919> we<00:06:16.979> are<00:06:17.310> left

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
simple enough and so now we are left

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.480 
simple enough and so now we are left
with<00:06:17.729> an<00:06:17.849> mRNA<00:06:18.419> with<00:06:19.050> the<00:06:19.349> Leader<00:06:19.680> V<00:06:20.340> J<00:06:21.000> and<00:06:21.240> C

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
with an mRNA with the Leader V J and C

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.850 
with an mRNA with the Leader V J and C
regions<00:06:23.690> which<00:06:24.690> will<00:06:24.810> essentially<00:06:25.110> make<00:06:25.590> the

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
regions which will essentially make the

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.189 
regions which will essentially make the
protein<00:06:26.280> and<00:06:26.400> so<00:06:27.090> have<00:06:27.240> we've<00:06:27.419> seen<00:06:27.750> the<00:06:28.020> light

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
protein and so have we've seen the light

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:30.950 
protein and so have we've seen the light
chain<00:06:28.530> gene<00:06:28.800> has<00:06:29.250> made<00:06:29.580> a<00:06:29.820> light<00:06:30.509> chain

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
chain gene has made a light chain

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.749 
chain gene has made a light chain
protein<00:06:31.470> which<00:06:31.770> will<00:06:31.919> make<00:06:32.130> the<00:06:32.340> this

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 
protein which will make the this

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.029 
protein which will make the this
particular<00:06:33.180> antibody<00:06:33.840> so<00:06:34.470> the<00:06:34.590> light<00:06:34.740> chain

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
particular antibody so the light chain

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.440 
particular antibody so the light chain
fits<00:06:35.759> this<00:06:36.450> antibody<00:06:37.139> V<00:06:37.830> and<00:06:38.099> C<00:06:38.460> regions<00:06:38.880> with

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.450 
fits this antibody V and C regions with

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.890 
fits this antibody V and C regions with
the<00:06:39.570> joining<00:06:39.810> region<00:06:40.229> here

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
the joining region here

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.930 
the joining region here
now<00:06:42.900> as<00:06:43.139> I've<00:06:43.350> mentioned<00:06:43.530> we<00:06:44.370> add<00:06:44.520> we<00:06:44.760> don't

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
now as I've mentioned we add we don't

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.420 
now as I've mentioned we add we don't
only<00:06:45.180> have<00:06:45.300> one<00:06:45.840> variable<00:06:46.350> region<00:06:46.830> in<00:06:47.010> even<00:06:47.310> in

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
only have one variable region in even in

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.189 
only have one variable region in even in
the<00:06:47.550> light<00:06:47.730> chain<00:06:48.030> one<00:06:48.389> joining<00:06:48.780> region<00:06:49.110> or

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
the light chain one joining region or

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.560 
the light chain one joining region or
one<00:06:49.320> constant<00:06:49.860> region<00:06:50.100> there<00:06:50.940> is<00:06:51.120> actually

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
one constant region there is actually

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.650 
one constant region there is actually
many<00:06:52.229> B<00:06:52.680> region's<00:06:53.070> many<00:06:53.520> joining<00:06:54.300> regions

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
many B region's many joining regions

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.219 
many B region's many joining regions
many

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
many

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.040 
many
diversity<00:06:55.979> regions<00:06:56.370> and<00:06:56.520> so<00:06:57.030> all<00:06:57.240> this<00:06:57.540> mixing

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
diversity regions and so all this mixing

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.070 
diversity regions and so all this mixing
up<00:06:58.229> between<00:06:58.560> the<00:06:58.740> V<00:06:58.949> D<00:06:59.460> and<00:06:59.699> J<00:07:00.210> will<00:07:00.660> make<00:07:00.930> a

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
up between the V D and J will make a

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.980 
up between the V D and J will make a
unique<00:07:01.650> antibody<00:07:02.400> not<00:07:03.000> only<00:07:03.360> that<00:07:03.600> during

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
unique antibody not only that during

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.900 
unique antibody not only that during
somatic<00:07:04.350> recombination<00:07:04.590> new<00:07:05.280> nucleotides

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
somatic recombination new nucleotides

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.370 
somatic recombination new nucleotides
can<00:07:06.000> also<00:07:06.240> be<00:07:06.419> added<00:07:06.720> to<00:07:06.840> increase<00:07:07.229> the

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
can also be added to increase the

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.200 
can also be added to increase the
diversity<00:07:08.010> and<00:07:08.160> specificity<00:07:08.910> of<00:07:08.940> these
