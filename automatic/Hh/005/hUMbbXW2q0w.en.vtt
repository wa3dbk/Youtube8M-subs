00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.270
 Here it comes to show by this Nistos 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.280
 to show you that this reproduction 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.530
 compliant allows for conservation of 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.350
 genotype then I take back my cell 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.240
 initial mother with three chromosomes 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.840
 different so two formulas 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.620
 chromosome n equals i'm going there 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.239
 locate genes and each gene will have 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.090
 a version given a version to the eic 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.780
 so here for example I'm going to have the 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.249
 embarrassment to 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.260
 and the version with the eic complexion I 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:44.239
 know very well that you are 2 chromatic 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.070
 sisters are exactly the same 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.499
 have maybe watch the video on the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.569
 replication is therefore logical on this 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:53.059
 chromatic that carries the information 

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:56.569
 great at his hours chromatics at 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.850
 mandatory no information big steps 

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:00.350
 I take another chromosome so 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.300
 necessarily there are other genes 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.540
 carried by this chromosome let's imagine by 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.790
 example gmb and then this little chromosome 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.810
 this hussian look will carry the information 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.790
 b1 so I loved big b 1 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.500
 and as I just explained them 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.530
 two traumatized tensor I have good and 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.780
 well and then finally another chromozone 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.860
 which contains other genes and there I 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.869
 will put or hazard on this blockade 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.240
 the information the gnc who is going to have 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.110
 information allelic aversion his 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:42.950
 price it's this mother cell so 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:44.299
 for genotype at b1 deleted here is 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.670
 the writing I put there typical of your 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.859
 mother cell she owns for each 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.450
 rom to ty for each chromosome of 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.960
 chromatic but it does not appear in 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.429
 genotypic writing in metaphase he 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.799
 there is no reason that things 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.439
 change so I have the information assures 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.679
 the big I have the information b1 on the 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.549
 small and I have the information 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:10.429
 these bonuses on the size chromosome 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.440
 average during the phase with 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.230
 disjunction of chromes atide 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.050
 and well the chromatic of the big 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.120
 chromosome climbs hall her sister 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.970
 migrate to the other pole always with 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.460
 information to the croma ty who 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.410
 included the chromatic of the small 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.810
 chromosomes that includes information from 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.730
 a name migrate to a pole 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.550
 chromatic sister migrate to each other 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.060
 pole and finally the chromatic portel 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.190
 information these premiums migrate to a 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.790
 pole his sister migrate to the other pole 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.320
 in the end I have two daughter cells 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:50.030
 one who has the information 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.680
 art b 1 these bonuses and the other oh well 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.330
 nothing surprising that possesses 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.480
 information to b1 these bonuses is so 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:06.080
 there you demonstrate that this cell girl 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:07.760
 to run genotype ab1 this premium this 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.420
 cell girl also for 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.840
 genetic information for genotype ab1 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.300
 his premiums 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.989
 in other words my mother cell was at b1 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.600
 these crimes 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.820
 she gives birth by mitosis to two 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.120
 girl cells strictly identical 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.860
 genetically ab1 these premiums to well these 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.040
 bonuses you just demonstrated that the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.459
 mitosis is a consistent reproduction of 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.459
 the cell
