00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.569
 I'm not going to record anything and the green background and 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.569
 point 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.560
 good good good for today for 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.770
 today because I said it 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.770
 for today 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:31.390
 and if you did not know every Tuesday to me 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.700
 Youtube channel not so good 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.680
 and is that these days, thanks, I've had 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.540
 quite work and I'm super exploited 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.610
 when well tired sleeping back 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.940
 corner so today's topic has 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.940
 what to be 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.260
 and it is possible that he is already asleep at all 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.000
 moment but tell me that there is no thing 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.120
 worse than being in the morning plug 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.120
 and that the eyes start to flip 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.120
 voluntarily 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.600
 but men that part is not worth it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.250
 when the one behind you and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.619
 knowing that you are in a trance of 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.090
 spiritual relaxation just started them 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.420
 to honk the horn to advance in the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.420
 plug 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.460
 and they lack in the dream one will 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.100
 let's say you arrived at your job or 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.780
 school or some meeting or good 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.730
 you got to where you were going you feel where 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.890
 you are going to accept and you start 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.540
 Appear between yourself and our 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.910
 brain because you do not want to stay 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.290
 asleep the brain yes and although the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.150
 most of the time in the brain 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.580
 There are times when we win 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.140
 also to be honest I do not remember 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.850
 no chance that I won but 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.250
 but there must be someone who has won 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.440
 sometime in life some 9 but there 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.000
 it is not the bad no no no no 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.900
 the lack of a chabón is when someone gives 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.900
 realize that we are asleep 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.950
 d 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.940
 dear Chinese teachers see you sleeping 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.599
 in your class, do not think that it's 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.430
 it's a pleasure it 's super boring, do not go 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.500
 to think that you do not know how to capture my 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.620
 attention and that's why I fell asleep in 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.620
 your boring class does not go wrong 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.680
 they with cantú read them alcapurrias 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:05.640
 and maybe we can continue it's fine 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.319
 and if the teachers are passed when the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.049
 they send sleeping worse are the 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.790
 beloved and beloved little chiefs if you have not 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.579
 past that they are working and 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.829
 striving hard at the moment in 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.659
 that they attack the dream like that but that 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.819
 sticky dream that we can not 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.530
 escape and as we are weak weapons that 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.290
 we do before the arms of morpheus in 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.200
 full office the bosses realize that 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.200
 small and insignificant slip 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.939
 a man 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.790
 right now the others yes yes 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.530

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.840
 that the work you notice is super 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.760
 exploiter and that adds up that follows 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.010
 asking and asking as if we 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.010

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.570
 rice and beans actual milk out 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.349

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.849

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:29.349
