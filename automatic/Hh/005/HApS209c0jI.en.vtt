 we do not use many muscles of the 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.700

 of yoga should be done in a 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.150
 deep through the nose we all know that 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.190
 the face is the mirror of the soul and in

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.100
 feelings of our interior that's why

 the people who smile permanently 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.080
 they notice how their muscles contract and in 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.210
 consequence its expression is much more 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.850
 nice than that of a paid person
