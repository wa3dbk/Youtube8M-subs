00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.589
 Hi there, I signed up to participate 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.280
 in the marathon 30 thousand rubles a month 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.550
 site for 60 days that spend arman 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.080
 and shiryaev more famous 3 like ass 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.960
 why did you decide to go for it in the yards 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.180
 first reviews of previous questions 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.270
 that got concrete and tangible 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.250
 results in the form of money and by the way forgot 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:37.550
 say about the cost of the marathon for 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:39.170
 marathon rallied 17,000 this is the lite version you 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.390
 worth as much 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.690
 how much is this information 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.260
 essentially marathon share 60 days 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:51.380
 I am a plugin to learn a lot of new and useful 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.660
 for myself, well, naturally I went to 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.210
 to teach earning on sites yet 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.020
 more than i do than i earn 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.729
 Now for previous members hacking 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.380
 Marathon he was 3 or 4 hours I do not remember 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.970
 Only positive feedbacks after 30 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.820
 or but officially its full all 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.700
 here but most of those who write 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.350
 put the vines in they consume their 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.670
 recall some specific facts 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.869
 what specific results 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.460
 and if you do something that is not 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.330
 do respectively the path to edren 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.930
 Come on, I'll share with you 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.960
 your impressions of the marathon after and 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.960
 time understood such a simple thing any 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.420
 information can be obtained empirically 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.680
 found on the internet but it requires 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.189
 time costs 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.320
 and time is essentially more expensive than right with me 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.620
 resource and it is much more expensive 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.620
 money so it was not a pity to rally 18 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.760
 17 thousand for information for what I 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.290
 I will save my time firstly I will not 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.800
 experiment everything will get ready 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.130
 ready work scheme is well worth it 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.910
 And I think that for such things you need 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.890
 pay and 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.170
 it is very much like interesting and meditation 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.660
 time is money in general and wait for my new ones 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.040
 Video will be interested in this all 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.040
