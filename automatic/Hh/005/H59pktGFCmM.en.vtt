00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.090
 hassen konichiwa it's virtual synthesis 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.469
 power I'm fast and today I 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.580
 you find for guild wars 2 yes 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.410
 it's been a long time I have not done a 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.320
 video on saturday i know i'm sorry 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.390
 here I find you for a patch 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.340
 notes completely late on March 26 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.220
 when you see the video will be the 10 12 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.570
 April may and it does not cost anything to read it 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.689
 there maybe some things you have 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.670
 missed so this patch notes of March 26 that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.960
 we add a lot of features 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.450
 Yes Yes 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.399
 so we will start with the oldest 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.690
 that I hope most of you 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.670
 notice this is the continuation of the story 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.050
 alive 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.140
 following the living history of 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.250
 flames and cold the destruction so that 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.180
 is noticed simply because 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.019
 that she is new success in 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:54.430
 living history 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:56.559
 that's infiltrated contact and it's almost 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.760
 all so how does that happen where is 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.659
 we are are I think I 'm doing again 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.579
 maybe videos about the story 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.920
 alive it's still not bad it allows 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.149
 to have rewards on vials 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.030
 of karma and affluence for the 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.610
 guild if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.250
 otherwise like there you stop me and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.940
 so it's here here so there is 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.860
 two pnj 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.259
 so I do not get you a story 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.550
 wanted to run it on video but but 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.380
 here you have two pnj to whom you 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.940
 talk who will launch two sets of 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.810
 different quests that can be done 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.039
 alone or just as well as at 5 and 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.110
 so that's going to allow you to 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.759
 unlock some small systems 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.140
 free that you can do once 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.580
 per day so it's pretty good 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.460
 then and the story begins to take 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.350
 a pretty interesting scale so 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.060
 do not hesitate to do it is always 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.600
 funny 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.320
 if not another thing not bad the islands 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.520
 it's not that button that's it here we are 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.119
 have two novelties in the company 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.790
 black lion 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.140
 you can buy as usual 1h me 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.710
 very casual sense is holding this new 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.540
 saint gilles 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.710
 sackey skin to sir some stuff from 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.549
 Okay 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.180
 ok we wish super talent shirt and 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.960
 useful thing if not for sale no 12 of 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.160
 brand hoods 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.319
 I think it's also a novelty 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.520
 well, it's full of colors 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.520
 rider boots whau 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.650
 apart from that what is there 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.120
 new then there are new skins 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.160
 then in the codes of the black kind 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.459
 now you have a tiny chance 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.209
 and I was very lucky 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.709
 to have a good for a molten weapon has 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.870
 so decided new new weapons 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.760
 skins weapons that are pretty cool who 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.730
 are related to living history 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.980
 that's just and and who are going 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.260
 allow yourself here to fart you a 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.670
 little with a rather rare sign then 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.780
 after rare everything is relative ago when 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.060
 even quite a few people in the guild who 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.470
 helped the first day so on a 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.590
 dozen black suits free of June 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.989
 so finally this is not it 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.489
 impossible h to the country and it's worth it 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.900
 because they are really really very 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.250
 stylish besides I showed you I 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.200
 go quietly go get the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.610
 pnj who wanted wind yes 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.630
 and meanwhile I'm talking to you 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.700
 something else to order at the level of 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.120
 missions of gi joe add a trick I 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.650
 then thought of the war here they have 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.840
 rejected a new thing it's called 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.150
 loose guild bonus training 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.070
 so the hunt for prime-1 we all know 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.799
 and therefore guild feather training 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.090
 which costs 300 influence to unlock 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.160
 teams have besides 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.720
 bad time to unlock and what 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.239
 advantage is that you will only have one 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.890
 only pnj to kill and and this psg between 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.620
 fields will recover from the influence if 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.970
 I say no nonsense it's 1000 miles 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.230
 of influence for your guild or it's 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.330
 rather nice and then you will always 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.310
 then you will not of course have the 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.230
 reward chest of real cats sa 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.549
 premium but here you will have a 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.110
 influence at will allow for small 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.150
 guilds of quietly it's to what 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.580
 influence for was going to unlock the 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.519
 higher levels of quests of 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.660
 guild then the specialist me weapons 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.420
 watchmen so he's the one who 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.980
 sells some days sir is so 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.120
 here are the fused arms skins 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.500
 so I'll make you another video there 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.920
 above i just ask you the pnj 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.849
 so here you know and news 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.849
 weapons with a treacherous skin quoted otherwise 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.590
 in new yara there is a ladder that 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.169
 is available on the site of guild wars 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.260
 2 in community that classifies people 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:25.970
 by points of success by points of 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.850
 success mcm and pvp point here at 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.960
 pvp level I will not go back on 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.320
 since what are I do not do a lot 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.750
 but at the level of the world against the world 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.039
 missed a points system so here 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.690
 it is in ranking and caps td 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.400
 noticed that the menu was 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.039
 completely remelted and so you have 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.450
 a ranking that is obtained by marking 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.830
 points then the points are obtained 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.849
 doing useful things for the mcm 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.120
 it's the same thing in general as this 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.620
 who brings back karma so do 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.050
 from tiber to door points 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.100
 I am the unusual hotels if reports 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.270
 points of view and deacons 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.600
 not finally bring everything reports 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.490
 points 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.860
 it is longer and longer to accumulate them 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.860
 you gain capacity points a 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.500
 world against world goes up against world 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.710
 that allow you to get small 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.030
 stats bonus only for mcm 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.770
 so you have the improvement of 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.360
 beacon skills improvement 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.770
 of a cannon control a bigger one 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.740
 refueling capacity but that's fine 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.479
 crack that the power of seats the 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.440
 impenetrable fortress reducing 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.370
 subject gains by siege engines 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.190
 it's pretty good 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.630
 the scourge of mercenaries that reduces 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.650
 damage they inflicted on you 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.930
 increase your damage done to 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.360
 mercenaries stomp on the guards and 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.410
 guard thing etc et cetera so you 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.220
 spend those points there and then you 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.330
 continue the watch vesle 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.400
 quietly and in addition it gives you 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.810
 a kind of pseudo title that appears 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.910
 it seems to me above your head 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.880
 when you are playing 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.590
 so it is rather quite nice all 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:52.320
 that for once conquer mcm that's 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:54.300
 rare otherwise it's pretty much everything 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.849
 which is interesting especially bet on 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.650
 this update is already not bad 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.690
 I want to say the system of 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.950
 ranking was really a big group 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.270
 more now would maybe 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.190
 that they take into account the ladder for 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.300
 the pvp but finally that's it will be more 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.099
 late one I will come back voili voilou and 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.150
 otherwise there is an event that was done in 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:13.440
 this moment I make you a video there 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.000
 on it very soon I think 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.590
 sincerely several pieces that 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.639
 is called the super boxing adventure if 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.599
 you missed it's you are 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.700
 surely not play and who's dancing since 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:22.800
 a little while but manage or do 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.210
 a little a little tourist guide of 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.479
 the area to and it's very nice and 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.370
 it's available until April 31st on 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.110
 this 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.000
 the video was pretty happy I 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.320
 was expecting a bit long and I 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.660
 found soon for fight 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.610
 new videos on guild wars 2 and 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.139
 do not forget to let them push towards 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.840
 comments subscribe to the 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.889
 chain and put some more green and 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.970
 share on Facebook 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:45.970
