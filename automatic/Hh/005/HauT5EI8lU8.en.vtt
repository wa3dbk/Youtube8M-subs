00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hey people nice to have a look 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.000
 welcome back martin here and you 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.940
 I see I have a pack here 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.080
 protein powder and that's what I have 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.099
 not only for the video 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.070
 bought and I have too 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.599
 actually standing in the house and what 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.690
 of it maybe a pack in the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.480
 year, so I'm eating it very much 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.260
 little I think that is also clear that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.550
 at my height and mine 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.349
 muscle mass I just have that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.960
 is not necessary if I am now 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.610
 For example, the need have that 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.160
 I feel I need more proteins 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.710
 it is explicitly food with 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.260
 more with a higher protein content yes 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.210
 all legumes lentils beans such 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.370
 I can easily do 100 grams 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.329
 eat more 100 grams of it and I have 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.850
 20 to 25 grams more herbal prodi 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.520
 in my opinion that is the one of the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.890
 best in port yes generally build mass 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.120
 want to be as powerful as always 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.309
 Pay attention to the input that it so that you 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.690
 is enough and then you can come here 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.760
 the choice of such good 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.170
 Food very easily wanted 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 increase protein requirements 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.549
 but if you say no to me now 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.229
 it does not or for a certain mass he 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.320
 from a certain size that is how it works 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.409
 Direction 90 100 kilograms of my opinion 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.130
 After that it can make sense if protein 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.110
 take powder if it does not again 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.970
 diet plan fits please if your conscience 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.500
 wanted to keep body fat percentage etc 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.320
 and if you noticed hey got that 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.210
 positive impact on my strength 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.240
 also on my muscle mass that she 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.479
 there really again a concentrated 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.040
 foods 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.549
 I'll say that again 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.240
 food to you take what just 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.159
 practically consists only of protein 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.619
 and I think many who know me 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.689
 know my music philosophy and the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.630
 know that I say hey grab better 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.460
 only it prefers only 30 percent of that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.399
 protein what you are going to if before 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.409
 it was a third before a problem 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.899
 but also likes to give it twice or 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.240
 three times as much and have 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.180
 For that really quality that is now 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.550
 bio hand proteins raw food quality 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.460
 in my opinion one of the best 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.950
 get protein powder race 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.750
 I myself can tell you about the sun 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.500
 Warrior also recommend one 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.300
 top quality 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.130
 This protein belongs to me in the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.230
 the ton 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.450
 absolutely do not give away away 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.970
 Let's go away with it 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.050
 symbolic nude is also me 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.670
 honestly , personally 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.240
 no longer take the whey seriously 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.470
 Protein still takes or or or 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.700
 applies in whatever form 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.810
 I know first-hand how the stuff 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.360
 is bottled 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.730
 yes, what comes in there and you 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.750
 you would really turn around really nice 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.710
 the whole stuff comes from eastern europe 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.630
 China nothing against these countries but what 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.020
 stuffed animals in there in the 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.690
 literally pure stuffed is then on 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.770
 others eat at antibiotics that 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.680
 did not want to know 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.420
 The stuff is then processed high 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.390
 then about business here to Germany 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.860
 then the whole film is filled 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.570
 welded and already allowed 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.370
 manufacturer wrote on it 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.070
 in germany yes that's it 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.850
 Quality seal that means unfortunately 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.980
 nothing at all 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.410
 that is, do it bottled here 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.570
 and that's just the most often 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.070
 the same with the ai weiweis 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.690
 pro.de so what about eggs 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.920
 chicken eggs won what is partly 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.810
 even in it remains in 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.960
 conventional samples and then come 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:40.130
 just these insane prices of about 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.780
 20 30 euro per kilogram out and 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.700
 it's just sick it's easy 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.050
 just perverted and i want to be in this 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.570
 context people one more time on 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.610
 a recent study point in the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.120
 was explored explicitly whether that is 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.880
 whey protein bcl da was investigated 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.040
 whey protein is comparable to that 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.660
 vegetable pro which one has rice here 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.510
 per team taken and it came out that 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.280
 just the wealth plant protein exactly 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.300
 has the same impact as the whey 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.320
 protein and that's just the point 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.250
 I would also like to have a thing 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.920
 point out that these are now 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.320
 short-term effects of muscle building 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.840
 four generations etc 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.739
 but I think everyone is clear 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.319
 long-term fixed 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.789
 the vegetable proteins just better 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:28.370
 So maybe a message is attached 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:31.130
 vegetarian or meat or people the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.470
 eating another protein throws it 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.810
 throw the stuff away with 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.520
 safety as nothing nothing good at 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.949
 and you have the best 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.370
 herbal alternative high quality 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.650
 Eat less food altogether 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.780
 not that is not for others now 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.610
 but topics from the rodinger 's 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.979
 is called after training three times one 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.610
 week or so then high quality 20 rhine 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.740
 Waist on 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.020
 yes what is generally important if you 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.360
 power and power sometimes wanted in general 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.710
 there is always enough when you have it 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.970
 deficit from then, of course, too 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.389
 shit and otherwise that's short 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.110
 recommendation that I can pronounce and 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.270
 everything else 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.340
 then turn to the strength athletes 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.110
 the vegans were the pictures that you can 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.669
 then give even better tips but that 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.389
 in my opinion is just very 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:23.360
 highly recommended things and grab 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:27.289
 rather than in this shit whey 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.909
 protein which also many report half 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.919
 that they just can not do this anymore 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.349
 have digestive problems with it all 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.889
 flatulence whole skin problems yes many 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:39.530
 get extreme extreme skin problems 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.330
 the back pimples completely from these 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.930
 whole whey proteins from the others 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.620
 stuff 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:48.409
 and yes it is even so in the award 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.080
 the per kilogram or per 500 grams 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.599
 offered at this cheap protein 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.039
 What's not even bio is so well 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.740
 if i am if i am at all 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.240
 no no bio buyer who himself as 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.300
 but I would get ten times more powder 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.909
 but pay ten times yes that's just 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.500
 also a point there you know 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:06.919
 can you yourselves the quality of 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.530
 marl 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.090
 in this sense people skin in it makes 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.590
 good and if you still have great tips and 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.860
 recommendations may have of the 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.719
 People are also in this 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.060
 in this sport segment or in this 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:21.069

 have me write down let us down
