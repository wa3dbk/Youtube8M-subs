00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 I warmly welcome you today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.930
 The sun is shining warm 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.970
 but unfortunately it will be god too 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.590
 it would be pretty wall in the house 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.719
 just fine if, for example, the blinds 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.379
 moving as if by magic and 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.510
 slept 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.890
 Of course that interests me as 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.769
 technikfreak I have to be right 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.609
 look how that works, hello god 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.890
 Mr. Moser 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.960
 I think they are behind it like 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.579
 you do that 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.380
 usually it drives automatically but it 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.070
 the sunscreen is known 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.230
 approved 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.690
 okay that works all this 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.940
 technology wonder 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.230
 usually heard shadowed when they are 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.950
 in the room is too warm and the sun 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.350
 seems 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.260
 when the sun comes out of the south again 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.180
 the southern facade shadows the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.010
 sun comes from the east we make the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.860
 shaded eastern facade it goes 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.890
 everything automatically automatically everything 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.530
 okay and that's what you need 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.449
 control system a tablet you can do it 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.110
 it does not have to use it you can do it 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.510
 use 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.729
 every smartphone every tablet possible 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.500
 and also quite conventional buttons like 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.020
 you find yourself here what you can 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.229
 because still wanted to show everything 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.670
 now our living room can be used to 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.670
 for example, activate the music 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.570
 very comfortable yes okay we complain 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.409
 Also, maybe someone is looking ahead 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.409
 the door is standing 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.200
 this is the camera connects interesting 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.759
 So a little bit an income on 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.170
 You can talk to jÃ¼rges 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.000
 talk about 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.250
 hello is someone out there wonderful 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.530
 understandably that means it is also like that 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.110
 a bit an alarm system included 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.149
 you can also control that important 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.700
 it takes a bit of sensory 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.080
 that means the surveillance whether the front door 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.640
 for example, opened or closed 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.560
 or the patio door that we too 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.420
 not nice when the blinds go down 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.250
 if the patio door is open 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.140
 and you grill it while outside that 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.940
 such dependencies can be 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.250
 following thinking house in 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.319
 ok and what does that system think 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.310
 something only taxed everything 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.470
 small beautiful green box this 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.040
 box controls everything in the house of 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.570
 picture brain that is the central 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.820
 so small computer completely built 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.269
 the state consumes little power 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.130
 from the blinds to the music up 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.470
 shading lighting everything you need 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.329
 I can imagine the whole thing 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.590
 actually also from the outside so steer 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.000
 for example, when I'm on the road and 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.980
 I forgot the heater 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.100
 turn it down or you can do it all 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.450
 control what they want from the outside 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.630
 the system is different around my house 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.390
 is or comes from the internet and ever 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.040
 What you want to control is what you want to do 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.959
 You can do that according to the internet 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.790
 also control 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.010
 interesting so that that will be exciting 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.200
 What does the light say ? 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.139
 I still watch and it's the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.519
 light on 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:13.810
 at the push of a button at the touch of a button 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:20.940
 but i just got more that is going through 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.940
 other drivers are still good today 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.109
 really great but there are still 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.109
 something something really cool 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.070
 and that's how fast it can be done 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.420
 Well then, love everything for you again 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.420
 look until next time
