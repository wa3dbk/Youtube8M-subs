this is a zoom button I would assume

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.639 
this is a zoom button I would assume
would<00:01:48.299> probably<00:01:48.689> trade<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.259> off<00:01:49.350> see<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
would probably trade this is off see to

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.830 
would probably trade this is off see to
play<00:01:49.860> your<00:01:50.009> media<00:01:50.399> turn<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.790> volume<00:01:50.939> this

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
play your media turn up the volume this

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.810 
play your media turn up the volume this
is<00:01:51.899> also<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.290> play<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> pause<00:01:52.890> your<00:01:53.159> media<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
is also to play and pause your media and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.600 
is also to play and pause your media and
us<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.420> turn<00:01:54.780> down<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> volume<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.680> then<00:01:55.979> CPI

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
us to turn down the volume and then CPI

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.209 
us to turn down the volume and then CPI
I'm<00:01:57.060> not<00:01:57.270> too<00:01:58.079> sure<00:01:58.320> what<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> C<00:01:58.770> power<00:01:58.920> button

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
I'm not too sure what the C power button

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.230 
I'm not too sure what the C power button
does<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.520> sure<00:01:59.670> we'll<00:01:59.820> figure<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.180> out

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
does going sure we'll figure that out

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.870 
does going sure we'll figure that out
also<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.590> at<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> end<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.189> USB<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.759> is

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
also here at the end of the USB it is

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.999 
also here at the end of the USB it is
gold-plated<00:02:03.210> I'll<00:02:03.719> say<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:04.439> maximum

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
gold-plated I'll say for maximum

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.069 
gold-plated I'll say for maximum
efficiency<00:02:05.310> here<00:02:05.820> I'll<00:02:06.270> gold-plated<00:02:06.869> things

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
efficiency here I'll gold-plated things

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.540 
efficiency here I'll gold-plated things
on<00:02:07.229> USB<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.680> always<00:02:07.950> make<00:02:08.099> them<00:02:08.220> more<00:02:08.340> durable

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
on USB is always make them more durable

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.760 
on USB is always make them more durable
as<00:02:08.819> well<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.450> there<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.140> product<00:02:10.379> itself

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
as well so there is the product itself

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.110 
as well so there is the product itself
guys<00:02:11.009> let's<00:02:11.220> go<00:02:11.370> ahead<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
LEDs in actions or badness like this

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.640 
LEDs in actions or badness like this
okay<00:02:18.540> guys<00:02:18.720> we're<00:02:18.930> back<00:02:19.110> here<00:02:19.290> with<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.500> lot

these<00:02:48.000> two<00:02:48.209> buttons<00:02:48.420> right<00:02:48.510> here<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.870> can

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
these two buttons right here you can

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.660 
these two buttons right here you can
these<00:02:49.200> are<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.410> only<00:02:49.560> customisable<00:02:50.280> ones<00:02:50.459> and

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
these are the only customisable ones and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.780 
these are the only customisable ones and
they<00:02:51.420> are<00:02:51.780> there<00:02:52.380> in<00:02:52.500> place<00:02:52.709> for<00:02:52.890> control<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.760> I

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
they are there in place for control so I

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.080 
they are there in place for control so I
tested<00:02:54.120> out<00:02:54.299> on<00:02:54.510> world<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.810> war<00:02:54.989> just<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.319> see

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
tested out on world of war just to see

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.400 
tested out on world of war just to see
how<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.120> could<00:02:57.390> configure<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.900> buttons<00:02:58.200> but

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
how I could configure the buttons but

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.289 
how I could configure the buttons but
and<00:02:58.620> I'm<00:02:58.890> worried<00:02:59.130> O'War<00:02:59.370> any<00:02:59.549> way<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.150> can

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
and I'm worried O'War any way you can

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.910 
and I'm worried O'War any way you can
only<00:03:00.480> configure<00:03:00.959> these<00:03:01.110> two<00:03:01.260> buttons<00:03:01.470> these

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
only configure these two buttons these

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.530 
only configure these two buttons these
two<00:03:02.190> don't<00:03:02.459> do<00:03:02.610> anything<00:03:02.849> they're<00:03:03.180> just<00:03:03.390> a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
two don't do anything they're just a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.960 
two don't do anything they're just a
zoom<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.069> if<00:03:05.069> only<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.580> in<00:03:05.670> Sniper<00:03:05.849> Elite

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
zoom and if only is that in Sniper Elite

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.490 
zoom and if only is that in Sniper Elite
or<00:03:06.239> something<00:03:06.510> I'd<00:03:06.599> say<00:03:06.630> maybe<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.110> zoom<00:03:07.290> in

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
or something I'd say maybe to zoom in

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.470 
or something I'd say maybe to zoom in
your<00:03:07.680> scope<00:03:07.890> but<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.120> do<00:03:09.209> some<00:03:09.360> more
