approach by gay people to ask for the
Buddhist<00:01:55.909> view<00:01:55.939> is<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:57.590> I<00:01:57.710> basically<00:01:58.069> say<00:01:58.399> to

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
Buddhist view is and I basically say to

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:59.859 
Buddhist view is and I basically say to
them<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.729> it's<00:01:59.030> important<00:01:59.479> they<00:01:59.539> accept

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
them that it's important they accept

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.850 
them that it's important they accept
themselves<00:02:00.819> after<00:02:01.819> all<00:02:02.590> sexuality<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:03.649> only<00:02:03.770> a

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
themselves after all sexuality is only a

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.309 
themselves after all sexuality is only a
very<00:02:04.039> small<00:02:04.130> part<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.789> a<00:02:04.880> person<00:02:05.299> as<00:02:05.689> they<00:02:06.020> come

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
very small part of a person as they come

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.130 
very small part of a person as they come
to<00:02:06.920> Lee<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.520> talk<00:02:07.789> about<00:02:07.969> your<00:02:08.330> problems<00:02:08.810> I

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
to Lee and talk about your problems I

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.089 
to Lee and talk about your problems I
find<00:02:09.379> that<00:02:10.239> they<00:02:11.239> get<00:02:11.480> more<00:02:12.440> understanding

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
find that they get more understanding

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.030 
find that they get more understanding
themselves<00:02:13.310> about<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.120> sexuality<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.440> a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
themselves about the sexuality and a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.380 
themselves about the sexuality and a
little<00:02:16.250> bit<00:02:16.370> better<00:02:16.610> understanding<00:02:16.819> of<00:02:17.709> the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
little bit better understanding of the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.809 
little bit better understanding of the
Christian<00:02:20.390> faith<00:02:21.099> which<00:02:22.099> will<00:02:22.400> allow<00:02:22.900> them<00:02:23.900> to

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
Christian faith which will allow them to

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.309 
Christian faith which will allow them to
overcome<00:02:25.819> their<00:02:26.530> own<00:02:27.530> guilt<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:29.390> being<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:30.110> gay
