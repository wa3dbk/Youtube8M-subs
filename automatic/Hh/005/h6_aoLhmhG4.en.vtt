00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 it may look like a pack of months 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.719
 m2 note and instead no 2 there is the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.000
 word months but not the known version 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:20.960
 we find out immediately in this new video 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:25.619
 unboxing yes yes dear guys here it is 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:29.400
 m2 in clearly white version in 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.679
 this moment m2 which is called le 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.239
 entry level of mei on a display of 5 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.000
 inch features slightly 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.800
 lower than m2 night however really 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.910
 could be the terminal suitable for 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.800
 you because if m2 night was too big 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.870
 and with its 5 inches we have this 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.690
 practically the same phone however in 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.910
 a 5-inch diagonal display then 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.399
 could really be the device 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.770
 you were looking for inside the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.660
 let's take your smartphone panorama 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.059
 immediately to remove the phone if there 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.420
 I succeed without breaking anything, here it is 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.909
 here then packs china they have 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.619
 immediately get all the seals then 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.270
 here we have the classic booklet of 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.380
 home months we put it a moment from 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.180
 part usb micro usb cable that we will need 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.830
 to recharge our smartphone 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.040
 also to use it as products like 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.479
 clearly mtp port was to say 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.159
 prototype but it has nothing to do with it 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.810
 anything 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.350
 then we are going to remove also the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.450
 films inside the display of m2m 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.329
 2 which clearly to the plastic materials 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.000
 it could not be different too 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.700
 given the price, here it is a lot 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.560
 small and portable cable of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.630
 recharge clearly not European company 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.640
 but big shop puntonet will resign 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.970
 the pin adapter to go open 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.420
 the compartment of the nano sim lock and also 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.320
 micro sd if necessary then dual sim 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.390
 or a sim is a micro sd to go 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.600
 expand the system memory from 16 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.090
 gigabytes on this m2 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.260
 let's immediately turn on the device 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.880
 clearly you can already see 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.640
 inside also the video now vi 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.450
 will put a little more focus on all 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.770
 features then we have two keys 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.320
 placed on the right power button 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.450
 switch off here on the right then point 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.630
 we have the volume bar one 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.810
 upper part that shows us the jack 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.970
 3.5mm headphone part 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.600

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.890
 simona micro sd and then in the part 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.630
 lower we have the first microphone 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.760
 micro usb usb input and then the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.130
 speaker clearly system in the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.810
 front part you see there is the display there 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.560

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.730
 with the fingerprint absolutely not 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.250

 placed in the back of our device 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.330
 in short, a really lean terminal 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.850
 really light laptop this is 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.100
 it could be the phone that 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.800
