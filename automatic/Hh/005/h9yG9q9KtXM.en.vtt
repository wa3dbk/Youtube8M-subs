have a tropical greenhouse with bright
new<00:00:39.809> corals<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.200> appreciate<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.430> let's<00:00:41.640> just

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
new corals to appreciate so let's just

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.250 
new corals to appreciate so let's just
think<00:00:41.969> warm<00:00:42.210> thoughts<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.840> get<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
think warm thoughts and get on to the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.160 
think warm thoughts and get on to the
corals<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.539> tend<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.629> branching

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
corals here I tend to like branching

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.569 
corals here I tend to like branching
affiliates<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:46.920> they<00:00:47.010> tend<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.399> grow

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
affiliates because they tend to grow

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.010 
affiliates because they tend to grow
faster<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.270> are<00:00:48.360> easy<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.780> propagate

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
faster and are easy to propagate

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.920 
faster and are easy to propagate
compared<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.829> their<00:00:49.950> wall<00:00:50.219> shaped<00:00:50.520> cousins<00:00:50.969> so

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
compared to their wall shaped cousins so

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.900 
compared to their wall shaped cousins so
far<00:00:52.170> these<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.860> grown<00:00:53.070> very<00:00:53.250> fast<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:53.850> I

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
far these have not grown very fast but I

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.849 
far these have not grown very fast but I
am<00:00:54.180> optimistic<00:00:56.539> if<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> variety<00:00:58.829> of

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
am optimistic if there was a variety of

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.680 
am optimistic if there was a variety of
coral<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.489> purchased<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> most<00:01:00.329> from
