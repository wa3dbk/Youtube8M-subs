00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.179 
and less at the calorie in
so<00:02:09.269> you<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.989> cut<00:02:10.289> down<00:02:10.530> your<00:02:10.560> food<00:02:10.950> intake

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:11.189 
so you have to cut down your food intake

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.750 
so you have to cut down your food intake
and<00:02:11.730> increase<00:02:12.719> your<00:02:12.750> cardio<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.609> that<00:02:14.609> was

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and increase your cardio and that was

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.550 
and increase your cardio and that was
something<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.599> really<00:02:15.870> struggled<00:02:16.439> with

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
something that I really struggled with

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.550 
something that I really struggled with
feelings<00:02:17.099> I'll<00:02:17.510> sacrificing<00:02:18.510> my<00:02:18.959> health<00:02:19.319> or

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
feelings I'll sacrificing my health or

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.530 
feelings I'll sacrificing my health or
aesthetics<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.219> it's<00:02:20.909> still<00:02:21.030> something<00:02:21.269> that

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
aesthetics and it's still something that

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.679 
aesthetics and it's still something that
I<00:02:21.719> don't<00:02:21.840> like<00:02:22.439> now<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.129> for<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.819> reason<00:02:23.969> it

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
I don't like now and for that reason it

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.160 
I don't like now and for that reason it
means<00:02:25.230> I'm<00:02:25.560> decided<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:26.250> compete<00:02:26.609> again<00:02:27.170> with

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
means I'm decided to compete again with

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.009 
means I'm decided to compete again with
mine<00:02:28.409> tend<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.889> be<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.579> make<00:02:29.760> my<00:02:30.019> preparation

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
mine tend to be to make my preparation

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.539 
mine tend to be to make my preparation
little<00:02:31.230> bit<00:02:31.319> healthier<00:02:31.469> this<00:02:31.799> time<00:02:32.010> around<00:02:32.129> um
