00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 then continuing simpler shows until 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.259
 the end these courses sessions always 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.750
 hold the white up the green on 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.000
 front if you do not have white is the most 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.620
 clear bowl in two by two having 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.660
 black in place of white then you do not 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.190
 will put the black up there will do 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.480
 with yellow on top it will be more 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.150
 clear after white 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.699
 The white of 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.220
 magnet and here in the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.090
 green if you do not have the green 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.309
 dark color adjacent to the brand new 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.160
 darker and then how are you going to do the same 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.070
 Forever thing you'll look at the lyrics 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.410
 or the letters here in front and go 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.090
 perform the movements there're so why 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:51.449
 example here webb up f in front 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:55.890
 the 2 is the right the top is the right 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:03.210
 twice is a little girl r 2 per line 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:05.549
 It is official only has UFRR always okay and there is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.619
 confronted with drawing 20 looks the part 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.810
 from top hit there white yellow red 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.920
 yellow orange come here from the sly side 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.799
 also all right 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.880
 although the beauty cat two by two the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.220
 rest is good looking three by three same 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.720
 white thing on top loses in front if 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.520
 Do not have a lighter white 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.390
 if you do not lose darker side 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.490
 from clear top to white green and one thing 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:38.360
 looking here from my left to 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:38.360
 the top right down from 2 to 2 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:52.700
 talking about the notation that ended the drawing 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:04.740
 right 24 changes a little bit more 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:11.360
 still holding white on top green 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:13.030
 in the front and there will start 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.569
 22 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:21.819
 two f 2 r 2 lulinha l2 colinho b2br 2 a 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:27.000
 first line was all smooth 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:32.110
 the second line f the two is is line bf2 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.640
 of b / d line f and last movement of 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.480
 second line 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.940
 if you go to repair it has a fw 2 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.360
 when you have w that this is invest more than 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.480
 a layer is so in front comes 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.550
 telling how many layers and will move if 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.130
 If you have ow you have no 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.769
 front of the letter of for example is 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.650
 because the 2-1 and understands then people 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.569
 fills two layers and still has 12 in 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.120
 end that is when you spin twice 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.420
 nor only the front two layers 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:09.220
 first and second double 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:13.230
 then came the w2 us two two times 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:19.840
 also is to continue efe in line belinha 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:24.040
 opu ow two of this sea two two times 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:30.730
 fw 2f two from the front 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:35.110
 fd new w2 are twice r 261 line 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:38.709
 l 2 and now has a rw line, you see that 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.530
 does not have 12 in the end is a sound line are 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.760
 both right is right 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.130
 only in the anti-clockwise direction only in 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.859
 2002 now jump right two on the 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:56.769
 clockwise with w 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:04:00.450
 r fw two lines ahead of r 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:04.989
 both the right time rw 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:10.920
 bl line and ends there to give the 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:15.700
 from then on a little there is 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.979
 You have to become like us beauty and there 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.760
 forward in the larger cubes will be 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.760
 always the same thing
