00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 And then everyone here is talking in a 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.250
 article today bringing another video to 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.170
 you this time about whether the rayan was 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.690
 this is going to be the last video of 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.350
 series and I 'll be teaching you 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.630
 do it online and boot on the check continue 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.400
 What kind of a lot of work do you do? 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.119
 a madman then make a place of him in the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.230
 source button there the guys will cheat 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.650
 It's going to pass the line, it's not funny. 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.650
 so let's start 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.030
 Good people, I 'm not going to make such a leader. 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.940
 great against that because it is not 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.399
 precise and type ohio is very easy only has 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.680
 two basic rule exists two sides of the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.920
 container and its use and whether 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 sells here and has two sides 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.980
 it does not give to do with it then 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.920
 Like, you have to use this side here. 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.570
 where's that at the table 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.939
 well first i put here one 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.580
 container a little higher up with a 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:14.180
 zin slope because neither here nor in 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.180
 over him 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.850
 that way so the guys I recommend 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.740
 The first one you do online 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.530
 then you put both campaigns 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.280
 It's much easier here. 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.229
 see the construction here again with 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.580
 our childhood war 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.490
 I did not come in here, I'm going to put a 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.640
 grain of cool tilt my buddies 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.600
 if we make the raid good and once again our 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.479
 prissy little friend to law and pee 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:55.600
 You see up here right up to 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:59.080
 x right again down here 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:04.720
 I'm back to training alone, I had a right foot. 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:08.830
 Good crowd 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:12.940
 are two simple rules to do 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.830
 The one rider is to use the inside part of the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.150
 container that if not the car she has 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.000
 these letters and the second is to put the 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.640
 container is not a container. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.980
 container first because it is 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.080
 you put on top 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.299
 obviously you will not have vision of 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.970
 down so I can put it on later 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.730
 and even if you make a whole 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:45.790
 bottom row is most at risk 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:49.440
 you miss so it is here put what 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.440
 puts your container from below 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.500
 here comes here, put one more 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:09.700
 What's next when you find the 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:11.799
 angle from here it will not allow good 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.650
 People I think particularly online are 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.810
 very easy to do 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.769
 I prefer more on your hardware here with 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.500
 contain the ramp is the galera like 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.989
 call mega ramps tornado rape 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.769
 I find it very annoying to do I prefer 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.769
 this method here 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:41.760
 good I think it's that's already good right there 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:46.319
 Now you come and get a ramp. 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.030
 Not from here, Jack picks up an average ramp. 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:54.909
 put a little bit back a little 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:59.980
 more on the side also puts here because it is 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:03.760
 here in the little girl watching our mine 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:08.650
 electric box again one more 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:11.160
 turn to direct x people our famous 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.160
 wider 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.270
 there the car hit the plant it is dingy 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.060
 Good guys, now I'll teach you 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.140
 to vote the check remains high and 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.210
 that there a first one there guys that 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:38.760
 I think it's even easier, as you go. 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:41.550
 see here in the container they will put a 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.510
 time to let's get at the time of 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.490
 williams picks up the other 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:56.280
 get a little taller and get better 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:58.770
 You're afraid it would be the way out here. 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.280
 of the leader, that is, here puts a 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:09.390
 container here puts another here 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:15.180
 on the contrary, you put 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:19.200
 here soon they will have to put the 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:24.300
 more level companion can be 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.740
 here the button inside the other even does not 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.290
 You have to stay here and look for this. 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.990
 height so that more or less than the 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:35.840
 container was well reveal one 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.840
 checkpoint comes up here 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.569
 I messed up because you 're not giving 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:47.180
 I know you keep trying, it's not 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.219
 It is possible to position the object here 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.520
 floor must be level be it from here 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.520
 new 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:08.480
 the subway pride did not need sauce 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.480
 tomorrow morning 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:28.039
 now I think it goes here the guys went 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:34.400
 then come here very cautiously had 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:37.819
 here take that side and 6 have a 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.330
 I would honor the check still high for me 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:40.330
 to walk 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.890
 O 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.870
 our team was that 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.990
 good guys the video about the hardware is 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.670
 This one is going to be short and you like it 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.640
 of the video they are the favorites 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.380
 and if you want to send the races 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.390
 What are you doing through the channel? 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:13.100
 For me, you can leave the linck. 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:13.100
 In the description he gave his Jorge and spoke
