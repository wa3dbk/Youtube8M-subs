supplies haul / organizational tips i am
a<00:00:13.559> freshman<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.129> i<00:00:14.160> don't<00:00:14.430> know<00:00:14.610> too<00:00:15.120> much

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
a freshman so i don't know too much

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.810 
a freshman so i don't know too much
about<00:00:15.360> what<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.870> need<00:00:16.200> in<00:00:16.530> class<00:00:16.830> but<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.430> know

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
about what I need in class but I do know

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.010 
about what I need in class but I do know
that<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.450> want<00:00:18.870> to<00:00:19.320> have<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.190> lot<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.990> space<00:00:21.990> for

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
that I want to have a lot of space for

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.350 
that I want to have a lot of space for
notes<00:00:22.620> that<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.400> may<00:00:23.700> not<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> train<00:00:24.240> in

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
notes that I may not have the train in

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.690 
notes that I may not have the train in
so<00:00:24.720> because<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.620> don't<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.310> turn<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.550> man

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
so because I don't have to turn the man

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.390 
so because I don't have to turn the man
like<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.330> didn't<00:00:27.900> like<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.110> spiral<00:00:28.650> notebooks

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
like I didn't like the spiral notebooks

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.730 
like I didn't like the spiral notebooks
so<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.670> got<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.090> composition<00:00:30.690> notebooks<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.290> I

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
so I got the composition notebooks and I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.360 
so I got the composition notebooks and I
got<00:00:31.890> two<00:00:32.129> of<00:00:32.430> every<00:00:32.790> color<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.570> i<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:34.370> two

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
got two of every color so i have two

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.439 
got two of every color so i have two
yellow<00:00:35.730> ones<00:00:36.059> here<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.899> i<00:00:37.879> marked<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
yellow ones here and i marked one of

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.540 
yellow ones here and i marked one of
them<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:40.170> i'll<00:00:40.469> just<00:00:40.859> save<00:00:41.039> this<00:00:41.280> one

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
them because i'll just save this one

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.360 
them because i'll just save this one
until<00:00:41.820> i<00:00:42.059> need<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.510> then<00:00:42.780> i<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:43.230> my<00:00:43.559> chemistry

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
until i need it then i have my chemistry

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.329 
until i need it then i have my chemistry
notebook<00:00:45.269> and<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.050> blue<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.859> i<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:47.159> to

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
notebook and this is blue so i have to

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.340 
notebook and this is blue so i have to
of<00:00:47.370> though<00:00:47.760> my<00:00:48.300> math<00:00:49.190> notebook<00:00:50.190> i<00:00:50.429> have<00:00:51.350> this

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
of though my math notebook i have this

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.750 
of though my math notebook i have this
one<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.829> didn't<00:00:53.100> work<00:00:53.219> any<00:00:53.429> of<00:00:53.579> them

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
one and I didn't work any of them

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.809 
one and I didn't work any of them
because<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.960> want<00:00:55.409> to<00:00:55.559> switch<00:00:55.859> to<00:00:56.249> an<00:00:56.489> honors

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:56.819 
because I want to switch to an honors

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:59.750 
because I want to switch to an honors
math<00:00:56.999> class<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.499> left<00:00:58.949> those<00:00:59.129> alone<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
math class so I left those alone and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.759 
math class so I left those alone and
then<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.909> have<00:01:00.089> another<00:01:00.120> purple<00:01:00.749> one<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.019> think

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
then I have another purple one I think

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.439 
then I have another purple one I think
it's<00:01:01.920> still<00:01:01.979> my<00:01:02.249> room<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.089> have<00:01:03.300> this

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
it's still my room but I have this

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.660 
it's still my room but I have this
purple<00:01:03.839> one<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.620> my<00:01:04.890> landscape

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
purple one and it's for my landscape

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.120 
purple one and it's for my landscape
architecture<00:01:06.180> class<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.870> I<00:01:06.900> also<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
architecture class what I also have is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.240 
architecture class what I also have is
this<00:01:08.549> composition<00:01:09.469> Bracken<00:01:10.469> notebook<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
this composition Bracken notebook and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.399 
this composition Bracken notebook and
basically<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.329> has<00:01:12.750> graphing<00:01:13.259> paper

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
basically it just has graphing paper

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.130 
basically it just has graphing paper
inside<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:15.060> probably<00:01:15.479> going<00:01:15.899> to<00:01:16.020> use

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
inside and I'm probably going to use

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.170 
inside and I'm probably going to use
this<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.590> chemistry<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.369> not<00:01:17.610> use<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> for

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
this for chemistry if not use it for

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.260 
this for chemistry if not use it for
math<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.659> vice<00:01:18.899> versa<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.149> an

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
math and vice versa so it can have an

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.060 
math and vice versa so it can have an
Andy<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.750> not<00:01:21.990> i<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.469> save<00:01:22.649> it<00:01:22.680> for

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
Andy if not i can just save it for

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.399 
Andy if not i can just save it for
whenever<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.490> need<00:01:23.969> graph<00:01:24.299> paper<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.229> what

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
whenever I do need graph paper so what

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.249 
whenever I do need graph paper so what
I'm<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.649> do<00:01:25.770> with<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.130> binder<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:27.259> type

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
I'm going to do with that binder is type

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.740 
I'm going to do with that binder is type
up<00:01:28.530> my<00:01:28.590> notes<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.399> am<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.759> love<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.270> type<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.719> notes

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
up my notes I am I love to type up notes

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.380 
up my notes I am I love to type up notes
just<00:01:31.259> because<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.770> easier<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.219> me<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.759> read

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
just because it's easier for me to read

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.149 
just because it's easier for me to read
and<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:33.689> also<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.020> form<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.320> repetition<00:01:34.920> I

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
and it's also a form of repetition I

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.609 
and it's also a form of repetition I
write<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.119> class<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.659> then<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.899> type<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.439> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
write it in class and then I type it and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.599 
write it in class and then I type it and
so<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.920> kind<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.689> study<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.840> twice<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.189> way<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
so I kind of study it twice in a way and

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.179 
so I kind of study it twice in a way and
then<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.320> keep<00:01:43.469> everything<00:01:43.680> nice<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
then I like to keep everything nice and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.670 
then I like to keep everything nice and
neat<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.630> when<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.869> comes<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.259> final

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
neat so that when it comes for the final

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.130 
neat so that when it comes for the final
I<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.130> everything<00:01:47.460> nice<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.119> organized<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
I have everything nice and organized and

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.039

I<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.549> all<00:01:50.789> of<00:01:50.850> my<00:01:51.090> notes<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.719> in<00:01:51.869> one

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
I have all of my notes just in one

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.709 
I have all of my notes just in one
binder<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.710> then<00:01:53.310> also<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.909> my<00:01:54.359> written

notes just to like refer back to things
if<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.030> had<00:01:57.060> some<00:01:57.329> drawings<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.840> there<00:01:57.990> or

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
if I had some drawings in there or

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.249 
if I had some drawings in there or
anything<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.679> so<00:01:59.100> yeah<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> think<00:02:00.299> that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
anything like that so yeah I think that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.800 
anything like that so yeah I think that
just<00:02:01.560> works<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:01.979> me<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.369> personally<00:02:02.759> love<00:02:03.270> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
just works for me I personally love to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.730 
just works for me I personally love to

things<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.460> write<00:02:05.640> things<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:07.140> another<00:02:07.860> way<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
things we write things so another way to

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.320 
things we write things so another way to
sort<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.330> substitute<00:02:09.959> my<00:02:10.200> my<00:02:11.180> binders<00:02:12.180> for

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
sort of substitute my my binders for

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.660 
sort of substitute my my binders for
each<00:02:12.480> class<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.260> think<00:02:13.680> I'm<00:02:13.860> just<00:02:13.920> going<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.520> do

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
each class I think I'm just going to do

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.780 
each class I think I'm just going to do
a<00:02:14.880> folder<00:02:15.510> for<00:02:15.660> each<00:02:15.720> class<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.800> have<00:02:17.250> my<00:02:17.550> mac

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
a folder for each class so I have my mac

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.760 
a folder for each class so I have my mac
chemistry<00:02:18.540> folder<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.200> just<00:02:19.380> says<00:02:19.500> Ken

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
chemistry folder and it just says Ken

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.290 
chemistry folder and it just says Ken
1201<00:02:20.510> general<00:02:21.510> chemistry<00:02:21.810> 1<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:23.090> I'm<00:02:24.090> just

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
1201 general chemistry 1 so I'm just

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.500 
1201 general chemistry 1 so I'm just
blue<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:25.080> then<00:02:25.349> la<00:02:25.860> stands<00:02:26.489> for<00:02:26.910> landscape

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
blue and then la stands for landscape

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.320 
blue and then la stands for landscape
architecture<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.319> it's<00:02:28.769> la<00:02:29.220> 1203<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.209> it's

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
architecture and it's la 1203 and it's

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.300 
architecture and it's la 1203 and it's
v's<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.989> American<00:02:31.380> landscape<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.160> it's

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
v's of the American landscape and it's

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.640 
v's of the American landscape and it's
an<00:02:32.400> elective<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.480> mine<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.019> then<00:02:34.470> another

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
an elective of mine and then another

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.090 
an elective of mine and then another
elective<00:02:35.099> is<00:02:35.250> art<00:02:35.810> 1001<00:02:36.810> its<00:02:37.410> introduction<00:02:37.799> to

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
elective is art 1001 its introduction to

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.240 
elective is art 1001 its introduction to
fine<00:02:38.250> arts<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.510> that's<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.780> yellow<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.560> I

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
fine arts so and that's a yellow and I

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.070 
fine arts so and that's a yellow and I
think<00:02:41.459> it's<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.670> spirals<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.630> case<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:42.989> I

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
think it's in spirals just in case if I

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.770 
think it's in spirals just in case if I
wanted<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.560> use<00:02:43.799> more<00:02:44.069> paper<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.060> i<00:02:45.090> got<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.540> blue

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
wanted to use more paper so i got a blue

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.190 
wanted to use more paper so i got a blue
one<00:02:46.049> for<00:02:46.350> 10<00:02:46.530> 12<00:02:46.769> 01<00:02:46.970> math<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.600> again<00:02:48.900> I

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
one for 10 12 01 math and I again I

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.870 
one for 10 12 01 math and I again I
didn't<00:02:49.560> write<00:02:49.680> anything<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.430> then<00:02:50.519> i<00:02:50.549> have

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
didn't write anything on and then i have

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.870 
didn't write anything on and then i have
my<00:02:51.150> landscape<00:02:51.690> architecture<00:02:52.350> book<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.519> this

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
my landscape architecture book and this

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.660 
my landscape architecture book and this
is<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.180> art<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:55.530> then<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.010> got<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.250> planner
