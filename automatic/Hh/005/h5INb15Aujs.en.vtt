if<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.500> important<00:00:56.160> why<00:00:56.309> don't<00:00:56.370> you

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
if it's that important why don't you

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.560 
if it's that important why don't you
wash<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.120> hair<00:00:57.360> every<00:00:58.320> day<00:00:59.329> for<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.390> same

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
reason that washing actually strips your

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.010 
reason that washing actually strips your
hair<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.860> essential<00:01:04.860> oils<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.540> don't<00:01:06.840> just

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
hair of essential oils so you don't just

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.080 
hair of essential oils so you don't just
strip<00:01:07.320> your<00:01:07.500> hair<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.890> secondly<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:08.970> your

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
strip your hair and secondly when your

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.830 
strip your hair and secondly when your
hair<00:01:09.299> grows<00:01:09.570> longer<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.710> more<00:01:11.810> timely<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
hair grows longer it's more timely and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.980 
hair grows longer it's more timely and
naughty<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:14.520> prime<00:01:14.880> time<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.299> had<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
naughty and that's prime time for had to
