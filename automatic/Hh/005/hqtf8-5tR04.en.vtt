00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:09.430
 Hebrews 10 22 that's why let's get close bye bye 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.219
 with sincere heart and a faith 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.219
 completely safe clean our 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.750
 Bad conscience hearts and washes 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.869
 our bodies with pure water 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.450
 reflection when we are in front of the 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.760
 presence of the Lord as best we can 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.760
 to do is to be honest with him 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.070
 He looks at our heart knows our 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.570
 intentions and knows what we're going to say 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.120
 but he in his immense love hopes that 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.260
 we talk to him and we open 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.260
 our being an angel 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.300
 every day our prayer should be 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.910
 may the Lord cleanse us from all sin 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.040
 of the sins of our mind from 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.470
 our soul and our body because 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.220
 many times we do not act badly but 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.220
 we think badly 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.370
 the gentleman is waiting for his children to 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.370
 approach you as children to talk with him 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.689
 to seek his advice but above all that 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.759
 we are cleansed with the blood of Christ 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.399
 so that every day we have the certainty 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.509
 that the father hears our prayer and 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.509
 let us walk with righteousness 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.369
 God is the most interested in you in that 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.920
 be successful that nothing is missing and only 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.710
 you will achieve it by clinging to it and leaving 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.549
 that day to day I washed you with your blood 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.119
 that purifies and gives you to drink from your water 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.119
 of eternal life 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:58.880
