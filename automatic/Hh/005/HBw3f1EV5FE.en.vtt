00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.450
 yielded to send us a screenshot of 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.759
 screen of your inbox without 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.410
 no problem as you can appreciate the 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.410
 average user but leaving safe 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:09.099
 in an environment that the colleague calls 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.819
 fucking geek a day at 8 a.m. and a 28 p.m. 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.819
 in the morning 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.970
 this contradictory accusation by part 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.860
 from this respected user of data field 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.740
 we have decided to enter in the afternoon and wrong 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.110
 to know what we found is not wrong 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.430
 it's wrong it gives you enough you could say 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.090
 which is a flickr page if we do not go 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:35.180
 more closely to see today we have it 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.180
 161 now it's pretty cold to compare 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.310
 but they bent 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.380
 In short, we have been investigating what 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.900
 happened on the 27th at 8 and 28 of the 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.520
 tomorrow this battle report belongs 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.370
 to a heading in operation meter of 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.000
 conquest from 1750 points on the top 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:06.080
 doublet of 132,000 points and see the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.720
 opposing team of ugly love if you get 67 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.070
 thousand mega by ugly aware of his 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.820
 condition of one of the best 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.820
 players 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.340
 to be so good neo morpheus not 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.290
 I understood how Facal invaded 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.270
 folded into points the continuation 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.140
 we can see how neo morpheus in an hour 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.120
 17 minutes gets 119 casualties and dies 82 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.160
 times statistics that contrast with 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.940
 the data of imataca that in an hour 13 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.860
 minutes gets 237 casualties and dies 53 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.620
 times and we are wondering 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.620
 how the hell dies 52 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.400
 in contact with the doctor and 17 years 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.760
 investigating the possibility that there 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.280
 guys in ps3 or if it was cuernavaca 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.990
 I am convinced that I am not good 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.090
 throughout my long career 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.069
 professional because I found things very 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.500
 amazing but nothing like the rest 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.030
 here 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.770
 I can say without fear of being wrong that 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.040
 what calls me from attacks are two 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.720
 eyes my human brain for these 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.709
 blunt statements from the doctor 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.139
 alain mod 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.030
 we said goodbye after what you can 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.980
 pass because use the bad hashtag 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.139
 cause Czechs to be able to denounce 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.370
 all together and this inadmissible practice 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.370
 of the 2003
