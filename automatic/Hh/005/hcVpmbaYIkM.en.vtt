00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
reviewing and using the split ender now

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.560 
reviewing and using the split ender now
I<00:00:14.469> have<00:00:14.799> already<00:00:14.980> done<00:00:15.340> a<00:00:15.400> video<00:00:15.700> on<00:00:15.879> this<00:00:16.030> but

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
I have already done a video on this but

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.570 
I have already done a video on this but
I<00:00:16.870> didn't<00:00:17.230> upload<00:00:17.470> it<00:00:17.770> because<00:00:18.130> it<00:00:18.370> was<00:00:18.550> a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
I didn't upload it because it was a

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.480 
I didn't upload it because it was a
negative<00:00:19.000> review<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.800> I<00:00:20.920> thought<00:00:21.160> that

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
negative review and I thought that

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.920 
negative review and I thought that
because<00:00:21.730> it<00:00:21.820> was<00:00:21.940> the<00:00:22.000> first<00:00:22.030> time<00:00:22.450> using<00:00:22.750> it

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
because it was the first time using it

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.930 
because it was the first time using it
maybe<00:00:23.620> I<00:00:23.770> hadn't<00:00:24.220> give<00:00:24.340> it<00:00:24.460> enough<00:00:24.640> chance

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
maybe I hadn't give it enough chance

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.690 
maybe I hadn't give it enough chance
when<00:00:25.450> I<00:00:25.480> first<00:00:25.720> used<00:00:25.840> it<00:00:26.170> I<00:00:26.440> did<00:00:27.190> not<00:00:27.400> think<00:00:27.580> it

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
when I first used it I did not think it

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.930 
when I first used it I did not think it
worked<00:00:27.970> and<00:00:28.300> I<00:00:28.510> did<00:00:28.690> not<00:00:28.870> like<00:00:29.050> it<00:00:29.080> I<00:00:29.940> thought

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
worked and I did not like it I thought

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.150 
worked and I did not like it I thought
it's<00:00:31.120> a<00:00:31.150> waste<00:00:31.330> of<00:00:31.480> money<00:00:31.570> because<00:00:31.810> yet<00:00:32.710> it<00:00:32.890> cut

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
it's a waste of money because yet it cut

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.400 
it's a waste of money because yet it cut
off<00:00:33.280> hair<00:00:33.550> but<00:00:33.910> I<00:00:34.149> still<00:00:34.660> had<00:00:34.809> a<00:00:34.840> load<00:00:35.050> of<00:00:35.200> split

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
off hair but I still had a load of split

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.560 
off hair but I still had a load of split
ends<00:00:35.620> however<00:00:36.429> um<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.730> then<00:00:39.730> used<00:00:40.120> it<00:00:40.329> again

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
ends however um I then used it again

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.069 
ends however um I then used it again
three<00:00:41.019> weeks<00:00:41.289> after<00:00:42.510> instead<00:00:43.510> of<00:00:43.629> leaving<00:00:43.870> it

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
three weeks after instead of leaving it

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.810

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
the full six to eight weeks I used it

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.220 
the full six to eight weeks I used it
three<00:00:46.030> weeks<00:00:46.179> after<00:00:46.329> because<00:00:46.629> I<00:00:46.659> had<00:00:46.839> so<00:00:47.109> many

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
three weeks after because I had so many

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.029

of your split ends but if you're like me
and<00:04:09.980> you<00:04:10.070> had<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.220> lot<00:04:10.400> of<00:04:10.430> split<00:04:10.760> ends<00:04:10.970> then<00:04:11.270> I

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
and you had a lot of split ends then I

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.590 
and you had a lot of split ends then I
recommend<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:11.900> use<00:04:11.960> it<00:04:13.120> three<00:04:14.120> weeks<00:04:14.330> after

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
recommend you use it three weeks after

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.690 
recommend you use it three weeks after
your<00:04:14.840> first<00:04:14.990> use<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:15.590> then<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.220> six<00:04:16.460> weeks

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
your first use and then the six weeks

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.280 
your first use and then the six weeks
after<00:04:16.880> because<00:04:17.360> it<00:04:17.600> really<00:04:17.900> did<00:04:18.080> make<00:04:18.230> a

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
after because it really did make a

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.400 
after because it really did make a
difference<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:18.980> then<00:04:19.850> always<00:04:20.210> cut<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.080> ends<00:04:21.320> of

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
difference I then always cut the ends of

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.960 
difference I then always cut the ends of
my<00:04:21.440> hair<00:04:21.560> with<00:04:22.010> scissors<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:22.670> that<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:22.820> know

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
my hair with scissors so that I know

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.180 
my hair with scissors so that I know
that<00:04:23.270> I've<00:04:23.360> got<00:04:23.480> a<00:04:23.510> proper<00:04:23.900> trim<00:04:24.140> on<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.890> ends

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
that I've got a proper trim on the ends

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.020 
that I've got a proper trim on the ends
of<00:04:25.280> my<00:04:25.460> hair<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:26.320> because<00:04:27.320> it<00:04:27.440> doesn't

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
of my hair and because it doesn't

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.910 
of my hair and because it doesn't
necessarily<00:04:29.030> trim<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:30.140> just<00:04:30.200> gets<00:04:30.620> rid<00:04:30.740> of

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
necessarily trim it just gets rid of

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.960 
necessarily trim it just gets rid of
your<00:04:31.070> split<00:04:31.370> ends<00:04:31.730> now<00:04:32.660> um<00:04:33.310> as<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.370> product<00:04:34.880> like
