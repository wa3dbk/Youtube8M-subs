give you a real talking to but otherwise

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.819 
give you a real talking to but otherwise
you<00:00:38.510> can<00:00:38.660> still<00:00:38.840> sort<00:00:39.050> plenty<00:00:39.380> of<00:00:39.440> stuff<00:00:39.620> on<00:00:39.800> it

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
you can still sort plenty of stuff on it

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.470 
you can still sort plenty of stuff on it
and<00:00:40.040> it's<00:00:40.160> obviously<00:00:40.520> it's<00:00:40.730> a<00:00:40.910> double<00:00:41.330> what

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
and it's obviously it's a double what

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.150 
and it's obviously it's a double what
you'd<00:00:41.630> get<00:00:41.840> on<00:00:42.140> something<00:00:42.860> like<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.130> I

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
you'd get on something like the I

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.470 
you'd get on something like the I
shuffle<00:00:43.700> which<00:00:43.850> is<00:00:43.970> the<00:00:44.030> kind<00:00:44.210> of<00:00:44.240> thing<00:00:44.300> is

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
shuffle which is the kind of thing is

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.110 
shuffle which is the kind of thing is
competing<00:00:44.810> with<00:00:45.550> now<00:00:46.550> what<00:00:46.580> I<00:00:46.730> like<00:00:47.090> about

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
competing with now what I like about

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.670 
competing with now what I like about
this<00:00:47.360> obviously<00:00:47.960> rather<00:00:48.140> than<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.320> shuffle

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
this obviously rather than a shuffle

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.500 
this obviously rather than a shuffle
it's<00:00:48.800> got<00:00:48.950> a<00:00:48.980> really<00:00:49.190> nice<00:00:49.430> organic<00:00:49.940> LED

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
it's got a really nice organic LED

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.180 
it's got a really nice organic LED
display<00:00:50.990> than<00:00:51.260> if<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.410> can<00:00:51.530> see<00:00:51.710> that<00:00:51.950> there

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
display than if you can see that there

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.510 
display than if you can see that there
but<00:00:52.790> it's<00:00:53.000> really<00:00:53.330> really<00:00:53.600> tasty<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.340> you<00:00:55.340> can

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
but it's really really tasty and you can

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.100 
but it's really really tasty and you can
basically<00:00:55.760> do<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.150> whole<00:00:56.450> thing<00:00:56.480> with<00:00:56.930> one

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
basically do the whole thing with one

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.100 
basically do the whole thing with one
hand<00:00:57.380> which<00:00:57.680> is<00:00:57.830> great<00:00:58.160> now<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:59.600> other<00:00:59.780> thing

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
hand which is great now the other thing

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.780 
hand which is great now the other thing
I<00:01:00.350> like<00:01:00.710> about<00:01:00.740> this<00:01:01.100> is<00:01:01.160> even<00:01:01.550> when<00:01:01.640> it's

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
I like about this is even when it's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.390 
I like about this is even when it's
locked<00:01:02.060> as<00:01:02.240> you'll<00:01:02.390> see<00:01:02.570> they're<00:01:02.810> all<00:01:03.170> the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
locked as you'll see they're all the

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.620 
locked as you'll see they're all the
buttons<00:01:04.400> which<00:01:04.549> are<00:01:04.699> mostly<00:01:05.150> on<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.360> display

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
buttons which are mostly on the display

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.679 
buttons which are mostly on the display
itself<00:01:06.970> even<00:01:07.970> when<00:01:08.210> it's<00:01:08.330> locked<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:08.659> can

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
itself even when it's locked you can

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.890 
itself even when it's locked you can
still<00:01:08.840> change<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.830> volume<00:01:10.570> which<00:01:11.570> I<00:01:11.720> like<00:01:11.869> a

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
works really quite nicely that it also

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.859

sitting area quite nicely they're not
that<00:02:04.639> better<00:02:04.909> than<00:02:04.969> the<00:02:05.149> apple<00:02:06.139> earphones

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
battery life and I can't think that I've

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.520 
battery life and I can't think that I've
actually<00:02:22.239> got<00:02:22.480> through<00:02:22.510> 20<00:02:22.989> hours<00:02:23.170> yet<00:02:23.379> but

I've charged it up once and i haven't
had<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.970> charge<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.390> again<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:26.230> i'm<00:02:26.379> willing<00:02:26.680> to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
had to charge it again so i'm willing to

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.280 
had to charge it again so i'm willing to
believe<00:02:26.890> what<00:02:27.160> they<00:02:27.250> say<00:02:27.459> about<00:02:27.489> Matt<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.989> use

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
believe what they say about Matt you use

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.410 
believe what they say about Matt you use
it's<00:02:29.739> connected<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.340> your<00:02:30.550> computer<00:02:30.670> just<00:02:31.030> by

it's connected to your computer just by
standard<00:02:31.930> USB<00:02:32.799> that's<00:02:33.250> hidden<00:02:33.430> panel<00:02:33.790> just

then<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.080> can<00:02:35.260> see<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:36.310> what<00:02:36.610> quite

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
then you can see that and what quite

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.930 
then you can see that and what quite
like<00:02:37.000> as<00:02:37.180> well<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:38.230> on<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:39.519> software

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
like as well is that on the software

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.030 
like as well is that on the software
that<00:02:39.970> comes<00:02:40.299> with<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:41.319> not<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:41.769> you<00:02:41.890> really

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
that comes with it's not like you really

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.289 
that comes with it's not like you really
have<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.250> install<00:02:42.549> anything<00:02:42.879> that

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
have to install anything that

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
complicated you can just drag and drop

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.039 
complicated you can just drag and drop
it<00:02:44.799> using<00:02:45.250> using<00:02:45.549> normal<00:02:45.940> windows<00:02:46.599> explorer

fantastic now the other thing that's a
little<00:02:56.799> bit<00:02:56.890> dubious<00:02:57.340> about<00:02:57.670> it's<00:02:58.000> it's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
little bit dubious about it's it's

little bit dubious about it's it's
really<00:02:58.390> your<00:02:58.540> call<00:02:58.569> is<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.560> does<00:02:59.709> have

Phillips full sound technology which

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.720 
Phillips full sound technology which
really<00:03:02.319> what<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.620> means<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.099> it<00:03:03.220> up<00:03:03.400> scales

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
really what it means is it up scales

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.600 
really what it means is it up scales
that<00:03:03.849> sounds<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.269> little<00:03:04.480> bit<00:03:04.629> for<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:05.019> now<00:03:05.769> you

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
open that Oh 3 milliwatts in each year

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.129 
open that Oh 3 milliwatts in each year
which<00:03:23.579> for<00:03:24.579> me<00:03:24.730> isn't<00:03:25.030> quite<00:03:25.600> loud<00:03:25.840> enough

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
which for me isn't quite loud enough

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.960 
which for me isn't quite loud enough
when<00:03:26.260> I'm<00:03:26.350> on<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.500> tube<00:03:26.769> with<00:03:26.950> this<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.400> can<00:03:27.519> do

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
when I'm on the tube with this I can do

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.610 
when I'm on the tube with this I can do
full<00:03:28.329> volume<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:28.780> can<00:03:28.900> just<00:03:29.049> about<00:03:29.230> here<00:03:29.440> what

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
full volume I can just about here what

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.780 
full volume I can just about here what
what's<00:03:29.889> going<00:03:30.190> on<00:03:30.280> without<00:03:30.430> too<00:03:30.670> much

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
what's going on without too much

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.400 
what's going on without too much
distractions<00:03:31.420> but<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:31.989> really<00:03:32.200> would<00:03:32.290> like

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
distractions but I really would like

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.229 
distractions but I really would like
just<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.799> little<00:03:33.220> bit<00:03:33.370> more<00:03:33.579> on<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:33.880> even<00:03:34.150> if

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
just a little bit more on that even if

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.940 
just a little bit more on that even if
it<00:03:34.329> is<00:03:34.420> destroying<00:03:34.750> my<00:03:34.959> ears<00:03:35.170> states<00:03:35.470> kind<00:03:35.769> of

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
it is destroying my ears states kind of

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.030 
it is destroying my ears states kind of
my<00:03:36.040> total<00:03:36.430> after<00:03:36.700> all<00:03:37.380> what<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.500> get<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:38.889> mean

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
my total after all what you get I mean

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.490 
my total after all what you get I mean
obviously<00:03:39.280> all<00:03:39.609> of<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:39.880> comes<00:03:40.269> in<00:03:40.450> at<00:03:40.599> 39<00:03:41.109> 99

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
obviously all of this comes in at 39 99

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.410 
obviously all of this comes in at 39 99
which<00:03:41.889> is<00:03:42.040> really<00:03:42.250> quite<00:03:42.790> reasonable<00:03:43.329> I<00:03:43.389> think

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
which is really quite reasonable I think

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.240 
which is really quite reasonable I think
for<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.810> package<00:03:44.049> you<00:03:44.739> know<00:03:44.829> if<00:03:44.919> you<00:03:45.010> want<00:03:45.190> a

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
for the package you know if you want a

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.400 
for the package you know if you want a
serious<00:03:45.549> mp3<00:03:46.269> player<00:03:46.480> go<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:46.780> buy<00:03:46.930> one<00:03:47.200> but

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
serious mp3 player go and buy one but

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.020 
serious mp3 player go and buy one but
otherwise<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:47.769> think<00:03:48.010> compared<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:48.940> the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
otherwise I think compared to the

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.580 
otherwise I think compared to the
shuffle<00:03:49.419> I<00:03:49.480> thinks<00:03:49.720> it's<00:03:49.780> got<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:49.989> lot<00:03:50.169> going<00:03:50.230> on

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
shuffle I thinks it's got a lot going on

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.210 
shuffle I thinks it's got a lot going on
it's<00:03:50.859> only<00:03:51.010> if<00:03:51.099> you<00:03:51.250> could<00:03:51.459> more<00:03:51.639> expensive<00:03:52.209> um

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
it's only if you could more expensive um

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.659 
it's only if you could more expensive um
other<00:03:54.220> than<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:55.799> no<00:03:56.799> in<00:03:57.040> fact<00:03:57.190> that's<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.639> I

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
other than that no in fact that's that I

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.670 
other than that no in fact that's that I
think<00:03:58.090> that's<00:03:58.239> it's<00:03:58.540> not<00:03:58.720> too<00:03:58.870> bad<00:03:59.049> awful<00:03:59.440> I

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
think that's it's not too bad awful I

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.229 
think that's it's not too bad awful I
don't<00:04:00.069> say<00:04:00.280> go<00:04:00.459> with<00:04:00.609> this<00:04:00.760> if<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.030> really

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
don't say go with this if you really

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.000 
don't say go with this if you really
fancy<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.569> low<00:04:01.720> anything<00:04:02.109> problem<00:04:02.739> is<00:04:02.799> it<00:04:02.889> is

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
fancy a low anything problem is it is

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.440 
fancy a low anything problem is it is
competing<00:04:03.489> with<00:04:03.639> something<00:04:04.060> like<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.209> mobile

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
competing with something like a mobile

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.559 
competing with something like a mobile
phone<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.530> it's<00:04:06.250> kind<00:04:06.669> of<00:04:06.730> hard<00:04:06.790> but<00:04:07.239> I<00:04:07.269> think

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
phone so it's kind of hard but I think

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.900 
phone so it's kind of hard but I think
the<00:04:07.720> capacity<00:04:08.230> for<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.530> display<00:04:08.950> for<00:04:09.819> the

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
the capacity for the display for the

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.110 
the capacity for the display for the
design<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:10.810> lightness<00:04:11.230> what<00:04:11.560> they<00:04:11.680> are<00:04:11.799> like

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.180
