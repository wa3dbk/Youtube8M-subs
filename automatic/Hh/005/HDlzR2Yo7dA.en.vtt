00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello yes q cubero see the one minute 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.150
 club before you start with these examples 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.700
 of f2 the basic axis I remind you that 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.620
 I am on twitter on Facebook I leave you the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.040
 links out there you can also ask me 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.420
 Any doubt that you have well also 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.640
 I leave the link of the list of 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.230
 reproduction of f2 l academy where I've 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.869
 made an introduction and where he explained 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.029
 the first three basic cases that I'm going 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.269
 to use to solve these three 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.130
 cubes the first two rows because I do 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.929
 this video because we have all been 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.969
 beginners sometime and there are many 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.020
 videos on youtube the world brooks shows 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.370
 that are called that people solve it 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.829
 explaining the slow ones is supposed but in 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.510
 they actually do it pretty fast and if 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.309
 you are not an expert, you may not be 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.039
 understand why they put you in some case 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.350
 advanced then to those who have 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.870
 more experience I ask for patience this 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.590
 example these examples are for 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.110
 beginners 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.970
 and later I'll put more cases 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.730
 advanced but now of course that 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.010
 let's rotate a single cube things that we 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.550
 they waste a little time but it 's 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.869
 important because it is efe 2 the basic 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.450
 well let's go there I've already mixed the cubes 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.080
 the resolved the cross of all of them and 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.270
 let's do 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.869
 efe 12 we will find the pieces that 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.810
 we are interested in the top layer that 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.180
 we have blue and red blue and red two 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.970
 different colors this is the case 1 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.700
 then but it is misguided I would have 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.590
 to go the edge here to join them 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.570
 so I will not join them because there is 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.330
 white here then we hide the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.479
 corner to move the edge where we 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.160
 interesting we take the corner over 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.490
 where it has to go between the center 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.790
 blue and red and we insert it as 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.600
 I explained in case 1 that more things 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:57.170
 we have here blue and orange blue 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.830
 and orange same color above case 3 we 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.830
 We take the corner where you have to go 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.960
 If the target is here, it tells me that 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:11.260
 we turn this layer for her we hide 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.290
 we return 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.720
 the top layer to join them and 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.720
 insert it as we already know well 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.510
 two pieces that we are interested in block two 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.329
 for one together you have to separate it as the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.650
 separated because it hides the corner and but 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.019
 watch out 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.269
 I'm going to break this block that I already have 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.849
 formed then you have to do it from 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.239
 way here there is no block formed 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.670
 here we can move with freedom 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.680
 to hide the corner move the edge 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.659
 and go up the corner again that case is 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.730
 this case two white piece up 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:53.870
 we look for the center that in this case is 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.440
 the green and 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.390
 we take it to the opposite color here 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.230
 we have the red because we will have to take it 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.319
 towards the orange we put the corner and 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.019
 we insert it as we already know we have left 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.440
 only one that is the case 3 same color 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:16.129
 We take the corner up to your site and 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.400
 the white tells us that for there the 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:22.909
 we hide we carry the edge so that 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.620
 join and insert as we already know cube 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.680
 solved well 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.220
 next case let's see what we have 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.530
 around here if blue and red blue and red 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.709
 white above we already know that is the case 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.010
 2 you have to align with the center here 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.409
 we're wearing it so it's the color 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.390
 opposite here is the red then to the side 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.379
 contrary 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:52.010
 join we have the block and insert it 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:54.900
 where it corresponds well we have been trained 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.400
 automatically a pair state defect 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:04.769
 it happens it's luck that we save ourselves 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:06.910
 we insert it in your site here we have a 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.960
 see what we have left 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.120
 if better this is the case 1 colors 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.540
 opposites is already well oriented over 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.880
 from your corner as easy as this 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.660
 and in passing we have separated the two pieces 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.930
 that had together that is the case 3 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:30.330
 for already indicates the white track 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.810
 we hide we recover is already united and 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.990
 we insert 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.780
 we go with the last cube that we see by 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.639
 here that we see here these two pieces 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.750
 that are united because we are going to separate 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:47.720
 we hide them corner is the case 3 same 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.400
 color up then I take the corner 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.260
 where you have to go this time is 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.690
 the white here tells us that you have to 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.990
 bring the upper face there 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.950
 we hide 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.390
 we make two to take the edge and 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.260
 we recover the corner we have the block 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:07.230
 two for one already inserted perfect case 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.630
 one with orange and green colors 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:13.560
 different is already well oriented so 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.550
 easy as this we go there we have this 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.550
 block that should be separated 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.750
 so we used this free space 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.580
 here to hide the corner without 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.910
 undo nothing we take away the 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.160
 edge and we have this next pair 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.310
 which is the case 1 different colors 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.880
 we insert the last one where 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.950
 there is the edge here because we will have to 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.230
 climb it up we take the corner 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.550
 here for example to use this 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.290
 free hollow we take the edge and already the 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.350
 we have separate without undoing anything 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:53.070
 green color we line towards the color 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.710
 otherwise we take the edge together 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.140
 with the corner and we insert everything 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.170
 efe 2 l by the way this is a buffoon 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:04.050
 version 2 this cube waylon version 2 and 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.180
 aol on version 2 I hope you have been 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.210
 useful of course we could have done 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.490
 advanced cases and have saved many 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.620
 movements and many rotations but 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:18.210
 this is these are the most 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.639
 basic we will soon make more videos 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.740
 advanced 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.780
 before we go to rest a bit of 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.520
 l'academy effects I'm going to change a bit 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.669
 of theme in the coming days and 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.460
 weeks and later I'll come back with 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.169
 l f2 videos Advanced hope you 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.909
 have liked and soon more videos in 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.909
 one minute and then cuberos
