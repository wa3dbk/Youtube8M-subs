 could have happened 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.289
 such animations arrive in the dense 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.730
 populated island state in Taiwan 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.980

 news channels daily each other 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.979
 with sensational messages the videos in

 biggest boulevard newspaper apple daily 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.590
 we can meet the trend and the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.369
 technical development is not 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.619
 oppose 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.840
 the young generation has become so much 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.130
 accustomed to the internet we can do it 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.979
 not necessarily to read newspaper again 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:35.850
 instead of going online 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:38.369
 Impossible already printed is apple daily 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.720

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.790
 Detailed who wants more can in the net 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.240

 animations counts apple daily 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.430
 in the cut on the day 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.060
 what like an action movie or 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.280
 computer games therefore comes from 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.149
 daily news with real 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.890
 exercise and sacrifice 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.630
 is currently producing with actors 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.450
 carry the infrared sensors 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.970
 Scenes like this brawl end up that way 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.940
 as an animated stick figure directly in the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:27.880
 computer up to 50 such videos 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:30.130
 arise here more than 100 per day 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.709
 Animators work for apple daily 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.930
 often until late in the night they give the 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.010
 stick figure a new look and 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.050
 can with a huge 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.910
 graphics library every imaginable 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.250
 adjust situation 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.760
 It only takes three hours from the idea 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.799
 then real life is up to the finished animation 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.610
 only the message behind the 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.709
 animation just looks like tiger 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.590
 Woods wife him with the golf club 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.540
 has driven to the accident or how the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.260
 earthquake victims of haiti really 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.360
 died 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.660
 the makers of apple daily know that 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.660
 Not 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.920
 if we have missing pictures by 3d 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.410
 We can reenact the animations 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.840
 tell a whole story without lying 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.480
 that's the number one rule we think 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.520
 we do not fool we do not fake us 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.140
 Just stick to the stars 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.120
 but according to many journalists in 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.080
 Taiwan does apple daily just that 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.940
 fake 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.099
 by constructing the reality 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.930
 Journalist can not know everything you can 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.660
 suggests to the audience he would be live 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.340
 and everything would have happened exactly like that 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.350
 but that is a false impression of 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.480
 a journalist becomes a dramatist 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:54.360
 staged a piece instead of the 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.910
 to report reality the makers of 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.010
 apple daily does not bother that you are planning 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.110
 its own news station and 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.750
 Also want to tailor made for foreign countries 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.940
 Media produce some videos there are 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.400
 already in English about the late night 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.030
 war at nbc as a battle of 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.030
 superheroes 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.260
 still no German interested 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.419
 reported at apple daily 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.190
 but successful business models in the 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.669
 internet are known to spread 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.650
 fast 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.600
 maybe there will be German too 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.600
 Boulevard news made in Taiwan
