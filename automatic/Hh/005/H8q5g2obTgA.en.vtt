00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
thinking of making a playlist and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.299 
thinking of making a playlist and
putting<00:00:37.140> all<00:00:37.260> these<00:00:37.410> videos<00:00:37.680> together<00:00:37.860> called

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
putting all these videos together called

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.890 
putting all these videos together called
full<00:00:38.550> auto<00:00:38.699> fun<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.270> hopefully<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:39.660> just

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900

generally speaking I like shooting guns
kind<00:01:24.660> of<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.870> little<00:01:25.080> bursts<00:01:25.290> anyways<00:01:25.830> because

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
kind of in little bursts anyways because

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.700 
kind of in little bursts anyways because
you<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:26.970> hold<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.300> trigger<00:01:27.570> down<00:01:27.810> other

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you just hold the trigger down other

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.470 
you just hold the trigger down other
than<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> draws<00:01:29.340> Blackbird<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.210> draws

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
than the draws Blackbird and the draws

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.450

holding<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.440> trigger<00:01:31.650> down<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:32.190> pretty

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
holding the trigger down you're pretty

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.130 
holding the trigger down you're pretty
much<00:01:32.640> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.910> run<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.270> bb's<00:01:33.570> really

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
much going to run out of bb's really

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.390 
much going to run out of bb's really
quick<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.560> most<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.890> those<00:01:34.980> are<00:01:35.160> just<00:01:35.220> going

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
quick and most of those are just going

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.460 
quick and most of those are just going
to<00:01:35.520> kind<00:01:35.730> of<00:01:35.790> go<00:01:35.910> all<00:01:36.030> over<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> place<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:37.230> um

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
to kind of go all over the place but um

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.170 
to kind of go all over the place but um
and<00:01:38.070> that's<00:01:38.310> probably<00:01:38.550> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.910> the<00:01:39.000> case

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
and that's probably going to be the case

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
and that's probably going to be the case
here<00:01:39.360> with<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.600> GSG<00:01:39.990> 92<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.590> got<00:01:40.740> lots<00:01:40.950> of

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
here with this GSG 92 it's got lots of

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.710

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
near the end it seemed to settle down I

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.789 
near the end it seemed to settle down I
could<00:03:12.970> probably<00:03:13.209> get<00:03:13.450> another<00:03:14.260> couple<00:03:14.560> nice

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.099 
the two and I'd have to reload them all
too<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.150> know<00:03:19.239> it<00:03:19.390> takes<00:03:19.569> time<00:03:19.750> but<00:03:19.810> whatever

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
too you know it takes time but whatever

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.530 
too you know it takes time but whatever
looks<00:03:20.799> like<00:03:20.950> we<00:03:21.040> got<00:03:21.220> one<00:03:21.819> two<00:03:22.000> three<00:03:22.030> four

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
too bad they didn't blast to pieces like

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.670 
too bad they didn't blast to pieces like
