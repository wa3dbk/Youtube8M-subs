00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.890 
like lots of the time like cuz the board
will<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.849> you<00:04:03.909> first<00:04:04.120> start<00:04:04.329> to<00:04:04.389> learn<00:04:04.510> up<00:04:04.720> and

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
will and you first start to learn up and

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.300 
will and you first start to learn up and
for<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.859> while<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.940> board<00:04:07.209> will<00:04:07.569> like<00:04:08.530> look<00:04:09.459> out

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
for a while the board will like look out

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.789 
for a while the board will like look out
that<00:04:12.310> way<00:04:12.959> in<00:04:13.959> front<00:04:14.019> of<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.379> and<00:04:14.620> you're

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
that way in front of you and you're

that way in front of you and you're
going<00:04:14.919> to<00:04:15.010> jump<00:04:15.430> with<00:04:15.609> the<00:04:15.639> board<00:04:15.970> so<00:04:16.750> it's

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
going to jump with the board so it's

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.879 
going to jump with the board so it's
really<00:04:18.190> crucial<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.880> you<00:04:19.019> land<00:04:20.019> right<00:04:20.620> on

really crucial that you land right on

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.670 
really crucial that you land right on
the<00:04:21.190> bolts<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:24.330> not<00:04:25.330> like<00:04:25.630> threaten<00:04:26.410> another

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
the bolts and not like threaten another

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.390 
the bolts and not like threaten another
board<00:04:27.240> and

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
board and

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.390 
board and
