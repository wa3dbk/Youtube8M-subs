innards out there but this is again one
of<00:00:21.000> those<00:00:21.380> multitasking<00:00:22.380> things<00:00:22.740> that's

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
of those multitasking things that's

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.920 
of those multitasking things that's
gonna<00:00:23.010> save<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.519> hopefully<00:00:23.970> yeah<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.810> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
gonna save you hopefully yeah I have to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.240 
gonna save you hopefully yeah I have to
say<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.470> probably<00:00:25.830> one<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
say that this is probably one of the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.820 
say that this is probably one of the
vehicles<00:00:26.609> I'm<00:00:26.760> more<00:00:27.330> excited<00:00:27.840> about<00:00:28.170> it's

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
vehicles I'm more excited about it's

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.609 
vehicles I'm more excited about it's
cool<00:00:29.160> I'm<00:00:29.580> natured<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.539> futuristic<00:00:31.050> as<00:00:31.439> hell

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619

and I really really like that and it
reminds<00:00:33.870> me<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.370> aspects<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.520> things<00:00:35.910> that

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
reminds me of aspects of things that

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.720 
reminds me of aspects of things that
we've<00:00:36.149> seen<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.450> Mad<00:00:36.630> Max<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.350> James<00:00:37.950> Bond<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
we've seen in Mad Max and James Bond and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
clear on that oh my share was in that

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.770 
clear on that oh my share was in that
movie<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.200> she<00:00:49.530> doesn't<00:00:49.980> matter<00:00:50.100> um<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:51.090> it's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
movie and she doesn't matter um but it's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.709 
movie and she doesn't matter um but it's
a<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.770> land<00:00:53.039> vehicle<00:00:53.160> primarily<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.420> it

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
a it's a land vehicle primarily and it

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.049 
a it's a land vehicle primarily and it
goes<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.410> fast<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:56.340> really

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
goes really really fast it's really

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.939 
goes really really fast it's really
really<00:00:57.480> maneuverable<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> space<00:00:58.920> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
really maneuverable and in the space of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.340 
really maneuverable and in the space of
about<00:00:59.219> ten<00:00:59.579> minutes<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.000> transforms<00:01:00.690> into<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
about ten minutes it transforms into a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.640 
about ten minutes it transforms into a
gyrocopter<00:01:02.280> which<00:01:03.239> actually<00:01:03.449> flies<00:01:04.019> below

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
gyrocopter which actually flies below

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.640 
gyrocopter which actually flies below
commercial<00:01:05.430> air<00:01:05.610> traffic<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.330> don't<00:01:06.720> have

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
commercial air traffic so you don't have

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.950 
commercial air traffic so you don't have
to<00:01:07.799> worry<00:01:08.040> about<00:01:08.189> running<00:01:08.850> into<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.840> know

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
to worry about running into you know

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.289 
to worry about running into you know
like<00:01:10.260> passenger<00:01:10.770> planes<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.490> now<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.000> thing

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
like passenger planes are now the thing

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.090 
like passenger planes are now the thing
that<00:01:12.420> was<00:01:12.479> charged<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.380> was<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.590> how<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> it

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that was charged I was like how is it

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.820 
that was charged I was like how is it
how<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.820> possible<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> guess<00:01:16.110> it's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
how is this possible but I guess it's

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.100 
how is this possible but I guess it's
just<00:01:17.070> yet<00:01:17.520> fly<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.880> low<00:01:18.180> enough<00:01:18.330> flies<00:01:18.869> low

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
just yet fly is low enough flies low

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.510 
just yet fly is low enough flies low
enough<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.530> mean<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.009> still<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> get

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
enough I mean you still have to get

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.120 
enough I mean you still have to get

big<00:01:47.189> beef<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.720> though<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.619> it

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
big beef with this though is that it

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.030 
big beef with this though is that it
does<00:01:50.310> take<00:01:50.670> some<00:01:50.880> time<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.570> convert<00:01:52.110> from<00:01:52.649> land

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
does take some time to convert from land

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.480 
does take some time to convert from land
vehicle<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:54.229> flying<00:01:55.229> vehicle<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.280> you're
