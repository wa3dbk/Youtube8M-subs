what's up everyone we're going to do a
speed<00:00:04.170> test<00:00:04.200> today<00:00:04.710> on<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.950> iPhone<00:00:05.250> 5s

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
speed test today on the iPhone 5s

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.320 
speed test today on the iPhone 5s
running<00:00:06.180> iOS<00:00:06.330> 7<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.799> iPhone<00:00:08.189> 4s<00:00:08.519> which<00:00:09.210> is

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
running iOS 7 and the iPhone 4s which is

running iOS 7 and the iPhone 4s which is
running<00:00:09.570> iOS<00:00:09.690> 6<00:00:10.349> we<00:00:11.040> left<00:00:11.280> iOS<00:00:11.940> 6<00:00:12.389> operating

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
running iOS 6 we left iOS 6 operating

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.070 
running iOS 6 we left iOS 6 operating
system<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.040> 4s<00:00:14.400> because<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.330> runs<00:00:15.540> faster

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
system on the 4s because it runs faster

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.099 
system on the 4s because it runs faster
the<00:00:16.230> iOS<00:00:16.560> 7<00:00:16.859> was<00:00:16.980> really<00:00:17.250> making<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.580> drag<00:00:18.109> so

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
the iOS 7 was really making a drag so

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.300 
the iOS 7 was really making a drag so
let's<00:00:19.949> run<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.760> speed<00:00:21.240> test<00:00:21.510> we're<00:00:21.840> going<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
let's run a speed test we're going to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.359 
let's run a speed test we're going to
load<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.490> both<00:00:26.840> speed<00:00:27.840> speed<00:00:28.410> test<00:00:28.680> apps<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
load up both speed speed test apps and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.460 
load up both speed speed test apps and
we're<00:00:29.699> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.939> hit<00:00:30.210> begin<00:00:30.539> test<00:00:30.869> here<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.349> go

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
we're going to hit begin test here we go

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.930 
we're going to hit begin test here we go
same<00:00:31.830> time<00:00:32.510> there<00:00:33.510> goes<00:00:33.920> ok<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.100> iPhone<00:00:35.370> 5s<00:00:35.760> on

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
same time there goes ok the iPhone 5s on

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.910 
same time there goes ok the iPhone 5s on
the<00:00:36.000> left<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.930> iPhone<00:00:37.290> 4s<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.219> right<00:00:39.680> ok

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the left the iPhone 4s on the right ok

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.720 
the left the iPhone 4s on the right ok
it<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.190> testing<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.110> will<00:00:43.110> mention<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
it is testing I will mention that the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.970 
it is testing I will mention that the
capacity<00:00:45.420> right<00:00:46.260> now<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:47.160> both<00:00:47.460> iPhones

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
capacity right now for both iPhones

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.430 
capacity right now for both iPhones
storage<00:00:49.980> has<00:00:50.809> 3/4<00:00:52.579> empty<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:55.079> how<00:00:55.289> much

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
storage has 3/4 empty so that's how much

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.139 
storage has 3/4 empty so that's how much
space<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:55.949> available<00:00:56.190> three<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.000> three

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
space we have available three of three

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.130 
space we have available three of three
quarters<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> 16<00:00:59.520> gig<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.539> 12

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
quarters so on the 16 gig we have 12

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.729 
quarters so on the 16 gig we have 12
gigs<00:01:01.410> free<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.489> 32<00:01:03.000> gig<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:03.989> 24<00:01:04.470> gigs

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
gigs free on the 32 gig we have 24 gigs

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.640 
gigs free on the 32 gig we have 24 gigs
free<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.360> tried<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.479> get<00:01:06.570> them<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.869> close<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
free I tried to get them as close to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.960 
free I tried to get them as close to
compare<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.790> compare<00:01:09.119> them<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.689> possible

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
compare to compare them as possible

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.039 
compare to compare them as possible
okay<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.060> first<00:01:12.390> test<00:01:13.909> 4.60<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> download

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
okay so first test 4.60 for the download

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.810 
okay so first test 4.60 for the download
for<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> 5s<00:01:18.110> 6.80<00:01:20.990> for<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.380> 4s<00:01:22.799> also<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> big

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
for the 5s 6.80 for the 4s also a big

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.960 
for the 5s 6.80 for the 4s also a big
difference<00:01:24.150> 4.5<00:01:24.869> 1<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.979> upload<00:01:26.400> speed<00:01:26.640> for

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
difference 4.5 1 on the upload speed for

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.679 
difference 4.5 1 on the upload speed for
the<00:01:27.030> 5s<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.799> point<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.369> zero<00:01:29.759> let's<00:01:30.420> run

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the 5s and point to zero let's run

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.530 
the 5s and point to zero let's run
another<00:01:30.810> test<00:01:31.229> restart<00:01:31.979> test<00:01:32.280> there<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.360> go

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
another test restart test there they go

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.460 
another test restart test there they go
i<00:01:35.210> will<00:01:36.210> also<00:01:36.329> make<00:01:36.420> mention<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:37.020> no<00:01:37.200> apps

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
i will also make mention that no apps

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.830 
i will also make mention that no apps
are<00:01:37.680> being<00:01:37.829> run<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:39.299> only<00:01:39.509> thing<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.780> right

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
are being run the only thing on right

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.490 
are being run the only thing on right
now<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.350> Wi-Fi<00:01:41.659> no<00:01:42.659> apps<00:01:42.899> are<00:01:43.079> running<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
now is Wi-Fi no apps are running in the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.450 
now is Wi-Fi no apps are running in the
background<00:01:45.710> ok<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:46.770> there<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.340> goes<00:01:47.659> hmm<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
background ok so there it goes hmm and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.749 
background ok so there it goes hmm and
we<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> download<00:01:52.460> four<00:01:53.460> point

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
we have for the download four point

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.410 
we have for the download four point
