00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
which I'm really excited for I think

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.490 
which I'm really excited for I think
ground<00:01:24.720> war<00:01:24.840> has<00:01:24.930> always<00:01:25.200> been<00:01:25.290> something

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
ground war has always been something

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.960 
ground war has always been something

love grandma back a modern warfare two

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.890 
love grandma back a modern warfare two
model<00:01:29.189> warfare<00:01:29.460> 3<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.150> think<00:01:30.390> there<00:01:30.630> was<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
model warfare 3 and I think there was a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
model warfare 3 and I think there was a
if<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.170> were<00:01:31.229> able<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.590> make<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> maps<00:01:32.520> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
if they were able to make the maps a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.429 
if they were able to make the maps a
little<00:01:32.850> bit<00:01:32.939> more<00:01:33.030> playable<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.900> ground<00:01:34.259> more

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
little bit more playable on ground more

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.630 
little bit more playable on ground more
I<00:01:34.470> think<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> great<00:01:35.130> idea<00:01:35.250> because<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
I think to be a great idea because a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.219 
I think to be a great idea because a
ground<00:01:35.880> war<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.299> way<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.659> people<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
ground war is a way for people to get a

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.719 
ground war is a way for people to get a
lot<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.380> kills<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.799> lot<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.040> action<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> lot<00:01:38.610> of
