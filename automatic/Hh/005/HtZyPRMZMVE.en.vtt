 no time to really shoot videos there 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.300

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.550

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.829

 okay as a compensation and as a special 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.629
 Let's do a little special 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:07.140

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.420

 Just had it both as a special 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:26.520

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.820
 a webspecial you can me so to speak 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.070

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.690
 I would even like to have a video with him 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.690
 link in a pm 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:44.010
 and yes, in there just tell him what you mean 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:48.630
 can and hold me and then we build 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.980
 a little web together that's it 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.500
 actually already very wet 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.220
 area is should be none 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.170
 big elaborate websites so we 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.020
 so become minigames in the redstone and such 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.740
 a little bit the animal love i will 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.870

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.170
 and yes that's really my abo 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:15.349
 special you can build a map with me 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.970
 I hope it's alright and yes 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.090
 my hard drive just does not have it 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.230
 more involved 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.240
 So now should equal on gameplay 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.430
 to be over, thank you again 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:32.150
 200 subscribers and hope that yourself 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.560
 many will apply with me an eps 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.020
 my skater thinks about us 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.670
 make a phone call and plan 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.640
 the map s.besten you bring synonymous directly 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.890
 an idea with what we can build because 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.989
 it's always pretty hard then so 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.380
 Minigame to invent what you can not 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.000
 after that does as it would if he then 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.970
 more a pn could write a video 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.230
 could do or something similar you can 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.019
 I think synonymous as a video answer 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.630
 post below 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.100
 I will introduce the map then 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.670
 and yes that was already in the big and 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.470
 all 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.230
 Soon, more videos will be back 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.880
 come there then I would be too 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.450

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.260
 looking forward 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.260
