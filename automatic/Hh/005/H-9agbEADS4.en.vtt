00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.510 
created there is a moon tent block and
then<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.500> also<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> create<00:01:47.250> some

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
then we also going to create some

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.649 
then we also going to create some
moonlighting<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:50.030> this<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.149> an<00:01:51.270> interesting

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
moonlighting so this is an interesting

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.760 
moonlighting so this is an interesting
design<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.470> how<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> create<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.100> lot<00:01:53.490> lamp<00:01:54.000> but

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
design on how to create a lot lamp but

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.149 
design on how to create a lot lamp but
it's<00:01:55.770> still<00:01:56.009> awesome<00:01:56.340> okay<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.899> then<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.710> think

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it's still awesome okay and then I think

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.670 
it's still awesome okay and then I think
we<00:01:59.280> got<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.549> make<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.759> helmet<00:02:00.390> with<00:02:01.380> some

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
we got to make a helmet with some

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.700 
we got to make a helmet with some
reinforced<00:02:03.200> cloth<00:02:04.250> with<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.520> glass<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.360> here<00:02:06.710> so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
reinforced cloth with a glass in here so

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.070 
reinforced cloth with a glass in here so
we<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.250> our<00:02:08.280> moon<00:02:08.640> helmet<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.300> then<00:02:09.810> can

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
we can have our moon helmet and then can

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.680 
we can have our moon helmet and then can
use<00:02:10.349> our<00:02:10.910> spacesuit

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
use our spacesuit

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.980
