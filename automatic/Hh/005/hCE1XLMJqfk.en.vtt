00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.389
 hello how am i the ariel of 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.710
 new with you now we are going with a 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.780
 tutorial on how to do tricks with three 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.849
 balls you already saw my first tutorial 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.860
 and learned to make the waterfall of 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:22.250
 basic movement of juggling now goes 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.960
 to do tricks the rules for this 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.480
 tutorial is that I will not avoid it if it 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.130
 I fall to balls if something happens is a 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.649
 natural normal we will do so 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.320
 natural and so I feel calmer 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.960
 do not criticize me and the next thing is that 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.050
 I will explain each trick carefully 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.280
 but you already know the waterfall and a 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.829
 Once following the waterfall you can 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.250
 observe the patterns and can do the 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.489
 trick 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.219
 so you can play the video a 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.370
 a million times good these individuals 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.739
 a million times and so you can see it 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.539
 again and again and again and again and I hope 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.070
 do not be your tricks some names the 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.870
 name but there we are going to invent the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.859
 name so let's start first 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.859
 waterfall 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.820
 that is the waterfall we already learned now 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.820
 let's cascade in reverse 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.840
 reverse we go now with the column 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840
 column 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.960
 that is the column now we go with the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.590
 false column two variations of the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.590
 fake column 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.150
 and now we go with 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.930
 he is told sour in English shower or sour 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.930
 come on now yes 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.319
 and now we go with the source 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.900
 that is called the source again 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.960
 source now let another that 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.960
 flame under the arm 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.900
 let's go to the other one called 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.900
 6 upi point 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.210
 is the same as under the arm nothing 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.350
 more than above the others below two 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.350
 balls down 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.879
 let's see is with a ball that I have 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.879
 marked for you to see what time 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.410
 let's go to what's called under the 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.410
 I invented chin 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.810
 we go with the other one that is supporting with 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.810
 arm 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.440
 thanks with the floor and the wall 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.209
 here I do not know what it's called 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.870
 another trick leaning with his head 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.810
 now the other trick below the 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.810
 legs 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.520
 and now we are going to others 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:34.420
 to start can start or also 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.420
 is varying and seized 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.130
 it even serves with all three genres 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.940
 Behind the back 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.780
 one of the words 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.890
 behind the back with 2 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.480
 now we go with the next 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.510
 which is called 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.510
 let's see what else can be here 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.450
 the raisins 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.360
 but I have a lot of space 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.360
 those of three above 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.210
 there are many more many tricks more than 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.430
 moment those matches for you 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.860
