00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.029 

I<00:00:17.640> think<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.750> uniqueness<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.590> feel<00:00:19.800> is

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
I think the the uniqueness of I feel is

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.640 
I think the the uniqueness of I feel is
that<00:00:20.220> brings<00:00:20.669> together<00:00:21.349> cricketers<00:00:22.349> that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
that brings together cricketers that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.870 
that brings together cricketers that
have<00:00:22.910> varying<00:00:23.910> training<00:00:24.359> backgrounds

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
have varying training backgrounds

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.710 
have varying training backgrounds
you've<00:00:26.330> got<00:00:26.510> guys<00:00:26.690> like<00:00:28.150> currently<00:00:29.150> has<00:00:29.420> got<00:00:29.689> a

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
you've got guys like currently has got a

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.710 
you've got guys like currently has got a
strong<00:00:30.320> training<00:00:31.220> ethic<00:00:31.760> because<00:00:31.970> we<00:00:32.270> he<00:00:32.509> come

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
strong training ethic because we he come

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.740 
strong training ethic because we he come
from<00:00:32.870> for<00:00:33.590> Mars<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:34.070> his<00:00:34.489> gender<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:35.300> some

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
from for Mars and his gender and some

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.549 
from for Mars and his gender and some
bias<00:00:36.680> from<00:00:36.890> a<00:00:37.010> training<00:00:37.250> point<00:00:37.460> of<00:00:37.610> view

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.080 

got<00:00:42.559> a<00:00:42.590> little<00:00:42.920> spicy<00:00:43.250> salsa<00:00:43.519> and<00:00:43.879> give

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
got a little spicy salsa and give

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.410 
got a little spicy salsa and give
example<00:00:44.600> if<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.140> only<00:00:45.289> have<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.530> do<00:00:45.680> once<00:00:46.010> ever

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
example if you only have to do once ever

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.180 
example if you only have to do once ever
sixes<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:48.010> 80%

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.569 

the<00:00:53.190> game<00:00:53.400> is

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
the game is

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.139 
the game is
it's<00:00:54.880> got<00:00:55.239> unique<00:00:55.629> requirements<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.340> those

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
it's got unique requirements and those

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.960 
it's got unique requirements and those
unique<00:00:58.570> requirements<00:00:59.440> move<00:00:59.980> from<00:01:00.340> a<00:01:00.610> high

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
unique requirements move from a high

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.530 
unique requirements move from a high
endurance<00:01:01.629> level<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.590> a<00:01:02.949> very<00:01:03.670> high<00:01:03.879> explosive

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
endurance level to a very high explosive

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.840 
endurance level to a very high explosive
components<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:05.379> so<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.190> really<00:01:06.460> have<00:01:06.580> to<00:01:06.760> at

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
components so so you really have to at

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.050 
components so so you really have to at
times<00:01:07.060> touch<00:01:07.450> all<00:01:07.720> bases<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:09.190> maintain

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
times touch all bases and maintain

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.300 
times touch all bases and maintain
whatever<00:01:10.659> your<00:01:10.869> strengths<00:01:11.320> are<00:01:11.470> different

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
whatever your strengths are different

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.649 
whatever your strengths are different
boilers<00:01:12.490> like<00:01:12.790> different<00:01:13.119> strengths<00:01:13.509> they're

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
boilers like different strengths they're

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.870 
boilers like different strengths they're
at<00:01:14.350> different<00:01:14.380> capabilities<00:01:14.890> they've<00:01:15.550> all<00:01:15.700> in

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
at different capabilities they've all in

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.580 
at different capabilities they've all in
different<00:01:16.030> ways<00:01:16.360> you<00:01:16.630> know<00:01:16.690> and<00:01:17.259> I<00:01:17.350> suppose

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
different ways you know and I suppose

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.800 
different ways you know and I suppose
from<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:17.979> conditioning<00:01:18.490> point<00:01:18.700> of<00:01:18.790> view<00:01:18.940> most

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
from the conditioning point of view most

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.590 
from the conditioning point of view most
of<00:01:20.110> my<00:01:20.290> energy<00:01:20.440> would<00:01:20.800> be<00:01:20.830> spent<00:01:21.220> on<00:01:21.790> the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
of my energy would be spent on the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.680 
of my energy would be spent on the
violets<00:01:22.990> on<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.170> phosphorus<00:01:23.380> in<00:01:23.979> particular

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
violets on the phosphorus in particular

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.940 
violets on the phosphorus in particular
because<00:01:25.690> their<00:01:25.899> workloads<00:01:26.320> differently<00:01:26.800> are

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
because their workloads differently are

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.999 
because their workloads differently are
on<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.520> highest<00:01:27.700> so<00:01:28.300> you<00:01:29.050> know<00:01:29.170> from<00:01:29.470> from

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
on the highest so you know from from

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.999 
on the highest so you know from from
speaking<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.149> people<00:01:31.509> out<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:31.780> there<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.229> what

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
speaking to people out of there and what

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.130 
speaking to people out of there and what
might<00:01:33.250> be<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.700> best<00:01:33.880> way<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.119> go<00:01:34.390> about<00:01:34.479> the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
might be the best way to go about the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.870 
might be the best way to go about the
conditioning<00:01:35.800> is<00:01:35.890> really<00:01:36.280> first<00:01:36.490> me<00:01:36.700> to

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
conditioning is really first me to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.630 
conditioning is really first me to
undignified<00:01:37.149> what<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.750> are<00:01:38.039> and<00:01:39.039> where<00:01:39.490> your

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
undignified what you are and where your

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.600 
undignified what you are and where your
strengths<00:01:40.000> lie<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:41.020> then

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
strengths lie and then

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.090 
strengths lie and then
in<00:01:41.880> nature<00:01:42.210> training<00:01:42.660> zero<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.050> on<00:01:43.260> really
