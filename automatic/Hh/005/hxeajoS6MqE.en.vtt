really<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:29.700> know<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.030> anyways<00:01:30.300> to<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:30.870> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
really don't know but anyways to get the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.720 
really don't know but anyways to get the
zombies<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.470> line<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.070> right<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.370> front<00:01:32.550> of<00:01:32.610> you

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
zombies to line up right in front of you

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.010 
zombies to line up right in front of you
you're<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:32.850> gonna<00:01:33.060> need<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.420> double<00:01:33.690> jump<00:01:33.840> up

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
you're just gonna need to double jump up

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.990 
you're just gonna need to double jump up
here<00:01:34.260> and<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.160> why<00:01:35.370> I<00:01:35.400> recommend<00:01:35.910> having

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
here and this is why I recommend having

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.850 
here and this is why I recommend having
an<00:01:36.240> exosuit<00:01:36.720> or<00:01:36.930> doing<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.290> glitch<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.680> later

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
an exosuit or doing this glitch in later

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.590 
an exosuit or doing this glitch in later
rounds<00:01:38.040> because<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.580> you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
rounds because as you can see it's a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.930 
rounds because as you can see it's a
great<00:01:40.080> pile<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.950> glitch<00:01:41.190> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.580> just<00:01:41.730> rack

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
great pile of glitch you can just rack

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.710 
great pile of glitch you can just rack
up<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.240> points<00:01:42.470> very<00:01:43.470> very<00:01:44.250> easily<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:45.150> as
