muscle optimally or as efficient as you
would<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.050> while<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.039> were<00:00:56.190> leaner<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
would have while you were leaner so it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.869 
would have while you were leaner so it
is<00:00:57.500> important<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.620> me<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:58.980> back<00:00:59.250> down<00:00:59.550> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
is important for me to get back down to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.470 
is important for me to get back down to
the<00:01:00.420> single<00:01:01.199> digits<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:02.879> continue

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the single digits so that I can continue

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.710 
the single digits so that I can continue
to<00:01:03.690> build<00:01:03.870> muscle<00:01:04.110> more<00:01:05.070> efficiently<00:01:05.720> alright

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
to build muscle more efficiently alright

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.990 
to build muscle more efficiently alright
so<00:01:06.900> let's<00:01:07.080> get<00:01:07.229> right<00:01:07.380> into<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.740> video<00:01:08.000> number

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
so let's get right into the video number

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.520 
so let's get right into the video number
one<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.630> want<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.650> keep<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.580> strength<00:01:12.530> alright

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
one I want to keep my strength alright

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.219 
one I want to keep my strength alright
this<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.830> important<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:15.229> muscle

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
this is important because muscle

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.590 
this is important because muscle
response<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.009> stimulus<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.729> when<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.360> on

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
response to stimulus and when you are on

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.370 
response to stimulus and when you are on
a<00:01:18.630> lower<00:01:18.930> calorie<00:01:19.470> diet<00:01:20.570> your<00:01:21.570> body<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.259> going

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
a lower calorie diet your body is going

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.670 
a lower calorie diet your body is going
to<00:01:22.650> look<00:01:23.549> towards<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.000> muscle<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:25.140> energy

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
to look towards the muscle for energy

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.890 
to look towards the muscle for energy
because<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> muscle<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:26.970> metabolically

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
because the muscle is very metabolically

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.960 
because the muscle is very metabolically
active<00:01:29.060> alright<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.479> as<00:01:30.860> long<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.579> can

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
active alright so as long as we can

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.840 
active alright so as long as we can
however<00:01:34.970> continue<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.560> make<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.979> body<00:01:38.340> feel

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
however continue to make the body feel

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.090 
however continue to make the body feel
like<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.299> needs<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.990> muscle<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.650> won't<00:01:40.890> get

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
like it needs that muscle it won't get

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
like it needs that muscle it won't get
rid<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.060> why<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.329> important

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
rid of it so this is why it's important

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.499 
rid of it so this is why it's important
that<00:01:43.649> we<00:01:43.680> focus<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.850> keeping<00:01:45.780> our<00:01:46.200> strength<00:01:46.619> so

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
that we focus on keeping our strength so

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.870 
that we focus on keeping our strength so
whatever<00:01:48.509> kind<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.409> training<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.310> were<00:01:50.460> doing

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
cutting all right a lot of people will

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.320 
cutting all right a lot of people will
be<00:02:34.500> at<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> four<00:02:35.010> thousand<00:02:35.400> calorie<00:02:35.730> diet<00:02:36.060> while

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
be at a four thousand calorie diet while

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.970 
be at a four thousand calorie diet while
they're<00:02:36.480> bulking<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.080> then<00:02:37.440> it's<00:02:37.590> time<00:02:37.799> to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
they're bulking and then it's time to

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.190 
they're bulking and then it's time to
cut<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.430> they're<00:02:38.580> dropping<00:02:39.209> them<00:02:39.299> down<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
cut and they're dropping them down to

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.339 
cut and they're dropping them down to
about<00:02:40.410> 1,200<00:02:40.920> or<00:02:41.489> they're<00:02:41.790> just<00:02:41.819> completely

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
about 1,200 or they're just completely

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.170 
about 1,200 or they're just completely
eliminating<00:02:43.349> carbs<00:02:43.620> all<00:02:44.489> right<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.819> problem

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
eliminating carbs all right the problem

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.350 
eliminating carbs all right the problem
with<00:02:45.269> that<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.549> that<00:02:47.549> big<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.150> a

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
with that is is that that big of a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.500 
with that is is that that big of a
difference<00:02:48.569> in<00:02:49.079> your<00:02:49.739> nutrient<00:02:50.670> intake<00:02:51.269> is

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
difference in your nutrient intake is

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.289 
difference in your nutrient intake is
not<00:02:51.739> going<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.860> allow<00:02:53.099> you<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.489> perform<00:02:53.700> at

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
not going to allow you to perform at

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.960 
not going to allow you to perform at
your<00:02:54.870> peak<00:02:55.140> or<00:02:55.380> close<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.489> where<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.670> were

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
your peak or close to where you were

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.850 
your peak or close to where you were
when<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.269> were<00:02:57.420> consuming<00:02:57.870> 4,000<00:02:58.680> calories

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
when you were consuming 4,000 calories

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.910 
when you were consuming 4,000 calories
so<00:02:59.760> ultimately<00:03:00.150> what's<00:03:00.690> going<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.410> happen<00:03:01.769> is

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
so ultimately what's going to happen is

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.309 
so ultimately what's going to happen is
you're<00:03:02.579> not<00:03:02.880> going<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.420> be<00:03:03.840> able<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.140> maintain

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
you're not going to be able to maintain

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.160 
you're not going to be able to maintain
your<00:03:04.739> strength<00:03:05.480> you're<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.599> to<00:03:06.660> lose<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.870> lot

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
your strength you're going to lose a lot

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.550 
your strength you're going to lose a lot
of<00:03:07.200> strength<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.989> ultimately<00:03:09.989> you'll<00:03:10.349> just

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
of strength and ultimately you'll just

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.319 
of strength and ultimately you'll just
end<00:03:10.769> up<00:03:10.920> losing<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.459> lot<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.760> muscle<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:12.239> the

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
end up losing a lot of muscle in the

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.800 
end up losing a lot of muscle in the
process<00:03:12.810> also<00:03:13.850> for<00:03:14.850> example<00:03:15.389> right<00:03:15.600> now

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
process also for example right now

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.259 
process also for example right now
starting<00:03:16.470> my<00:03:16.590> cut<00:03:16.859> at<00:03:17.100> about<00:03:17.609> twenty<00:03:18.030> six

first month I will eventually start

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.780 
first month I will eventually start
doing<00:03:58.019> cardio<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.950> will<00:03:59.280> solely<00:03:59.970> focus<00:04:00.510> on

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
doing cardio and I will solely focus on

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.089 
doing cardio and I will solely focus on
more<00:04:02.790> high<00:04:03.090> intensity<00:04:03.840> training<00:04:04.099> like

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
more high intensity training like

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.949 
more high intensity training like
sprints<00:04:05.669> and<00:04:05.849> circuits<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:06.540> things<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.930> that

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
sprints and circuits and things of that

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.280 
sprints and circuits and things of that
nature<00:04:07.970> now<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.450> way<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:09.810> I'm<00:04:09.900> going<00:04:10.019> to<00:04:10.079> do

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
nature now the way that I'm going to do

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.750 
nature now the way that I'm going to do
it<00:04:10.440> is<00:04:10.620> instead<00:04:10.889> of<00:04:11.040> just<00:04:11.160> saying<00:04:11.280> okay<00:04:11.639> I<00:04:11.669> need

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
it is instead of just saying okay I need

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.760 
it is instead of just saying okay I need
to<00:04:11.880> cut<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:12.419> I<00:04:12.450> need<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.810> start<00:04:12.989> doing<00:04:13.139> 70

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
to cut so I need to start doing 70

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.710 
to cut so I need to start doing 70
cardio<00:04:14.190> is<00:04:15.180> basically<00:04:16.020> i'm<00:04:16.290> going<00:04:16.650> to

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
cardio is basically i'm going to

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.120 
cardio is basically i'm going to
incrementally<00:04:20.180> increase<00:04:21.180> my<00:04:21.780> cardio<00:04:22.170> when

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
incrementally increase my cardio when

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.450 
incrementally increase my cardio when
needed<00:04:23.490> so<00:04:24.420> for<00:04:24.690> example<00:04:24.920> after<00:04:25.920> this<00:04:26.220> for

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
needed so for example after this for

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.790 
needed so for example after this for
weeks<00:04:26.700> i'll<00:04:27.600> probably<00:04:27.960> end<00:04:28.290> up<00:04:28.470> hitting<00:04:28.650> a

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
weeks i'll probably end up hitting a

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.460 
weeks i'll probably end up hitting a
plateau<00:04:28.950> so<00:04:29.820> i'll<00:04:30.000> add<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.270> day<00:04:30.540> of<00:04:30.690> cardio<00:04:31.080> for

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
plateau so i'll add a day of cardio for

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.630 
plateau so i'll add a day of cardio for
about<00:04:31.740> 20<00:04:32.610> minutes<00:04:32.900> ok<00:04:33.900> i'll<00:04:34.680> keep<00:04:35.040> my<00:04:35.220> calorie

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
about 20 minutes ok i'll keep my calorie

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.450 
about 20 minutes ok i'll keep my calorie
is<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.940> same<00:04:36.150> once<00:04:37.140> i<00:04:37.320> hit<00:04:37.500> a<00:04:37.560> plateau<00:04:37.830> with

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
is the same once i hit a plateau with

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.320 
is the same once i hit a plateau with
that<00:04:38.700> then<00:04:39.660> i<00:04:40.050> will<00:04:40.490> slightly<00:04:41.490> decrease<00:04:42.150> my

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
that then i will slightly decrease my

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.240 
that then i will slightly decrease my
calories<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.020> keep<00:04:43.230> the<00:04:43.410> cardio<00:04:43.770> where<00:04:44.010> it<00:04:44.130> is
