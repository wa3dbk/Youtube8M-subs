00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.700
 elena what slow indicates pre raising the

 total number to 44 fighters a 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.560
 amount nothing 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.869
 enter to analyze the technical sections 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.060
 of this proposal has no reason to be 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.490
 When we analyze long as both 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.350
 the normal version like the super that yes 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.420
 certain aspects are retouched for 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.820
 keep the product fresh as the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.990
 first well the visual section continues 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.149
 enjoying the showiness that 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.130
 characterized the original with colors 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.140
 showy fast and fluid actions 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.719
 elements in the background cameras 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.579
 dynamics etcetera indeed if someone 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.979
 never played any street 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.140
 fighter 4 see how this ultra looks 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.899
 will think that we are really before a 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.580
 totally new product in everything and not 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.640
 of an update on the game 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.709
 launched five years ago the street 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.569
 fighter 4 has become thanks to the 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.209
 merits of capcom in the fighting game 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.270
 more competitive and with more competitions 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.799
 reals around the world was logical 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.049
 that this addition has been expected 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.940
 for all those that I include myself we have 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.620
 created trapped by the fighting game 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.450
 that has marked a before and after 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.540
 since the launch of its fourth 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.340
 delivery in the year 2009 perhaps being 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.010
 something critical you have to put the price to 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.910
 pay as a negative point as this will 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.770
 it will look elevated 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.390
 equally that already depends on the 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.090
 each one's pockets and if you want 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.650
 update to this version the most 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.650
 complete and balanced
