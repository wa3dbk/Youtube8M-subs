new cell replaces new cell does not have

new cell replaces new cell does not have
good<00:02:45.970> building<00:02:46.390> material<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.220> thus<00:02:48.220> new<00:02:48.580> cell

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
good building material and thus new cell

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.360 
good building material and thus new cell
is<00:02:49.150> weaker<00:02:49.690> than<00:02:49.720> cell<00:02:50.200> being<00:02:50.500> replaced<00:02:51.010> and

is weaker than cell being replaced and

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.270 
is weaker than cell being replaced and
so<00:02:52.210> there<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.630> slow<00:02:53.050> degeneration<00:02:53.890> and

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
so there is a slow degeneration and

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.820 
so there is a slow degeneration and
deterioration<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:55.240> body<00:02:55.450> parts<00:02:57.330> if<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:59.200> cell

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
deterioration of body parts if that cell

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.850 
deterioration of body parts if that cell
that<00:03:00.250> old<00:03:00.580> cell<00:03:00.940> as<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.630> dies<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:01.870> replaces

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
that old cell as it dies and replaces

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.660 
that old cell as it dies and replaces
has<00:03:03.640> quality<00:03:04.510> building<00:03:04.900> material<00:03:05.459> then<00:03:06.459> the

God to be nourished with living food and
so<00:03:31.180> let's<00:03:31.600> get<00:03:31.780> back<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.050> my<00:03:32.170> eyes<00:03:33.150> with<00:03:34.150> that

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
so let's get back to my eyes with that

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.000 
so let's get back to my eyes with that
as<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.510> little<00:03:34.810> foundation<00:03:37.260> for<00:03:38.260> 28<00:03:38.680> years<00:03:38.950> of

as a little foundation for 28 years of

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.380 
as a little foundation for 28 years of
my<00:03:39.190> life<00:03:39.400> I'd<00:03:39.640> been<00:03:39.790> on<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.030> standard

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
my life I'd been on the standard

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.620 
my life I'd been on the standard
American<00:03:40.810> diet<00:03:40.840> as<00:03:41.519> my<00:03:42.519> old<00:03:42.760> eye<00:03:43.030> cells<00:03:43.390> that

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
American diet as my old eye cells that

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.960 
American diet as my old eye cells that
died<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.260> my<00:03:44.380> new<00:03:44.800> eye<00:03:44.830> cells<00:03:45.310> had<00:03:45.519> replaced

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
died and my new eye cells had replaced

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.170 
died and my new eye cells had replaced
them<00:03:46.290> new<00:03:47.290> eye<00:03:47.320> cell<00:03:47.830> did<00:03:48.100> not<00:03:48.280> have<00:03:48.640> good

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
them new eye cell did not have good

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.170 
them new eye cell did not have good
building<00:03:49.600> material<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.940> new<00:03:52.150> eye

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
building material and so the new eye

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.210 
building material and so the new eye
cell<00:03:52.690> was<00:03:52.959> weaker<00:03:53.410> than<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.739> cell<00:03:53.950> it<00:03:54.100> was

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
cell was weaker than the cell it was

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.670 
cell was weaker than the cell it was
replacing<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.120> there<00:03:56.110> was<00:03:56.230> a<00:03:56.260> slow

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
replacing and there was a slow

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.890 
replacing and there was a slow
degeneration<00:03:57.549> and<00:03:57.880> deterioration<00:03:58.450> of<00:03:58.480> my<00:03:58.870> eye

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
degeneration and deterioration of my eye

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.210 
degeneration and deterioration of my eye
cells<00:03:59.410> until<00:03:59.799> at<00:03:59.920> the<00:03:59.950> age<00:04:00.190> of<00:04:00.370> 28<00:04:02.190> when<00:04:03.190> I

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
cells until at the age of 28 when I

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.520 
cells until at the age of 28 when I
couldn't<00:04:04.150> see<00:04:04.360> properly<00:04:04.780> couldn't<00:04:05.110> focus

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
couldn't see properly couldn't focus

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.530 
couldn't see properly couldn't focus
properly<00:04:05.769> I<00:04:06.010> go<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.519> eye<00:04:06.549> doctor<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:07.360> I

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
properly I go to the eye doctor and I

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.660 
properly I go to the eye doctor and I
get<00:04:07.720> corrective<00:04:08.200> lenses<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:09.250> can<00:04:09.459> see

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
get corrective lenses and I can see

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.380 
get corrective lenses and I can see
great<00:04:10.060> again<00:04:10.420> but<00:04:11.880> after<00:04:12.880> I<00:04:12.910> got<00:04:13.120> those

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
great again but after I got those

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.360 
great again but after I got those
corrective<00:04:13.900> lenses<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:14.410> I<00:04:14.440> could<00:04:14.620> see<00:04:14.890> great

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
corrective lenses and I could see great

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.070 
corrective lenses and I could see great
again<00:04:15.730> what<00:04:16.600> did<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:16.780> do

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
again what did I do

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.060 
again what did I do
I<00:04:17.519> went<00:04:18.519> back<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:18.940> same<00:04:19.180> diet<00:04:19.890> that<00:04:20.890> it

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
I went back to the same diet that it

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.600 
I went back to the same diet that it
caused<00:04:21.340> my<00:04:21.580> eye<00:04:21.609> cells<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:23.650> become<00:04:24.010> weaker<00:04:24.370> and

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
caused my eye cells to become weaker and

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.080 
caused my eye cells to become weaker and
weaker

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
weaker

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.200 
weaker
and<00:04:25.270> so<00:04:26.169> on<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.890> same<00:04:27.160> standard<00:04:27.729> American

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
and so on the same standard American

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.130 
and so on the same standard American
dead<00:04:28.450> food<00:04:28.690> diet

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
dead food diet

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.310 
dead food diet
a<00:04:29.260> year<00:04:29.530> later<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:30.120> go<00:04:31.120> back<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.690> eye<00:04:31.720> doctor

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
a year later I go back to the eye doctor

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.170 
a year later I go back to the eye doctor
for<00:04:32.349> an<00:04:32.620> eye<00:04:32.740> examination<00:04:33.190> and

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
for an eye examination and
