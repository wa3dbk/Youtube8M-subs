00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
often as i thought i was going to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.200 
often as i thought i was going to
because<00:00:34.190> when<00:00:35.190> i<00:00:35.280> first<00:00:35.520> start<00:00:35.670> using<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.059> I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
because when i first start using it I

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.959 
because when i first start using it I
was<00:00:36.329> too<00:00:36.480> excited<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.890> would<00:00:38.100> put<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
was too excited so I would put like a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.380 
was too excited so I would put like a
whole<00:00:39.270> bunch<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.540> my<00:00:39.660> hair<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.760> it<00:00:41.760> wasn't

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
whole bunch of my hair and it wasn't

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.270 
whole bunch of my hair and it wasn't
long<00:00:42.750> until<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.230> started<00:00:43.530> breaking<00:00:43.860> out<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.399> um

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
long until I started breaking out and um

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
long until I started breaking out and um
yeah<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.700> was<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.000> was<00:00:48.300> breaking<00:00:48.539> out<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.960> lot<00:00:49.320> and

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
yeah it was I was breaking out a lot and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.529 
yeah it was I was breaking out a lot and
at<00:00:49.739> first<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.129> was<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.399> small<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.420> know

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
at first it was like small you know

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.330 
at first it was like small you know
little<00:00:52.079> zits<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.559> then<00:00:52.739> they<00:00:53.070> just

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
little zits and then they just

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340 
little zits and then they just
progressively<00:00:53.879> got<00:00:54.149> worse<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.780> kind<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> got

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
progressively got worse so I kind of got

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.959 
progressively got worse so I kind of got
scared<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.039> wouldn't<00:00:56.309> use<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:56.730> often

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
scared and I wouldn't use it as often

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
scared and I wouldn't use it as often
and<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.420> won't<00:00:57.600> why<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.350> probably<00:00:58.739> haven't

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and I won't why like I probably haven't

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.799 
and I won't why like I probably haven't
used<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.670> past<00:00:59.879> 2-3<00:01:00.600> months<00:01:01.070> um<00:01:02.390> but<00:01:03.390> I

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
used it for the past 2-3 months um but I

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.620 
used it for the past 2-3 months um but I
do<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.979> feel<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.700> doesn't<00:01:06.270> help<00:01:06.450> your

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
do you feel like it doesn't help your

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.100 
do you feel like it doesn't help your
hair<00:01:06.900> grow<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> think<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.950> helps<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.310> hair

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
hair grow but I think it helps your hair

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.490 
hair grow but I think it helps your hair
it<00:01:10.110> makes<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.409> stronger<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.189> helps<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:12.500> get

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
it makes it stronger and it helps it get

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.179 
it makes it stronger and it helps it get
healthier<00:01:14.689> as<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.990> tell<00:01:16.170> my<00:01:16.860> hair<00:01:16.979> didn't

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
healthier as you can tell my hair didn't

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.120 
healthier as you can tell my hair didn't
grow<00:01:17.310> all<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.970> much<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.570> grew<00:01:18.890> like<00:01:19.890> that

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
grow all that much it grew like that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.370 
grow all that much it grew like that
much<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.330> here<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> think

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
much and it was like up here but I think

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.749 
much and it was like up here but I think
this<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> normal<00:01:23.130> length<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.610> your

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
this is like the normal length that your

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.730 
this is like the normal length that your
hair<00:01:23.909> would<00:01:24.030> grow<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.600> six<00:01:24.810> months<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> don't

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
hair would grow in six months so I don't

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.630 
hair would grow in six months so I don't
think<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.950> makes<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.220> big<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.520> difference

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
think it makes that big of a difference

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.749 
think it makes that big of a difference
um<00:01:27.380> but<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.439> will<00:01:28.619> tell<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.070> there<00:01:29.640> were

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
um but I will tell you that there were

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.270 
um but I will tell you that there were
times<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.420> would<00:01:30.930> leave<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.920> my<00:01:32.040> hair

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
times that I would leave it in my hair

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.740 
times that I would leave it in my hair
at<00:01:32.400> night<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.000> wake<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.509> take<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.659> shower

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
all through out here you really just

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.810

I like<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:59.500> a<00:01:59.800> lot<00:01:59.830> I<00:02:00.340> would<00:02:00.460> show<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.729> but

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.850 
I like not a lot I would show you but
i'm<00:02:01.060> actually<00:02:01.180> using<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.870> under<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.530> camera

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
i'm actually using it under the camera

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.279 
i'm actually using it under the camera
to<00:02:02.979> hold<00:02:03.190> it<00:02:03.340> but<00:02:04.000> um<00:02:06.090> yeah<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.690> think<00:02:07.930> that's

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
to hold it but um yeah I think that's

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.010 
to hold it but um yeah I think that's
about<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.910> well<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:09.940> continue<00:02:10.600> using<00:02:10.750> it
