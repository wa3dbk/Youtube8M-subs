and
then<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.010> end<00:01:11.160> up<00:01:11.250> getting<00:01:11.370> it<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.670> their

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
then you end up getting it on their

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.010 
then you end up getting it on their
clothes<00:01:12.060> well<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.380> stuff<00:01:13.560> off

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.470 
okay so it's kind of a faint stain right
so<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> idea<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.590> will<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.820> able<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.150> get

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480
