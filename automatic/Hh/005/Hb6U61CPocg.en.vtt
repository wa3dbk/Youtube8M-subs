00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:10.460
 Explain how to do 3d new operations with cinema 4d 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.460
 Open the composed scene c 4 new 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:20.550
 When creating a 3d scene you need to work from different angles 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:26.360
 For example, in this scene, one tie appears to overlap vertically 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.390
 Switch the reason 4 the Meiji because they are sure that is actually what made 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:34.180
 To switch 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.870
 In the upper right corner of the car view window to obtain a division boot of the panel menu the right edge of the icon 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.870
 Click 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.290
 In fact, the size is different depending on the illusion of the eye 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:47.520
 On the other hand , you can see that Thailand is in a disjointed place 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.520
 Let's switch the viewpoint 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.620
 To switch the viewpoint 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:58.320
 Operate with the icon in the upper right of the viewport 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:01.350
 10 o'clock icon is new up and down movement 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.899
 Arrows move camera back and forth 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.899
 The circle rotates the bottle 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:14.500
 This operation is also possible with a shortcut . 1 Press and drag while moving. 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.560
 Move forward and backward while pressing 3 key 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:22.720
 It becomes rotation that becomes chunky 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:27.420
 You can operate intuitively because it rotates around the place where you can buy it by using the shortcut. 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.420
 It is recommended that you use the shortcut because 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:38.070
 Note that the Euro 2 is &amp; shift 50,000 z simultaneously 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:41.570
 Let's actually move the blue cube 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.290
 First select the move tool 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:49.340
 To move, position the cursor on the object you want to move 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:53.240
 An object with a white outline is an object to be selected from here 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.580
 Move while holding down the mouse button and drag the object 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.170
 Or you can move once you select an object 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.210
 Align objects you want to select the cursor 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.890
 Or white outer India fit object 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.410
 When you click an object on the object to be selected from now on outline 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.840
 Switch from to orange 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:22.120
 If selected , drag an empty area to move the object 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.640
 If you want to move along the case or axis that is in place intricate object is selected 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.160
 Move from 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:33.290
 c The magician is in the horizontal direction 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:36.560
 the x-axis vertical direction have been the first district of the Kui Kui and z-axis 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.870
 Each can be determined by the color of the axis 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.370
 Red is the x axis green is the y axis 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.370
 It becomes a blue gadget axis 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.230
 If you move the cursor to the house and drag the whitened axis , it will move only in that direction 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.540
 I can do it 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:58.080
 Movement in the numbers the amount of movement is a tightly this time move while holding down the shift key 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.080
 I can do it 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:11.830
 You can also try not to move in a specific axial direction 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.830
 If you turn off the xyz child clock icon, it will not move in that direction only 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.349
 Let's scale this time 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.910
 When you drag an object in the same way as switching Move tool to scale the 2-position 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:47.670
 The size of the object changes 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.670
 You can also change the angle with the rotation tool 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:01.200
 If you want to move accurately Yuri is done using the table manager 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:05.860
 Enter the numerical value in the sequel manager with the prince selected and press the Apply button to specify 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:11.680
 Or you can change the location where the size or move to 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:15.770
 After that you can handle two legislatures properly by manipulating the object while looking at the 4 views 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.030
 Dog in a square in more than can be arranged in a vertical image quality 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.030
 There is the basic operation
