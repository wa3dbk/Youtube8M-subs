00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hello youtube and continue with the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.580
 3rd generation iPad I have it 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.719
 just directly first to the stream 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:16.289
 put it so that it is fully charged 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:21.080
 I can start right away and we 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:27.350
 set this up for the first time 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.350
 the SIM card is already flying around here 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:40.320
 Can I ever get the sim cards? 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.850
 prey tool uses while laying out the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.770
 ipad high quality I believe this 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.899
 never used 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.300
 I always have one with one 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.920
 made paperclip but there we are 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.460
 already and start 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.460
 German fits 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.870
 aha, but he needs a long time 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.250
 Germany also fits regulatory services 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.750
 activate yes please 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.260
 I'd like to stress that now 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.119
 Of course, like to connect with a wifi 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.940
 entered into the foyer wlan password 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:30.330
 we hope to continue connection to the wifi 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:35.450
 is built up if I'm right 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:39.050
 have entered very nice on we go 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.940
 activate ipad 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.470
 done more often to produce why me 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.660
 that also in English request 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.600
 no idea in any case would like now 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.410
 that I then immediately the sim card 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.789
 tuck in 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.070
 Now we come to the point I want 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.800
 that as a brand new thing or have 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.080
 from the itunes backup on the computer or 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.039
 I'm already as progressive as I am 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.130
 it's from the iCloud backup 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.400
 the backup of course because I have 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.830
 just the old ipad again 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.720
 let backup and I put it out 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.300
 now everything here and then all apps come 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.980
 and settings as well as everything is direct 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.450
 Of course, he needs one out of here 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.980
 fast internet connection or too 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.410
 a slow then he needs more time 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.380
 I'll give itunes aldi us now 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.240
 password 1 balancing next 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.110
 from me the agbs have confirmed 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.980
 of course, read everything ten times 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.220
 and now he starts sledding on rome 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.890
 shows me the backups and I have 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.310
 I still have an iphone backup in it and 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.250
 ipad backup today selected the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.550
 and we say restore and now 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.190
 Let my rubbish and here we are again 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.170
 the comparison with the iCloud has so five 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.200
 to ten minutes lasted then starts 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.930
 ipad new intercepts now so 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.310
 all apps are already displayed 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.319
 but can not use yet 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.849
 they all have to be installed again 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.950
 that means he is moving here now 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.440
 whole apps if you're a big one then 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.900
 play with 12 gigabytes or here to 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.810
 example imovie with 400 something 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.879
 that invites everything ever again 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.629
 Internet connection it takes just short 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.939
 or me briefly and then that's the thing 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.700
 completely ready for use again 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:32.220
 let it shake and then you have the 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.569
 whole apps again and not 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.799
 wonder if you can 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.120
 I turned on that I'm now 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.950
 not shown because of the against apple id 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.689
 you will have been five times now 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.879
 asked for one, I was after the 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.049
 apple id asked for spexard 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.769
 recover 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:52.440
 then i was asked about imessage 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.769
 then I was asked about the password 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.170
 password for facetime 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.900
 then came directly to the query for the 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.519
 e-mail passwords 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.530
 So there you are busy so first 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.290
 do not not tell 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.260
 Let's talk. I'll get in touch 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.049
 then we will build the SIM card 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.150
 a so he still installs that is 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.639
 here a little more time consuming than 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.169
 thought I have to go now but no 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.599
 fear that you can turn off everything here 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.130
 interrupt 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:28.639
 But now we finally come to the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.449
 micro or sim card other side 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.750
 we have them up here 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.229
 I hope that comes over it and 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.229
 the plug 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.820
 so press a little tenderly 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:54.410
 bit and tender now have here 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:58.320
 our sim-card tray remember us 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.960
 reasonably how the thing was out 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.310
 have taken 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.199
 grab the SIM card here now 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:11.900
 and frit herein somehow pure 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:18.050
 ok and just put it all back 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:24.419
 because somehow with or without 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:27.350
 fingertip feeling is so to sit 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.440
 breathes and had wobbled and has air 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.680
 I'll get my locked my directly 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.680
 sim-card message pin entered 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.669
 unlock was successful that was it 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.530
 Now let's have a look 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:44.490
 Settings in and then we have 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.810
 we should now be the point 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:52.039
 because now have the point mobile data 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:06:00.500
 but that is still off 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:06:04.639
 mmh aha effect general network no 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.490
 actually here should be mobile values 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.930
 So now he is not attracted to only one 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:15.990
 Do not panic like me here 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:17.880
 straight network operator automatically the 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.510
 should be here now the latest 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.470

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.000
 that with profile of yes it now here 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.099
 I can say vodafone as well 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.440
 I saw the map 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:30.590

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.139
 get this mobile data ran 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.419
 so right now that was trick 17 once 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.400
 plane mode on and off again 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.849

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.449

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.240
 three out of five bars that's all 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:12.630
