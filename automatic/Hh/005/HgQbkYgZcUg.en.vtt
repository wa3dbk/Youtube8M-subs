l1 l2 r1 r2 left right left right so

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.459 
l1 l2 r1 r2 left right left right so
it's<00:00:40.850> basically<00:00:41.089> either<00:00:41.359> set<00:00:41.570> it's<00:00:41.749> like<00:00:41.870> half

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
it's basically either set it's like half

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.259 
it's basically either set it's like half
of<00:00:42.589> that<00:00:42.649> code<00:00:43.039> and<00:00:43.609> they're<00:00:43.789> just<00:00:43.969> repeat<00:00:44.239> it

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
of that code and they're just repeat it

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.259 
of that code and they're just repeat it
again<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:44.780> just<00:00:44.809> two<00:00:45.109> times<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.739> same<00:00:45.920> code

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
again so just two times the same code

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.180 
again so just two times the same code
and<00:00:47.269> then<00:00:47.359> we<00:00:47.449> fly<00:00:47.629> around<00:00:47.719> like<00:00:48.559> Superman<00:00:48.739> and

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
and then we fly around like Superman and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.819 
and then we fly around like Superman and
it's<00:00:49.789> real<00:00:50.120> if<00:00:50.390> kind<00:00:51.079> of<00:00:51.140> fun<00:00:51.289> I<00:00:51.440> did<00:00:51.589> this<00:00:51.679> for

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
it's real if kind of fun I did this for

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.759 
it's real if kind of fun I did this for
ages<00:00:52.219> omit<00:00:52.940> as<00:00:53.420> soon<00:00:53.600> as<00:00:53.690> I<00:00:53.749> landed<00:00:54.109> I<00:00:54.289> tapped

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
ages omit as soon as I landed I tapped

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.619 
ages omit as soon as I landed I tapped
it<00:00:54.920> in<00:00:54.949> again<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.519> just<00:00:56.059> flew<00:00:56.179> around<00:00:56.300> again

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
it in again and just flew around again

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.149 
it in again and just flew around again
and<00:00:57.140> of<00:00:57.260> course<00:00:57.999> the<00:00:58.999> odds<00:00:59.179> of<00:00:59.390> you<00:00:59.510> surviving

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
and of course the odds of you surviving

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.579 
and of course the odds of you surviving
hitting<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.280> ground<00:01:01.550> are<00:01:02.319> extremely<00:01:03.319> slim

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
hitting the ground are extremely slim

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.370 
hitting the ground are extremely slim
unless<00:01:04.040> you're<00:01:04.159> very<00:01:04.190> lucky<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.059> I<00:01:06.049> haven't

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
unless you're very lucky and I haven't

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.929 
unless you're very lucky and I haven't
hit<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.619> ground<00:01:06.860> in<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.130> right<00:01:07.280> angle<00:01:07.490> or

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
hit the ground in the right angle or

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.920 
hit the ground in the right angle or
something<00:01:08.270> saves<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.280> so<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:11.090> know<00:01:11.210> aim<00:01:11.479> for

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
something saves you so you know aim for

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.990 
something saves you so you know aim for
water<00:01:12.140> aiming<00:01:12.860> for<00:01:13.219> water<00:01:13.490> is<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.790> best

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
water aiming for water is the best

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.420 
water aiming for water is the best
chance<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:14.630> have<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:14.840> survival<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:16.369> you

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
chance you have of survival but you

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.859 
chance you have of survival but you
don't<00:01:16.579> have<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.850> always<00:01:17.030> hit<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.539> water<00:01:17.719> you

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
don't have to always hit the water you

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.810 
don't have to always hit the water you
can<00:01:17.990> die<00:01:18.170> if<00:01:18.409> you<00:01:18.530> feel<00:01:18.680> like<00:01:18.799> dying<00:01:19.009> big<00:01:19.579> whoop

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
can die if you feel like dying big whoop

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.950 
can die if you feel like dying big whoop
but<00:01:20.509> this<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:20.780> fun<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.259> minute<00:01:22.039> this<00:01:22.960> your

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
but this is fun a minute this your

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.279 
but this is fun a minute this your
Superman<00:01:24.530> but<00:01:25.460> you're<00:01:25.579> falling<00:01:25.969> but<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:27.049> think

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
Superman but you're falling but I think

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:28.990 
Superman but you're falling but I think
in<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:27.500> Man<00:01:27.649> of<00:01:27.680> Steel<00:01:27.829> he<00:01:28.219> kind<00:01:28.430> of<00:01:28.460> wasn't

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
in the Man of Steel he kind of wasn't

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.990 
in the Man of Steel he kind of wasn't
flying<00:01:29.360> he<00:01:29.539> was<00:01:29.659> more<00:01:29.869> of<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:30.430> hop<00:01:31.430> jumping

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
flying he was more of a hop jumping

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.450 
flying he was more of a hop jumping
around<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.049> I<00:01:33.409> guess<00:01:33.829> you<00:01:34.009> could<00:01:34.159> call<00:01:34.310> this

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
around so I I guess you could call this

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.760 
around so I I guess you could call this
a<00:01:34.520> man<00:01:34.759> of<00:01:34.880> steel<00:01:35.030> cheat<00:01:35.329> if<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.350> wanted<00:01:36.619> to

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
a man of steel cheat if you wanted to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.800 
a man of steel cheat if you wanted to
you<00:01:37.369> don't<00:01:37.549> have<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.850> I'm<00:01:38.329> not<00:01:38.479> I'm<00:01:38.659> not

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
you don't have to I'm not I'm not

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.779 
you don't have to I'm not I'm not
forcing<00:01:39.109> this<00:01:39.289> upon<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.770> but<00:01:40.549> this<00:01:40.640> is<00:01:40.759> just

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
forcing this upon you but this is just

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.550 
forcing this upon you but this is just
my<00:01:41.090> first<00:01:41.420> thought<00:01:41.689> when<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.259> was<00:01:42.320> flying

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
my first thought when I was flying

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.940 
my first thought when I was flying
around<00:01:42.710> oh<00:01:43.070> yeah<00:01:43.399> cool<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.909> is<00:01:44.060> I<00:01:44.619> was<00:01:45.619> cool<00:01:45.799> I

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
around oh yeah cool that is I was cool I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.289 
around oh yeah cool that is I was cool I
like<00:01:46.039> his<00:01:46.130> little<00:01:46.250> jet<00:01:46.640> streams<00:01:47.000> it's<00:01:47.179> not

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
like his little jet streams it's not

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.209 
like his little jet streams it's not
going<00:01:47.509> out<00:01:47.689> what<00:01:48.170> air<00:01:48.380> streams<00:01:48.740> or<00:01:48.979> whatever

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
going out what air streams or whatever

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.069 
going out what air streams or whatever
it<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:49.719> perspiration

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
it is perspiration
