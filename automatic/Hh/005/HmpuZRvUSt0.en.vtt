00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
pick up fix up the animatronics that's

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.729

what<00:02:40.650> I'm<00:02:40.739> thinking<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.540> but<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.750> guess<00:02:42.989> what

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
what I'm thinking and but I guess what

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.400

could be she that you're playing has now

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.479 
could be she that you're playing has now
could<00:02:49.829> be<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.640> always<00:02:50.880> play<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.769> he<00:02:52.769> but

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
looks exciting it looks scary twice I'm

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.940 
looks exciting it looks scary twice I'm
gonna<00:03:03.810> say<00:03:03.989> probably<00:03:04.319> maybe<00:03:04.530> three<00:03:04.799> times

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
gonna say probably maybe three times

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.950 
gonna say probably maybe three times
