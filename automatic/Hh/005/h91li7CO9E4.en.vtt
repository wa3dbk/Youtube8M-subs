fondant<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:04.019> you'll<00:01:05.019> see<00:01:05.170> that<00:01:05.289> some<00:01:05.500> of<00:01:05.590> its

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
fondant and you'll see that some of its

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.039 
fondant and you'll see that some of its
gonna<00:01:05.829> start<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.189> come<00:01:06.340> off<00:01:06.369> on<00:01:06.490> my<00:01:06.700> glove<00:01:07.049> but

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
gonna start to come off on my glove but

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.480 
gonna start to come off on my glove but
it's<00:01:08.170> not<00:01:08.350> going<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:08.590> stick<00:01:08.860> on<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.219> and<00:01:09.369> it's

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
it's not going to stick on it and it's

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.270 
it's not going to stick on it and it's
not<00:01:09.670> gonna<00:01:09.820> stain<00:01:10.299> it<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.830> more<00:01:12.010> you<00:01:12.100> knead

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
not gonna stain it so the more you knead

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.100 
not gonna stain it so the more you knead
it<00:01:12.369> in<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.670> more<00:01:15.909> it<00:01:15.940> stays<00:01:16.210> in<00:01:16.510> the<00:01:16.659> fondant

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
it in the more it stays in the fondant

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.980 
it in the more it stays in the fondant
so<00:01:17.229> therefore<00:01:17.770> you're<00:01:18.070> not<00:01:18.100> only<00:01:18.369> making<00:01:18.990> no

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
so therefore you're not only making no

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.630 
so therefore you're not only making no
mess<00:01:20.200> out<00:01:20.409> of<00:01:20.440> it<00:01:20.619> you're<00:01:20.799> also<00:01:21.040> getting<00:01:21.460> the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
mess out of it you're also getting the

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.609 
mess out of it you're also getting the
most<00:01:21.939> out<00:01:22.119> of<00:01:22.150> your<00:01:22.270> color<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.990> therefore

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
most out of your color and therefore

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:24.840 
most out of your color and therefore
stretching<00:01:24.159> that<00:01:24.220> penny<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.520> little<00:01:24.760> bit

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
stretching that penny a little bit

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.250 
stretching that penny a little bit
farther<00:01:25.060> so<00:01:25.630> you<00:01:25.720> can<00:01:25.810> see<00:01:25.930> I've<00:01:26.020> got<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.170> little
