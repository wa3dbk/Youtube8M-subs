00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.600 
the thumb and importantly you're going
to<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.960> why<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.679> cool<00:01:29.039> that<00:01:29.069> the<00:01:29.399> thumb

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
to see why it's very cool that the thumb

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.020 
to see why it's very cool that the thumb
is<00:01:29.640> dampening<00:01:30.330> it<00:01:30.509> below<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:32.310> actual<00:01:32.700> third

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
fret in this case because if I want to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.410 
fret in this case because if I want to
move<00:01:35.810> say<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.020> bass<00:01:37.440> note<00:01:37.819> now<00:01:38.819> I'm<00:01:38.970> free<00:01:39.270> to
