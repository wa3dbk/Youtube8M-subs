00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.559
 go thereafter 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.709
 there by a third place 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.059
 thought you lost your way and 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.060
 think of 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.900
 I believe I can do it 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.289
 Open 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.289
 I am satisfied no 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.619
 the forgetful cowboy I know 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.610
 just read the back stocks 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.360
 but what I also wanted to do anyway 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.050
 look 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.010
 though that he did not clementine 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.640
 i can't keep sleeping to make it disgusting 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.580
 know you click on it 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.320
 for this purpose 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.290
 we are going to win 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.430
 apparently 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.060
 apa 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.060
 well that failed 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.219
 but it is good 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.079
 down 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.260
 Causing 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.650
 be true 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.440
 a shot 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.650
 I thought it once 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.260
 whatever you do we go through 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.200
 and 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.100
 no I do not know what I will do but what 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.899
 I thought so 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.570
 those steps will take fourth place 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.590
 that too is my back chest 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.340
 yes that parallel to the action very shocked world where you are not good at 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.600
 you can 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 what did you certainly not do what you wanted to do 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.549
 residents and clementine 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.500
 some work 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.630

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.970
 the light effects 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.240
 I can do that 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.580
 this is my biggest 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.690
 we saw broken with a pleasant thereby mostly dry and the towel that is 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.810
 and what is this what you want that to do 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.810

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.990

 greenery 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.980

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.569
