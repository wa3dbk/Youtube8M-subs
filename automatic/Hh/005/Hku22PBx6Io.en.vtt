00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
mathematician PI enthusiasts I enthuses

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.200 
mathematician PI enthusiasts I enthuses
because<00:00:07.140> it's<00:00:07.290> pi<00:00:07.440> day<00:00:07.470> it's<00:00:08.189> it's<00:00:08.429> March<00:00:08.700> 14th

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
because it's pi day it's it's March 14th

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.230 
because it's pi day it's it's March 14th
so<00:00:09.450> we're<00:00:09.570> at<00:00:09.719> mission<00:00:10.080> PI<00:00:10.759> celebrate<00:00:11.759> you're

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
so we're at mission PI celebrate you're

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.669 
so we're at mission PI celebrate you're
not<00:00:12.389> supposed<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.750> be<00:00:12.870> celebrating<00:00:13.170> pi<00:00:13.500> you're

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
not supposed to be celebrating pi you're

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.049 
not supposed to be celebrating pi you're
supposed<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.009> be<00:00:14.099> celebrating<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> number<00:00:14.880> pi

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
supposed to be celebrating the number pi

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.150 
supposed to be celebrating the number pi
but<00:00:15.630> we<00:00:15.719> figure<00:00:15.929> two<00:00:16.109> for<00:00:16.289> one<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.619> celebrate

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
but we figure two for one I celebrate

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.859 
but we figure two for one I celebrate
everything<00:00:17.520> by<00:00:17.640> eating<00:00:17.940> pies<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.510> do<00:00:18.630> sort

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
everything by eating pies so we do sort

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.019 
everything by eating pies so we do sort
of<00:00:18.960> make<00:00:19.080> sense<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.680> Tara<00:00:19.949> like<00:00:20.279> explain<00:00:20.789> first

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
of make sense so Tara like explain first

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.779 
of make sense so Tara like explain first
of<00:00:21.150> all<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:22.050> anybody<00:00:22.380> who<00:00:22.500> doesn't<00:00:22.650> know<00:00:22.859> some

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
of all to anybody who doesn't know some

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.880 
of all to anybody who doesn't know some
PI<00:00:23.939> 3.14159<00:00:26.779> number<00:00:27.779> pi<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.470> nothing

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
PI 3.14159 number pi is really nothing

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.529 
PI 3.14159 number pi is really nothing
special<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.609> an<00:00:29.699> irrational<00:00:29.939> number

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
special it's an irrational number

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.319 
special it's an irrational number
so<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:30.929> infinite<00:00:31.380> there's<00:00:31.969> you<00:00:32.969> know<00:00:33.000> an

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
so it's infinite there's you know an

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.970 
so it's infinite there's you know an
infinite<00:00:33.840> number<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.110> digits<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.739> it's

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
infinite number of digits and it's

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.530 
infinite number of digits and it's
seemingly<00:00:35.340> random<00:00:35.790> which<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.329> all<00:00:36.510> that

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
seemingly random which is not all that

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.180 
seemingly random which is not all that
uncommon<00:00:36.899> because<00:00:37.200> most<00:00:37.649> numbers<00:00:38.010> are

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
uncommon because most numbers are

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.310 
uncommon because most numbers are
irrational<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.030> significance<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.629> PI<00:00:39.870> comes

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
irrational the significance of PI comes

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.590 
irrational the significance of PI comes
in<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.620> fact<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.730> constant<00:00:41.940> that's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
in the fact that it's a constant that's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.840 
in the fact that it's a constant that's

it's used in astronomy it explains a lot

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.270 
it's used in astronomy it explains a lot

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
of the things about the way our world

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.680 
of the things about the way our world
works<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:50.940> don't<00:00:51.120> necessarily

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
works that we don't necessarily

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.720 
works that we don't necessarily
understand<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> basic<00:00:53.070> level<00:00:53.250> high

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
understand so on a basic level high

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.410 
understand so on a basic level high
describes<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.289> ratio<00:00:55.770> between<00:00:56.420> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
describes the ratio between the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.729 
describes the ratio between the
circumference<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> circle<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
circumference of a circle and the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.880 
circumference of a circle and the
diameter<00:00:59.070> right<00:00:59.570> okay<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:01.289> how<00:01:01.320> does<00:01:01.739> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
diameter right okay so then how does it

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.500 
diameter right okay so then how does it
get<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.340> larger<00:01:02.820> significance<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
get this larger significance of

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.299 
get this larger significance of
explaining<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> world<00:01:04.199> around<00:01:04.439> us

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
explaining the world around us

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.429 
explaining the world around us
that's<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.820> good<00:01:05.939> question<00:01:06.150> nobody<00:01:07.049> really

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
that's a good question nobody really

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.350 
that's a good question nobody really
knows<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> actual<00:01:08.400> significance<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
knows what the actual significance of it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.270 
knows what the actual significance of it
is<00:01:09.479> there's<00:01:09.869> no<00:01:10.049> way<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> calculate<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> circle

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
is there's no way to calculate a circle

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.270 
is there's no way to calculate a circle
without<00:01:11.400> knowing<00:01:12.000> pi<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.840> pi<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.049> endless<00:01:13.590> how

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
without knowing pi so pi is endless how

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.550 
without knowing pi so pi is endless how
long<00:01:14.430> we've<00:01:14.670> been<00:01:15.030> trying<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.450> calculate<00:01:15.840> pi<00:01:16.350> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
long we've been trying to calculate pi I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.399 
long we've been trying to calculate pi I
think<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> first<00:01:17.430> sort<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.270> proof<00:01:19.080> that

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
think the first sort of proof that

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.740 
think the first sort of proof that
somebody<00:01:20.070> had<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> concept<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.180> what<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.479> meant

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
somebody had a concept of what it meant

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.050 
somebody had a concept of what it meant
were<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.799> Babylonians<00:01:23.430> people<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:23.939> also

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
were the Babylonians people have also

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.660 
were the Babylonians people have also
said<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> ancient<00:01:25.080> Egyptians<00:01:25.619> used<00:01:25.950> pie

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
said that the ancient Egyptians used pie

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.399 
said that the ancient Egyptians used pie
in<00:01:27.119> their<00:01:27.360> construction<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> pyramids

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
in their construction of the pyramids

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.620 
in their construction of the pyramids
that's<00:01:28.710> still<00:01:29.009> sort<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> air<00:01:29.820> there

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that's still sort of up in the air there

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.210 
that's still sort of up in the air there
are<00:01:30.720> definitely<00:01:31.049> some<00:01:31.200> coincidences<00:01:31.950> there

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
are definitely some coincidences there

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.219 
are definitely some coincidences there
you<00:01:32.729> take<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> length<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.479> one<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> sides

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
you take the length of one of the sides

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.530 
you take the length of one of the sides
of<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> pyramids<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.759> double<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
of the pyramids and you double that and

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.560 
of the pyramids and you double that and
if<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.170> divide<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.590> by<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.579> height<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.420> get

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
if you divide that by the height you get

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.030 
if you divide that by the height you get
pi<00:01:39.810> people<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.350> sort<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.619> given<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.920> like

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
pi people have sort of given it like

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.429 
pi people have sort of given it like
spiritual<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:41.820> religious<00:01:42.329> implications<00:01:43.200> I

spiritual or religious implications I

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.990 
spiritual or religious implications I
don't<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.770> guess<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.189> sort<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.549> open<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
don't know I guess it's sort of open to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.310 
don't know I guess it's sort of open to
interpretation<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.750> people<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.110> love

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
interpretation but people do love

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.899 
interpretation but people do love
finding<00:01:46.740> patterns<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.399> numbers<00:01:47.490> they<00:01:47.850> do

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
finding patterns and numbers they do

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.460 
finding patterns and numbers they do
like<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.240> here<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.720> Albert<00:01:49.020> Einstein's

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
like you here like Albert Einstein's

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.679 
like you here like Albert Einstein's
birthday<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.549> March<00:01:51.000> 14th

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
birthday is is March 14th

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.499 
birthday is is March 14th
yeah<00:01:51.840> pi<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.009> hear<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.509> 360

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
yeah pi and then you hear the 360

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.870 
yeah pi and then you hear the 360
degrees<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.960> circle<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.920> go<00:01:56.009> 359

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
degrees in a circle and if you go 359

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.389 
degrees in a circle and if you go 359
digits<00:01:57.299> into<00:01:57.450> pi<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.409> next<00:01:58.680> digits<00:01:58.979> are<00:01:59.130> three

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
digits into pi the next digits are three

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.609 
digits into pi the next digits are three
six<00:01:59.700> zero<00:01:59.790> that's<00:02:00.450> that's<00:02:00.930> sort<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.350> stretch

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
six zero that's that's sort of a stretch

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.170 
six zero that's that's sort of a stretch
I<00:02:01.860> think<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.610> there<00:02:02.790> are<00:02:02.909> definitely

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
I think but there are definitely

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.090 
I think but there are definitely
coincidences<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.020> way<00:02:04.110> computers<00:02:04.439> calculate

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
coincidences the way computers calculate

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.070 
coincidences the way computers calculate
it<00:02:05.189> now<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.960> basically<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.110> by<00:02:07.259> doing

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
it now is basically just by doing

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.840 
it now is basically just by doing
series<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.530> fractions<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.220> actually<00:02:09.670> the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
series of fractions and actually the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.840 
series of fractions and actually the
first<00:02:10.030> person<00:02:10.479> who<00:02:10.860> rigorously<00:02:11.860> approximated

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
first person who rigorously approximated

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.220 
first person who rigorously approximated
the<00:02:12.910> value<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.360> was<00:02:13.480> Archimedes<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.110> we

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
the value of it was Archimedes and we

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.560 
the value of it was Archimedes and we
used<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:15.490> polygon<00:02:15.880> method<00:02:16.090> which<00:02:16.420> is

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
used the polygon method which is

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.390 
used the polygon method which is
basically<00:02:16.930> taking<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.470> circle<00:02:17.890> putting<00:02:18.310> a

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
basically taking a circle putting a

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.340 
basically taking a circle putting a
hexagon<00:02:18.880> inside<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:19.480> circle<00:02:19.660> so<00:02:20.020> all<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.230> the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
hexagon inside that circle so all of the

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.080 
hexagon inside that circle so all of the
points<00:02:20.530> touch<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.100> circle<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.640> putting

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
points touch the circle and putting

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.240 
points touch the circle and putting
another<00:02:22.270> one<00:02:22.360> outside<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.800> circle<00:02:24.100> lies

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
another one outside so the circle lies

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.600 
another one outside so the circle lies
tangential<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.090> all<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:26.100> sides<00:02:27.100> what<00:02:27.490> you

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
tangential to all of the sides what you

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.160 
tangential to all of the sides what you
have<00:02:27.760> when<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.090> do<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.570> an<00:02:28.750> upper<00:02:29.020> bound

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
have when you do that is an upper bound

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.020 
have when you do that is an upper bound
and<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.530> lower<00:02:29.650> bound<00:02:29.920> for<00:02:30.040> what<00:02:30.280> pi<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:30.970> if

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
and a lower bound for what pi is and if

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.810 
and a lower bound for what pi is and if
you<00:02:31.180> do<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.050> adding<00:02:32.560> one<00:02:32.830> side<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.550> the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
you do that adding one side to the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.400 
you do that adding one side to the
polygon<00:02:34.180> every<00:02:34.450> time<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.780> basically<00:02:35.140> get<00:02:35.380> a

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
polygon every time you basically get a

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.620 
polygon every time you basically get a
close<00:02:35.710> enough<00:02:35.980> approximation<00:02:36.330> yeah<00:02:37.330> that

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
close enough approximation yeah that

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.630 
close enough approximation yeah that
that<00:02:38.200> window<00:02:38.380> closes<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.190> eventually

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
that window closes and eventually

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.270 
that window closes and eventually
becomes<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.180> circle<00:02:40.360> yeah<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.280> Archimedes

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
becomes a circle yeah and so Archimedes

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.060 
becomes a circle yeah and so Archimedes
did<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:42.970> by<00:02:43.540> using<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.870> ninety<00:02:44.260> six<00:02:44.530> sided

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
did that by using a ninety six sided

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.610 
did that by using a ninety six sided
polygon<00:02:45.520> so<00:02:45.880> imagine<00:02:46.780> all<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.020> calculation

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
polygon so imagine all the calculation

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.580 
polygon so imagine all the calculation
that<00:02:47.650> went<00:02:48.070> into<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.490> so<00:02:49.000> how<00:02:49.240> many<00:02:50.020> digits

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
that went into that so how many digits

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.980 
that went into that so how many digits
of<00:02:50.740> pi<00:02:50.970> do<00:02:51.970> we<00:02:52.150> know

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
of pi do we know

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.250 
of pi do we know
I<00:02:53.020> think<00:02:53.500> our<00:02:53.740> latest<00:02:54.070> calculations<00:02:54.790> have

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
I think our latest calculations have

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.600 
I think our latest calculations have
figured<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.350> out<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.680> about<00:02:56.770> ten<00:02:57.190> trillion

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
figured it out to about ten trillion

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.720 
figured it out to about ten trillion
digits<00:02:58.500> they<00:02:59.500> call<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.100> normal<00:03:00.310> which<00:03:00.700> means

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
digits they call it normal which means

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.630 
digits they call it normal which means
that<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.300> is<00:03:01.660> considered<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.620> be<00:03:02.740> a<00:03:03.070> random

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
that it is considered to be a random

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.640 
that it is considered to be a random
sequence<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:04.180> numbers<00:03:04.540> people<00:03:05.290> don't<00:03:05.410> just

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
sequence of numbers people don't just

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.680 
sequence of numbers people don't just
attach<00:03:06.010> significance<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:06.970> number<00:03:07.300> they

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
attach significance to the number they

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.880 
attach significance to the number they
attach<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.080> lot<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.290> significance<00:03:08.770> to

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
attach a lot of significance to

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.360 
attach a lot of significance to
memorizing<00:03:09.959> i<00:03:10.959> know<00:03:11.170> thirty<00:03:11.530> digits<00:03:11.920> but

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
memorizing i know thirty digits but

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.070 
memorizing i know thirty digits but
actually<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.269> think<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.600> Guinness<00:03:13.840> world

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
actually the I think the Guinness world

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.290 
actually the I think the Guinness world
record<00:03:14.230> right<00:03:14.500> now<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.650> guy<00:03:15.310> from<00:03:15.489> China<00:03:15.760> who

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
record right now is guy from China who

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.030 
record right now is guy from China who
well<00:03:16.870> he<00:03:16.989> said<00:03:17.170> he<00:03:17.230> memorize<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.530> hundred

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
well he said he memorize a hundred

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.520 
well he said he memorize a hundred
thousand<00:03:18.550> digits<00:03:18.700> high<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.750> apparently<00:03:20.320> he

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
thousand digits high and apparently he

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.170 
thousand digits high and apparently he
only<00:03:20.709> got<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:21.070> sixty<00:03:21.400> seven<00:03:21.640> thousand<00:03:22.030> before

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
only got to sixty seven thousand before

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.960 
only got to sixty seven thousand before
he<00:03:22.630> screwed<00:03:23.590> up<00:03:23.739> which<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.250> guess<00:03:24.459> they<00:03:24.670> stopped

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
he screwed up which I guess they stopped

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.940 
he screwed up which I guess they stopped
you<00:03:25.239> because<00:03:25.660> they're<00:03:25.810> like<00:03:26.019> oh<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.739> guy's<00:03:26.920> a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
you because they're like oh this guy's a
