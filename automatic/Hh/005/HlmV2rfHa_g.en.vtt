00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.009
 bios 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:19.910
 inside h20 version 37 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:23.609
 I suffered for a long time with this in general and 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.660
 finally resolved it all myself understood how 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.500

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.800

 This button here and of course you can see well 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.590
 and generally not visible there is an exit button 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.430
 in bios if you have the computer turned off well 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.390
 in general, just press f2 here you

 there is such a window 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.399
 in general, just go to bios first 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.360
 here we are 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:08.160

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.100
 disk 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:21.050
 as my case where it is written yusbi legacy 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:26.930
 put 10 will go further in the boot 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.930
 by default we should show now 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.729

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.690

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:45.509
 legacy support is also here where 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:48.840
 there will be priority there by default first 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.350
 there was this one garbage we need legacy 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.450

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:19.680
