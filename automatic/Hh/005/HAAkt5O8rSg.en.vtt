00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.259
 hello to all my dear youtubers 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:08.380
 we are in this video to see a 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.640
 monster collection update 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.190
 high 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:17.180
 as you can see there are some new masters 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:20.630
 then let's see them in this video 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.730
 look at one of the new spring that is 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.410
 there 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.410
 we also have afghanistan 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.640
 another new master where is 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.640
 it's for acne 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.770
 is the daughter of the spider 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.020
 and we also have as a new night and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.330
 roll 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 that comes out in the new monster movie 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.690
 high that is geek fusion and you see that 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.900
 nate and is a half hybrid monster 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.840
 unicorn zombie half 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.280
 and we also have javier trotter that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.280
 it's half centaur half 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.420
 then there we have the new master 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.009
 jai of the collection 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.439
 I always like to put them in 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.390
 couples if they see that they are always 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.280
 matched if they have a partner 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.250
 always go together 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.760
 Actually there's no talk of rosell with 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.979
 this mouse or in particular they say that 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.280
 she is on scales looking for her 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.990
 boyfriend 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.020
 but since there is not a monster that has 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.909
 come out particularly from him then I 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.040
 I bought this monster that is equal a 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.590
 gargoyle and it appears that quietly 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.659
 could be rosell's boyfriend 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.240
 We have here where we have another 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.009
 couple that we have not seen to see by 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.009
 course here is the lagoon and guide 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.100
 and although there is not much talk about this either 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.680
 but good is ittube face edu say that 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.450
 they could also be inseparable not 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.880
 They speak precisely of a couple but 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.880
 they say they could be inseparable 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.920
 I really love the master jai 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.620
 they have not only their face is beautiful 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.570
 They are beautiful in general but also 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.300
 his look his style is super fashion 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.040
 I love collecting them and I do not think 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.700
 I will stop in the collection I will continue 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.410
 expanding a little bit 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.270
 I wanted to get the other two 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.000
 divided monsters that are new to 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.120
 the school 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.320
 what is the mermaid and is also the moth 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.330
 but I have not been able to get them yet 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.250
 as you know after Christmas eras 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.140
 the toys run out a bit then 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.210
 I think I'll have to wait for 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.930
 come back more copies of them 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.270
 finally ask for them online some 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.660
 of my monster high monsters are 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.910
 here they were ordered by internet and 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.500
 they were brought directly here to the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.990
 house one of them is where he is here 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.300
 as well 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.500
 the little hit branch came from 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.990
 Germany 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.640
 he was part of a collection that just 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.380
 it reads at that moment that he was coming together 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.720
 with abominable that is mad science 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.260
 in this case I bought it only from him 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.700
 because I had previously another one 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.340
 it showed that I brought myself online was 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.920
 guided gerber because as you know 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.420
 guide does not come alone in a box really 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.220
 here in the least in the country has not 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.410
 come only in a box but 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.390
 came along with other monsters from 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.940
 monster high and buy that box 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.350
 it only cost you more than 100 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.090
 dollars then it really was not 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.680
 feasible to buy here or in all 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.450
 apart from the collection 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.880
 besides that as you know I do not 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.420
 like to repeat the monsters to me 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.550
 I do not like having two spectra two 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.830
 operettas etcetera but have one of 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.160
 each one only in the case of claudin 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.940
 is where I have two because actually 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.760
 I do not know if it can be called as 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.160
 a cloud in normal because it agulates 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.790
 then this is how it is a cloud in normal 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.220
 You can even see it in the color of your 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.280
 vinyl can be seen there in this case 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.440
 cloud in is opaque 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.590
 and this claudin here already has a little 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.300
 more than brightness since it's the material that 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.810
 used on his face is a plastic 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.810
 harder 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.210
 to see that I took her suit online 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.639
 Well obviously I also brought your 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.270
 gordon 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:41.569
 I also brought a lagoon 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.669
 and I also brought cleo on the internet 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:46.610
 leo and lagoons are from the collection 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.919
 escarÃ­s 2 is also from the collection 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.350
 escarÃ­s is more wine with this clothes that 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.910
 this vampire lord is here 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.160
 but I also brought myself online 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.360
 apart I only bought the clothes of doubt 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.360
 part to put it on 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:08.680
 and which other parts came to me and I also 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:11.540

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.610
 also extracted by internet 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.730
 good and cardigan is from the normal collection 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.350

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.350
 then she is from the basic collection 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.970
 I also brought myself online 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.060
 I also brought me online from china 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.430

 because if yesterday we were not here yet 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.330

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.289

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:54.690
