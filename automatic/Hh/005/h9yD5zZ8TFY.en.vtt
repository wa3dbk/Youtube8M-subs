wide<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.670> see<00:02:48.849> how<00:02:48.940> closely<00:02:49.209> come<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.630> my

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
wide so you see how closely come to my

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.170 
wide so you see how closely come to my
head<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:51.370> know<00:02:51.400> these<00:02:51.610> things<00:02:51.790> hit<00:02:52.030> you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
head and you know these things hit you

head and you know these things hit you
so<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.840> can<00:02:52.959> see<00:02:53.079> how<00:02:53.140> wide<00:02:53.380> these<00:02:53.590> dumbbells

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
so you can see how wide these dumbbells

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.420 
so you can see how wide these dumbbells
are<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:55.390> up<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.110> be<00:02:56.739> more<00:02:56.860> convenient<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.310> can

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
are so up and be more convenient I can

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.990 
are so up and be more convenient I can
go<00:02:57.519> down<00:02:57.670> like<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.120> do<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:59.260> um<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
go down like this and I do but um the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.229 
go down like this and I do but um the
other<00:03:01.090> thing<00:03:01.209> is<00:03:01.510> if<00:03:01.840> you're<00:03:02.079> doing<00:03:02.200> curls<00:03:02.739> I

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
other thing is if you're doing curls I

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.300 
other thing is if you're doing curls I
think<00:03:04.239> he<00:03:04.360> calls<00:03:04.720> them<00:03:05.019> condon<00:03:05.620> curls<00:03:06.040> when

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
think he calls them condon curls when

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.710 
think he calls them condon curls when
you're<00:03:06.459> up<00:03:07.060> against<00:03:07.329> the<00:03:07.390> wall<00:03:07.599> on<00:03:07.630> your

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
you're up against the wall on your

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.710 
you're up against the wall on your
needle<00:03:07.989> over<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:09.130> pull<00:03:09.400> these<00:03:09.549> up

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
needle over and you you pull these up

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.089 
needle over and you you pull these up
well<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.810> problem<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.230> when<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.709> pull<00:03:11.950> them

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
well the problem is when you pull them

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.890 
well the problem is when you pull them
up<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.549> see<00:03:12.730> how<00:03:12.760> post<00:03:13.090> these<00:03:13.239> dumbbells<00:03:13.840> here

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
up you see how post these dumbbells here

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.789 
up you see how post these dumbbells here
are<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.220> pull<00:03:15.430> them<00:03:15.609> up<00:03:16.049> they<00:03:17.049> hit<00:03:17.290> be

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
are and you pull them up they hit be

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.530 
are and you pull them up they hit be
nicer<00:03:18.160> if<00:03:18.190> they<00:03:18.519> weren't<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:18.910> why'd<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.120> go<00:03:19.420> in

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
nicer if they weren't so why'd you go in

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.580 
nicer if they weren't so why'd you go in
closer<00:03:19.870> um<00:03:20.799> I'm<00:03:21.790> on<00:03:21.970> shorter<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.170> smaller<00:03:23.260> guy

that kind of that base that that this
thing<00:04:02.500> sits<00:04:02.769> on<00:04:02.980> it's<00:04:03.190> got<00:04:03.340> wheels<00:04:03.519> you<00:04:03.880> can

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
thing sits on it's got wheels you can

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.870 
thing sits on it's got wheels you can
see<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.239> wheels<00:04:04.420> here<00:04:04.690> let<00:04:04.930> me<00:04:05.220> get<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.280> more<00:04:06.819> of

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
see the wheels here let me get a more of

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.750 
see the wheels here let me get a more of
a<00:04:06.940> close<00:04:07.150> up<00:04:07.359> on<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.630> wheels<00:04:07.780> here<00:04:08.549> so<00:04:09.549> you<00:04:09.609> can

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
a close up on the wheels here so you can

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.470 
a close up on the wheels here so you can
see<00:04:09.910> that<00:04:10.060> they've<00:04:10.480> got<00:04:10.510> casters<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:12.389> so<00:04:13.389> you

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
see that they've got casters and so you

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.680 
see that they've got casters and so you
can<00:04:13.690> roll<00:04:13.900> them<00:04:14.049> around<00:04:14.760> no<00:04:15.760> this<00:04:16.180> this<00:04:16.419> this

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
can roll them around no this this this

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.130 
can roll them around no this this this
uh<00:04:16.750> thing<00:04:17.410> is<00:04:17.560> really<00:04:18.070> sturdy

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
uh thing is really sturdy

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.659 
uh thing is really sturdy
um<00:04:20.140> they<00:04:20.739> hold<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.070> weights<00:04:21.250> really<00:04:21.519> well

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
um they hold the weights really well

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.860 
um they hold the weights really well
they<00:04:21.820> won't<00:04:21.940> Rock<00:04:22.289> again

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
they won't Rock again

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.540 
they won't Rock again
like<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.470> lot<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.740> these<00:04:24.860> other<00:04:25.040> things<00:04:25.160> you

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
like a lot of these other things you

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.090 
like a lot of these other things you
become<00:04:26.060> disassembled<00:04:26.870> as<00:04:27.020> far<00:04:27.199> that<00:04:27.410> that

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
become disassembled as far that that

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.970 
become disassembled as far that that
stand<00:04:28.460> goes<00:04:28.669> you<00:04:28.850> have<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.060> reassemble<00:04:29.480> them

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
stand goes you have to reassemble them

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.170 
stand goes you have to reassemble them
but<00:04:30.980> it's<00:04:31.160> pretty<00:04:31.340> easy<00:04:31.460> just<00:04:31.760> gotta<00:04:32.090> take

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
but it's pretty easy just gotta take

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.330 
but it's pretty easy just gotta take
your<00:04:32.300> time<00:04:32.360> it<00:04:32.660> takes<00:04:32.900> about<00:04:32.990> so<00:04:33.410> 20<00:04:34.250> minutes

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
your time it takes about so 20 minutes

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.290 
your time it takes about so 20 minutes
to<00:04:34.750> assemble<00:04:35.750> it<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.699> you<00:04:37.699> can<00:04:37.820> see<00:04:37.970> there's<00:04:38.180> a

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
to assemble it and you can see there's a

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.840 
to assemble it and you can see there's a
bar<00:04:38.479> down<00:04:38.510> here<00:04:39.250> let<00:04:40.250> me<00:04:40.280> see<00:04:40.460> if<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.610> can<00:04:40.729> get<00:04:40.820> a

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
bar down here let me see if I can get a

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.430 
bar down here let me see if I can get a
shot<00:04:41.090> at<00:04:41.240> that<00:04:41.270> work<00:04:41.510> my<00:04:41.810> hand<00:04:42.050> on<00:04:42.199> there<00:04:42.350> so

shot at that work my hand on there so
you<00:04:42.470> got<00:04:42.590> a<00:04:42.650> bar<00:04:42.830> down<00:04:42.979> here<00:04:43.010> we<00:04:43.250> can<00:04:43.400> pull<00:04:43.580> this

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
you got a bar down here we can pull this

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.010 
you got a bar down here we can pull this
thing<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:44.060> roll<00:04:44.270> around<00:04:44.500> umm<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:47.449> show<00:04:47.960> you

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.750 
thing to roll around umm and show you
some<00:04:48.260> of<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.440> get<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.800> close-up<00:04:49.040> of<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.370> dial

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.730 

and<00:04:52.760> this<00:04:52.970> is<00:04:53.120> dials<00:04:53.600> these<00:04:54.169> are<00:04:54.290> the<00:04:54.380> dials

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
and this is dials these are the dials

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.980 
and this is dials these are the dials
that<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:54.979> turn<00:04:55.220> to<00:04:56.050> readjust<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.229> weights<00:04:57.880> um

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
that you turn to readjust the weights um

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.659 
that you turn to readjust the weights um
let<00:04:59.990> me<00:05:00.080> try<00:05:00.380> to<00:05:00.410> show<00:05:01.030> you<00:05:02.030> here<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:03.490> don't<00:05:04.490> know

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
let me try to show you here I don't know

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:05.890 
let me try to show you here I don't know
if<00:05:04.700> you<00:05:04.790> can<00:05:04.880> get<00:05:05.000> a<00:05:05.030> shot<00:05:05.090> at<00:05:05.419> that<00:05:05.450> it's

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
if you can get a shot at that it's

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.129 
if you can get a shot at that it's
pretty<00:05:06.139> close<00:05:06.889> but<00:05:07.130> anyways<00:05:07.479> they<00:05:08.479> lock<00:05:08.930> into

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
pretty close but anyways they lock into

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.659 
pretty close but anyways they lock into
place<00:05:09.320> in<00:05:09.590> each<00:05:09.680> d-10<00:05:11.770> um<00:05:12.770> I<00:05:12.830> guess<00:05:13.310> there's

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
place in each d-10 um I guess there's

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.640 
place in each d-10 um I guess there's
not<00:05:13.850> much<00:05:14.030> more<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.389> that<00:05:15.130> so<00:05:16.130> basically

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
not much more to that so basically

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.200 
not much more to that so basically
that's<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.950> system<00:05:21.340> okay<00:05:22.340> so<00:05:22.400> that's<00:05:22.699> it<00:05:22.970> for

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
that's the system okay so that's it for

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.900 
that's the system okay so that's it for
my<00:05:23.300> review<00:05:23.330> of<00:05:23.630> the<00:05:24.039> Bowflex<00:05:25.039> adjustable

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
my review of the Bowflex adjustable

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:26.500 
my review of the Bowflex adjustable
dumbbells

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
dumbbells

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.740 
dumbbells
um<00:05:26.720> I<00:05:27.320> think<00:05:27.740> Gold's<00:05:28.070> Gym<00:05:28.100> also<00:05:28.639> has<00:05:28.820> a<00:05:28.850> double

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
um I think Gold's Gym also has a double

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.750 
um I think Gold's Gym also has a double
adjustable<00:05:30.500> dumbbell<00:05:30.979> said<00:05:31.190> I<00:05:31.250> did<00:05:31.550> take<00:05:31.729> a

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
adjustable dumbbell said I did take a

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.600 
adjustable dumbbell said I did take a
look<00:05:31.970> at<00:05:32.150> it<00:05:32.330> instead<00:05:33.289> of<00:05:33.530> dialing<00:05:33.919> it<00:05:34.220> in<00:05:34.340> you

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
look at it instead of dialing it in you

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.760 
look at it instead of dialing it in you
move<00:05:34.729> these<00:05:34.880> sliders<00:05:35.090> I<00:05:35.630> felt<00:05:35.870> that<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.229> dial

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
move these sliders I felt that the dial

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.480 
move these sliders I felt that the dial
had<00:05:37.070> a<00:05:37.360> better<00:05:38.360> action<00:05:38.630> and<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:40.070> sliders<00:05:40.460> you

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
had a better action and the sliders you

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.860 
had a better action and the sliders you
can<00:05:40.550> I<00:05:40.700> have<00:05:40.820> to<00:05:40.880> lift<00:05:41.060> them<00:05:41.150> up<00:05:41.210> and<00:05:41.389> pull<00:05:41.660> and

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
can I have to lift them up and pull and

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.879 
can I have to lift them up and pull and
you<00:05:41.960> can<00:05:42.110> feel<00:05:42.229> them<00:05:42.349> catching<00:05:42.710> on<00:05:42.800> the

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
you can feel them catching on the

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.080 
you can feel them catching on the
details<00:05:43.280> so<00:05:43.370> it<00:05:43.430> wasn't<00:05:43.669> a<00:05:43.700> real<00:05:44.410> smooth

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
details so it wasn't a real smooth

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.360 
details so it wasn't a real smooth
mechanism<00:05:47.090> so<00:05:47.950> they're<00:05:48.950> a<00:05:48.979> little<00:05:49.130> bit

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
mechanism so they're a little bit

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.560 
mechanism so they're a little bit
cheaper<00:05:49.820> but<00:05:49.970> I<00:05:50.419> went<00:05:50.750> for<00:05:51.430> on<00:05:52.430> the<00:05:53.030> action<00:05:53.419> on

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
cheaper but I went for on the action on

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.770 
cheaper but I went for on the action on
the<00:05:53.720> on<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:54.470> adjustability<00:05:55.370> of<00:05:55.400> the<00:05:55.910> of<00:05:56.660> the

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
the on the adjustability of the of the

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.400 
the on the adjustability of the of the
weights<00:05:56.990> so<00:05:57.370> anyway<00:05:58.370> until<00:05:59.180> the<00:06:00.050> next<00:06:00.200> time<00:06:00.380> I

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
weights so anyway until the next time I

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.520 
weights so anyway until the next time I
