a lot more improved than what you see in
here<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:36.620> how<00:01:37.070> does<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.790> UI<00:01:37.940> work<00:01:38.360> how<00:01:38.540> do<00:01:38.600> you

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
here so how does the UI work how do you

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.900 
here so how does the UI work how do you
play<00:01:38.990> how<00:01:39.320> do<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.560> but<00:01:40.010> how<00:01:40.280> does<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.430> work

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
play how do you but how does that work

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.410 
play how do you but how does that work
shall<00:01:41.330> we<00:01:41.360> operate<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:42.740> four<00:01:43.640> different<00:01:43.850> ways

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
shall we operate in four different ways

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.440 
shall we operate in four different ways
we<00:01:44.930> have<00:01:45.020> button<00:01:45.350> controls<00:01:45.970> up<00:01:46.970> on<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.240> top

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
we have button controls up on the top

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.180 
we have button controls up on the top
and<00:01:48.230> on<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.530> bottom<00:01:48.680> we<00:01:50.200> have<00:01:51.200> gesture

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
and on the bottom we have gesture

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.120 
and on the bottom we have gesture
recognition<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:53.570> here's<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.080> gesture<00:01:54.650> sensor

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
recognition so here's a gesture sensor

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.710 
recognition so here's a gesture sensor
on<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.400> side<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:55.910> can<00:01:56.090> move<00:01:56.180> your<00:01:56.330> hands

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
on the side so you can move your hands

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.050 
on the side so you can move your hands

sitting<00:04:38.370> on<00:04:38.460> top<00:04:38.670> of<00:04:38.880> my<00:04:39.000> desk<00:04:39.210> at<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.540> office

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.300 

huge<00:04:42.840> future<00:04:43.110> for<00:04:43.230> the<00:04:43.530> realm<00:04:43.710> of<00:04:43.830> computing

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
huge future for the realm of computing

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.080 
huge future for the realm of computing
so<00:04:45.060> future<00:04:45.480> is<00:04:45.720> going<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.080> be<00:04:46.880> destroyed<00:04:47.880> the
