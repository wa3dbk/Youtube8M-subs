00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.199
 beaten guys here he did and we start 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.609
 immediately with the eleventh episode 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.430
 I should have trained at 10, however, given the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.390
 requests of some of you I have decided to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.770
 continue with the eleventh episode 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:43.829
 what reminds you of this beautiful billboard 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.309
 certainly for those who had played gta 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.309
 san andreas 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.440
 it will come back to mind, in fact, requires 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.930
 face is very similar lies in this 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.430
 however I am advertising billboard 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.059
 always been quite skeptical about 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.920
 this one instead we find a billboard 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.870
 which needs no explanation in 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.120
 how soon you will understand his 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:15.270
 meaning a well in the billboard 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:18.630
 here is what to say and advertise 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.750
 the extreme sports drink a drink 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.160
 energy therefore red bull style 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:32.310
 creator in these who asks here 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:38.840
 you have understood the reference now 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:42.840
 we have to go to the airport here 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.170
 airport of the first island maybe 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.800
 try to go back up here 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.300
 because you can see it better now me 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.670
 the tail of the helicopter is detached e 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.980
 randomly in perfect position e 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.920
 we can see on this clearing up 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:06.090
 this small land is small for 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.179
 way of saying the classic facet 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.160
 let's say you use it in chats on social networks 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:16.610
 network and similar things I don't know why 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.610
 be there 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.520
 this is exactly what I said I did a 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.330
 safe landing avoid breaking through 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.590
 all 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.590
 the helicopter like I did 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.980
 that I almost killed this is 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.950
 another thing I am very much about 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.340
 skeptical or the alien from miguel park 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.610
 is called and if you look we say that 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.950
 the lake can take on a sort of shape 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.420
 you want to lice the eye up there 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:57.440
 we say that islet onwards, we say 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:59.180
 of this alien but another thing of which 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.410
 I have never been completely convinced 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.940
 and that's why I didn't already have it 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.940
 proposed in previous videos 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.570
 for in fact as you have seen 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.050
 the underside of the body was enough 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:19.910
 abstract to it tends towards the trophies 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:21.620
 in fact we will need trophies because 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.770
 we're going to see some particular names 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:29.390
 that the rock star is assigned murder 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.530
 born the murderer born actually was that is 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.380

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.739
 greed kills and reported 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:44.269

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.180

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.650
 numerous complaints 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.019
