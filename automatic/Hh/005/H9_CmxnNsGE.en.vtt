years<00:01:45.620> ago<00:01:46.030> never<00:01:47.030> dreamed<00:01:47.480> that<00:01:48.040> will<00:01:49.040> happen

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
years ago never dreamed that will happen

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.110 
years ago never dreamed that will happen
after<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.570> logged<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:51.050> I<00:01:51.770> was<00:01:52.310> sure<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.580> found

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
after so logged on I was sure I found

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.700 
after so logged on I was sure I found
something<00:01:53.450> about<00:01:53.870> interesting<00:01:54.500> and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
something about interesting and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.830 
something about interesting and
inspiring<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.610> I<00:01:56.030> think<00:01:56.300> one<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.659> reasons

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
inspiring and I think one of the reasons

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.140 
inspiring and I think one of the reasons
why<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.530> has<00:01:57.710> inspired<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:58.400> much<00:01:58.640> cultural

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
why it has inspired so much cultural

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.360 
why it has inspired so much cultural
reflection<00:01:59.780> is<00:01:59.930> that<00:02:00.440> it's<00:02:00.590> very<00:02:00.800> rare<00:02:01.340> to

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
reflection is that it's very rare to

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.810 
reflection is that it's very rare to
have<00:02:01.850> an<00:02:02.060> object<00:02:02.540> which<00:02:03.170> is<00:02:03.200> small<00:02:04.159> enough<00:02:04.190> and

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
have an object which is small enough and

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.910 
have an object which is small enough and
simple<00:02:05.570> enough<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.050> you<00:02:06.380> can<00:02:06.530> look<00:02:06.710> at<00:02:06.890> it

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
simple enough that you can look at it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.309 
simple enough that you can look at it
immediately<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.940> see<00:02:08.300> what<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.690> puzzle<00:02:09.140> is

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
immediately and see what the puzzle is

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.750 
immediately and see what the puzzle is
so<00:02:10.009> at<00:02:10.340> its<00:02:10.550> essence<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.390> toy<00:02:11.750> it's<00:02:12.159> playful<00:02:13.159> it

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
so at its essence a toy it's playful it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.670 
so at its essence a toy it's playful it
brings<00:02:14.090> joy<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.780> lot<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:14.989> people<00:02:15.409> and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
brings joy to a lot of people and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.910 
brings joy to a lot of people and
there's<00:02:16.069> this<00:02:16.569> elegant<00:02:17.569> simplicity<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:18.379> it<00:02:18.409> so

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
there's this elegant simplicity to it so

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.580 
there's this elegant simplicity to it so
you<00:02:19.310> know<00:02:19.430> we<00:02:19.549> take<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.090> sort<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
you know we take that a sort of the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.830 
you know we take that a sort of the
spirit<00:02:22.099> that<00:02:22.459> we<00:02:22.730> want<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.150> pervade

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
spirit that we want to pervade

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.410 
spirit that we want to pervade
throughout<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.650> exhibition<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:26.209> most

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
throughout the exhibition and the most

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.390 
throughout the exhibition and the most
stunning<00:02:26.659> thing<00:02:26.930> for<00:02:27.140> me<00:02:27.260> was<00:02:27.440> although<00:02:27.860> you

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
stunning thing for me was although you

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.470 
stunning thing for me was although you
know<00:02:28.489> actually<00:02:28.640> when<00:02:28.849> you<00:02:28.940> calculate<00:02:29.120> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
know actually when you calculate the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.290 
know actually when you calculate the
number<00:02:29.629> of<00:02:29.780> symmetries<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:31.310> know<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:32.090> number

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
number of symmetries you know the number

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.090 
number of symmetries you know the number
of<00:02:32.360> different<00:02:32.630> configurations<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.380> colors<00:02:33.830> is

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
of different configurations of colors is

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.740 
of different configurations of colors is
of<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.790> order

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
of the order

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.800 
of the order
I<00:02:35.810> think<00:02:36.290> what<00:02:36.380> is<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.590> something<00:02:37.100> like<00:02:37.810> 43

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
I think what is it something like 43

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.400 
I think what is it something like 43
quintillion<00:02:39.910> 18<00:02:40.910> zeroes<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.660> think<00:02:42.200> also

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
quintillion 18 zeroes I think also

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.850 
quintillion 18 zeroes I think also
there's<00:02:43.280> something<00:02:43.610> in<00:02:43.850> us<00:02:44.180> where<00:02:45.080> we<00:02:45.440> want<00:02:45.470> to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
there's something in us where we want to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.340 
there's something in us where we want to

bring order to chaos even though is

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.650 
bring order to chaos even though is

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660

that it's both chaos and complexity it's

that it's both chaos and complexity it's

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
both formula and intuition at once and i

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.130 
both formula and intuition at once and i
think<00:03:30.830> it's<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.040> dualism<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:32.510> is<00:03:32.690> such<00:03:32.959> an

think it's that dualism that is such an

important part of science that you have

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.670 
important part of science that you have
to<00:03:34.850> use<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.630> rigorous<00:03:35.930> side<00:03:36.200> of<00:03:36.350> your<00:03:36.470> mind

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
to use the rigorous side of your mind

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.010 
to use the rigorous side of your mind
that<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.340> also<00:03:37.489> have<00:03:37.910> to<00:03:38.060> be<00:03:38.180> open<00:03:38.570> to<00:03:38.840> just

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
that you also have to be open to just

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.640 
that you also have to be open to just
letting<00:03:39.380> your<00:03:39.530> mind<00:03:39.680> play<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:41.269> so<00:03:42.140> I<00:03:42.440> find

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
letting your mind play and so I find

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.259 
letting your mind play and so I find
that<00:03:42.739> mesh<00:03:42.920> very<00:03:43.100> naturally<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:43.820> find<00:03:44.120> that

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
that mesh very naturally and I find that

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.020 
that mesh very naturally and I find that
I<00:03:44.480> mean<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:45.049> reason<00:03:45.080> why<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.500> enjoy<00:03:46.310> making<00:03:46.640> art

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.300 
genius of this object that in many ways
it's<00:03:58.549> like<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.790> kindergarten<00:03:59.660> toy<00:04:00.160> but<00:04:01.160> it

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
it's like a kindergarten toy but it

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.979 
it's like a kindergarten toy but it
actually<00:04:01.489> teaches<00:04:02.120> us<00:04:02.239> profound<00:04:02.600> things

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
actually teaches us profound things

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.190 
actually teaches us profound things
mentally<00:04:03.860> but<00:04:04.370> also<00:04:04.579> I<00:04:04.820> think<00:04:05.200> beautifully

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
mentally but also I think beautifully

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.350 
mentally but also I think beautifully
physically<00:04:06.950> it<00:04:07.100> teaches<00:04:07.430> us<00:04:07.459> about<00:04:07.970> our

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
physically it teaches us about our

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.479 
physically it teaches us about our
relationship<00:04:09.110> in<00:04:09.260> space<00:04:09.530> because<00:04:10.190> here's<00:04:10.430> a

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
relationship in space because here's a

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:11.770 
relationship in space because here's a
little<00:04:10.730> thing<00:04:10.760> that<00:04:10.940> we<00:04:11.150> can<00:04:11.299> hold<00:04:11.540> in<00:04:11.690> our

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
little thing that we can hold in our

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.080 
little thing that we can hold in our
hands<00:04:12.350> but<00:04:12.950> what<00:04:13.070> I<00:04:13.100> love<00:04:13.190> about<00:04:13.370> this<00:04:13.700> cube<00:04:14.000> is

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
hands but what I love about this cube is

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.479 
hands but what I love about this cube is
the<00:04:14.209> stunning<00:04:14.570> discovery<00:04:15.380> by<00:04:15.650> mathematicians

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
the stunning discovery by mathematicians

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.520 
the stunning discovery by mathematicians
that<00:04:16.790> but<00:04:17.120> although<00:04:17.419> it's<00:04:17.900> got<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:18.350> many

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
that but although it's got so many

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.099 
that but although it's got so many
different<00:04:18.799> symmetries<00:04:19.479> actually<00:04:20.479> it<00:04:20.900> only

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
different symmetries actually it only

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.040 
different symmetries actually it only

using<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:41.200> primary<00:04:42.200> colors<00:04:42.849> what<00:04:43.849> is<00:04:44.000> very

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
using the primary colors what is very

using the primary colors what is very
easy<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:44.960> distinguish<00:04:46.060> that<00:04:47.060> helps<00:04:47.539> so<00:04:48.080> I

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:49.249 
easy to distinguish that helps so I

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:52.689 
easy to distinguish that helps so I
wanted<00:04:49.549> to<00:04:50.049> design<00:04:51.049> the<00:04:51.319> cube<00:04:51.649> the<00:04:52.129> appearance

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
wanted to design the cube the appearance

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.369 
wanted to design the cube the appearance
of<00:04:52.849> the<00:04:53.059> cube<00:04:53.389> to<00:04:54.079> have<00:04:55.009> the<00:04:55.669> user<00:04:56.119> to<00:04:56.929> have<00:04:57.139> the

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.579 
of the cube to have the user to have the
soul<00:04:57.649> because<00:04:58.339> I<00:04:58.579> will<00:04:59.479> I<00:04:59.779> believe<00:05:00.169> in<00:05:00.409> my

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
experience the fast is difficult enough

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.399 
experience the fast is difficult enough
by<00:05:04.159> itself<00:05:04.189> you<00:05:05.059> don't<00:05:05.389> need<00:05:05.629> to<00:05:05.689> make<00:05:06.079> it<00:05:06.259> more

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.409 
by itself you don't need to make it more
