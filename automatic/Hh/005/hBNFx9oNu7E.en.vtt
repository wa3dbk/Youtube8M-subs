00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.670
 I came here to talk about the practice game. 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.670
 technical or physical part with the technical 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.419
 and starting from behind and always occupied enough 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.630
 with a very serious error at the moment in the championship that is 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.779
 This type of error is inadmissible. 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.900
 an arbitrator 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.359
 Experient 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.490
 comes in bad phase the whole Brazilian championship had no chest 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.059
 did not have chest for such by the title a little talc or had no chest 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.600
 lacked courage 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.860
 to the top to give a legitimate goal 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.100
 at the moment of the championship 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
 the first day of this one has been successful 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.500
 yesterday that Celsinho not having to climb can escalate the symptoms that he has 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.839
 courage to whistle a game of these 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.490
 it is easy to whistle she cites that it only applies to which 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.900
 legitimate where you want to hire the abel suffered the 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.640
 I repeat the lack 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.820
 so it was clear in all the pictures because with the simpsons they are called hemopa 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.690
 give a collective and explain 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.690
 I suggest you, the press. 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.350
 this man the simÃ£o Sergio Correia I led the eliterio referees Sergio 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.479
 runs every explanation not at sea in an absurd marking of spear 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.930
 a shame that happens today 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.930
 a very serious technical mistake 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.140
 is inadmissible 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.820
 despite the great ability of the Fluminense in his great coach who 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.680
 has 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.480
 One thing is one thing 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.979
 the arbitration 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.719
 injured the palm trees and the Fluminense could have won the game anyway 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.600
 having passed by which could 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.070
 now you can not admit mistake of this kind is easy to whistle one decides that he 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.350
 do not punctuate complicated 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.150
 of thumping inside the area in a ball contest was not a 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.920
 honor a new throw of the ball on the Saturday was in front of his marker him 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.660
 I missed the obina 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.110
 I will want to predict that they intended I wanted to I estimate travels to explain 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.250
 for silver society we fans what he scored 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.930
 besides the state with a halter in German in front of his assistant 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:19.299
 in front you hit a dubious penalty also in the danilo that is 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.339
 I'll go, I will not even consider 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:23.979
 have to really see the other 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:29.069
 a goal at that moment someone here has doubt who knows football a match 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.259
 between a new decisive match for the two teams 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.219
 balanced great teams of the championship of the Brazilian championship 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.679
 someone has to take it and the one you get out in the front by the wing 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.339
 favorably 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:46.169
 someone will deny this the palm trees are disgusted 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:51.019
 your board your fans be and pointed Sergio belt 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.279
 to be missing the earthquake 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:57.879
 with is trying to schedule what today had a
