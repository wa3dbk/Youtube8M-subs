on<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.049> color<00:02:04.259> coordinates<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.490> color

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
on the color coordinates and the color

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.609 
on the color coordinates and the color
coordination<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.479> some<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> cards<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
coordination of some of the cards and

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.130 
coordination of some of the cards and
you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.950> open<00:02:08.399> them<00:02:08.580> pretty<00:02:08.910> rapidly<00:02:09.450> as<00:02:09.780> well

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you can open them pretty rapidly as well

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.199 
you can open them pretty rapidly as well
as<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.830> see<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.459> background<00:02:11.489> there

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
as you can see in the background there

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.580 
as you can see in the background there
you<00:02:12.390> get<00:02:12.569> one<00:02:12.810> gold

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
you get one gold

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.170 
you get one gold
per<00:02:14.040> pack<00:02:14.370> which<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.760> pretty<00:02:14.910> annoying

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
per pack which is pretty annoying

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.030 
per pack which is pretty annoying
considering<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.230> play<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> fee<00:02:16.709> for<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.920> lot

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
considering I do play a fee for a lot

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.550 
considering I do play a fee for a lot
and<00:02:17.129> get<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> lot<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.700> gold<00:02:18.000> players<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.569> but<00:02:19.530> I

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
and get a lot of gold players and but I

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.809 
and get a lot of gold players and but I
like<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.739> flash<00:02:20.129> where<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.550> don't<00:02:20.700> actually

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
like the flash where you don't actually

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.670 
like the flash where you don't actually
see<00:02:21.150> what's<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.510> pack<00:02:21.690> until<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.110> opens<00:02:22.470> up

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
see what's in the pack until it opens up

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.280 
see what's in the pack until it opens up
so<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:24.060> think<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.660> legend<00:02:24.989> cab<00:02:25.170> you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
so the I think the legend cab you

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.500 
so the I think the legend cab you
actually<00:02:25.590> get<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.550> one<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.940> highest<00:02:27.060> rated

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
actually get is one of the highest rated

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.470 
actually get is one of the highest rated
ones<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.200> game<00:02:28.410> as<00:02:28.620> well<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.129> with<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> 94

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
ones in the game as well and with a 94

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.820 
ones in the game as well and with a 94
it<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.930> may<00:02:31.110> have<00:02:31.230> give<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.530> away<00:02:31.620> actually

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
it that may have give it away actually

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.289 
it that may have give it away actually
the<00:02:32.040> thumbnail<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.670> title<00:02:33.000> probably

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
the thumbnail and the title probably

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.390 
the thumbnail and the title probably
give<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.569> away<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.870> which<00:02:34.019> 1i<00:02:34.260> got<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.739> and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
give it away of which 1i got and and
