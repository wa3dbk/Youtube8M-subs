and as you can see there's quite a bit
of<00:01:04.830> items<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.940> first<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
of items in here the first one is the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.000 
of items in here the first one is the
big<00:01:07.530> bold<00:01:07.890> curl<00:01:08.340> NYC<00:01:09.030> mascara<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.830> is

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
actually really excited to try

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.690 
actually really excited to try

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
those cuz I've been wanting to do that

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.330 
those cuz I've been wanting to do that
so<00:02:20.060> that's<00:02:20.690> pretty<00:02:21.020> cool<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.440> those<00:02:21.770> retail

this is more of a bar type so these

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.760
