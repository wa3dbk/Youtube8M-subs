00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.589
 traffic chaos battered roads e 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.179
 safety always a little at risk 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.010
 so mobility in big cities 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.540
 it looks really dramatic 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.670
 but then what is the right medium for 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.470
 survive this urban warfare 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.369
 a Parisian would answer without 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.580
 hesitation 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.260
 mp3 piaggio want to know why I 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.880
 I'll explain it in this because buying it 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.269
 that even on purpose it will be in 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.099
 company of the new mp3 300 how much it counts 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.199
 style is not easy to hide 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.540
 clutter and make the front beautiful 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.430
 with these two wheels perhaps the part that 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.230
 makes Italian customers more doubtful 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.850
 but if you go further 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.649
 then you can appreciate the great work 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.790
 played by the piaggio style center on 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.250
 this new mp3 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.260
 in addition to the revised front with unpublished works 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.149
 headlights to the new windshield ea 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.670
 wide use of LEDs both front and back 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.590
 they are above all the central part and the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 later to have been totally 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.940
 twisted the tail is much more 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.920
 slender and style with these two 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.170
 tapered and optic groups 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.270
 maxi gt of the piaggio group also the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.189
 saddle has been totally redesigned e 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.470
 now it is also more comfortable for the passenger 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.390
 who can count on two practical rests 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.729
 good quality feet also finishes 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.240
 as for example this padding for 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.220
 protect knees from bumps a lot 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.740
 the instrumentation is also well rewarded 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.780
 both analog and digital a lot 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.409
 complete that is always readable 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.450
 day that at night is spacious, the beautiful 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.939
 of the scooter you know is also able 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.619
 count on a lot of space and I would say that here 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.619
 on the mp3 you can't complain 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.650
 in addition to the two full-face helmets that you 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.630
 they can stow comfortably under the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.650
 saddle where space also remains for 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.540
 other items 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.729
 finally even on me p3 comes a 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.369
 practical front storage compartment that 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.350
 offers an ideal usb socket for the 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.659
 mobile or other device recharge 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.310
 and if you travel often in pairs and the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.070
 your sweetheart wants more 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.860
 sometimes the optional turquoise happens 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.250
 has a capacity of 50 readers in the city 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.250
 how are you 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.290
 a nightmare 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:18.690
 if he did not know I would say that he was there in front 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.350
 there are not two wheels but only one 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.350
 easy 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.050
 but also above all 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.270
 among the cars all features that 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.270
 there 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.210
 they are a real blast 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.130
 its 240 kg feels like iron 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.200
 while the movement is a nice journey 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.570
 protected by the broad shield and by 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.550
 windshield here on the sport of media 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.060
 ideal size for the como that the 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.220
 citizen 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.090
 if you want more protection instead there is the 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.280
 larger and optional windscreen 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.960
 at the traffic light the electrohydraulic block vi 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.970
 will make others feel superior 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.800
 motorcyclists in the sense that you will not have to 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.820
 put your feet on the ground and this is not 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.820
 bad on rainy days 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.040
 the engine compared to the older brother 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.110
 500 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.760
 let's say it's a bit of panache 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.290
 it was panda mar 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.810
 and for example planning for overtaking 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.760
 because you are already a little bit launched 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.650
 why take some 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.970
 everything to keep the boards quiet 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.310
 in the sleeve of this engine are 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.629
 balance and linear delivery e 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.450
 without tears 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.280
 the 278 cc single cylinder delivers 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.930
 in fact 22 and a half horses do not 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.579
 very much in proportion to the weight but 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.409
 sufficient to dominate traffic e 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.329
 keep consumption low 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.610
 we in the city have traveled about 16 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.430
 17 km with a liter but being more careful 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.099
 they exceed largely unpublished and 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.989
 comfortable and among the innovations introduced 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.730
 with this last generation i 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.549
 Traces environments are the wheels that they are 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.519
 go from 12 to 13 inches today and 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.810
 in the guide the difference is felt 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.700
 the suspension hydraulics are calibrated 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.409
 to withstand city stress and 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.000
 at the front the roughness of the bottom 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.250
 road are well absorbed 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.409
 especially while both employs a real 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.090
 must behind instead the trim remains 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:07.580
 rather rigid and insecure 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.950
 in a nutshell there is none for anyone 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.280
 in the city 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.090
 among the wheels like this my presence 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.090
 security volunteers 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.769
 represents a problem that everything is 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.690
 digested 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.129
 better than the electronics instead 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.470
 think of the rest in the maneuvers of 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:30.259
 emergency abs and traction control 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.330
 asr are standard on 3 percent 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.639
 species rarely enter 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.599
 bs but when they do it is because it serves to 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.760
 example with rain 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.000
 exact 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.740
 we have 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.200
 one of the most annoying conditions but 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.810
 where the qualities of the m 3 emerge 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.810
 more sin 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.970
 how much coasts and this is a bit of a key 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.980
 sore if you want the three wheels 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.800
 enter into the heart and above all into 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.690
 garage of the Italians for the piaggio mp3 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.080
 300 in sport setup 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.410
 it takes 7 thousand 620 euros 100 euros more 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.400
 for the business always with abs and asr di 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.410
 series defects I have mentioned to you that in 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.360
 video but if I really have to put it all down not 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.940
 I loved the brake pedal so much 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.190
 it is mandatory to drive the mp3 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.160
 with the license b, however, it obliges the foot to 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.640
 not very natural positions and takes up space 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.920
 on the platform 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.320
 and always speaking of brakes are 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.140
 powerful but to realize it must 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.650
 squeeze the levers a lot and the pedal in 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.510
 an exaggerated way you would recommend it 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.640
 the three wheels are so the first time there 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.020
 look a little crooked then try them and don't 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.780
 you can do without it anymore 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.400
 to me it happened with the mp3 that I think 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.290
 still be the reference of the 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.450
 category as it is worse metropolis 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.870
 and framework 350 are not yet in his 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.540
 level 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.910
 this is a highly recommended means to whom 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.530
 travels many kilometers in the city with 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.960
 any weather conditions and can 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.640
 afford this kind of security e 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.640
 truly top versatility
