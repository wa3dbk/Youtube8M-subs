00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.060
 good this nest I bring you how to open 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.050
 more than one account in the dragon online 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.940
 no need for virtual PC sometimes 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.370
 virtual because it does not have a very machine 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.860
 powerful 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.390
 and by the way this is much more comfortable not 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.400
 it takes 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.160
 It makes many problems with installing anything 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.500
 more a program can make it run 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.040
 to the dragon ball room with a computer 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.780
 average unless my computer 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.480
 the discussions so that they have an idea 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.480
 it is a notebook an a5 processor 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.640
 of 4 gigas of ram 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.040
 better enough two accounts 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.290
 in this case we are going to use sun boxing 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.760
 this program but to see two 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.800
 programs at the same time 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.170
 this program at least have given before 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.470
 they worked in a while ago but 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:14.280
 after taiwan as the girl I guess 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:18.230
 what we're going to do is download it 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.950
 in the description as you see here 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.950
 all right 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.899
 the server let's say 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.530
 once they have downloaded 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.530
 installed 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.600
 it's a game 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.450
 as you see suleman with my character 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.520
 normally at least I as a spectator 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.460
 had the game open to the session 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.460
 started many people 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.000
 in previous versions so clear 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.620
 you had to configure it 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.070
 had some options more than the one 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.070
 has this 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.530
 does not have much chance of 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.480
 configuration to buy the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.600
 cooperation of previous versions 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.080
 for that reason I usually return as it comes 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.920
 by default with the options so no 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.920
 I think they have to touch it 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.770
 once 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.530
 and right click on dragon ball 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.870
 on-line 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.180
 run isolated in a sandbox what 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.960
 let's do 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.010
 and click here 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.010
 he has also left 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.110
 the default box that is a box where 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.600
 it will open a fly in the same part 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.410
 let's say and then I do not have one that is 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.290
 a personalized thing that if you guys 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.100
 have the sandbox milestone the truth is that 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.020
 will let you use a little more the sandbox 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.580
 even with more than one account maybe 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.120
 it is also the first the period of 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.799
 proof of cause nothing more than a single account 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.950
 then what we will do is give 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:16.310
 Firefox default box 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:20.709
 to run as administrator uat maybe 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.709
 in some you do not need to do this 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.360
 but friends in my case if then what 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.350
 what you can do is try this and in 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.600
 case it does not work what this 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.890
 in my case at least there would be the dragon 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.890
 online as administrator 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.500
 once they have branded this from 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.580
 they will give you accept 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.580
 he tells me that it is not a version 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.430
 what is a version that 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.430
 but I'm waiting to release 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.020
 and good as you will see although I have 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.549
 normally first 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.650
 on April 30 with the sandbox 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.039
 unless my game runs me mother be 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.039
 normal 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.960
 that is a little 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.530
 a little bit of the face 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.530
 many people 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.169
 as in excess for that is what is 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.600
 basically do now 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.000
 to be able to open two accounts 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.380
 so as I say, they have to be 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.860
 the program 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.680
 they have to arrive in line with the line 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.990
 later with the program they open it using 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.540
 the sandbox but right click choose 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.940
 sandbox and sports box 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.310
 they give the option they have down 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.260
 and we will do so normally 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.300
 this has no time limit you do not know 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.300
 is going to make the game in so long 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.550
 so well I hope you have them 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.210
 liked the video 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.210
 his upbringing 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.210
 when when they make videos in the aic and 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.680
 anything if they want me to do some 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.680
 tutorial of something from the super dragon ball 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:34.700
 and properties either about 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.810
 characters about kinds of things that for 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.800
 there some does not look very clear 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.500
 so they can leave me in the 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.560
 comments was a good line or some 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.350
 specific program 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.060
 more in more free time I'm going to do them 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.040
 with some idea and that is of 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.889
 utility so good I send you a 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.889
 greeting and see you in the next video
