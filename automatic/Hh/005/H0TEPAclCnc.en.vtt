00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
much lower moisture content and then

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.569 
much lower moisture content and then
packed<00:01:00.149> into<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.539> bail<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> pellet<00:01:01.769> or<00:01:01.920> an

using<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.339> wet<00:01:06.119> hop<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.720> concept<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
using a wet hop the concept is that

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.400 
using a wet hop the concept is that
you're<00:01:07.800> pulling<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.399> hop<00:01:08.580> out<00:01:08.789> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.940> field

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
you're pulling the hop out of the field

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.840 
you're pulling the hop out of the field
exactly<00:01:10.410> how<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.740> picked<00:01:11.039> and<00:01:11.280> then

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
exactly how it's picked and then

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.389 
exactly how it's picked and then
packaging<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.869> somehow<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> shipped

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
packaging it somehow to get it shipped

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.219 
packaging it somehow to get it shipped
to<00:01:14.670> where<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.210> at<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.539> brew<00:01:15.690> with<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.050> within
