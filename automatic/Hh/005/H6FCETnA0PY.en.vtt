 well how to generate in geek sport in 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.000
 this paper tous is very very very easy and 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.939
 I'm going to explain everything because it's the most 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.059
 easy that I could play in amount of 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.489
 challenge challenge here let's go up 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.290
 left we leave to this we have it here 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.230
 and already here we would feel both 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.670
 interest the other can counterattack 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.620
 the yellow enemy appears with which 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.230
 the easiest thing to do is hit a 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.600
 pineapple blow gets into the strip to the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.030
 right carefully and here what 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.340
 I tried to load everything but it was 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.780
 a stick for the two sites so I picked up 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.320
 and I loaded this to get a 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.120
 punctuation 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 two enemies I put myself here to the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.170
 left begins to hit and I come by 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 I try to come running not give me you 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.210
 I hit again the other one comes running 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.570
 he eats it 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.290
 pulled forward and now comes another 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.510
 stick of this not what I do I'm going to 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.280
 I hit him again and he turns me 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.640
 to go in a part so I hit again 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.070
 750 points and another 750 other enemy more 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.870
 very easy for which I hit him I leave it 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.120
 the lashed strip I keep hitting 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.720
 and I shot to the right here I try to eat 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:37.020
 the flies this novelty is that I eat 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.630
 one and with bad luck is not new I do not 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.830
 like no fence since he tried the co 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.600
 go carefully up to the right 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.480
 this blue appears he tried to paste here 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.790
 but I can not beat myself so if I 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.070
 I go a little bit up and it hit you well 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.040
 quoted entered a blow hit 23 and there 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.540
 ready very fast hits I approach for 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.820
 forward where they have another one month 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.710
 there was something here and here something 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.560
 I swell with blows with him 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.800
 to his house he tries to move forward he threw me out 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.590
 back running and one two and three away 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.360
 perfect here come two here in this 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.130
 site they will not give us so we're going 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.480
 sticking there and then we throw them by the 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.600
 ravine is so to go as 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.850
 accumulating now another more or hit 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.800
 then a little bit below I do not think 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.290
 comes indicates good to put a goal but 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.659
 way 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.480
 and I jumped here tried to catch some 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:30.659
 flies although you really do not need 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.019
 and that's it, and little else there is trying to catch 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:37.200
 this life I do not know how to catch 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.959
 and here we have very easy step or start 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.129
 to shoot rays towards you with which you 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.569
 what you have to do is the first 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.370
 stone not I always try to catch the 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.470
 second institution to the second shot 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.090
 I'm going up, I'm picking up the stone 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.549
 because the other one if you have the same side 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.879
 he hit a blow but he has a 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.230
 stone up I take the stone from above 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.819
 I always try to play with up to 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.020
 unless it is very risky with play 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.540
 low 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.410
 and tried to hit there another blow there but 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.590
 there is a failure because it has to be 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.700
 practically in the center so I 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.990
 waited for a tap nothing failed number 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.640
 2 face for my part you take well given 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.320
 perfect and would make the last hit 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.090
 He cited as I've ever seen always to 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.320
 up and it was committed at the point I put 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.240
 top left because it keeps firing 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.760
 in the last hit and a score of 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.470
 46 thousand 750 friends of crumbs and dismissal 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.010
 here is the next video a greeting to 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.010
 all and all
