00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
Dave buddy well the following videos

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.870 
Dave buddy well the following videos
that<00:00:26.530> you're<00:00:26.680> about<00:00:26.830> to<00:00:26.980> see<00:00:27.130> if<00:00:27.190> the<00:00:27.369> air<00:00:27.670> raid

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
that you're about to see if the air raid

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.030 
that you're about to see if the air raid
siren<00:00:28.510> are<00:00:28.720> probably<00:00:29.260> going<00:00:29.410> to<00:00:29.470> be<00:00:29.590> its<00:00:29.740> last

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
siren are probably going to be its last

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.450 
siren are probably going to be its last
for<00:00:30.490> quite<00:00:31.030> some<00:00:31.330> time<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:32.500> you<00:00:32.890> can<00:00:33.010> see<00:00:33.280> we

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
for quite some time as you can see we

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.820 
for quite some time as you can see we
had<00:00:33.550> a<00:00:33.580> bit<00:00:33.790> of<00:00:33.880> a<00:00:33.940> whoopsie<00:00:34.390> with<00:00:34.570> it

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
had a bit of a whoopsie with it

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.200 
had a bit of a whoopsie with it
basically<00:00:35.830> what<00:00:36.250> happened<00:00:36.610> is<00:00:36.670> one<00:00:36.910> of<00:00:37.030> these

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
basically what happened is one of these

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.460 
basically what happened is one of these
um<00:00:38.070> le<00:00:39.270> rotor<00:00:40.270> fins<00:00:40.570> that<00:00:40.750> are<00:00:40.840> put<00:00:40.989> on<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.290> take

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
um le rotor fins that are put on to take

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.930 
um le rotor fins that are put on to take
up<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.739> clearance<00:00:42.160> between<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.640> stator

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
up the clearance between the stator

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.510 
up the clearance between the stator
housing<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.690> rotor<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:45.309> of<00:00:45.370> these

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
housing and the rotor one of these

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.330 
housing and the rotor one of these
actually<00:00:45.760> came<00:00:46.210> off<00:00:46.239> during<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.320> full<00:00:47.890> speed

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
actually came off during the full speed

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.910 
actually came off during the full speed
I<00:00:48.370> got<00:00:48.580> up<00:00:48.730> to<00:00:48.909> top<00:00:49.180> speed<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:49.780> it<00:00:50.500> sounded

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
I got up to top speed and it sounded

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.299 
I got up to top speed and it sounded
awesome<00:00:51.220> until<00:00:52.680> yeah<00:00:53.680> one<00:00:53.860> of<00:00:53.949> those<00:00:54.070> just

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
awesome until yeah one of those just

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.840 
awesome until yeah one of those just
gave<00:00:54.670> away<00:00:54.879> came<00:00:55.420> out<00:00:55.769> hit<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:56.920> state<00:00:57.699> of

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
gave away came out hit the state of

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.740 
gave away came out hit the state of
casing<00:00:58.470> bounced<00:00:59.470> off<00:00:59.650> and<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.420> kept<00:01:01.629> going

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
casing bounced off and as it kept going

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.509 
casing bounced off and as it kept going
around<00:01:01.989> it<00:01:02.260> just<00:01:02.440> chomped<00:01:02.979> the<00:01:03.040> rest<00:01:03.220> of<00:01:03.400> these

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
around it just chomped the rest of these

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.050 
around it just chomped the rest of these
fins<00:01:04.269> off<00:01:04.920> that's<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.040> only<00:01:06.340> one<00:01:06.460> that<00:01:06.520> stayed

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
fins off that's the only one that stayed

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.760 
fins off that's the only one that stayed
on<00:01:07.300> and<00:01:07.510> as<00:01:07.659> you<00:01:07.780> can<00:01:07.930> see<00:01:07.990> it's<00:01:08.350> pretty<00:01:08.500> are

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
on and as you can see it's pretty are

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.980 
on and as you can see it's pretty are
stressed<00:01:09.370> from<00:01:09.640> there<00:01:09.850> it<00:01:10.570> was<00:01:10.720> just

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
stressed from there it was just

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.750 
stressed from there it was just
centrifugal<00:01:11.470> force<00:01:12.010> that<00:01:12.100> did<00:01:12.460> that<00:01:12.580> just

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
centrifugal force that did that just

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.330 
centrifugal force that did that just
pulling<00:01:13.420> out<00:01:13.600> at<00:01:13.840> it<00:01:14.110> because<00:01:14.920> it<00:01:15.070> was<00:01:15.159> going

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
pulling out at it because it was going

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.130 
pulling out at it because it was going
about<00:01:15.490> 2,000<00:01:16.450> rpm<00:01:17.010> 2200<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:19.420> be<00:01:19.540> exact<00:01:19.930> because

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
about 2,000 rpm 2200 to be exact because

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.160 
about 2,000 rpm 2200 to be exact because
that's<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.590> speed<00:01:20.860> of<00:01:20.980> this<00:01:21.070> motor<00:01:21.580> but

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that's the speed of this motor but

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.350 
that's the speed of this motor but
here's<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.260> pre<00:01:23.560> nasty<00:01:24.250> gouge<00:01:24.640> in<00:01:24.910> there<00:01:25.090> from

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
here's a pre nasty gouge in there from

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.150 
here's a pre nasty gouge in there from
it<00:01:25.570> hitting<00:01:25.990> one<00:01:26.230> of<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.440> art<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.770> other<00:01:26.920> ones

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
it hitting one of the art the other ones

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.730 
it hitting one of the art the other ones
and<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.810> whole<00:01:28.960> thing<00:01:29.140> just<00:01:29.230> locked<00:01:29.530> up

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
and the whole thing just locked up

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.220 
and the whole thing just locked up
immediately<00:01:30.280> stopped<00:01:30.670> working<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:32.050> as<00:01:32.110> you

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
immediately stopped working and as you

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.520 
immediately stopped working and as you
can<00:01:32.320> see<00:01:32.380> is<00:01:32.710> another<00:01:32.950> one<00:01:33.190> jammed<00:01:33.730> in<00:01:33.970> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
can see is another one jammed in the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.900 
can see is another one jammed in the
stator<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.740> haven't<00:01:36.100> yet<00:01:36.160> been<00:01:36.340> able<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.700> pull

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
stator I haven't yet been able to pull

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.680 
stator I haven't yet been able to pull
that<00:01:37.060> out<00:01:37.120> but<00:01:38.760> yeah<00:01:39.760> it<00:01:40.060> was<00:01:40.180> going<00:01:40.390> really

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
that out but yeah it was going really

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.210 
that out but yeah it was going really
good<00:01:40.990> until<00:01:41.320> it<00:01:41.910> jammed<00:01:42.910> up<00:01:43.120> and<00:01:43.980> yes<00:01:44.980> I<00:01:45.160> do

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
good until it jammed up and yes I do

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.980 
good until it jammed up and yes I do
know<00:01:45.340> I<00:01:45.490> have<00:01:45.610> a<00:01:45.730> bit<00:01:45.910> of<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.000> disliking<00:01:46.600> problem

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
know I have a bit of a disliking problem

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.470 
know I have a bit of a disliking problem
with<00:01:47.230> um<00:01:47.410> some<00:01:47.770> dickhead<00:01:48.420> disliking<00:01:49.420> the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
with um some dickhead disliking the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.110 
with um some dickhead disliking the
videos<00:01:49.780> I<00:01:49.900> put<00:01:50.080> up<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:50.760> but<00:01:51.760> all<00:01:51.880> I'm<00:01:52.000> gonna

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
videos I put up this but all I'm gonna

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.570 
videos I put up this but all I'm gonna
say<00:01:52.420> is<00:01:52.450> it's<00:01:53.200> not<00:01:53.440> gonna<00:01:53.620> sound<00:01:53.980> like<00:01:54.520> a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
say is it's not gonna sound like a

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.490 
say is it's not gonna sound like a
proper<00:01:55.030> air-raid<00:01:55.390> siren<00:01:55.930> it's<00:01:56.080> just<00:01:56.320> not

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
proper air-raid siren it's just not

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.530 
proper air-raid siren it's just not
built<00:01:56.740> like<00:01:56.830> that<00:01:57.010> I<00:01:57.460> haven't<00:01:58.300> met<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
built like that I haven't met the

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.270 
built like that I haven't met the
tolerances<00:01:59.200> between<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.680> stator<00:02:00.010> and<00:02:00.220> the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
tolerances between the stator and the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.720 
tolerances between the stator and the
rotor<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:02.460> yeah

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
rotor and yeah

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.580 
rotor and yeah
basically<00:02:04.240> I<00:02:04.360> suggest<00:02:04.840> just<00:02:05.140> watch<00:02:05.290> some

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
basically I suggest just watch some

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.980 
basically I suggest just watch some
other<00:02:05.680> videos<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:06.400> other<00:02:07.090> attempts<00:02:07.600> people

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
other videos of other attempts people

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.250 
other videos of other attempts people
building<00:02:08.349> them<00:02:08.530> or<00:02:09.509> don't<00:02:10.509> even<00:02:10.660> bother<00:02:10.810> don't

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
building them or don't even bother don't

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.080 
building them or don't even bother don't
shoot<00:02:11.560> yourself<00:02:11.650> if<00:02:12.099> you<00:02:12.220> really<00:02:12.489> have<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.849> I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
really don't care about dislike errs but

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.680 
really don't care about dislike errs but

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
last of power-ups of this thing I didn't

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.040 
last of power-ups of this thing I didn't
get<00:04:51.130> on<00:04:51.280> video<00:04:51.550> but<00:04:52.060> as<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.570> can<00:04:52.630> see<00:04:52.720> it

get on video but as you can see it

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.159 
get on video but as you can see it
self-destructed<00:04:54.300> as<00:04:55.300> far<00:04:55.510> as<00:04:55.630> I<00:04:55.690> can<00:04:55.750> tell<00:04:56.050> the

self-destructed as far as I can tell the

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.590 
self-destructed as far as I can tell the
rotors<00:04:56.560> are<00:04:56.740> still<00:04:56.950> good<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.669> arm<00:04:57.850> row

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600

defense<00:04:58.960> haven't<00:04:59.290> come<00:04:59.470> off<00:04:59.650> but<00:04:59.919> basically

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
defense haven't come off but basically

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.219 
defense haven't come off but basically
what's<00:05:00.669> happened<00:05:01.030> is<00:05:01.690> one<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.110> these

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
what's happened is one of these

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.650 
what's happened is one of these
aluminium<00:05:02.470> fins<00:05:03.130> are<00:05:03.370> actually<00:05:03.789> glued<00:05:04.210> on<00:05:04.419> to

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
aluminium fins are actually glued on to

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.200 
aluminium fins are actually glued on to
the<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:05.320> rotors<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.490> take<00:05:06.700> up<00:05:06.850> some<00:05:07.060> of<00:05:07.150> the

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
the the rotors to take up some of the

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.500 
the the rotors to take up some of the
clearance<00:05:08.430> one<00:05:09.430> of<00:05:09.520> them<00:05:09.640> has<00:05:09.729> come<00:05:09.760> off<00:05:10.120> from

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
clearance one of them has come off from

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.000 
clearance one of them has come off from
the<00:05:10.919> extreme<00:05:11.919> speed<00:05:12.520> that<00:05:12.820> it<00:05:12.940> runs<00:05:13.150> up<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:14.010> as

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
the extreme speed that it runs up and as

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.680 
the extreme speed that it runs up and as
it's<00:05:15.220> gone<00:05:15.370> around<00:05:15.760> it's<00:05:15.970> just<00:05:16.210> taking<00:05:16.600> the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
it's gone around it's just taking the

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.620 
it's gone around it's just taking the
rest<00:05:16.840> of<00:05:17.080> them<00:05:17.200> off<00:05:17.580> then<00:05:18.580> see<00:05:18.880> their<00:05:19.090> car

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
rest of them off then see their car

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.110

boards<00:05:19.990> torn<00:05:20.380> a<00:05:20.910> bit<00:05:21.910> of<00:05:22.030> tape<00:05:23.640> the<00:05:24.640> good<00:05:24.880> thing

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
boards torn a bit of tape the good thing

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.659 
boards torn a bit of tape the good thing
is<00:05:25.270> is<00:05:25.450> that<00:05:25.570> the<00:05:26.350> other<00:05:26.740> rotor<00:05:26.950> looks<00:05:27.250> okay

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
is is that the other rotor looks okay

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.340 
is is that the other rotor looks okay
which<00:05:27.940> is<00:05:28.180> important<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:30.340> may<00:05:31.350> hopefully

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
which is important and may hopefully

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.610 
which is important and may hopefully
I'll<00:05:32.470> be<00:05:32.500> able<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:32.860> recover<00:05:33.460> this<00:05:33.700> but<00:05:34.620> that's

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
I'll be able to recover this but that's

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.770 
I'll be able to recover this but that's
disappointing<00:05:36.160> put<00:05:37.120> a<00:05:37.150> lot<00:05:37.300> of<00:05:37.389> work<00:05:37.570> into

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
disappointing put a lot of work into

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.750 
disappointing put a lot of work into
that<00:05:37.990> oh<00:05:38.260> well<00:05:38.950> I<00:05:39.280> definitely<00:05:40.270> got<00:05:40.539> my<00:05:40.750> reward

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
that oh well I definitely got my reward

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.270 
that oh well I definitely got my reward
annoying<00:05:42.760> the<00:05:42.940> neighbors<00:05:45.419> yeah<00:05:46.419> I<00:05:47.280> knew

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
annoying the neighbors yeah I knew

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.310 
annoying the neighbors yeah I knew
something<00:05:48.880> would<00:05:49.000> probably<00:05:49.510> fail<00:05:49.870> at<00:05:50.110> some

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
something would probably fail at some

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.010 
something would probably fail at some
point<00:05:50.590> where<00:05:51.130> you<00:05:51.400> can<00:05:51.490> see<00:05:51.729> there<00:05:51.970> one<00:05:52.750> of<00:05:52.780> us

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
point where you can see there one of us

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.500 
point where you can see there one of us
just<00:05:53.050> come<00:05:53.500> off<00:05:53.650> going<00:05:54.520> around<00:05:54.760> outside<00:05:55.000> and

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
just come off going around outside and

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.980 
just come off going around outside and
just<00:05:55.570> chomp<00:05:56.289> the<00:05:56.440> rest<00:05:56.650> of<00:05:56.860> them<00:05:57.990> can't

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
just chomp the rest of them can't

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.850 
just chomp the rest of them can't
actually<00:05:59.169> see

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.689 

thankfully<00:06:02.860> they<00:06:03.099> are<00:06:04.319> the<00:06:05.319> main<00:06:05.559> arm<00:06:05.830> PVC<00:06:06.490> row

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
thankfully they are the main arm PVC row

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.939 
thankfully they are the main arm PVC row
so<00:06:06.999> it<00:06:07.119> didn't<00:06:07.449> explode<00:06:07.990> which<00:06:08.409> is<00:06:08.619> what<00:06:08.860> I'm

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
so it didn't explode which is what I'm

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.820
