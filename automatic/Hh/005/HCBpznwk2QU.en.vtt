00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.780
 hello friends , welcome to one more video of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.450
 channel fender that she seconds 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.850
 video lpl spoiler and here behind me 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.640
 not the ford fiesta in its version 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.500
 ford fiesta sport 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.949
 This car ended up at the dealership. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.240
 it's the red one but it's showing the black 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.689
 I think Pedro was pretty cool. 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.530
 this sporty look this car he is 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.290
 mounted on the ford fiesta rs is 1.6 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.270
 manual gearbox five-speed and what 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.239
 changes it in the other gives another 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.850
 this aesthetic kit placed in it he 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.989
 won a skirt in the front left a 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.059
 little lower 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.250
 headlights with a black mask that count 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.899
 now with black equipment in. 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.539
 gives a very aggressive look that the car 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.710
 offers against the rita very aggressive 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.890
 Well, the balls are the wheels of the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 Titanium painted black on the side 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.400
 has already closed the door to discharge 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.659
 side you see that the car also 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.180
 earned a skirt that aesthetic kit of 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.369
 I leave the car and he finally let 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.630
 car looking lower and the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.939
 car is no longer the same car 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.860
 s version 's height is only to contain these 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.530
 site he is looking closer to 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.479
 ground that gives this sporty look is 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.430
 cooler than the car 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.340
 This car was made by Ford in 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.380
 partnership with kiko, which is not to blame 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.880
 I know exactly how the name says forgiveness. 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.280
 The writer's staff did not know the name of 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.140
 right as you speak but it's a company 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.200
 known here in Brazil already well 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.200
 traditional factory good equipment ne 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.799
 You look like it was cool. 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.899
 their work the airfoil is much bigger 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.210
 It has a entradinha air 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.799
 helena that looks very different from showing 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.990
 Who has another party behind me? 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:02.569
 Let me show the difference here. 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.009
 this position was nice to see that the 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:10.340
 airfoil and the site it brings are quite large and 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.620
 here in the common version is quite different from 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.030
 car is not as aggressive in the pit anymore 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.560
 comportadinha out down here Odone 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.989
 Which I think I could practice. 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.780
 could have the most would be an exit one 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.670
 chromed exhaust tip for 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.090
 also enhance the sports look 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.860
 and inside personal car has not changed 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.829
 almost nothing to get into the back seat 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.579
 because it's a stub denied by now 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.280
 then this camera having an angle 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.110
 A little closer, I was able to show 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.260
 better for you 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.560
 This car like I said it 's based on 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.269
 in 1.6 ls is currently a bit 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.940
 simpler than titanium in black 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.549
 piano panel and leather steering wheel lost 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.260
 also diplomatic function because 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.940
 the manual gearbox 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.859
 talking to a simpler finish 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.780
 than titanium but it is a very 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.349
 good is a treatment fies tool 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.769
 Good car is beautiful inside it comes 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.579
 with a multimedia sync system of the 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.500
 ford very cool partnership with microsoft 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.169
 and folks I played in the back seat on the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.049
 the back seat has not changed either 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:20.540
 he does not have head support the third 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.760
 person or three-point belt 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.470
 the bank is also not split to the bank 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.329
 simple in the party he is formed in 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.489
 third party but not being nice to 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.280
 cool visual let out again 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.090
 that the sound of the back in the car 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.090
 is 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.650
 you can trust and that banks have a 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.330
 visual nice close to having been training 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.040
 which was a height adjustment the driver 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.750
 headlights with fog lights I do not have 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.890
 more than 20 thousand automatic as having 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.390
 titanium and steering wheel height adjustment 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.610
 digital air 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.430
 This is a personal car. 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.200
 but what has to matter in him again 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.010
 cool in it is really different 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.900
 visual 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.470
 Particularly I found the visual well 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.210
 Nice, I think the car is the 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.590
 fiesta was always a beautiful car, right? 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.510
 since its launch in the fiesta is a 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.950
 beautiful car but now it really 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.590
 is with a younger look more 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.020
 aggressive and it's really cool 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.900
 good staff, this is the party at the party 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.580
 sport 1.6 manual gearbox with five gears 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.340
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.840
 for every one nice car and soon 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.000
 I'll be back with some other car some other. 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.070
 spoiler some other car novelty for 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.780
 You liked the video, did not it? 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.430
 Forget about a jewel Do not forget to

 share your social networks that is 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.190
 as the channel can grow and 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.160
 so you can bring more cars to 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.200
 you and do not forget 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.180
