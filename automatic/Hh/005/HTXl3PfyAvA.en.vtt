00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello internet, they have already 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.549
 think about where the whole thing tested 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.740
 they are out in the world outside 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.320
 are in wind and weather in the sun 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.480
 rain with ice and snow little things 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.450
 come in a klimakammer big things 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.990
 come here in the world's largest climate 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.990
 wind channel 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.779
 I am here in the control room of the plant 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 mr is understandable with me they are 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.320
 here the manager of the project in 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.600
 what kind of institution are we here 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.600
 you are here in the largest over the canal 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.860
 the world different vehicle tests the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.379
 rail vehicles that is now too 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.600
 other objects buses trucks or anything 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.250
 Commercial vehicles also affects cars and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.350
 is also increasing the number of aircraft 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.090
 if you imagine many vehicles 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.000
 that sounds big to what size 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.500
 The trains may be because 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.180
 we are the biggest profit channel that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.250
 means we are very long for one 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.020
 total to 100 meters measuring distance 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.210
 are available that works 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.979
 mostly off and so say climate 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.689
 wind tunnel you do not just do when you 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.720
 also make climate from where to where ranged 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.650
 that we generate temperatures of minus 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.729
 five and forty to plus sixty degrees next to it 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.409
 Temperatures we can every weather 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.840
 after picture that means we can rain 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.610
 sun snow and recently 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.250
 wanted to simulate and so 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.290
 cover a lot 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.670
 okay, I'm in it and what's up there 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.979
 looks like an oversized 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.630
 marshmallow male is the wind tunnel 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.579
 from behind this is a huge one 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.740
 steel structure big steel pipes and 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.630
 what is nice and soft looking fluffy 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.579
 is a thermal insulation with it 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.310
 cold or hot air is on the way 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.990
 that too remains hot or cold 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.220
 this is the connection box for 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.049
 the blower and you look at the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.740
 that he performs properly 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.799
 passes 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.159
 Both partners are technicians here 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.710
 Windkanal theme how much power struck 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.259
 because here the blower so the maximum 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.080
 What this building has in short supply 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.170
 5 megawatts is equivalent to one power 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.679
 the quote inhabitant city with 3000 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.190
 inhabitant consumes at the same time 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.479
 fascinating which 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.010
 Wind speeds get in the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.590
 channel with the power then out 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.780
 we can with the large profit channel just 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.120
 generate up to 300 km / h wind and it 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.709
 results in an air circulation of up to 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.330
 1000 cubic meters per second 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.220
 This is not about the climate here 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.600
 also in the weather but as we all know 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.720
 there is no bad weather but 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.190
 only inappropriate clothes 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.599
 here is the sun at home or 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.819
 at least she gets her energy here 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.190
 those fell hit it back there worrying 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.840
 for the electricity the lighting system 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.830
 The pay facility has downstairs inside 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.630
 Although up to 1000 watts per square meter 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.180
 What we see about this pump is not 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.989
 Insulation that's ice down here 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.049
 probably a woman 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.910
 here the snow is made here in 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.370
 everything now works together 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.600
 performance control and, of course, too 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.390
 the security technology because but 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.370
 plant is already relatively dangerous around 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.480
 to see how she is hedged look 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.519
 I put in the switchboard and me 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.720
 I have the note of mushroom gentleman wise 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.310
 are even engineer 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.810
 What is with such a system everything 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.810
 so we have here in the 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.730
 plant the pss 4000 installed which can 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.410
 perform these tasks as well 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.299
 standard tasks fulfilled here she has 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.100
 priority persons protection tasks 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.389
 means the emergency function 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.310
 monitor wind speed 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.319
 Sincerely too much wind arises and before 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.660
 all there are no persons protected that 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.739
 at 50 km / h wind is no longer in 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.450
 come to the wind tunnel 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.079
 that seems safe enough for me, I think 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.130
 I dare to enter the channel 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.480
 last slipway here 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.340
 it's bright in here you can do it 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.920
 maybe not necessarily see it though 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.210
 that's really hot and right l this 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.520
 lights 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.790
 this conclusion is coming soon 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.690
 the wind is blowing up to 120 km h 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.260
 the small wind tunnel 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.880
 let's see how much I can stand it ok 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.880
 Hear noises are to go 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.390
 how does it feel in spring breezes 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.900
 yes, already slowly 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.900
 comes the heart 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.910
 but there is more or 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.970
 the stiff breeze we have is early 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.890
 the 11th 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.890
 it is reasonably cool 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.760
 OK 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.560
 slowly 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.689
 gets uncomfortable 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.830
 he will say 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.830
 before the rain points 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.949
 today
