00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.710
 8th 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.480
 by no means with the essentials 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.540
 displays are missing such as that 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.099
 her from hollister or a core i7 very much 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.310
 I also like bright nail polish colors 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.799
 such as a bright brink of 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.260
 kiko one of my darlings a white one 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.180
 color also from fcm with liveview the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.390
 i can tinted most of you 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.819
 recommend corn prices of essence of 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.370
 this my skin series of it really 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.130
 super good gives nice color and it is 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.810
 not heavy skin so either would 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.340
 I do not use it or this one 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.380
 I have closed my heart 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.930
 also here this song while in 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.340
 strawberry sorbet and so on 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.990
 not much in aiken palette because of me 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.539
 think these are really the perfect ones 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.430
 colors feel summer what am I still there 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.500
 can recommend are panders and that 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.630
 I only use you and 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.940
 they are great too when you go to 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.340
 Example over night or sun dutt has 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.400
 and because he bells the next day 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.110
 so if you are curious then you want to be 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.490
 the really perfect for the approx 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.080
 They do this funny planter on 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.789
 head and you are also much better for 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.979
 So I can only recommend yours 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.840
 also keep much better for me for me 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.370
 like normal tourist in the summer may 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.590
 Of course not the sunglasses 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.300
 you are missing and find one best 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.430
 I'm against you 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.260
 have this remains found by h &amp; m 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.240
 I think eight euros really cost 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.160
 not so expensive and I like 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.580
 really awesome good at my place 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.500
 summer is never missing is my total 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.270
 charger may again after that 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.910
 ask for a link 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.010
 in the info box where he will be me 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.740
 same again finds that can buy 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.539
 or just any other where I think 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.340
 that really is my life saver 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.990
 for me, just because I have that 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.849
 my mobile phone is on the way all day 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.410
 just can not stand the whole if 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.389
 I somehow completely on the servers 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.070
 or so, or just with yours 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.830
 older 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.180
 on vacation drives and no charger in the 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.550
 car then it really is one too 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.590
 lifesaver and I can only do so many 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.000
 keeps super-long once charging stops 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.130
 about three times completely your cellphone 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.250
 Charge and I live too 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.810
 Can I have my xbox you like 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.820
 and it's just such a small box 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.100
 you put this in here with this 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.290
 your mobile phone will then turn it on 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.670
 you and then you can hear it music 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.620
 is really great if you then with 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.050
 friends a little bit around at all or something 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.670
 and my last essentials will be in 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.920
 summer was really great 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:13.170
 I can and can only be varied 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.170
 High spitzensports are recommended 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.340
 then a while from h &amp; m 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.740
 really great sitting super super comfortable 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.270
 are airy for the weather us the 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.890
 fit happens to be really much 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:32.230
 just so neutral and I love 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.970
 the water at essentials and now say 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.880
