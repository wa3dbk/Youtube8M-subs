white cast on me so obviously this is

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.630 
white cast on me so obviously this is
again<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.290> foundation<00:04:39.770> not<00:04:39.950> balancing<00:04:40.550> the

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
color correctly but I am going to go on

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.140 
color correctly but I am going to go on
with<00:04:43.040> a<00:04:43.130> pattern<00:04:43.580> now<00:04:43.640> and<00:04:43.820> this<00:04:43.910> is<00:04:44.030> the

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
with a pattern now and this is the

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.060

SPF<00:04:57.650> 15<00:04:58.130> now<00:04:58.730> because<00:04:59.120> it's<00:04:59.330> an<00:04:59.480> actual<00:04:59.900> powder

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320
