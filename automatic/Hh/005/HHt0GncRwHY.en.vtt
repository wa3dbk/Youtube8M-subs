00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.490
 the goal of this fifth step is 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.020
 put together 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.810
 with the center of its corresponding face 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.880
 These edges remind you that we have 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.080
 made the cross in the previous well but 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.450
 we had not noticed 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.110
 in the side colors in this case 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.110
 we have to fix 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.980
 that these edges match your 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.980
 center 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.700
 what is there to do 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.770
 to get these edges 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.660
 match and put here in blue put 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.930
 here an orange put here a green 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.550
 and it is as we already see that it is resolved 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.780
 well we have to learn a 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.070
 movement set more 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.840
 this is so 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.860
 what do we have to do we have to go 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.860
 turning this face 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:09.600
 until we match only one color 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.159
 a color now we see that nothing 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.149
 none matches 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.149
 I turn again 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.870
 I now only matches the green that's 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.650
 when we can only match 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.560
 one we look at the cube 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.450
 I faced that face and we have to 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.450
 execute the following movements 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.820
 right 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.270
 twice right 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.270
 and down 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.970
 that is the movement the only ones 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.909
 movements that we have to learn 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.899
 in this step and well let's look 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.820
 it does not coincide with us, we do it once 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.860
 plus 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.300
 it may be that we coincide doing only 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.860
 once because we have to execute it 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.860
 twice as in this case 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.790
 very well we have already finished 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.400
 and as you see 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.400
 we already agree all the edges 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.310
 very well now I'm going to put all the 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.719
 cases may come out even though all 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.819
 solve with them the same 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:44.079
 movements 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.079
 this would be a case 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.270
 it would be the simplest when we go 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.840
 turning the faces this upper face we 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.280
 match 1 we execute the algorithm one 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.280
 time and it is solved 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.490
 lets go see it 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.370
 are very intuitive movements this 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.200
 face only turns clockwise 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.230
 clockwise and by 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.950
 that's very simple 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.950
 as you see 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.510
 we have applied the movements of a 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.939
 once and it has already been resolved 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.470
 Now I'm going to show you the case when 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.470
 we have to apply twice 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.170
 how can this be 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.470
 at first glance it looks like the 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.570
 previous 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.300
 but it has a small difference that what 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.620
 we have to apply twice alone it's not 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.620
 prince of the orange as you see 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.970
 we have to execute the movements 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.709
 from here but in this case what 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.150
 we will have to execute twice 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.190
 you do not have to know if it is one or 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.810
 two simply execute it is one if not 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.810
 it resolves it executes it and again 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.390
 as you can see it has not been resolved yet passed 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.690
 nothing looking at the same face applied it 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.690
 again 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.229
 and now it has been resolved 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.669
 very well 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.369
 these movements you will learn right away 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.469
 at the moment you make them three or four 

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:51.260
 the hand is very intuitive 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:57.500
 He learns them immediately because he is climbing 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:59.600
 right lower right rise and now 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.210
 the only thing that needs to be done is twice 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.120
 right 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:08.440
 and already lower the moment you do three or 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.710
 four times the hand already learns it 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.710
 right away 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:18.390
 very well I will show you a couple of pair 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.240
 of exceptions in this step 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.930
 I will set the example very well this 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.930
 it would be one of them 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.720
 you see that we match the red 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.220
 the green does not and also tells us the 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.220
 orange match us two 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.780
 what do we do when we coincide 2 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:45.780
 these two there is a case that we match 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.130
 two together and this case that I'll put it in 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.430
 this case we match two 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.810
 separate things to do when we 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.750
 touch this case the only thing that there is 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.610
 simply do 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:02.310
 is to apply the algorithm wherever 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.370
 Wherever it does not matter if here it matches 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.820
 yes here that does not 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.550
 if I turn it over again so it does not match 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.350
 none does not matter where it applied 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.700
 algorithm that is already for me to change 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.030
 of situation simply 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:23.340
 right 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:25.500
 right rise right right low 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.590
 what do I have now 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.700
 as you see what is applied anywhere and already 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.700
 it only costs me 1 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.919
 can be 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.980
 I applied it and you two other 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:44.490
 time 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.490
 I will try to put the case this is 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.230
 as you see we match the red us 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:55.120
 coincided the green 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:56.990
 and blue and orange do not match 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.910
 these two 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:03.080
 what do we have to do when we coincide 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:05.820
 these two good ones just because what 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.500
 we run here for example 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.540
 when they did not know about these two what 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.340
 we run here in the part 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:16.170
 in the first on the left that we do not 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.170
 it matches and it's 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.860
 but I already tell you that you can execute it 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:28.759
 Wherever you want 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.759
 as we see like this and we have already resolved 

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.810
 what of the edges have no fear 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.780
 in doing these movements so many times 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:39.870
 as you want in the face that is because 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:43.160
 you are not going to undo the cube are about 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.160
 movements that only alter 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.580
 these edges are moving the van 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.229
 exchanging site 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.650
 so nothing the only thing that you have to 

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:57.370
 do is 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:08:00.990
 learn these movements and apply it 

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.990
 in the face that are the one match 

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.460
 Knowing that 

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:10.940
 you will achieve that the cube stays like this 

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:13.150
 and move on to the next step there, see you 

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.150
 Boys
