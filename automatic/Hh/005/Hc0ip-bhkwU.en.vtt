solid snake although who knows we do see

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.710 
solid snake although who knows we do see
some<00:01:01.220> modern<00:01:01.640> looking<00:01:02.000> tech<00:01:02.330> there<00:01:02.510> with

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
snake going all Sam Fisher so maybe it's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.420

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
a prequel to Metal Gear Solid 4 and

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.980 
a prequel to Metal Gear Solid 4 and
maybe<00:01:07.880> that's<00:01:08.119> just<00:01:08.240> an<00:01:08.390> older<00:01:08.600> version<00:01:08.750> of

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
maybe that's just an older version of

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.320 
maybe that's just an older version of
solid<00:01:09.320> snake<00:01:09.530> or<00:01:09.799> even<00:01:10.460> better<00:01:10.700> maybe<00:01:10.970> we<00:01:11.180> can

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
solid snake or even better maybe we can

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.929 
solid snake or even better maybe we can
play<00:01:11.509> both<00:01:11.750> as<00:01:12.020> big<00:01:12.560> boss<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:13.130> solid<00:01:13.729> snake

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
play both as big boss and solid snake

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.609 
play both as big boss and solid snake
maybe<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:14.720> game<00:01:14.900> goes<00:01:15.110> back<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.560> forth

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
maybe the game goes back and forth

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.919 
maybe the game goes back and forth
between<00:01:16.009> two<00:01:16.460> eras<00:01:16.999> but<00:01:17.390> on<00:01:17.479> this<00:01:17.630> screenshot
