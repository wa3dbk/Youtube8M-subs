00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
ok so I got the first hole tilted and

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.930 
ok so I got the first hole tilted and
it's<00:00:06.450> gonna<00:00:06.569> work<00:00:06.750> fine<00:00:07.309> but<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.460> first<00:00:08.700> one

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
it's gonna work fine but the first one

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.410 
it's gonna work fine but the first one
was<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.080> easy<00:00:10.230> one<00:00:10.730> now<00:00:11.730> I'm<00:00:11.910> gonna<00:00:12.090> have<00:00:12.300> to

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
was the easy one now I'm gonna have to

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.570 
was the easy one now I'm gonna have to
try<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.630> go<00:00:14.719> 90<00:00:15.719> degrees<00:00:16.109> put<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> hole<00:00:17.160> 90

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
try to go 90 degrees put a hole 90

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.939 
try to go 90 degrees put a hole 90
degrees<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:19.010> know<00:00:20.600> to<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.740> same

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
degrees you know to this one on the same

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.710 
degrees you know to this one on the same
spot<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.480> let's<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.840> how<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.109> goes<00:00:26.359> okay<00:00:27.359> this

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
spot so let's see how it goes okay this

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.020 
spot so let's see how it goes okay this
is<00:00:27.840> what<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.019> machined<00:00:31.579> just<00:00:32.579> drilled<00:00:32.820> two

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
is what I machined just drilled two

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.720 
is what I machined just drilled two
holes<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.540> flat<00:00:33.780> washer<00:00:34.399> one's<00:00:35.399> gonna<00:00:35.550> be

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
holes in this flat washer one's gonna be

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.910 
holes in this flat washer one's gonna be
attach<00:00:36.690> head<00:00:37.050> tilt<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> only<00:00:37.559> ones<00:00:37.680> gonna<00:00:37.739> be

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
attach head tilt the only ones gonna be

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.200 
attach head tilt the only ones gonna be
head<00:00:38.010> nod<00:00:38.190> there's<00:00:38.489> supposed<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.820> 90

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
head nod there's supposed to be 90

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
head nod there's supposed to be 90
degrees<00:00:39.480> apart<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:40.559> unfortunately<00:00:41.219> because

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
degrees apart but unfortunately because

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.930 
degrees apart but unfortunately because
of<00:00:41.670> my<00:00:41.790> machining<00:00:43.160> it<00:00:44.160> looks<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
of my machining it looks like it's a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.569 
of my machining it looks like it's a
little<00:00:45.149> little<00:00:45.870> less<00:00:46.050> than<00:00:46.230> 90<00:00:46.500> degrees<00:00:46.829> but

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
little little less than 90 degrees but

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.510 
little little less than 90 degrees but
hopefully<00:00:48.410> it<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:50.010> close<00:00:50.250> enough<00:00:50.280> for

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
hopefully it will be close enough for

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.110 
hopefully it will be close enough for
hand<00:00:50.820> shoes<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.239> horse<00:00:51.420> grenades<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.850> shoes

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
hand shoes and horse grenades and shoes

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.069 
hand shoes and horse grenades and shoes
and<00:00:54.270> horse<00:00:54.480> goodnight<00:00:56.210> I<00:00:57.210> don't<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:57.930> what

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and horse goodnight I don't know what

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.720 
and horse goodnight I don't know what
I'm<00:00:58.170> doing

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
I'm doing

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.170 
I'm doing
but<00:00:59.730> uh<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.930> now<00:01:01.289> gonna<00:01:01.649> go<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.789> here

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
but uh so this is now gonna go on here

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.440 
but uh so this is now gonna go on here
and<00:01:04.189> the<00:01:05.189> server<00:01:05.430> will<00:01:05.700> go<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> back<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and the server will go in the back and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.580 
and the server will go in the back and
linked<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> top<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:08.820> know

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
linked it at the top of here you know

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.840 
linked it at the top of here you know
here<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.100> there<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:11.820> I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
here it is it's on there but you know I

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.910 
here it is it's on there but you know I
wanted<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.420> delay<00:01:12.960> cutting<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.530> bracket

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
wanted to do delay cutting this bracket

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.859 
wanted to do delay cutting this bracket
out<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.970> look<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.780> hitting<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> washer<00:01:16.680> so

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
out but look it's hitting the washer so

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.810 
out but look it's hitting the washer so
I'm<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.049> gonna<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.409> ahead<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.130> cut<00:01:20.400> this

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
I'm just gonna go ahead and cut this

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.670 
I'm just gonna go ahead and cut this
bracket<00:01:21.299> out<00:01:22.100> like<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:25.200> know<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.530> go

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
bracket out like this you know just go

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.950 
bracket out like this you know just go
around<00:01:26.090> like<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.490> go<00:01:29.960> well

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
around like that so here we go well

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.890 
around like that so here we go well
there<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.200> cut<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.490> miraculously<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.570> still

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
there I cut it and miraculously I still

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.440 
there I cut it and miraculously I still
have<00:01:34.020> all<00:01:34.189> 10<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.369> fingers<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.240> didn't

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
have all 10 of my fingers and I didn't

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.219 
have all 10 of my fingers and I didn't
even<00:01:36.630> cut<00:01:36.810> myself<00:01:37.490> okay<00:01:38.750> craftsmanship<00:01:39.750> isn't

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
even cut myself okay craftsmanship isn't

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.460 
even cut myself okay craftsmanship isn't
that<00:01:40.320> good<00:01:40.909> but<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.939> sanded<00:01:42.509> down<00:01:42.570> there's<00:01:43.320> no

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
that good but I sanded down there's no

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.960 
that good but I sanded down there's no
sharp<00:01:43.710> edges<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:46.700> hopefully<00:01:47.700> no<00:01:47.850> one

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
sharp edges on it so hopefully no one

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.289 
sharp edges on it so hopefully no one
will<00:01:48.000> inspect<00:01:48.509> my<00:01:48.720> work<00:01:48.960> too<00:01:49.200> closely<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.340> as

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
will inspect my work too closely and as

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.300 
will inspect my work too closely and as
you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:52.579> hopefully<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:55.350> didn't

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
you can see here hopefully I didn't

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.670 
you can see here hopefully I didn't
damage<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:57.600> integrity<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.560> holes<00:02:00.350> by<00:02:01.350> you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
damage the integrity of the holes by you

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.649 
damage the integrity of the holes by you
know<00:02:01.799> keep<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.610> taking<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.000> bracket<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
know keep on taking this bracket on and

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.880 
know keep on taking this bracket on and
off<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.110> off<00:02:04.200> hopefully<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
off on and off hopefully this is the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.039 
off on and off hopefully this is the
last<00:02:05.130> time<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.610> had<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.360> take<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> bracket<00:02:06.930> off

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
last time I had to take the bracket off

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.749 
last time I had to take the bracket off
okay<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.740> haven't<00:02:07.979> put<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.489> all<00:02:08.580> back

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
okay so I haven't put it all back

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.410 
okay so I haven't put it all back
together<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.239> look<00:02:09.599> I

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.660 

totally<00:02:13.420> free<00:02:13.780> movement<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:15.250> not<00:02:15.310> hitting

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
totally free movement it's not hitting

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.089 
totally free movement it's not hitting
anything<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:18.400> then<00:02:19.090> this<00:02:19.329> thing<00:02:19.569> right<00:02:19.810> here

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
anything and then this thing right here

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.750 
anything and then this thing right here
spins<00:02:23.159> so<00:02:24.159> now<00:02:24.430> I'm<00:02:25.180> gonna<00:02:25.510> have<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:26.760> figure

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
spins so now I'm gonna have to figure

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.740 
spins so now I'm gonna have to figure
out<00:02:28.000> how<00:02:28.659> to<00:02:28.690> mount<00:02:29.049> a<00:02:29.709> servo<00:02:32.040> here<00:02:33.040> oh<00:02:33.629> sorry<00:02:34.629> I

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
out how to mount a servo here oh sorry I

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.000 
out how to mount a servo here oh sorry I
wasn't<00:02:34.930> looking<00:02:35.079> through<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.440> viewfinder

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
wasn't looking through the viewfinder

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.420 
wasn't looking through the viewfinder
now<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.579> servo<00:02:37.030> here<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.680> link<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.099> attached

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
now the servo here so link is attached

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.429 
now the servo here so link is attached
from<00:02:39.579> there<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.120> ball<00:02:40.359> joint<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.079> I<00:02:41.290> had

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
from there to that ball joint and I had

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.130 
from there to that ball joint and I had
to<00:02:41.620> make<00:02:42.519> this<00:02:42.700> as<00:02:42.909> I<00:02:43.150> had<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.599> make<00:02:43.750> sure<00:02:43.900> that

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
to make this as I had to make sure that

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.949 
to make this as I had to make sure that
this<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.859> took<00:02:45.549> totally<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.540> line<00:02:46.720> with<00:02:46.870> the

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
this is took totally in line with the

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.830 
this is took totally in line with the
threads<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.709> way<00:02:47.859> when<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.790> good<00:02:48.970> when<00:02:49.750> it

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
threads so that way when it good when it

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.589 
threads so that way when it good when it
goes<00:02:49.989> up<00:02:50.139> and<00:02:50.349> down<00:02:50.639> head<00:02:51.639> nod<00:02:51.879> it<00:02:52.420> goes

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
goes up and down head nod it goes

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.259 
goes up and down head nod it goes
straight<00:02:52.780> up<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.739> down<00:02:53.829> it<00:02:54.099> doesn't<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:55.120> know

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
straight up and down it doesn't you know

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.589 
straight up and down it doesn't you know
if<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.470> linkage<00:02:56.859> is<00:02:57.069> not<00:02:57.400> straight<00:02:58.359> with<00:02:58.389> the

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
if the linkage is not straight with the

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.080 
if the linkage is not straight with the
pivot<00:02:58.900> point<00:02:59.079> it's<00:02:59.920> gonna<00:03:00.099> go<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.609> head<00:03:00.909> nod

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
pivot point it's gonna go a head nod

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.569 
pivot point it's gonna go a head nod
will<00:03:01.329> go<00:03:01.480> like<00:03:01.659> this<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.260> that's<00:03:02.500> why<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:03.040> want

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
will go like this and that's why I want

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.030 
will go like this and that's why I want
to<00:03:03.670> mount<00:03:03.849> these<00:03:04.000> like<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:04.480> on<00:03:05.040> other

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
to mount these like this on other

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.740 
to mount these like this on other
designs<00:03:06.549> they<00:03:06.790> mount<00:03:07.030> them<00:03:07.180> like<00:03:07.329> this<00:03:07.510> they

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
designs they mount them like this they

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.910 
designs they mount them like this they
cut<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.049> hole<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.349> here<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.680> mount<00:03:08.769> them

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
cut a hole in here and mount them

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.349 
cut a hole in here and mount them
through<00:03:09.370> here<00:03:09.579> like<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:13.209> that

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
through here like this and and that

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.140 
through here like this and and that
makes<00:03:13.659> it<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.220> when<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.340> does<00:03:15.609> the<00:03:15.760> head<00:03:15.940> nod<00:03:16.120> I

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
makes it so when it does the head nod I

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.750 
makes it so when it does the head nod I
started<00:03:16.540> going<00:03:16.810> perfectly<00:03:17.340> perfectly<00:03:18.340> you

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
started going perfectly perfectly you

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.650 
started going perfectly perfectly you
know<00:03:18.879> up<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.480> down<00:03:19.569> it<00:03:19.959> kind<00:03:20.109> of<00:03:20.230> always<00:03:20.769> tilts

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
know up and down it kind of always tilts

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.229 
know up and down it kind of always tilts
so<00:03:23.040> that's<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.190> next<00:03:24.370> part<00:03:26.579> okay<00:03:27.579> so<00:03:27.639> I<00:03:27.940> have

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
so that's the next part okay so I have

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.930 
so that's the next part okay so I have
the<00:03:28.569> ball<00:03:28.750> joint<00:03:29.079> on<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.859> rod<00:03:30.040> there<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.790> one

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
the ball joint on the rod there and one

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.360 
the ball joint on the rod there and one
thing<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.150> noticed<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.769> when<00:03:32.769> it's<00:03:32.949> gonna<00:03:33.040> push

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
thing I noticed is when it's gonna push

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.039 
thing I noticed is when it's gonna push
it<00:03:34.109> you<00:03:35.109> see<00:03:35.319> how<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.699> can<00:03:36.699> push<00:03:36.910> like<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.180> but

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
it you see how it can push like that but

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.140 
it you see how it can push like that but
I<00:03:38.079> think<00:03:38.470> once<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:38.859> have<00:03:39.069> the<00:03:39.250> other<00:03:39.400> servo<00:03:39.849> tied

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
I think once I have the other servo tied

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.500 
I think once I have the other servo tied
here<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:42.190> thing<00:03:42.220> will<00:03:42.730> actually<00:03:42.760> spin

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
here and this thing will actually spin

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.439 
here and this thing will actually spin
this<00:03:44.349> thing<00:03:44.650> will<00:03:44.859> spinning<00:03:45.449> correlation

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
this thing will spinning correlation

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:47.580 
this thing will spinning correlation
with<00:03:46.569> this<00:03:46.660> thing<00:03:46.900> we<00:03:47.230> won't<00:03:47.410> have<00:03:47.530> that

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
with this thing we won't have that

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.050 
with this thing we won't have that
problem<00:03:47.739> now

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
problem now

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.030 
problem now
I<00:03:50.040> had<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.190> modify<00:03:51.639> this<00:03:52.150> ball<00:03:52.389> joint<00:03:52.599> end<00:03:53.040> it

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
I had to modify this ball joint end it

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.300 
I had to modify this ball joint end it
wasn't<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.609> diameter<00:03:55.150> was<00:03:55.629> word<00:03:55.930> 256<00:03:56.799> rod<00:03:57.040> in

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
wasn't the diameter was word 256 rod in

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.629 
wasn't the diameter was word 256 rod in
these<00:03:57.549> screws<00:03:58.389> that<00:03:58.599> came<00:03:58.750> with<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:58.959> servo<00:03:59.639> were

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
these screws that came with a servo were

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.119 
these screws that came with a servo were
not<00:04:00.909> a<00:04:00.940> or<00:04:01.930> bigger<00:04:02.169> so<00:04:02.470> I<00:04:02.500> actually<00:04:02.769> had<00:04:03.099> to

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
not a or bigger so I actually had to

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.289 
not a or bigger so I actually had to
take<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.400> drill<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:04.109> popped<00:04:05.109> the<00:04:05.230> ball<00:04:05.379> out<00:04:06.299> held

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
take a drill I popped the ball out held

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.199 
take a drill I popped the ball out held
it<00:04:07.449> with<00:04:07.829> pliers<00:04:08.829> took<00:04:09.370> a<00:04:09.430> drill<00:04:09.699> drilled<00:04:10.090> out

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
it with pliers took a drill drilled out

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.390 
it with pliers took a drill drilled out
that<00:04:10.389> ball<00:04:10.599> no<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.169> ball<00:04:11.319> is<00:04:11.440> kind<00:04:11.650> of<00:04:11.739> rough<00:04:12.099> I

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
that ball no the ball is kind of rough I

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.879 
that ball no the ball is kind of rough I
should<00:04:13.239> Sam<00:04:13.780> favor<00:04:14.019> it<00:04:14.139> down<00:04:14.319> and<00:04:14.530> won't<00:04:14.680> turn

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
should Sam favor it down and won't turn

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:20.159 
should Sam favor it down and won't turn
that<00:04:15.129> well<00:04:15.519> but<00:04:16.150> uh<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:18.220> know<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.699> had<00:04:19.120> to<00:04:19.299> kind

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
that well but uh you know I had to kind

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.120 
that well but uh you know I had to kind
of<00:04:20.260> rig<00:04:20.469> that<00:04:21.330> linkage<00:04:22.330> up<00:04:22.510> so<00:04:23.500> now<00:04:23.710> I've<00:04:23.950> got

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
of rig that linkage up so now I've got

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.400 
of rig that linkage up so now I've got
to<00:04:24.250> go<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.669> mount

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
to go and mount

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.220 
to go and mount
this<00:04:25.590> server<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.400> back<00:04:26.610> here<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:28.020> got

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
this server to the back here and I got

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.020 
this server to the back here and I got
to<00:04:28.260> mount<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.800> so<00:04:28.980> that<00:04:29.340> this<00:04:30.980> Rawdon<00:04:31.980> is<00:04:32.280> in

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
to mount it so that this Rawdon is in

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.250 
to mount it so that this Rawdon is in
line<00:04:33.480> with<00:04:34.140> this<00:04:34.350> threaded<00:04:35.040> rod<00:04:36.020> okay<00:04:37.020> so<00:04:37.080> I

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
line with this threaded rod okay so I

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.220 
line with this threaded rod okay so I
took<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.650> plate<00:04:37.860> off<00:04:38.100> again<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:39.630> know<00:04:39.780> for

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
took the plate off again and I know for

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.220 
took the plate off again and I know for
a<00:04:40.260> fact<00:04:41.030> this<00:04:42.030> is<00:04:42.150> where<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.480> threaded<00:04:42.810> rod<00:04:42.840> is

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
a fact this is where the threaded rod is

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.010 
a fact this is where the threaded rod is
you<00:04:44.040> know<00:04:44.190> goes<00:04:44.430> through<00:04:44.670> here<00:04:44.880> so<00:04:45.090> it's<00:04:45.840> in

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
you know goes through here so it's in

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.230 
you know goes through here so it's in
line<00:04:46.050> with<00:04:46.260> these<00:04:46.620> holes<00:04:46.860> right<00:04:47.070> here<00:04:47.160> so<00:04:47.970> I'm

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
line with these holes right here so I'm

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.720 
line with these holes right here so I'm
gonna<00:04:48.570> had<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:48.870> mount<00:04:49.020> this<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:50.520> this

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
gonna had to mount this so that this

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.440 
gonna had to mount this so that this
linkage<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:53.720> in<00:04:54.720> line<00:04:54.960> like<00:04:55.260> that<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:56.450> that

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
linkage is in line like that and that

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.840 
linkage is in line like that and that
this<00:04:58.140> service<00:04:58.470> squared<00:04:58.980> at<00:05:00.380> Cerberus<00:05:01.380> City<00:05:01.850> it

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
this service squared at Cerberus City it

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.850 
this service squared at Cerberus City it
was<00:05:02.940> a<00:05:03.000> dollar<00:05:03.270> for<00:05:03.750> each<00:05:03.780> of<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.230> for<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.620> pair

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
was a dollar for each of the for a pair

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.610 
was a dollar for each of the for a pair
of<00:05:04.890> these<00:05:05.150> and<00:05:06.150> I'm<00:05:06.270> gonna<00:05:06.420> screw<00:05:07.020> these<00:05:07.170> into

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
of these and I'm gonna screw these into

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.030 
of these and I'm gonna screw these into
here<00:05:08.010> and<00:05:08.190> then<00:05:08.280> screw<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:08.790> serve<00:05:08.970> over<00:05:09.180> there

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
here and then screw the serve over there

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.770 
here and then screw the serve over there
so<00:05:11.040> here<00:05:11.220> we<00:05:11.280> go<00:05:12.140> well<00:05:13.140> I<00:05:14.360> kind<00:05:15.360> of<00:05:15.390> messed<00:05:15.570> up

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
so here we go well I kind of messed up

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.090 
so here we go well I kind of messed up
as<00:05:15.960> you<00:05:16.050> can<00:05:16.140> see<00:05:16.200> this<00:05:16.470> is<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.650> little<00:05:16.920> crooked

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
as you can see this is a little crooked

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.800 
as you can see this is a little crooked
but<00:05:17.340> I<00:05:17.550> don't<00:05:17.850> think<00:05:17.970> it's<00:05:18.150> gonna<00:05:18.240> affect<00:05:18.330> it

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
but I don't think it's gonna affect it

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.280 
but I don't think it's gonna affect it
at<00:05:19.800> all<00:05:19.950> it's<00:05:20.280> pretty<00:05:20.550> close<00:05:21.420> so<00:05:21.750> let's<00:05:21.990> all

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
at all it's pretty close so let's all

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.260 
at all it's pretty close so let's all
put<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:22.590> together<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:23.160> see<00:05:23.370> how<00:05:23.400> it<00:05:23.790> looks<00:05:23.850> oh

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
put it together and see how it looks oh

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.340 
put it together and see how it looks oh
yeah<00:05:24.450> these<00:05:24.720> things<00:05:25.020> they<00:05:25.830> were<00:05:27.230> dollar<00:05:28.230> a

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
yeah these things they were dollar a

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.010 
yeah these things they were dollar a
pair<00:05:28.650> at<00:05:28.860> service<00:05:29.220> city<00:05:29.460> and<00:05:29.910> I<00:05:30.480> just<00:05:30.510> put<00:05:30.870> one

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
pair at service city and I just put one

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.220 
pair at service city and I just put one
screw<00:05:31.320> on<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.620> top<00:05:31.830> of<00:05:32.040> each<00:05:32.100> one<00:05:32.160> and<00:05:33.230> then

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
screw on the top of each one and then

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.160 
screw on the top of each one and then
screw<00:05:34.410> on<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.590> side<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:35.040> it's<00:05:35.190> pretty<00:05:35.370> solid

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
screw on the side and it's pretty solid

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.660 
screw on the side and it's pretty solid
okay<00:05:37.170> so<00:05:37.230> far<00:05:37.590> so<00:05:37.620> good<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:38.130> only<00:05:38.190> thing<00:05:38.460> is

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
okay so far so good the only thing is

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.090 
okay so far so good the only thing is
when<00:05:39.600> it's<00:05:39.750> like<00:05:39.930> this<00:05:40.170> it<00:05:40.410> binds<00:05:40.650> up<00:05:40.919> when<00:05:41.070> I

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
when it's like this it binds up when I

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.470 
when it's like this it binds up when I
try<00:05:41.280> to<00:05:41.340> push<00:05:41.580> it<00:05:41.700> down<00:05:43.760> so<00:05:44.760> what<00:05:44.940> I<00:05:44.970> need<00:05:45.090> to<00:05:45.240> do

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
try to push it down so what I need to do

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.550 
try to push it down so what I need to do
is<00:05:45.780> take<00:05:46.590> this<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.160> move<00:05:47.460> it<00:05:48.020> this<00:05:49.020> one<00:05:49.320> notch

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
is take this and move it this one notch

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.500 
is take this and move it this one notch
this<00:05:49.890> way<00:05:50.100> and<00:05:50.430> shouldn't<00:05:51.150> bind<00:05:51.330> up<00:05:53.419> okay<00:05:54.419> I've

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
this way and shouldn't bind up okay I've

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.550 
this way and shouldn't bind up okay I've
been<00:05:54.570> nestled<00:05:54.930> in<00:05:54.990> the<00:05:55.050> tenon<00:05:55.260> I<00:05:55.290> still

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
been nestled in the tenon I still

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.890 
been nestled in the tenon I still
haven't<00:05:55.800> gotten<00:05:55.950> it<00:05:56.160> but<00:05:56.730> when<00:05:56.880> I<00:05:56.910> figured<00:05:57.300> the

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
haven't gotten it but when I figured the

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.600 
haven't gotten it but when I figured the
secret<00:05:58.290> is<00:05:58.440> when<00:05:58.919> this<00:05:59.100> is<00:05:59.250> all<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.490> way<00:05:59.580> up

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
secret is when this is all the way up

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.880 
secret is when this is all the way up
you<00:06:00.000> see<00:06:00.150> this<00:06:00.270> is<00:06:00.419> bottomed<00:06:00.600> out<00:06:00.810> here<00:06:01.080> this

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
you see this is bottomed out here this

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.390 
you see this is bottomed out here this
arm<00:06:02.580> should<00:06:03.330> be<00:06:03.560> down<00:06:04.560> a<00:06:04.590> little<00:06:04.919> more<00:06:05.190> when

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
arm should be down a little more when

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.700 
arm should be down a little more when
this<00:06:05.550> is<00:06:05.669> bottomed<00:06:05.970> out<00:06:06.120> that<00:06:06.840> way<00:06:07.080> it<00:06:07.590> won't

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
this is bottomed out that way it won't

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.580 
this is bottomed out that way it won't
bind<00:06:08.010> up<00:06:08.630> it's<00:06:09.630> a<00:06:09.690> down<00:06:09.870> there<00:06:10.110> a<00:06:10.140> little<00:06:10.320> more

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
bind up it's a down there a little more

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.120 
bind up it's a down there a little more
should<00:06:11.000> easily<00:06:12.000> go<00:06:12.419> this<00:06:13.140> way<00:06:13.320> okay<00:06:13.680> so<00:06:13.770> I<00:06:13.919> have

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
should easily go this way okay so I have

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.890 
should easily go this way okay so I have
it<00:06:14.220> hooked<00:06:14.340> up<00:06:14.520> to<00:06:14.580> the<00:06:14.790> Arduino<00:06:15.360> with<00:06:15.660> this

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
it hooked up to the Arduino with this

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:29.530 
it hooked up to the Arduino with this
potentiometer<00:06:16.530> to<00:06:17.010> control<00:06:17.340> the<00:06:17.430> position

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.540 

it's<00:06:30.260> making<00:06:30.530> a<00:06:30.620> noise<00:06:30.770> like<00:06:31.100> it's<00:06:31.310> struggling

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
it's making a noise like it's struggling

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.060 
it's making a noise like it's struggling
to<00:06:31.790> get<00:06:31.880> somewhere

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:46.490 

what<00:06:38.880> uh<00:06:43.280> I'm<00:06:44.280> gonna<00:06:45.200> even<00:06:46.200> though<00:06:46.290> it's<00:06:46.440> a

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
what uh I'm gonna even though it's a

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.980 
what uh I'm gonna even though it's a
little<00:06:46.650> jerky<00:06:47.160> and<00:06:47.340> stuff<00:06:47.630> and<00:06:48.630> I<00:06:48.690> haven't

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
little jerky and stuff and I haven't

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.200 
little jerky and stuff and I haven't
broken<00:06:49.200> anything<00:06:49.620> yet<00:06:49.980> and<00:06:50.220> it's<00:06:50.580> moving<00:06:50.940> kind

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
broken anything yet and it's moving kind

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.590 
broken anything yet and it's moving kind
of<00:06:51.300> weird<00:06:51.480> I<00:06:51.750> want<00:06:52.290> to<00:06:52.350> continue<00:06:52.620> on

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
of weird I want to continue on

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.760 
of weird I want to continue on
you<00:06:54.600> see<00:06:54.750> it's<00:06:54.900> making<00:06:55.140> a<00:06:55.200> sound<00:06:55.380> I<00:06:55.530> hope<00:06:55.680> I

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
you see it's making a sound I hope I

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:11.490 
you see it's making a sound I hope I
don't<00:06:55.970> burn<00:06:56.970> the<00:06:57.210> server<00:06:57.570> well

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:20.800 

she's<00:07:12.500> a<00:07:12.530> little<00:07:12.830> sloppy<00:07:19.300> you<00:07:20.300> see<00:07:20.510> there<00:07:20.690> it's

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810 
she's a little sloppy you see there it's

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.170 
she's a little sloppy you see there it's
not<00:07:20.930> making<00:07:21.110> any<00:07:21.260> sound<00:07:22.750> what<00:07:23.750> is<00:07:23.840> I<00:07:24.970> just<00:07:25.970> hope

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:26.180 
not making any sound what is I just hope

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.870 
not making any sound what is I just hope
I<00:07:26.330> don't<00:07:26.390> break<00:07:26.630> anything<00:07:26.960> but<00:07:27.470> I'm<00:07:28.340> gonna<00:07:28.550> go

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 
I don't break anything but I'm gonna go

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.930 
I don't break anything but I'm gonna go
and<00:07:29.150> continue<00:07:29.720> on<00:07:29.930> and<00:07:30.650> hopefully<00:07:31.640> when<00:07:31.820> I<00:07:31.850> get

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:31.940 
and continue on and hopefully when I get

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.320 
and continue on and hopefully when I get
the<00:07:32.120> head<00:07:32.300> tilt<00:07:32.570> in<00:07:32.750> this<00:07:33.940> head<00:07:34.940> tilt<00:07:35.180> in

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330 
the head tilt in this head tilt in

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.600 
the head tilt in this head tilt in
should<00:07:35.570> tie<00:07:35.750> this<00:07:36.010> washer<00:07:37.010> to<00:07:37.190> this<00:07:37.370> so

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:37.610 
should tie this washer to this so

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.670 
should tie this washer to this so
there's<00:07:37.790> no<00:07:37.970> more<00:07:38.210> movement<00:07:38.480> and<00:07:38.810> hopefully

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 
there's no more movement and hopefully

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.750 
there's no more movement and hopefully
you'll<00:07:39.800> make<00:07:39.980> everything<00:07:40.220> a<00:07:40.430> little<00:07:40.520> more

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:40.760 
you'll make everything a little more

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:47.800 
you'll make everything a little more
stable<00:07:42.580> but<00:07:44.170> that's<00:07:45.170> what<00:07:45.320> I<00:07:45.350> have<00:07:45.560> so<00:07:45.770> far
