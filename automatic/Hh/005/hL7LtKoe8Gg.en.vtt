00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 an individual is already a system so a 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.480
 couple of people a family x 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.000
 people 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.639
 they are systems with different 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.190
 number of intervention poles 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.789
 interactivity an element to who will 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.039
 send an item b it's l mans b va 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.689
 refer to element c and so on 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.210
 that is, it's actually a 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.070
 an organization of several elements 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.320
 who go one after the other 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.910
 be challenged interveners so in 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.949
 the whole a couple n families 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.190
 belong to other systems such 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.530
 that the professional system for example 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 family friendly school also family 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.670
 of origin, for example from parents or 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 two members of a couple 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.170
 obviously the social finally brief all 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.600
 the interventions of the eu knowing 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.399
 in a society are other systems 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.219
 in which each element of a 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.930
 existing system couple family is going to be 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.239
 also to a place and have a role in 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.180
 another system in a family that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.700
 represents a system where there are two 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.780
 children we can have 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.610
 obviously several manifestations that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.070
 are going to be our average that I like 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.080
 well that is for example the place of 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.540
 each one that is to say that when I speak 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.380
 of place it's finally everyone at his 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.119
 place is not a place for everyone 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.180
 that is, children parents 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.740
 have role functions and that is that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.810
 it's going to present you for each a place 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.280
 one of the important places of the parents 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.400
 for example it is the affect ie 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.440
 only two 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.720
 two helps be in giving 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.840
 affect their children to bring them 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.470
 simply is an example that me 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.560
 which I like very much is a mother who 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.500
 is going to have his child in his arms and who 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.050
 will tell him I love you by watching no 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.010
 not the child but the television on 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.330
 on the right 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.890
 you do not know what they give 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.370
 actually a double message to 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.930
 the child who is on one side the sea 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.170
 medical even other beauties she me 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.090
 shows that she does not love me and there we 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.950
 is really in a in a case 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.190
 specificity of what can cause a 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.530
 difficulty in a systemic relationship 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.690
 ie in the system what do we say 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.220
 and what is passed as another message 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.580
 at the same time and that Cretan this moment 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.200
 there in the child of the rest ie 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.510
 I am loved at the same time shows that 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.820
 that I 'm not loved so is that 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.400
 I am but here it can be a 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.690
 typical case of 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.980
 problematic in the tooth in a 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.980
 system where in a historic meeting
