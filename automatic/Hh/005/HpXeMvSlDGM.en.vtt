 welcome to my channel once 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.670

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.920
 dress for Christmas with pants the 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.020
 perfect idea if you do not feel like carrying 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.090
 skirt or dress and I'm going to give you this 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.710
 makeup option that is 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.379
 extremely easy to do but that 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.809
 is very very resultona if you want to see the 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.730
 three Bethlehem outfit options 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.710
 I will leave in the description box 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.449
 and if you can not see them at the end of 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.210
 video and now let's start with this 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:51.860
 Makeup so face for Christmas we are going to 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.750
 start preparing the mobile eyelid 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.460
 I'm going to opt for a shadow in cream but 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.019
 you can choose a prebase of 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.239
 shadows if I had the eyelids more 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.400
 fatty we will start by applying a 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.199
 matte brown shadow to define 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.449
 slightly the eye socket the banana 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.549
 I'm going to do it by applying it with a brush 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.950
 of blurring and blurring the 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.720
 shadow in this area and blurring the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.650
 upper cut 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.650
 all right 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.030
 Today I am going to share a very technical 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.430
 facilitates to be able to create an eyeliner 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.280
 perfect and without it being too much work 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.200
 and we go crazy with this step 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 I'm going to catch a black matte shadow I'm going to 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.400
 start applying it for the whole line 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.050
 top of tabs to taps and to 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.240
 create my corner what I'm going to do is 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.340
 follow the lower line of tabs and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.160
 create our line there we are going to create 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.350
 simply a first diagonal line and 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.270
 that line we are going to join the rest of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.340
 the upper line of lashes and we're going to 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.770
 blur the well this is what is going to 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.869
 do that we can create and we can play 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.869
 with our eyeliner we can modify it 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.640
 we can extend we can enlarge it 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.860
 until we get the two genes 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.500
 look alike and to give a 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.119
 definition much more polished what I'm going to 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.880
 to do is to take an eyeliner in this case 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.920
 brush base and I'm going to apply it right 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.200
 at the base of the eyelashes in the area 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.880
 more glued to the lash line and 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.620
 let's apply it then we're going to 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.630
 seal everything with the same black shadow 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.150
 so that it does not shine so that it is more 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.350
 mate and concentrate and that of everything more 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.020
 integrated and we already have an island 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.600
 perfect very easy to do that because 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.400
 we can blur the main step the 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.800
 first what will we do is that it is 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.800
 very easy to be able to create the two equal 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.860
 i 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.860
 i 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.450
 Y 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.010
 let's drill the special points 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.080
 to do much more Christmas I'm going to 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.300
 catch a pigment glue I'll 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.000
 apply it a little bit right in the center 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.500
 of the anise our eyeliner on top of 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.300
 eyeliner and also in the area of 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.490
 lacrimal leading a little towards the 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.530
 center of lower flange of eyelashes and 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.810
 I'm going to apply a golden pigment 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.340
 to touch the pigment in the area 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.030
 superior what it is going to do to us is to give a 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.190
 much more luminosity effect in this 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.480
 and concentration area and the area 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.000
 lacrimal what you are going to do is open 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.410
 the look faded slightly and now 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.410
 it's as easy as that 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.470
 we continue with the intensity steps that 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.810
 tweaking our eyebrows to create a 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.700
 more polished effect let's curl our 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.590
 tabs and this time to continue 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.120
 with easy makeup what I'm going to 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.950
 do is going to be applying several layers of 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.290
 mask but if you wanted you could 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.910
 apply a set of false eyelashes but 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.980
 good as we are doing something very 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.370
 easy let's just opt ​​for 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.370
 mask 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.330
 i 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.760
 It is a good option to apply a little bit of 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.410
 lip balm on our lips 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.640
 while we finished making up for 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.980
 that when we get to make up the 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.080
 lips are fine with juices and cough I'll 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.180
 use a concealer to correct 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.430
 imperfections my dark circles and also for 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.500
 polish the bottom of the makeup 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.660
 of eyes let's move on to apply our 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.130
 makeup base you know that the base 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.139
 of makeup have to be chosen from 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.150
 your real skin tone and apply during 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.830
 several minutes to get a 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.389
 Total integration do not forget about 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.010
 apply a bit in the line of the 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.620
 jaw and lower it to the neck 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.120
 Give a few touches to the ears and as not 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.120
 the line of hair growth 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.300
 we sealed all the makeup I go to 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.800
 use loose translucent powders 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.570
 but that you can adapt it to those that more 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.090
 need the ones that you like best and 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.740
 we give a light outline below the 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.270
 cheekbones on the temple and in the line of the 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.430
 jaw but once again you can 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.260
 adapt this to what suits you best 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.540
 your face and I will give a few touches of 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.460
 illuminator cream very light on 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.470
 of the cheekbones to give again this 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.910
 more festive effect to makeup and to 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.380

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.230
