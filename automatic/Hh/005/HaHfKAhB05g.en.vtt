00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
and it's not good Elaine's very

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.230 
and it's not good Elaine's very
charismatic<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:44.650> I<00:05:45.460> think<00:05:45.730> that's<00:05:45.910> the<00:05:46.000> big

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
charismatic and I think that's the big

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.760 
charismatic and I think that's the big
draw<00:05:46.480> for<00:05:46.720> her<00:05:46.960> and<00:05:47.140> I<00:05:47.200> think<00:05:47.410> that's<00:05:47.560> probably

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
draw for her and I think that's probably

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.790 
draw for her and I think that's probably
why<00:05:48.220> she's<00:05:48.580> had<00:05:48.850> so<00:05:49.150> much<00:05:49.330> success<00:05:49.600> is<00:05:50.230> because

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
why she's had so much success is because

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.830 
why she's had so much success is because
people<00:05:51.460> feel<00:05:51.610> like<00:05:51.670> they<00:05:51.970> can<00:05:52.150> relate<00:05:52.420> to<00:05:52.450> her

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
people feel like they can relate to her

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.560 
people feel like they can relate to her
and<00:05:53.230> she's<00:05:53.710> just<00:05:53.770> fun<00:05:54.310> to<00:05:54.610> be<00:05:54.640> around<00:05:54.910> she<00:05:55.360> puts

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
and she's just fun to be around she puts

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.020 
and she's just fun to be around she puts
off<00:05:55.720> a<00:05:55.750> good<00:05:56.050> energy<00:05:56.560> even<00:05:57.340> if<00:05:57.490> things<00:05:57.790> are

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
off a good energy even if things are

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.610 
off a good energy even if things are
chaotic<00:06:00.510> it's<00:06:01.510> our<00:06:01.630> tents<00:06:01.840> for<00:06:02.080> her<00:06:02.200> I<00:06:02.350> can't
