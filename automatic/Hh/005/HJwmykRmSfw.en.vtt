combination<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:21.269> so<00:02:21.510> happy<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.959> be

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
combination and just so happy to be

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.369

Canadian<00:02:22.730> what<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.269> greater<00:02:24.629> feeling<00:02:25.050> is

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
Canadian what is the greater feeling is

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.280 
Canadian what is the greater feeling is
it<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:26.340> moment<00:02:26.819> right<00:02:27.120> as<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.840> finished

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
it that moment right as you finished

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.860 
it that moment right as you finished
