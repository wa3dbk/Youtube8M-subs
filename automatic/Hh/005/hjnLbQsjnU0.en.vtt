00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.919 

so<00:00:00.359> on<00:00:00.719> XM<00:00:01.650> skis<00:00:01.979> we<00:00:02.399> have<00:00:02.550> skated<00:00:02.939> classic<00:00:03.449> and

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
so on XM skis we have skated classic and

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.110 
so on XM skis we have skated classic and
we've<00:00:04.350> changed<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.950> skis<00:00:05.220> for<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.580> 13/14

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
we've changed the skis for the 13/14

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.459 
we've changed the skis for the 13/14
season<00:00:06.509> so<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.080> now<00:00:07.200> have<00:00:07.490> s1<00:00:08.490> s2<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.719> s3<00:00:09.870> and

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
season so we now have s1 s2 and s3 and

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.320 
season so we now have s1 s2 and s3 and
then<00:00:10.590> see<00:00:10.830> one<00:00:11.070> two<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.460> three<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:11.880> classic

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
then see one two and three for classic

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.870 
then see one two and three for classic
and<00:00:13.019> we've<00:00:13.710> changed<00:00:14.009> how<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.370> skis<00:00:14.700> are<00:00:14.730> made

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and we've changed how the skis are made

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.720 
and we've changed how the skis are made
so<00:00:15.389> one<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.109> cold<00:00:16.350> conditions<00:00:16.920> two<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.699> a

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
so one is for cold conditions two is a

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.490 
so one is for cold conditions two is a
universal<00:00:18.480> ski<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:18.960> reisel<00:00:19.320> our

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
universal ski and it's reisel our

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.500 
universal ski and it's reisel our
conditions

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
conditions

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.450 
conditions
we're<00:00:20.900> changing<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:21.350> camber<00:00:21.740> profiles<00:00:22.189> and

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
we're changing the camber profiles and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.370 
we're changing the camber profiles and
pressure<00:00:22.640> distributions<00:00:23.330> on<00:00:23.449> flight<00:00:23.810> zone<00:00:24.080> to

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
pressure distributions on flight zone to

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.010 
pressure distributions on flight zone to
handle<00:00:24.680> those<00:00:24.770> different<00:00:25.189> conditions<00:00:25.340> so<00:00:26.330> one

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
handle those different conditions so one

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.019 
handle those different conditions so one
it<00:00:27.500> used<00:00:27.740> to<00:00:27.859> be<00:00:27.949> a<00:00:27.980> sprint<00:00:28.310> ski<00:00:28.520> for<00:00:28.730> us<00:00:28.849> we've

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
it used to be a sprint ski for us we've

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.970 
it used to be a sprint ski for us we've
now<00:00:29.150> changed<00:00:29.180> this<00:00:29.599> to<00:00:29.779> a<00:00:29.810> true<00:00:30.140> cold<00:00:30.439> snow<00:00:30.680> ski

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
now changed this to a true cold snow ski

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.439 
now changed this to a true cold snow ski
changing<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:31.550> lay<00:00:31.669> up<00:00:31.820> of<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.000> ski<00:00:32.239> a<00:00:32.270> little

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
changing the lay up of the ski a little

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.479 
changing the lay up of the ski a little
bit<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:34.489> s-two<00:00:35.000> is<00:00:35.420> our<00:00:35.960> standard<00:00:36.290> one<00:00:37.250> ski

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
bit and s-two is our standard one ski

bit and s-two is our standard one ski
quiver<00:00:37.519> the<00:00:38.180> universal<00:00:38.690> ski<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.769> then<00:00:39.890> we<00:00:39.980> add

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
quiver the universal ski and then we add

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.220 
quiver the universal ski and then we add
an<00:00:41.000> s3<00:00:41.260> which<00:00:42.260> is<00:00:42.410> a<00:00:42.440> warm<00:00:42.769> snow<00:00:43.100> ski<00:00:43.780> so<00:00:44.780> if<00:00:45.140> you

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
an s3 which is a warm snow ski so if you

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.509 
an s3 which is a warm snow ski so if you
were<00:00:45.320> going<00:00:45.410> to<00:00:45.500> have<00:00:45.589> one<00:00:45.620> ski<00:00:46.010> from<00:00:46.129> us<00:00:46.309> it

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
were going to have one ski from us it

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.430 
were going to have one ski from us it
would<00:00:46.610> be<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.910> s2<00:00:47.269> and<00:00:47.750> then<00:00:47.960> depending<00:00:48.199> on

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
would be the s2 and then depending on

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.200 
would be the s2 and then depending on
your<00:00:48.500> climate<00:00:48.800> or<00:00:49.160> you're<00:00:49.280> traveling<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.850> go

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
your climate or you're traveling to go

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.670 
your climate or you're traveling to go
to<00:00:50.269> the<00:00:50.420> three<00:00:50.720> for<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.140> warm<00:00:51.320> wet<00:00:51.470> wet

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
to the three for the warm wet wet

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.010 
to the three for the warm wet wet
conditions<00:00:52.250> or<00:00:52.579> you'd<00:00:52.850> go<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.270> s1<00:00:53.750> for

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
conditions or you'd go to the s1 for

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.920 
conditions or you'd go to the s1 for
quality<00:00:54.350> conditions<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:55.730> s3<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.390> unique<00:00:56.690> in<00:00:56.870> a

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
quality conditions the s3 is unique in a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.660 
quality conditions the s3 is unique in a
few<00:00:57.170> ways<00:00:57.320> we're<00:00:57.649> building<00:00:58.039> in<00:00:58.190> some<00:00:58.399> tips

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
few ways we're building in some tips

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.510 
few ways we're building in some tips
play<00:00:58.940> for<00:00:59.719> those<00:00:59.840> softer<00:01:00.320> conditions<00:01:00.739> then

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
play for those softer conditions then

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.010 
play for those softer conditions then
we're<00:01:01.640> actually<00:01:01.730> putting<00:01:02.239> a<00:01:02.390> white<00:01:02.570> base<00:01:02.780> on

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
we're actually putting a white base on

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.749 
we're actually putting a white base on
the<00:01:03.109> ski<00:01:03.289> as<00:01:03.410> well<00:01:03.620> there's<00:01:04.220> no<00:01:04.369> carbon

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
the ski as well there's no carbon

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.940 
the ski as well there's no carbon
additive<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:06.320> helps<00:01:06.649> with

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
additive to this so it helps with

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.550 
additive to this so it helps with
there's<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:07.700> little<00:01:07.910> bit<00:01:08.030> less<00:01:08.259> build-up<00:01:09.259> so<00:01:09.410> I

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
there's a little bit less build-up so I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.100 
there's a little bit less build-up so I
can<00:01:09.710> attack<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.100> dirt<00:01:10.310> as<00:01:10.490> much<00:01:10.720> in<00:01:11.720> this<00:01:11.899> base

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
can attack the dirt as much in this base

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.200 
can attack the dirt as much in this base
material<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:12.619> harder<00:01:13.070> than<00:01:13.460> what<00:01:13.670> we<00:01:13.789> use<00:01:14.000> on

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
material is harder than what we use on

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.300 
material is harder than what we use on
an<00:01:14.300> s2<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:14.780> s1<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.740> we're<00:01:15.860> able<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.130> put<00:01:16.280> a

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
an s2 and s1 so we're able to put a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.740 
an s2 and s1 so we're able to put a
little<00:01:16.490> deeper<00:01:16.789> structure<00:01:17.210> in<00:01:17.300> there<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.570> help

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
little deeper structure in there to help

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.630 
little deeper structure in there to help
get<00:01:17.960> water

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640

the<00:01:20.940> profile<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.780> three<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.170> different

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the profile of the three is different

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.590 
the profile of the three is different
than<00:01:22.980> the<00:01:23.130> two<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> one<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> little

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
than the two on the one we have a little

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.410 
than the two on the one we have a little
bit<00:01:24.720> smaller<00:01:24.990> contact<00:01:25.530> catch<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.190> less<00:01:27.150> chance

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
bit smaller contact catch so less chance

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.890 
bit smaller contact catch so less chance
for<00:01:27.480> suction<00:01:28.050> and<00:01:28.410> handler<00:01:29.100> adjustment

for suction and handler adjustment

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.380 
for suction and handler adjustment
those<00:01:31.900> are<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.170> skate<00:01:32.409> skis<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:33.430> classic<00:01:34.180> skis

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
those are the skate skis a classic skis

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.649 
those are the skate skis a classic skis
are<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.659> same<00:01:34.869> thing<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:36.159> have<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.340> 1<00:01:37.030> 2<00:01:37.360> &amp;<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.630> 3

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
are the same thing we have a 1 2 &amp; a 3

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.410 
are the same thing we have a 1 2 &amp; a 3
so<00:01:38.560> 1<00:01:38.830> being<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.130> cold<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.790> being<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.119> uni

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
so 1 being the cold to being the uni

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.810 
so 1 being the cold to being the uni
three<00:01:40.690> being<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:40.960> warm<00:01:41.229> so<00:01:42.040> one<00:01:42.310> being<00:01:42.580> our

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
three being the warm so one being our

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.469 
three being the warm so one being our
powder<00:01:43.540> ski<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:45.280> being<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.670> universal<00:01:45.909> skis

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
powder ski to being the universal skis

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.320 
powder ski to being the universal skis
we'd<00:01:47.020> have<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.200> wax<00:01:48.070> this<00:01:48.310> version<00:01:48.580> that's<00:01:49.119> so

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
we'd have a wax this version that's so

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.270 
we'd have a wax this version that's so
here<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.750> see<00:01:49.899> on<00:01:50.110> that<00:01:50.140> thing<00:01:50.380> up<00:01:50.590> it's<00:01:51.130> nice

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
here you see on that thing up it's nice

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.859 
here you see on that thing up it's nice

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
about this guys we're able to put a hard

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.529 
about this guys we're able to put a hard
wax<00:01:53.020> on<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:53.500> if<00:01:53.710> needed<00:01:53.920> as<00:01:54.159> well<00:01:54.369> it's<00:01:55.270> built

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
wax on this if needed as well it's built

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.260 
wax on this if needed as well it's built
on<00:01:55.659> a<00:01:55.720> c2<00:01:56.259> profile<00:01:56.979> so<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.340> universal<00:01:57.909> little

we're<00:02:01.900> now<00:02:02.140> bringing<00:02:02.500> in<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.950> series<00:02:03.520> to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
we're now bringing in the series to

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.940 
we're now bringing in the series to
charter<00:02:04.150> blister<00:02:04.540> skis<00:02:04.810> it's<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.590> little<00:02:05.830> bit

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
charter blister skis it's a little bit

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.800 
charter blister skis it's a little bit
higher<00:02:06.190> camber<00:02:06.760> on<00:02:06.940> these<00:02:07.120> little<00:02:07.510> steeper

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
higher camber on these little steeper

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.440 
higher camber on these little steeper
transition<00:02:08.350> from<00:02:08.500> camera<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.950> glide<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:10.119> we

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
transition from camera to glide and we

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.980 
transition from camera to glide and we
do<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:10.720> in<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.990> standard<00:02:11.380> base<00:02:12.930> there's<00:02:13.930> a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
do this in a standard base there's a

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.930 
do this in a standard base there's a
white<00:02:14.200> base<00:02:14.410> version<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.550> white<00:02:15.730> base

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
white base version so the white base

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.550 
white base version so the white base
just<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:16.390> on<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.600> skate<00:02:16.810> skis<00:02:17.080> made<00:02:17.320> for

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
just like on the skate skis made for

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.170 
just like on the skate skis made for
that<00:02:17.620> really<00:02:17.950> wet<00:02:18.130> snow<00:02:18.430> conditions<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.150> that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
that really wet snow conditions in that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.990 
that really wet snow conditions in that
larger<00:02:19.660> base<00:02:19.860> little<00:02:20.860> deeper<00:02:21.190> structure

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
larger base little deeper structure

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.580 
larger base little deeper structure
built<00:02:22.209> into<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:23.200> then<00:02:23.320> we<00:02:23.410> have<00:02:23.560> a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
built into that and then we have a

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.530 
built into that and then we have a
standard<00:02:24.209> black<00:02:25.209> base<00:02:25.480> under<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.900> kick<00:02:26.080> so

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.240 

it's<00:02:31.540> also<00:02:31.870> black<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.410> can<00:02:32.620> see<00:02:32.860> if<00:02:33.040> you're

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
it's also black so you can see if you're

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.600 
it's also black so you can see if you're
layering<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:38.140> big<00:02:38.380> changes<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.160> axiom

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
layering so big changes to the axiom

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.470 
layering so big changes to the axiom
collection

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.950 
collection
making<00:02:40.780> sure<00:02:40.810> we<00:02:41.110> have<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.820> right<00:02:43.000> conditions

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
making sure we have the right conditions

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.660 
making sure we have the right conditions
there<00:02:45.590> types<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:45.980> snow<00:02:46.130> everybody's<00:02:46.550> gonna

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
there types of snow everybody's gonna

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.510 
there types of snow everybody's gonna
see<00:02:46.910> out<00:02:47.030> there<00:02:47.300> another<00:02:48.170> thing<00:02:48.440> we<00:02:49.190> made<00:02:49.370> this

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
see out there another thing we made this

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.310 
see out there another thing we made this
change<00:02:49.850> this<00:02:50.090> year<00:02:50.360> all<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.050> skis<00:02:51.290> are

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
change this year all the skis are

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.730 
change this year all the skis are
flexing<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.220> factory<00:02:52.640> it's<00:02:53.060> in<00:02:53.210> a

flexing in the factory it's in a
climate-controlled<00:02:54.740> room<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:56.570> skis

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
climate-controlled room so the skis

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.330 
climate-controlled room so the skis
doesn't<00:02:57.470> matter<00:02:57.620> what<00:02:57.770> time<00:02:57.950> of<00:02:57.980> day<00:02:58.070> they're

doesn't matter what time of day they're

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.680 
doesn't matter what time of day they're

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
flexed everything's the same in that and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.370 
flexed everything's the same in that and
we're<00:03:01.790> able<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.150> put<00:03:02.360> in<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.630> bunch<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.990> fitting

we're able to put in a bunch of fitting

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.350 
we're able to put in a bunch of fitting
information<00:03:04.100> into<00:03:04.280> this<00:03:04.400> barcode<00:03:04.880> that<00:03:04.940> tells

information into this barcode that tells

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.260 
information into this barcode that tells
us<00:03:05.510> camber<00:03:06.550> measurements<00:03:07.550> so<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.880> lengths<00:03:08.180> of
