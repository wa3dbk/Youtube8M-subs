00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.859
 i 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.560
 how 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.180
 betina cat 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.030
 how good it is that I arrived before 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.710
 that nobody because I have a lot of 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.100
 things to do these after helping 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.000
 he taught me and I bring you a little gift 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.330
 it thrills me are always these angels 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.370
 so delicious, very similar to those of 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.940
 last year that we hung in the crown of 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.570
 doing 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.289
 I love them and I love them I like them 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.350
 very much 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.290
 danny is 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.340
 almost German was born in Spain but all 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.090
 their German families has been the first 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.170
 commercial pilot that was in Spain and 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.930
 also the first commander 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.950
 she is very artisan now that she is 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.869
 retired has a lot of time and can 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.810
 make these precious gifts to 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.970
 your friends tell how you fate 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.979
 happened that pilot I had then 13 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.899
 years or so while I left 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.810
 saw and the planes throwing fire to 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.700
 back it seemed like a wonderful thing and 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.220
 says I was going joe 9 greater I want to be 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.670
 pilot like bill I told me fireman 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.580
 because your super pilot I met 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.840
 betina just at that time 40 years ago 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:57.210
 when she started in 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.039
 as a pilot on a Bettina shelf that 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.630
 you are going to teach because today we are going to do 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.640
 some stars because it becomes very easy 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.469
 and it 's like this very fast as well as station 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.319
 more things because maybe it's the good thing to do 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.119
 notice now I think it's a great idea 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.120
 Well, shoot for the stars 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.459
 we need first a role that 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.099
 it's a bit stiff we can take advantage 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.519
 also any wrapping paper that 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.680
 have been if decent and perfectly 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.110
 you can do it and then what we have 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.120
 is we need paper we use a 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.799
 thread to tie it to match the paper 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.000
 what we are going to do depends on our 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:36.680
 I like to glue some scissors and that's it and 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.220
 it is not necessary anymore because we are going to what 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.780
 that we think first where we want 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.209
 do with the star where we want it 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.370
 hang is that I would like to see it in 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.950
 the long is worth it because we want them thumb 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.920
 in the tree we make them not very big 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.859
 we do as a distance of 13 or 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.200
 14 centimeters worth is worth then what 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.450
 we make 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.379
 search for 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.030
 start come because as we have here 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:09.069
 the luck of having it marked not 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.840
 we need no rule 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.519
 Well, we have here the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.790
 squares made and then what 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.769
 we do is double them with the pax with the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.799
 drawing outwards we fold them in 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.799
 diagonal in a few doubles 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.450
 like the times 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.500
 we re-open what we do again with 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.500
 triangles 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.700
 we mark well so then we go back to 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.700
 we make an all one rectangle 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.980
 now a rectangle 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.690
 we already have them in hand and for the part 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.140
 let's say in triangles but the 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.360
 perpendicular we make a slit with the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.930
 scissor him like half the distance 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:07.220
 from the center until reaching channels 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.220
 they go more or less like this 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.360
 it's fine it's phenomenal look now it 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:20.540
 rinse fold the little corners doing 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.850
 that match any with the 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.880
 diagonal or the diagonal that then then 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.130
 we bend it by making some angles 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.040
 you already have some accounts that you want one 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.980
 Well, that beautiful story that to me 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.140
 the one in your grandmother's basket whistles 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.660
 Well look any day before 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.220
 Christmas in Advent season as 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.170
 they had to be the whole family 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.480
 doing Christmas things when 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.120
 we had everything under control that we already 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.660
 we had all things done all very 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.330
 beautiful 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.720
 came down from the sky that was lowered by 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:58.460
 angels clear is a wonderful basket 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.040
 full of sweet hazel nuts are 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.890
 marzipan figurines sure to be 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.200
 there the subject becomes a wonder 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.000
 that was wonderful and we came back from that 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.800
 then all the year because of course there was 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.080
 wait for when the festival arrived 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.500
 come this now we have it dominated look 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.849
 we already have the more or less made star 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.440
 Now we have to take the cord that 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.389
 we have chosen to hang our 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.819
 star as we are going to hang it from 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:29.610
 tree we do not place it mobility do not 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.610
 we make very long nothing that is easy to 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.300
 to hang the one that looks good we make it 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:39.020
 a knot here at the bottom and 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:43.340
 now we put catch the glue and 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:46.789
 we're giving him glue the first one 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:51.169
 the channel stops at the bottom more 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.979
 that nothing to paste the clear half like 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.500
 you see 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.960
 I have to tape tapes not only 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.330
 I just one sole pin and then we go 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.370
 hitting each triangle we have 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.670
 made a part one side very well one side 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.740
 other side 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.289
 and another side 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.469
 OK 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:14.620
 and now once we have it we start 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:17.080
 to bend it 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:21.600
 so that it is in a triangle if we put 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:24.600
 the little finger like that seems to facilitate and 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.600
 so 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.730
 then so that it has more volume what 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.070
 what we do is hit two stars 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:38.640
 together we are going to put you for which 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:41.880
 we have to put glue can 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.710
 put the finger back that helps me 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.260
 we have to paste them on the edges 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:49.590
 interior enough that 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.720
 we can hit the other star on top 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.639
 thank you very much and then we put 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.819
 we focus it well so that it is 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:07:00.939
 everything is pretty well who are the 

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:02.770
 points each in its place and we press 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:05.830
 a little bit like that now we have a little 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:10.949
 of patience that sticks like you see 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.949
 bettina is a fantastic craftswoman 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.250
 and point 

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:04.700
 two 

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.830
 I do not even love that I was taught 

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:11.080
 to make this star I will remember 

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:11.080
 in this tree 

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:19.090
 do you think we put the month
