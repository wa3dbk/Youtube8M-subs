00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
try it yeah maybe it on the speedrun I

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.340 
try it yeah maybe it on the speedrun I
was<00:01:36.970> yeah<00:01:37.180> I'll<00:01:37.390> just<00:01:37.450> finish<00:01:37.660> this<00:01:37.869> I<00:01:40.170> don't<00:01:41.170> I

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
don't know where the the end of the

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.490 
don't know where the the end of the
floor<00:01:44.860> is<00:01:45.099> so<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.550> don't<00:01:45.729> know<00:01:45.819> i<00:01:46.140> think<00:01:47.140> that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
floor is so I don't know i think that

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.020 
floor is so I don't know i think that
building<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:48.069> she<00:01:48.429> was<00:01:48.550> next<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.819> you<00:01:48.880> has

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
building that she was next to you has

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.820 
building that she was next to you has
collision<00:01:49.509> detection<00:01:49.780> even<00:01:50.200> though<00:01:50.289> there's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
collision detection even though there's

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.870 
collision detection even though there's
no<00:01:51.069> texture<00:01:51.670> there<00:01:51.849> so<00:01:53.190> anyway<00:01:54.190> I'm<00:01:54.520> kind<00:01:54.849> of

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
no texture there so anyway I'm kind of

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.990 
no texture there so anyway I'm kind of
happy<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.179> that<00:01:55.390> happened<00:01:56.789> that's<00:01:57.789> cool

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
happy that that happened that's cool
