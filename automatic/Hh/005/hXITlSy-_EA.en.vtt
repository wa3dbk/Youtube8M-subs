enough<00:02:36.640> you're<00:02:37.640> going<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.850> dip<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.239> base

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.190 

can<00:02:52.230> actually<00:02:53.390> squeeze<00:02:54.390> out<00:02:54.720> some<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
can actually squeeze out some of the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.630 
can actually squeeze out some of the
excess<00:02:55.650> wax<00:02:57.260> but<00:02:58.260> my<00:02:58.440> experience<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:59.160> actually

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
excess wax but my experience is actually

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.150 
excess wax but my experience is actually
the<00:02:59.790> more<00:03:00.000> wax<00:03:00.300> that's<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.870> these<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.800> longer

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
they burn and it's a good idea to have

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.460 
they burn and it's a good idea to have
some<00:03:05.580> wax<00:03:05.790> paper<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.690> set<00:03:06.900> these<00:03:07.050> in<00:03:07.260> while

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
they dry because it won't stick to the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.710 
they dry because it won't stick to the
wax<00:03:09.480> paper<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:13.970> another<00:03:14.970> thing<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.630> can
