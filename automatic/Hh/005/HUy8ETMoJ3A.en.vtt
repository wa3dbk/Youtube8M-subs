00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:02.919 
wanted to give it some texture

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:05.039 
wanted to give it some texture
this<00:02:03.459> is<00:02:03.639> Basile<00:02:04.060> card<00:02:04.299> stock<00:02:04.569> so<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.899> already

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
this is Basile card stock so it already

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.319 
this is Basile card stock so it already
has<00:02:05.319> some<00:02:05.649> but<00:02:06.009> it's<00:02:06.159> got<00:02:06.399> lots<00:02:06.639> of<00:02:06.849> texture

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329

now<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.739> just<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:09.789> it<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.149> just<00:02:10.479> a

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.410 
five and a quarter and I cut them six
times<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.600> cuts<00:02:32.870> five<00:02:33.140> each<00:02:33.410> time<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.490> it<00:02:34.880> cut

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
times it cuts five each time so it cut

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.740 
times it cuts five each time so it cut
30<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:37.160> just<00:02:37.430> started<00:02:37.820> putting<00:02:38.000> them<00:02:38.240> where

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
30 and I just started putting them where

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.630 
30 and I just started putting them where
the<00:02:39.080> layers<00:02:39.350> would<00:02:39.740> come<00:02:39.950> together<00:02:40.130> on<00:02:40.520> the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
the layers would come together on the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.750 
the layers would come together on the
cake<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:42.590> needed<00:02:42.980> something<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:43.610> the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
cake and it needed something in the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.140 
cake and it needed something in the
center<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.450> didn't<00:02:44.720> really<00:02:44.870> want<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.200> use

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
center and I didn't really want to use

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.380 
center and I didn't really want to use
anything<00:02:47.150> glittery<00:02:48.020> or<00:02:48.140> sparkly<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.090> got

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
anything glittery or sparkly so I got

and<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:56.300> secret<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.840> using<00:02:57.050> these<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.860> put<00:02:58.400> a

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
and the secret to using these I put a

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.120 
and the secret to using these I put a
dot<00:02:58.730> in<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.600> center<00:02:59.900> of<00:02:59.990> each<00:03:00.170> one<00:03:00.200> well<00:03:01.070> it

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
dot in the center of each one well it

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.490 
dot in the center of each one well it
leaves<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.490> little<00:03:01.610> point<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.330> top<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.290> what

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
leaves a little point in the top so what

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.199 
leaves a little point in the top so what
you<00:03:03.620> want<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.860> do<00:03:04.100> when<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.790> get<00:03:04.910> them<00:03:05.060> all<00:03:05.150> on

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
and those little points on the top will

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.820 
and those little points on the top will
flatten<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:14.180> you'll<00:03:14.570> get<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.780> nice<00:03:15.020> little
