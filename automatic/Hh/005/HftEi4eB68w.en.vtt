00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
care about elegance again if you have a

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.690 
care about elegance again if you have a
sense<00:00:57.230> of<00:00:57.410> style<00:00:57.680> your<00:00:58.400> clothes<00:00:58.670> should

a straight guy not to care about your
clothes<00:01:16.010> at<00:01:16.190> all<00:01:16.340> everybody<00:01:16.790> tried<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.240> well

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
clothes at all everybody tried to well

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.910 
clothes at all everybody tried to well
went<00:01:17.660> to<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.750> private<00:01:18.170> school<00:01:18.200> never<00:01:18.590> one<00:01:18.770> try

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
went to a private school never one try

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.490 
went to a private school never one try
to<00:01:18.980> look<00:01:19.220> scruffy<00:01:19.550> that<00:01:19.880> was<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.210> way<00:01:21.080> to<00:01:21.110> look

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
to look scruffy that was the way to look

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.140 
to look scruffy that was the way to look
so<00:01:22.220> I<00:01:22.250> think<00:01:22.460> there<00:01:22.700> was<00:01:22.790> some<00:01:22.970> confusion

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
so I think there was some confusion

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.750 
so I think there was some confusion
between<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.230> English<00:01:24.890> part<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.640> my

between the English part of my

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.750 
between the English part of my
sensibility<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:26.870> the<00:01:27.770> result<00:01:28.250> of<00:01:28.400> living<00:01:28.550> in

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
sensibility and the result of living in

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.000 
sensibility and the result of living in
New<00:01:28.790> York<00:01:28.909> for<00:01:29.120> 15<00:01:29.570> years<00:01:29.900> I<00:01:30.110> would<00:01:30.860> never
