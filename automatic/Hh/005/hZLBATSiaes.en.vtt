00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.720 
I feel like I'm painting a canvas with
sounds<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.369> some<00:00:17.699> some<00:00:18.180> fashion<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:20.279> you

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
sounds in some some fashion and so you

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.990 
sounds in some some fashion and so you
know<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.000> visual<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.580> oral<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.850> me

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
know the visual and and the oral to me

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.920 
know the visual and and the oral to me
they<00:00:24.439> they're<00:00:25.439> all<00:00:25.590> mixed<00:00:25.830> up<00:00:26.449> in<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.599> good<00:00:27.779> way

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930

engineer<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.000> good<00:01:55.750> friend<00:01:56.020> Jim<00:01:56.200> Anderson

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
engineer and good friend Jim Anderson

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.279 
engineer and good friend Jim Anderson
about<00:01:56.799> this<00:01:56.979> project<00:01:57.329> he<00:01:58.329> said<00:01:58.600> how<00:01:59.259> about

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
about this project he said how about

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.139 
about this project he said how about
sounds<00:02:00.130> around<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:02.200> capturing<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.070> from<00:02:03.250> 360

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
sounds around so capturing it from 360

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.199 
sounds around so capturing it from 360
degrees<00:02:04.509> is<00:02:04.810> really<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.679> very<00:02:06.369> special<00:02:06.640> way<00:02:07.149> to

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
degrees is really a very special way to

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.479 
degrees is really a very special way to
hear<00:02:07.959> it<00:02:08.080> it's<00:02:08.619> really<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.280> way<00:02:09.369> the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
hear it it's really the way the

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.740 
hear it it's really the way the
instrument<00:02:09.789> kind<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.560> breathes<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.600> that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
instrument kind of breathes so in that

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.890 
instrument kind of breathes so in that
sense<00:02:14.190> sound<00:02:15.190> surround<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.940> like<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> perfect

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
sense sound surround is like a perfect

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.030 
sense sound surround is like a perfect
match<00:02:17.110> for<00:02:17.140> my<00:02:17.560> instrument<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:20.739> know<00:02:20.860> for

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
match for my instrument you know for

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.650 
match for my instrument you know for
somebody<00:02:21.280> like<00:02:21.430> me<00:02:21.640> who's<00:02:21.910> always<00:02:22.209> been

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
interested in how sound changes when it

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.280 
interested in how sound changes when it
moves<00:02:24.549> you<00:02:24.760> know<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.180> do<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:25.840> thing<00:02:26.019> with<00:02:26.170> the
