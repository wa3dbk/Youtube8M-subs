I'm gonna use a fork to mash it all

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.140 
I'm gonna use a fork to mash it all
together<00:02:32.030> that's<00:02:32.480> usually<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.900> easiest<00:02:32.930> way

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.040

we want to really make sure that
everything<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.650> incorporated<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.400> then<00:02:40.489> it's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
everything is incorporated and then it's

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.820 
everything is incorporated and then it's
all<00:02:40.880> mashed<00:02:41.450> up<00:02:41.750> looks<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.410> lot<00:02:42.590> of<00:02:42.620> hot

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830

the yolks the yolks and the minis will
help<00:02:47.060> cool<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.360> heat<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.720> little<00:02:47.810> bit<00:02:52.780> to

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
help cool the heat a little bit to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.460

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
smooth at this point it's often nice to

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.350 
smooth at this point it's often nice to
just<00:03:00.500> add<00:03:00.709> about<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.130> teaspoon<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:01.880> olive<00:03:02.060> oil
