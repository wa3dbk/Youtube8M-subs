limited by his large chin because of the
magnetic<00:00:18.010> ball<00:00:18.220> system<00:00:18.490> he<00:00:18.940> can<00:00:19.090> move<00:00:19.210> all

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
magnetic ball system he can move all

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.109 
magnetic ball system he can move all
over<00:00:19.840> the<00:00:19.960> place<00:00:20.200> at<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:21.640> shoulder<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:23.560> elbow

over the place at the shoulder the elbow

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.720 
over the place at the shoulder the elbow
he<00:00:25.119> also<00:00:25.270> has<00:00:25.570> a<00:00:25.830> traditional<00:00:26.830> hinge<00:00:27.130> swivel

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
he also has a traditional hinge swivel

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.639 
he also has a traditional hinge swivel
and<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.980> can<00:00:30.160> rotate<00:00:30.340> his<00:00:30.640> wrist<00:00:30.970> so<00:00:31.270> his<00:00:32.259> arms

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
and you can rotate his wrist so his arms

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.509 
and you can rotate his wrist so his arms
are<00:00:32.800> extremely<00:00:33.929> versatile<00:00:35.039> he<00:00:36.039> doesn't<00:00:36.339> have

a waste any waist movement his hips
again<00:00:41.589> because<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.280> magnetic<00:00:42.579> ball<00:00:42.879> joint

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
again because the magnetic ball joint

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.689 
again because the magnetic ball joint
move<00:00:43.420> all<00:00:43.569> over<00:00:43.600> the<00:00:43.899> place<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.309> then<00:00:45.489> he<00:00:45.550> does

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
move all over the place and then he does

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.750 
move all over the place and then he does
have<00:00:45.879> a<00:00:45.909> traditional<00:00:46.510> hinge<00:00:47.229> at<00:00:48.069> the<00:00:48.159> knee<00:00:48.489> and

well<00:02:21.670> when<00:02:21.910> you've<00:02:22.030> got<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.210> light<00:02:22.420> source

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
well when you've got a light source

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.830 
well when you've got a light source
behind<00:02:22.960> him

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
behind him

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.300 
behind him
doesn't<00:02:25.840> really<00:02:25.900> pipe<00:02:26.260> through<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.650> back<00:02:26.950> but

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
doesn't really pipe through the back but

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.280 
doesn't really pipe through the back but
you<00:02:27.820> can<00:02:27.880> see<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.210> shoulders<00:02:28.660> are<00:02:28.870> solid

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
you can see the shoulders are solid

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.500 
you can see the shoulders are solid
blocks<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.160> then<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:30.940> chest<00:02:31.210> does

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
blocks of it and then the chest does

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.090 
blocks of it and then the chest does
have<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.840> all<00:02:31.960> around<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.350> big<00:02:32.590> central

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
have it all around this big central

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.740 
have it all around this big central
magnetic<00:02:33.580> ball<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.420> there<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.440> go<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:36.490> uh

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
magnetic ball so there you go but uh

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.850 
magnetic ball so there you go but uh
yeah<00:02:37.750> he<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.860> pretty<00:02:39.070> poseable<00:02:39.610> pretty<00:02:39.940> fun

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
yeah he is pretty poseable pretty fun

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.630 
yeah he is pretty poseable pretty fun
liked<00:02:41.860> him<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.130> lot

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
liked him a lot

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.680 
liked him a lot
there's<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.120> central<00:02:43.690> figure<00:02:45.630> okay<00:02:46.630> so

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
there's the central figure okay so

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.530 
there's the central figure okay so
taking<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.440> look<00:02:47.620> at<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.010> cat<00:02:48.520> portion<00:02:49.270> of<00:02:49.390> this

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
taking a look at the cat portion of this

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.280 
taking a look at the cat portion of this
set<00:02:50.550> these<00:02:51.550> are<00:02:51.880> almost<00:02:52.210> identical<00:02:52.540> in<00:02:53.170> every

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
set these are almost identical in every

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.830 
set these are almost identical in every
way<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.980> only<00:02:54.190> difference<00:02:54.580> is<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.120> heads<00:02:55.420> are

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
way the only difference is the heads are

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.590 
way the only difference is the heads are
different<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:57.400> piece<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.000> leg<00:02:58.240> is

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
different and this piece of the leg is

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.590 
different and this piece of the leg is
actually<00:02:59.520> different<00:03:00.520> on<00:03:00.850> this<00:03:01.060> guy

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
actually different on this guy

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.040 
actually different on this guy
it's<00:03:01.990> a<00:03:02.290> disc<00:03:02.650> shooter<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.400> on<00:03:03.910> this<00:03:04.120> one<00:03:04.360> it

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
it's a disc shooter and on this one it

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.190 
it's a disc shooter and on this one it
shoots<00:03:05.320> missiles<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.690> they<00:03:10.870> do<00:03:10.930> have<00:03:11.140> a

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
shoots missiles and they do have a

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.930 
shoots missiles and they do have a
difference<00:03:11.560> in<00:03:11.650> articulation<00:03:12.370> in<00:03:12.550> that<00:03:12.730> this

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
difference in articulation in that this

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.750 
difference in articulation in that this
the<00:03:13.600> black<00:03:13.870> ones<00:03:14.140> head<00:03:14.470> just<00:03:15.040> turns<00:03:15.280> left<00:03:15.520> and

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
the black ones head just turns left and

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.030 
the black ones head just turns left and
right<00:03:15.940> whereas<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.900> blue<00:03:17.110> one<00:03:17.290> can<00:03:17.620> actually

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
right whereas the blue one can actually

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.790 
right whereas the blue one can actually
look<00:03:18.760> up<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.150> down<00:03:20.640> as<00:03:21.640> well<00:03:21.940> as<00:03:22.090> turning<00:03:22.800> like

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
look up and down as well as turning like

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.490 
look up and down as well as turning like
normal<00:03:24.630> other<00:03:25.630> than<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:25.900> they're<00:03:26.080> identical

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
normal other than that they're identical

want on there
the<00:03:40.870> articulation<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.920> tail<00:03:42.670> hinges<00:03:43.630> I

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
the articulation the tail hinges I

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.259 
the articulation the tail hinges I
showed<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.769> head<00:03:45.000> because<00:03:46.000> of<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
showed you the head because of the

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.140 
showed you the head because of the
magnetic<00:03:46.930> attachment<00:03:47.610> you've<00:03:48.610> got<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.820> wide

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
magnetic attachment you've got a wide

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.300 
magnetic attachment you've got a wide
range<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.570> movement<00:03:49.900> at<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.080> hip<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.500> then

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
range of movement at the hip and then

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.910 
range of movement at the hip and then
the<00:03:51.610> bottom<00:03:51.970> piece<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.390> leg<00:03:52.680> folds<00:03:53.680> up<00:03:53.800> and

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
the bottom piece of the leg folds up and

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.920 
the bottom piece of the leg folds up and
down<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:55.420> front<00:03:55.750> leg<00:03:55.989> it<00:03:56.950> looks<00:03:57.250> like<00:03:57.430> a

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
down the front leg it looks like a

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.060 
down the front leg it looks like a
magnetic<00:03:58.930> ball<00:03:59.260> but<00:03:59.410> it's<00:03:59.530> actually<00:03:59.830> just<00:03:59.860> a

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
magnetic ball but it's actually just a

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.830 
magnetic ball but it's actually just a
plastic<00:04:00.550> ball<00:04:00.730> that<00:04:00.940> goes<00:04:01.090> on<00:04:01.239> here<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:01.720> it's

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
plastic ball that goes on here so it's

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.380 
plastic ball that goes on here so it's
really<00:04:02.110> only<00:04:02.290> a<00:04:02.680> forward<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.430> back<00:04:03.670> it

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
really only a forward and back it

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.710 
really only a forward and back it
doesn't<00:04:04.720> rotate<00:04:04.900> and<00:04:05.350> then<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.489> elbow<00:04:06.910> does

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
doesn't rotate and then the elbow does

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.190 
doesn't rotate and then the elbow does
Bend<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:10.269> that's<00:04:10.720> about<00:04:10.870> it

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
Bend and that's about it

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.320 
Bend and that's about it
other<00:04:11.440> than<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:12.700> know<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:13.060> doesn't<00:04:13.209> really

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
other than that I know it doesn't really

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.570 
other than that I know it doesn't really
come<00:04:13.690> off<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:13.900> well<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:15.190> way<00:04:15.310> that<00:04:15.489> I'm

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
come off that well the way that I'm

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.979 
come off that well the way that I'm
showing<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.090> but<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.299> does<00:04:16.419> have<00:04:16.450> some<00:04:16.840> nice

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
showing it but it does have some nice

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.640 
showing it but it does have some nice
clear<00:04:17.730> or<00:04:18.730> translucent<00:04:19.120> orange<00:04:19.750> plastic<00:04:20.109> with

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
clear or translucent orange plastic with

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.360 
clear or translucent orange plastic with
kind<00:04:20.950> of<00:04:21.039> some<00:04:21.100> like<00:04:21.539> energy<00:04:22.539> lines<00:04:22.810> running

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
kind of some like energy lines running

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.439 
kind of some like energy lines running
through<00:04:23.520> it<00:04:23.699> that<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.720> uh<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:25.740> actually

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
through it that that uh is actually

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.900 
through it that that uh is actually
actually<00:04:27.449> pretty<00:04:27.780> cool<00:04:28.040> gives<00:04:29.040> a<00:04:29.130> nice<00:04:29.310> gives

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.890 
a nice effect yeah you can't really see
it<00:04:31.410> but<00:04:31.650> well<00:04:31.770> but<00:04:32.550> anyway<00:04:32.790> so<00:04:33.330> yeah<00:04:33.479> so<00:04:33.780> that's

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
it but well but anyway so yeah so that's

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.520 
it but well but anyway so yeah so that's
that's<00:04:34.229> the<00:04:34.350> basic<00:04:34.680> cat<00:04:35.120> also<00:04:37.669> take<00:04:38.669> them

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
that's the basic cat also take them

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.890 
that's the basic cat also take them
separate<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.680> front<00:04:40.919> in<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.040> back<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.900> then

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
separate the front in the back and then

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.800 
separate the front in the back and then
with<00:04:43.050> this<00:04:43.199> front<00:04:43.470> portion<00:04:44.240> you<00:04:45.240> fold<00:04:45.600> the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
with this front portion you fold the

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.610 
with this front portion you fold the
legs<00:04:47.060> up<00:04:48.060> like<00:04:48.389> this<00:04:49.699> which<00:04:50.699> pretty<00:04:50.940> much

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
legs up like this which pretty much

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.370 
legs up like this which pretty much
exposes<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.940> laser<00:04:53.940> blaster<00:04:54.540> cannons<00:04:55.139> here

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
exposes the laser blaster cannons here

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.670 
exposes the laser blaster cannons here
and<00:04:55.880> then<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:57.030> flip<00:04:57.300> down<00:04:58.160> this<00:04:59.160> arm<00:04:59.580> and<00:05:00.680> now

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
and then you flip down this arm and now

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.390 
and then you flip down this arm and now
you've<00:05:01.919> got<00:05:02.419> cat<00:05:03.419> guns<00:05:03.750> on<00:05:04.139> top<00:05:04.410> of<00:05:04.590> cat<00:05:04.830> which

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
you've got cat guns on top of cat which

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.909 
you've got cat guns on top of cat which
admittedly<00:05:06.120> is<00:05:06.289> completely<00:05:07.289> ridiculous<00:05:07.740> but

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
admittedly is completely ridiculous but

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.980 
admittedly is completely ridiculous but
this<00:05:08.280> is<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.460> micro<00:05:08.940> man<00:05:09.120> set<00:05:09.479> we're<00:05:09.660> talking

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
this is a micro man set we're talking

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.650 
this is a micro man set we're talking
about<00:05:10.080> here<00:05:10.410> so<00:05:10.520> you<00:05:11.520> know<00:05:11.669> ridiculousness

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
about here so you know ridiculousness

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.659 
about here so you know ridiculousness
kind<00:05:12.930> of<00:05:12.990> goes<00:05:13.139> along<00:05:13.260> with<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:13.919> the<00:05:14.310> idea

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
kind of goes along with it and the idea

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.279 
kind of goes along with it and the idea
is<00:05:14.760> to<00:05:14.880> be<00:05:15.000> creative<00:05:15.419> as<00:05:15.510> possible<00:05:15.539> I<00:05:16.110> only

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
is to be creative as possible I only

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:17.570 
is to be creative as possible I only
show<00:05:16.500> you<00:05:16.560> this<00:05:16.800> because<00:05:17.010> it's<00:05:17.340> in<00:05:17.460> the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
show you this because it's in the

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.279 
show you this because it's in the
instruction<00:05:18.090> other<00:05:18.240> thing<00:05:18.539> that<00:05:18.570> you<00:05:18.840> can<00:05:18.990> do

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
instruction other thing that you can do

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.320 
instruction other thing that you can do
with<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:19.800> is<00:05:21.710> you<00:05:22.710> take<00:05:22.949> him<00:05:23.160> you<00:05:23.970> know<00:05:24.090> more

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
with this is you take him you know more

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.100 
with this is you take him you know more
or<00:05:24.419> less<00:05:24.449> in<00:05:24.720> this<00:05:25.250> configuration<00:05:26.780> attach<00:05:27.780> the

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
or less in this configuration attach the

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.839 
or less in this configuration attach the
arms<00:05:29.360> turn<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.510> head<00:05:30.690> around<00:05:31.580> so<00:05:32.580> that<00:05:32.669> it's

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
arms turn the head around so that it's

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:38.779 
arms turn the head around so that it's
like<00:05:33.000> this<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:35.810> then<00:05:36.810> taking<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:38.400> bottom

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
like this and then taking the bottom

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:44.480 
like this and then taking the bottom
part<00:05:39.030> of<00:05:39.120> it<00:05:40.610> detach<00:05:41.610> these<00:05:41.880> legs<00:05:43.099> I'm<00:05:44.099> gonna

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
part of it detach these legs I'm gonna

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.100 
part of it detach these legs I'm gonna
see<00:05:44.669> fold<00:05:45.419> that<00:05:45.599> down<00:05:45.660> like<00:05:46.289> that<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:48.110> then

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
see fold that down like that and then

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:56.360 
see fold that down like that and then
this<00:05:49.919> goes<00:05:50.669> on<00:05:51.000> top<00:05:52.340> like<00:05:53.340> so<00:05:54.020> and<00:05:55.020> that's<00:05:56.010> how

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
this goes on top like so and that's how

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.050 
this goes on top like so and that's how
he<00:05:56.430> actually<00:05:56.849> forms<00:05:57.210> a<00:05:57.419> leg<00:05:58.220> which<00:05:59.220> Believe<00:05:59.970> It

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
he actually forms a leg which Believe It

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.770 
he actually forms a leg which Believe It
or<00:06:00.120> Not<00:06:00.180> does<00:06:00.599> work<00:06:00.960> pretty<00:06:01.260> well<00:06:02.039> actually<00:06:02.910> on

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
or Not does work pretty well actually on

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.250 
or Not does work pretty well actually on
the<00:06:04.020> combined<00:06:04.560> mode<00:06:04.889> but<00:06:05.430> but<00:06:06.270> anyway<00:06:06.360> so

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
the combined mode but but anyway so

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.600 
the combined mode but but anyway so
there's<00:06:07.440> the<00:06:07.590> cat<00:06:07.770> combiners<00:06:10.070> so<00:06:11.070> here<00:06:11.250> is<00:06:11.400> in

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
there's the cat combiners so here is in

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.810 
there's the cat combiners so here is in
the<00:06:11.699> suggested<00:06:12.510> impact<00:06:13.139> man<00:06:13.440> combined<00:06:14.400> form

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
the suggested impact man combined form

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.050 
the suggested impact man combined form
which<00:06:15.320> you<00:06:16.320> know<00:06:16.440> is<00:06:16.590> okay<00:06:16.949> I<00:06:17.160> mean<00:06:17.400> certainly

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
which you know is okay I mean certainly

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.860 
which you know is okay I mean certainly
the<00:06:18.240> evil<00:06:19.080> claw<00:06:19.289> makes<00:06:19.560> a<00:06:19.710> great<00:06:20.150> hand<00:06:21.150> I<00:06:21.479> don't

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
the evil claw makes a great hand I don't

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.379 
the evil claw makes a great hand I don't
know<00:06:21.990> I<00:06:22.229> don't<00:06:23.070> really<00:06:23.220> go<00:06:23.580> for<00:06:23.880> the<00:06:23.970> old

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389 
know I don't really go for the old

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.120 
know I don't really go for the old
animal<00:06:25.190> head<00:06:26.190> for<00:06:26.460> a<00:06:26.520> hand<00:06:26.760> thing<00:06:27.260> the<00:06:28.260> cat

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
animal head for a hand thing the cat

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.159 
animal head for a hand thing the cat
legs<00:06:29.400> are<00:06:29.580> pretty<00:06:29.699> cool<00:06:30.030> and<00:06:30.360> you<00:06:30.960> know<00:06:31.050> it

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
legs are pretty cool and you know it

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.140 
legs are pretty cool and you know it
does<00:06:31.349> have<00:06:31.380> there<00:06:31.710> does<00:06:32.580> have<00:06:32.729> their<00:06:32.880> firing

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
does have there does have their firing

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.000 
does have there does have their firing
gimmicks<00:06:33.690> still<00:06:33.960> intact<00:06:34.320> so<00:06:34.620> that's<00:06:34.800> pretty

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
gimmicks still intact so that's pretty

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.210 
gimmicks still intact so that's pretty
cool<00:06:35.250> but

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
cool but

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.950 
cool but
from<00:06:36.670> my<00:06:36.790> money<00:06:37.060> I<00:06:37.150> think<00:06:37.390> there's<00:06:37.690> a<00:06:37.780> lot<00:06:37.930> of

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
from my money I think there's a lot of

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.830 
from my money I think there's a lot of
other<00:06:38.170> combinations<00:06:38.980> that<00:06:39.100> that<00:06:39.700> you<00:06:40.600> can<00:06:40.720> do

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
other combinations that that you can do

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.210 
other combinations that that you can do
that<00:06:40.960> look<00:06:41.140> a<00:06:41.200> lot<00:06:41.320> better<00:06:41.560> than<00:06:41.770> this<00:06:41.920> but

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
that look a lot better than this but

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.850 
that look a lot better than this but
this<00:06:42.820> is<00:06:43.030> kind<00:06:43.060> of<00:06:43.420> what<00:06:43.600> they<00:06:43.720> intended<00:06:44.260> this

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
this is kind of what they intended this

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.630 
this is kind of what they intended this
was<00:06:45.070> their<00:06:45.250> idea<00:06:45.280> of<00:06:45.670> a<00:06:45.820> cool<00:06:46.770> combination<00:06:47.770> so

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
was their idea of a cool combination so

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.210 
was their idea of a cool combination so
there<00:06:49.390> you<00:06:49.510> go<00:06:49.660> that's<00:06:49.870> that's<00:06:50.620> what<00:06:50.890> it<00:06:51.010> shows

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
there you go that's that's what it shows

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.480 
there you go that's that's what it shows
you<00:06:51.400> out<00:06:51.490> of<00:06:51.640> the<00:06:51.730> box<00:06:51.910> the<00:06:52.420> impact<00:06:53.050> man<00:06:53.490> from

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
you out of the box the impact man from

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.870 
you out of the box the impact man from
micro<00:06:55.150> man<00:06:55.360> so<00:06:56.200> yeah<00:06:57.010> there<00:06:57.370> you<00:06:57.490> go

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
micro man so yeah there you go

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.570 
micro man so yeah there you go
hopefully<00:06:58.660> you've<00:06:59.170> enjoyed<00:06:59.590> thank<00:07:00.130> you<00:07:00.280> very
