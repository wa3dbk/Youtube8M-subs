the United States but of course I will
do<00:00:50.039> more<00:00:50.309> investigating<00:00:50.480> to<00:00:52.760> truly<00:00:53.760> decide

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
do more investigating to truly decide

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.760 
do more investigating to truly decide
which<00:00:54.949> one<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.250> would<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.760> vote<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.770> but

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
which one I would like to vote for but

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.650 
which one I would like to vote for but
it's<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.609> be<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> first<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.359> either

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
it's it's going to be a first for either

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.950 
it's it's going to be a first for either
and<00:01:01.219> I<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.280> think<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.600> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.840> be

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and I do think that it's going to be

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.440 
and I do think that it's going to be
either/or<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.739> president<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.450> United

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
either/or for president of the United

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.530 
either/or for president of the United
States<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.799> makes<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.280> harder<00:01:11.670> it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
States and it just it makes it harder it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.390 
States and it just it makes it harder it
makes<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.900> harder<00:01:13.400> on<00:01:14.400> us<00:01:14.840> black<00:01:15.840> females<00:01:16.400> you
