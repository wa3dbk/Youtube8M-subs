00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.330
 I am the first row right away with in addition the control the 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.329
 recall of millions of vehicles 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:26.199
 washington 30 france abroad since i run this survey 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.359
 of the commission will have nine which investigates these problems 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.750
 since the end of June I am if it's the case since 1953 this commission was 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.420
 founded at 51 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.460
 in a hospital this study 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.870
 it's a conviction stresses this study 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.070
 that many envious contacts between extraterrestrials and beings 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.110
 humans 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.180
 however 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.700
 2is to contact 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.080
 take the courage to reveal yourself 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.420
 so most of the contacts still remain in the shadows 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.230
 but I think we have 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.300
 on the other hand 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.640
 as the act said we finished the prologue which would be the first chapter 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.270
 start 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.920
 this trial 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.920
 crops are rejected from noon to pontarlier 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.120
 a fence to the world 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.060
 low-speed science fiction novelist 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.490
 we know he was 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.040
 when the focus 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.230
 direction of suez perez had hit a serious man signs of impatience 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.340
 as one might think 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.340
 sales tax and then that's what is 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.990
 the big problem 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 what I say the a6 pillar of Toulon 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.240
 it's philippe vignaud bordelais 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.380
 everything he did 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.609
 intended for the edge of the highway then if we think that sf literature 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.850
 as a therapy 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.370
 for that time that matthew 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.550
 then take place as long as the second flotilla of production are 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.700
 officially recognized 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.860
 Cartesian France because France is a country 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.500
 he proposes first may 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.650
 but with scanty people scientists for the eighths 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.090
 on the charter 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.650
 very deeply 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.650
 and he is happy so it's true that I said was always 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.049
 for as much m 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.929
 if such methods marginalized by the elysée 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:19.159
 little clearing before he was still a character who was at the 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.229
 tip of 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:22.109
 to procreate 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.409
 that is to say that as a science fiction authority was the first to 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.079
 be elected 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.569
 that is to say teams of authors and who 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.479
 out of those characters of these heroes he was 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.509
 and by the way 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.659
 it's been so effective that corruption exists four years after its 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:36.729
 death 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.139
 we can mention the head first 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.479
 as for his research as to be confessed 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:45.029
 he was as old the first one maybe speaks the symbol 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:46.369
 to pay for himself 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:48.749
 i can say that i 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.429
 pay this trip to go investigate all over the world 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:52.919
 the bcc 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.639
 yes of course its transport 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:55.779
 there is 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.779
 he can also of his person hear some researchers you are 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:02:59.640
 in the field 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.919
 in all weathers and mountains 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.919
 while he was still 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.739
 after it's a hard worker to group slums 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.939
 detonating that was said 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.379
 he was always ready to surrender 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.719
 here are some examples 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.729
 of work has been part of 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.379
 that's exactly how it's going to look 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.359
 so works on the screen in the form of word processing sheets provides 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:27.969
 the treatment 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.389
 how corresponded 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.069
 all bus lines 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.459
 so that l can find it here in every paragraph at every 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.089
 chapter 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:39.339
 but something has changed 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:42.699
 very clear and very ultra-nationalists 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.699
 it is by bursting press 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.129
 he hesitated between pc and mac intosh 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.329
 health costs 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.329
 in the windows of the pc 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.389
 we will follow also underlined m 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.689
 belfond editions the weird world of contacts and lipids are among 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.259
 we 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:07.059
 Mehsud 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.389
 hello japan will play all the friends who watch us listen that i have 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:11.999
 always happy to see you again 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.259
 not only do not I still have a lot of people think it's 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.979
 maybe extraterrestrials are among us 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.440
 we can eat at the restaurant the worst side of his harvest harvest 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:22.259
 Quebec absolutely 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.479
 saïd jalili know well and because from 16h to the sector with edges 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.200
 quite regularly on the world on the same score 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.200
 those of festival because the Chinese are too far 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.919
 economics professor mouillard to say that the usa 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.539
 but they are among us of course 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.930
 when you do not see them every day in every street 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.719
 in all classes 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:47.509
 but we have enough information since June 24, 1945 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.789
 secure 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.009
 contact between humans and aliens 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.009
 to be affirmative it is not certain 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.580
 frequently extraterrestrials 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.699
 but from here 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.969
 2 there is some time left 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:03.770
 and we are founded 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.520
 think 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.520
 that not only does he provide his knee 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.900
 therrien 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.900
 make 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:23.819
 it was really a character quite 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.819
 extreme kindness 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:29.680
 until 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.000
 to a month pile of his life 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.759
 gold was always being price 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.279
 I remember it's 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.349
 he died of county 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.349
 prostate cancer 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:46.680
 really dared topo 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.789
 work again 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.789
 yes and that and his companions stranded underground 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:57.779
 with tinkering a kind of inclined plane 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.520
 on which it was time 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.759
 as often as any rest 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:03.999
 he will also surrender 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.930
 the comfortable 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.400
 if the keyboard seems 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.089
 but just down 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:11.580
 far from obvious 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.710
 because the others in France whoever they are authors 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.710
 of Science fiction 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.339
 the moment a little paranormal like that where 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:21.949
 photo ap photo 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.169
 it's a bit of considering 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.979
 always sepultura we talk a lot 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.319
 it's not much for her 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.439
 and the authors are forced to work until their last breath 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:32.240
 in a coup d'état for example 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.599
 you have to discuss things 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.189
 he is an expert 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.139
 almost no retirement 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.139
 so I really worked like a crazy commander 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.279
 really shocked because the man 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.699
 following his death 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.699
 his place to literary criticism 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:53.029
 for its part journalists 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:56.270
 not really down until Thursday 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.449
 I do not have much to blame myself 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:06:59.889
 so the spokesperson 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:01.229
 baxter can be 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:04.229
 he was tempted per cent 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.779
 on tf1 in particular 

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:12.369
 authors named christophe dechavanne who was faster than 

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:13.749
 you 

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:14.559
 it's mans tuesday
