here<00:00:09.230> ten<00:00:10.230> minutes<00:00:10.440> ago

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
here ten minutes ago

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.600 
here ten minutes ago
and<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:12.000> said<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.480> longest<00:00:13.019> they<00:00:13.860> have<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.340> 30

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
and it said the longest they have is 30

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.450 
and it said the longest they have is 30
meters<00:00:15.089> which<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.509> pretty<00:00:15.809> much<00:00:16.049> 98<00:00:16.680> feet<00:00:16.920> on

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.910 
meters which is pretty much 98 feet on
all<00:00:18.029> like<00:00:18.420> 100<00:00:18.990> feet<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:20.490> wheels<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.830> think<00:00:22.830> you

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
all like 100 feet the wheels I think you

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.130 
all like 100 feet the wheels I think you
might<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:29.090> stopped<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.869> hill

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
might have it stopped it this hill

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.229 
might have it stopped it this hill
wasn't<00:00:31.560> big<00:00:31.710> enough<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.550> we're<00:00:32.700> gonna<00:00:32.790> try<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
wasn't big enough so we're gonna try and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:48.340 
wasn't big enough so we're gonna try and
find<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.770> hill<00:00:34.770> that's<00:00:35.520> even<00:00:35.820> steeper
