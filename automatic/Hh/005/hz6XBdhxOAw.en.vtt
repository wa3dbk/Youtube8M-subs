00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.539
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.250
 a new video of me in this 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.599
 video is about normal case again for 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.849
 the iphone 5 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.340
 And this case comes from the company 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.770
 pier and sets course orden in 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.590
 video description of this cheese really 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.079
 a very thin case for the iphone 5 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.340
 There is also for the 4s on the ranks 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.950
 of course, below in the video 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.840
 description yes the case has a weight 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.520
 I'll say less than ten grams 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.770
 So if you have such a hand now 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.680
 You almost do not notice me and also 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.650
 if you have the cases on iphone has fat 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.090
 weight is not big on the case either 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.760
 is 0 35 millimeters thin and I pack 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.300
 drive the whole year iphone rand can 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.190
 let you go but cliffs tuned here 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.920
 very simple, it also really holds up very well 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.000
 Hard slide is not from the iphone 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.820
 or something like that, we'll see you soon 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.439
 retail design does not have this case 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.110
 case is supposed to do more 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:13.729
 that scratch on the back or on 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.439
 the page does not arise here and 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.909
 In addition , the handling should now 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.039
 not be affected 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.889
 Here we see again in this 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:25.369
 cases so that really contributes hardly 

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:27.319
 not here on iphone so 0 35 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.899
 millimeter, the iphone will daughters 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.579
 Thicker and I say so against when you 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.289
 so easy to protect against scratches 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.810
 that these cases are really good 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.639
 kept for that and worsened 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.490
 not the design or drinker important 

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:42.079
 on or so yes now come here to the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.869
 recesses here we have at the side 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.679
 at the music and the sound has quieter 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.869
 buttons and these can really be 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.149
 move very well as if no casey 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.499
 that would be especially good with it 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.499
 Musicians if I'm here now 

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:58.909
 iphone hand hold goes down louder or 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.130
 want to operate quieter cup then goes 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.869
 that really without any problems that 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.529
 Whole goes of course also in the power 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.090
 button 

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:06.799
 it can be easy on such a hand 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.649
 keep and to problems easy to put on and 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.840
 turn off come to the camera 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.330
 cut it out perfectly too 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.439
 cut out as I think 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.030
 this would not have been that big or too small 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:20.760
 on the bottom you can see here 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.920
 a little bit the graphite back 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.140
 Some do not like it that much 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.090
 you can see that it does not matter 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.550
 I do not say much anymore 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.530
 yes there is this case in here once 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.560
 the color black and then here in 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.459
 Sum knows what a bit 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.170
 more transparent than the black 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.790
 marked it out these 15 because me 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.440
 and yes, we can already see you here 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.470
 looks much more from the back 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.380
 from the white iphones with the black one 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.930
 case but i find for the white iphone 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.570
 this church is a bit better 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.110
 Anyone can do that 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.790
 Black iPhone 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.800
 Well, the white case on me summer 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.840
 black iphone looks like i think 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.470
 not as good as the black one now 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.180
 gs di pasta much better too and 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.920
 then whatsoever for comparison to the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.040
 better to see here again 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.690
 black case looks on white iphone 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.019
 not that bad either 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.150
 the case has a matte back 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.660
 and it's also a bit roughened 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.250
 So not completely smooth and leaves 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.540
 Keep yourself in good hands 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.030
 the iphone slip now synonymous yes 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.220
 not out of my hands, yes me 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.870
 I'm really happy with cheese 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.180
 now carries not thick on iphone 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.850
 still keeps on making up 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.250
 This super thin and beautiful design from 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.870
 iphone and still it against 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.370
 Scratch protected on the back or 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.110
 here also on the sides 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.880
 of course, if it is down now 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.579
 you should of course fall 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.739
 the danger that now old display 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.390
 but could take a big loss 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.459
 and all the iphone is still good 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.549
 protected against scratches yes this case 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.980
 on the site costs 20 dollars 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.900

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.030
