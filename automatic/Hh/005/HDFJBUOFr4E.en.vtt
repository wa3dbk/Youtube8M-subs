 Excerpts from my course belly 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.949
 when and where 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.539
 we do an exercise 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.920
 but give musculature or especially the 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.460
 Thigh front this exercise stood some networks and then

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 and unfortunately move up 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.830

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.350
 Heitersheim samples stood firm 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.409
