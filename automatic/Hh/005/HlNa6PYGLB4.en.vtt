 here is exclusive on foot the first sports en the new ipad 2 which 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.970
 is expected by year number of you om will detail today the la to 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.439
 the tablet 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:13.679
 and start looking in the menus 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.519
 and subsequently in France preview for couples full so the box we 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.940
 note marcel keller she's far it's a way to differentiate very 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.079
 easily in e from the old version 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:25.599
 so for them 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.730
 day in 10 inches 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.119
 e 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.379
 we see here now is that the elected and the numbers 2 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.680
 the earthquake 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.280
 we are on the box and on the tablet 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.280
 harper last always explanations 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.440
 but these are the explanations 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.440
 from the old model of what maple syrup 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.010
 here the technical sheet of 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.970
 we are for example 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.210
 I then avoid that the table was delivered with 4 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.580
 here he is always marked for him by two points 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.580
 while the number of points 2 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.640
 and here is not marked and that is taken 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.990
 the city 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.229
 so it's even older sportsmen they do not have the time you're 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.490
 scratch it in this version 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.490
 so to indulge with a charger 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.560
 ap in addition to the rsa we failed to have a charger originally 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.500
 in this first version with% a European crisis 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.270
 but he would have the adapter 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.960
 maybe the versions that will come that will be delivered by the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.560
 after 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.890
 will be in French track is not for now 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.400
 it is delivered here with the if a 45th adapter 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.520
 with their aunt waited 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.250
 ap 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.520
 on time 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.120
 at the bottom the tablet 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.800
 always the speakers 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.030
 on the side here we have 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.000
 always without a club 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.730
 quality control 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.730
 and again a serial number here 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:10.010
 the button that can 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.439
 Atol 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.029
 here in hand 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:14.629

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.649
 the microphone jack the hdmi socket always the button risette the headphone jack 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:21.739
 a usb socket 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.739
 and a most charged mini USB plug 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:26.760
 and here on the way 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.639
 for Roman so 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.780
 back and forth to open the menus 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.769
 no one to return much tone 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.399
 less safe archos home 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:40.059
 this one from the location to connect the jack rj45 the on-off button 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.839
 and for the location to put the micro SD card 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.719
 this is my offer 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.629
 light 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.629
 but here are the main ones of the titanic wreck 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.109
 when you say no, it's 8 6% 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.609
 the mayor of cannes 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.999
 it's not on the first version 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.699
 but if we see the icons its most broadcast title compared to many 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.309
 conventional 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:10.599
 pelissier in terms of signal 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.259
 these last six months 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.080
 it's the price to 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.529
 at 7 8 meters 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.829
 August 8, 2006 but behind a partition in place 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.889
 % and in an office a shame 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.889
 so the luxury of him philippe faure 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.739
 we will look at what is a little bit like application 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.619
 so% it comes with 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:37.809
 but to a small island that allows to receive flow information flows 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:39.919
 video 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.929
 there is another small application that allows to fly over the matche of 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:48.229
 find address wings 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.629
 in the agenda wanted to mark while there was no delay in the 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.219
 first version it was another brand 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:55.889
 the camera 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.419
 calculator 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.500
 we have galleries 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.690
 facebook the lay and development of all contacts 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.879
 what innovations 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.879
 I'm a little bit liked the best 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.869
 m translation 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:17.009
 the attitude the browser the world's fashion car music 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.030
 so that's done the app kept heading the world 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.620
 to install in the lambro marquette 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.240
 marseille even the people 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.529
 a membership that is considerable here is a gps or late 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:34.499
 that's not bad at the office pro suite it will allow me to read 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:35.689
 files 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:38.509
 excellent the current one 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:39.509
 the need 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.720
 besides the parameters 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.189
 then there to simply install it 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:48.119
 the same theme to test the speed of the processor we'll see this in a 

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:49.550
 video 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.229
 % and 2 rate that oversees the most user speirs gateway to the 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.969
 research 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.969
 I play better 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.610
 since the phone 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.220
 an application to listen to the radio 8 hours a pop culture 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:09.629
 totti go 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:11.339
 she is quite complete 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.789
 original so that's pretty good 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.430
 we can cumulate 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.029
 complete demo 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:19.430
 I propose 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.770
 the baby on the internet 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.020
 and to go 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.680
 psion of citizens of tomorrow 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.870
 to see a little bit there quality we see here 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.779
 in the favorites 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.969
 you come 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.969
 Jane founded the rise 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.159
 it allows me to look a little bit at the screen quality and speed 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.879
 for the future 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.879
 a protective film still said it may be there 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:50.719
 completely 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.719
 the Internet 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.009
 for what is good is that you lie screen 10 cushions 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.009
 it's super nice even 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.800
 Ben when we want to surf for example see videos 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.949
 here we are for example on the expected we had done 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.270
 a few weeks 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.270
 of this new ehpad 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:39.759
 that was it on the 12th of january a con had already been able to have some 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.050
 news 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.930
 on this new tablet 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.889
 we will see 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:46.300
 accelerometer 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.300
 so and the accelerometer it works well 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.830
 So here is this act 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.399
 Europe is planned for 

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:02.509
 of the new state in front of androids of points 2 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:05.979
 the head before 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.409
 finished the video what we will do is we still watch 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.309
 but show you that it's good 

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:15.119
 an android press point that the box 

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:17.399
 tells us it's an android 

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:20.399
 of dots a nice blue morning check it 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.529
 but we succeeded 

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.529
 in settings 

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:32.249
 we see here 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:35.259
 about the phone 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:39.199
 but we will look at what scored so we are in andros and 2 points 2 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.719
 so that's a core 

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:46.719
 to take six points 32 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.229
 with the successful mayor 

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:51.689
 for 100 euros 

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:54.689
 25 71 

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:59.759
 the number two of the bit 

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:02.759
 building this tablets prison 

00:08:07.659 --> 00:08:08.610
 so percent 

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.189
 see you soon on what inconsistency for new videos on this tablet
