here's how it works first before a

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.280 
here's how it works first before a
regular<00:00:39.760> old<00:00:40.210> table<00:00:40.600> salt<00:00:40.809> into<00:00:41.170> this

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
regular old table salt into this

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.180 
regular old table salt into this
compartment<00:00:41.620> here<00:00:41.950> and<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:44.260> can<00:00:44.470> see<00:00:44.770> the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
compartment here and you can see the

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.650 
compartment here and you can see the
level<00:00:45.489> of<00:00:45.550> your<00:00:45.670> table<00:00:45.970> slot<00:00:46.150> in<00:00:46.300> these<00:00:46.450> little

level of your table slot in these little

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.810 
level of your table slot in these little
holes<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:48.460> you<00:00:48.879> pump<00:00:50.070> which<00:00:51.070> activates<00:00:51.640> the

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
holes then you pump which activates the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.380 
holes then you pump which activates the
safety<00:00:52.210> so<00:00:52.360> you<00:00:52.420> just<00:00:52.570> have<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:52.750> flick<00:00:53.110> that<00:00:53.290> up

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
safety so you just have to flick that up

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.090 
safety so you just have to flick that up
also<00:00:55.390> it<00:00:55.720> pulls<00:00:55.930> up<00:00:56.080> the<00:00:56.199> site<00:00:56.440> sneaking<00:00:56.980> more

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
also it pulls up the site sneaking more

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.709 
also it pulls up the site sneaking more
accurate<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:58.720> shoot

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.600 

the<00:01:03.719> bug-a-salt<00:01:04.019> 2.0<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.920> different<00:01:05.369> from<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the bug-a-salt 2.0 is different from the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.940 
the bug-a-salt 2.0 is different from the
original<00:01:05.640> bug<00:01:06.150> assault<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:07.080> has<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> textured

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950

original bug assault it has a textured
grip<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> pump<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.509> pump

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
grip for the pump so you can pump

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.429 
grip for the pump so you can pump
quicker<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.710> get<00:01:11.040> more<00:01:11.460> shots<00:01:11.759> out<00:01:12.060> also<00:01:12.899> it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
quicker and get more shots out also it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.499 
quicker and get more shots out also it
comes<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.830> two<00:01:13.979> different<00:01:14.009> colors<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.850> when

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
comes in two different colors and when

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.410 
comes in two different colors and when
you're<00:01:15.659> shooting<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.830> more<00:01:17.520> powerful<00:01:17.820> but

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
you're shooting it's more powerful but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.570 
you're shooting it's more powerful but
it<00:01:18.540> shoots<00:01:18.720> less<00:01:19.049> salt<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.830> there's<00:01:20.039> less<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
it shoots less salt so there's less of a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.810 
it shoots less salt so there's less of a
cleanup<00:01:20.820> afterwards<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:22.520> always<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.700> this
