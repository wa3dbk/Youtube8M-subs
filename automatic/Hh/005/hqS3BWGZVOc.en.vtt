00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.080

 pitched half tablet batteries if some 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.029
 something like that so it's a tablet 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.050
 running under windows that is 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.340
 extremely powerful and that is 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.470

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.140
 bad of 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.030
 few elements I can not get too much 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.650
 sorry here we have one of the outputs of 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.390
 integrated fans etc 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.880
 so that's the first version at 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.180
 stage of finally versions the first way 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.400
 to have it's in tablet mode of 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.720
 that way and then we'll go to 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.980
 side see his purchases without 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.980
 the earth 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.230
 a version with a keyboard so that 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.710
 it's jubilant and a censor of the dock 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.750
 who could rather pretty tits 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.610
 you will make pretty accessories 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.820
 playing keyboards if it's not 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.260
 necessarily a special keyboard gaming may 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.970
 but well why not help it is 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.340
 pretty sexy and then after 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.830
 the implementation that I think you have 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.520
 already seen a few pages if he sneak me 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.510

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.750
 very healthy 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.380
 army 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.660
 so that's it 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.720
 it's with joysticks on the sides 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.380
 so there on the left that right is 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.380
 rather nice 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.130
 the eye and to the tablet in a kind 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.030
 dock with joysticks are there 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.080
 triggers etc 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.410
 and there it really becomes the console the 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.850
 race hercules team on pc anyway 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.110
 not only team on pc since I 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.510
 answer from the pc tablet of gains 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.090
 in chick theory is really nice that 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.229
 I have you on it it seems for there 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.420
 does not have the opportunity to test it 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.490
 jeanne is interesting and then I finish 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.940
 with the last do not know where and that's it 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.590
 that's it 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.440
 if you put it that way there and 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.470
 you connect a 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.180
 a controller this way and that 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.520
 can be really nice so the goal 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.750
 it's really about offering you a 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.060
 not very friendly gaming experience 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.630
 on a small tablet that is very 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.250
 powerful 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.819
 I do not know why I bothered 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.780
 with 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.780
 listen to them 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.630

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.070

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.480

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.120

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.250

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.870

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.000
 and we will keep the top in any case this 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.519
 that I did a little bit of a gamer on 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.730
 pc and it's true having the experience 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.799
