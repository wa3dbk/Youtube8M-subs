the<00:01:12.240> way<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.450> works<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.200> roll<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> dice<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the way it works you roll the dice and

the way it works you roll the dice and
you<00:01:14.520> make<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.880> story<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.299> starts<00:01:15.570> with

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
you make up a story that starts with

you make up a story that starts with
once<00:01:15.869> upon<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.080> time<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.009> somehow

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
once upon a time and you have to somehow

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.060 
once upon a time and you have to somehow
join<00:01:17.670> together<00:01:18.000> earlier<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.350> face<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.740> images

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
join together earlier the face of images

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.910 
join together earlier the face of images
on<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> dice

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.190 

four<00:01:25.580> o'clock<00:01:25.970> finally<00:01:26.690> it's<00:01:26.840> four<00:01:27.080> o'clock

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
sequences that you can have but then

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.470 
sequences that you can have but then
with<00:01:36.950> how<00:01:37.730> people<00:01:37.850> tell<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.180> stories<00:01:38.450> that

was the visual and tactile nature of to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.940

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
keep the children loved and I often say

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.950 
keep the children loved and I often say
that<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.580> story<00:01:53.150> cubes<00:01:53.330> are<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.450> great<00:01:53.630> leveler

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
that the story cubes are a great leveler

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.510 
that the story cubes are a great leveler
because<00:01:54.260> children<00:01:54.500> are<00:01:54.650> cut<00:01:55.160> off<00:01:55.250> from<00:01:55.340> better

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
because children are cut off from better

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.420 
because children are cut off from better

than adults added physical the same
inhibitions<00:01:58.430> though<00:01:59.420> you<00:01:59.480> will<00:01:59.660> find<00:01:59.900> some

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
that say I can't tell a story but what

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.560 
that say I can't tell a story but what
will<00:02:04.310> happen<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:04.610> they<00:02:04.700> maybe<00:02:04.880> start<00:02:05.180> off<00:02:05.270> and

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
will happen is they maybe start off and

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.300 
will happen is they maybe start off and
be<00:02:05.720> quite<00:02:05.900> literal<00:02:06.260> and<00:02:06.440> how<00:02:06.530> they<00:02:06.650> use<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:07.010> so

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
be quite literal and how they use it so

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.700 
be quite literal and how they use it so
they<00:02:07.400> might<00:02:07.550> say<00:02:07.760> once<00:02:08.119> upon<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.390> time<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:09.649> know

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
where it's really it's more like a

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.100 
where it's really it's more like a
muscle<00:06:05.880> that<00:06:06.120> you<00:06:06.240> just<00:06:06.390> got<00:06:06.570> it<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:06.870> more<00:06:07.020> you

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110

exercise<00:06:07.350> it<00:06:07.740> and<00:06:07.950> that's<00:06:08.640> kind<00:06:08.820> of<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:08.910> point

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
exercise it and that's kind of the point

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.820 
exercise it and that's kind of the point
of<00:06:09.210> the<00:06:09.330> story<00:06:09.510> cubes<00:06:09.780> I<00:06:10.020> kind<00:06:10.620> of<00:06:10.680> say<00:06:10.770> to

need to think differently about things I
suppose<00:06:44.670> our<00:06:44.910> kind<00:06:45.540> of<00:06:45.600> our<00:06:45.930> big<00:06:46.170> mission<00:06:46.560> is

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
suppose our kind of our big mission is

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.060 
suppose our kind of our big mission is
to<00:06:47.160> help<00:06:47.370> as<00:06:47.730> many<00:06:47.940> people<00:06:48.300> in<00:06:48.420> lock<00:06:48.660> their

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070 
to help as many people in lock their

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.710 
to help as many people in lock their
creativity<00:06:50.070> and<00:06:50.250> put<00:06:50.550> it<00:06:50.640> into<00:06:50.850> it<00:06:50.940> to<00:06:51.570> use

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
creativity and put it into it to use

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.350 
creativity and put it into it to use
because<00:06:52.020> for<00:06:52.290> us<00:06:52.380> there's<00:06:52.590> nothing<00:06:53.360> there

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
because for us there's nothing there

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.000 
because for us there's nothing there
isn't<00:06:54.570> there's<00:06:54.960> no<00:06:55.080> bigger<00:06:55.230> kick<00:06:55.500> than<00:06:55.530> having

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
isn't there's no bigger kick than having

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.590 
isn't there's no bigger kick than having
an<00:06:56.100> idea<00:06:56.340> and<00:06:56.550> seeing<00:06:56.760> it<00:06:56.880> come<00:06:57.150> to<00:06:57.390> fruition

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
an idea and seeing it come to fruition

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.020 
an idea and seeing it come to fruition
so<00:06:58.470> it's<00:06:58.800> I<00:06:59.040> think<00:06:59.160> helping<00:06:59.490> people<00:06:59.790> improve

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
so it's I think helping people improve

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.830 
so it's I think helping people improve
their<00:07:00.440> kind<00:07:01.440> of<00:07:01.530> if<00:07:02.250> I'm<00:07:02.430> lot<00:07:02.670> in<00:07:02.850> life<00:07:03.030> by

their kind of if I'm lot in life by

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.450 
their kind of if I'm lot in life by
being<00:07:04.380> able<00:07:04.470> to<00:07:04.560> apply<00:07:04.740> that<00:07:04.950> creatively<00:07:05.280> to

being able to apply that creatively to

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.310 
being able to apply that creatively to

make a difference whether it's you know

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.640 
make a difference whether it's you know
social<00:07:07.890> emotional<00:07:08.600> financial<00:07:09.600> because<00:07:10.530> I

think if the more people who can apply

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.720 
think if the more people who can apply
