00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.950 
easiest way to cut with these is to put
in<00:02:22.209> about<00:02:22.659> halfway<00:02:22.989> and<00:02:23.530> then

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
in about halfway and then

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.900 
in about halfway and then
don't<00:02:24.140> cut<00:02:24.410> all<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.650> way<00:02:24.740> to<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.010> chip<00:02:25.250> all

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
don't cut all the way to the chip all

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.790 
don't cut all the way to the chip all
right<00:02:26.150> now<00:02:27.140> these<00:02:28.390> scissors<00:02:29.390> are<00:02:29.420> great<00:02:30.260> for

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
right now these scissors are great for

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.970 
right now these scissors are great for
most<00:02:31.310> any<00:02:31.700> kind<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:32.210> paper<00:02:32.540> they<00:02:33.440> don't<00:02:33.470> cut

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
most any kind of paper they don't cut

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.160 
most any kind of paper they don't cut
fabric<00:02:34.250> though<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:35.390> save<00:02:35.660> them<00:02:35.870> for<00:02:36.050> your

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
fabric though you save them for your

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.450 
fabric though you save them for your
paper<00:02:36.440> projects<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:39.590> just<00:02:39.860> can<00:02:40.040> get<00:02:40.220> some

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
paper projects and you just can get some

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.850 
paper projects and you just can get some
really<00:02:40.820> cool<00:02:41.210> effects<00:02:41.900> I'm<00:02:42.230> having<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.590> lot<00:02:42.740> of

really cool effects I'm having a lot of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.370 
really cool effects I'm having a lot of
fun<00:02:43.010> playing<00:02:43.220> with<00:02:43.670> them<00:02:43.910> so<00:02:44.900> let<00:02:45.080> me<00:02:45.170> just

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
fun playing with them so let me just

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.980 
fun playing with them so let me just
speed<00:02:45.680> up<00:02:45.710> the<00:02:46.010> process<00:02:46.550> here<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.540> doesn't

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
speed up the process here it doesn't

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.920 
speed up the process here it doesn't
take<00:02:48.170> long<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:49.010> it's<00:02:49.880> not<00:02:49.970> an<00:02:50.330> exact<00:02:50.750> Oh

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
take long and it's not an exact Oh

science you just get it cut it's just
they're<00:02:58.310> fun<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.580> use<00:02:59.000> I've<00:02:59.330> used<00:02:59.720> them<00:02:59.900> quite

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
they're fun to use I've used them quite

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.430 
they're fun to use I've used them quite
a<00:03:00.260> bit<00:03:00.880> okay<00:03:01.880> so<00:03:02.180> now<00:03:02.630> I<00:03:02.690> have<00:03:02.840> all<00:03:02.990> my<00:03:03.260> little

a bit okay so now I have all my little

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.090 
a bit okay so now I have all my little
fringe<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.280> it's<00:03:04.970> on<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:05.360> fold<00:03:05.660> there<00:03:06.020> see<00:03:06.380> so

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
fringe and it's on the fold there see so

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.250 
fringe and it's on the fold there see so
now<00:03:07.460> we<00:03:07.520> get<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.120> pull<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:09.470> off<00:03:10.990> I'm<00:03:11.990> going<00:03:12.200> to

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
now we get to pull this off I'm going to

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.700 
now we get to pull this off I'm going to
rub<00:03:12.530> that<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.800> little<00:03:13.130> bit<00:03:13.280> there<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:14.360> can<00:03:14.710> get

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
rub that a little bit there so I can get

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.480 
rub that a little bit there so I can get
it<00:03:15.890> started<00:03:16.460> okay<00:03:20.950> then<00:03:21.950> we're<00:03:22.100> just<00:03:22.310> going<00:03:22.460> to

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
it started okay then we're just going to

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.230 
it started okay then we're just going to
start<00:03:22.820> rolling<00:03:23.060> okay<00:03:23.890> so<00:03:24.890> you<00:03:25.670> try<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:25.940> get<00:03:26.120> it

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
start rolling okay so you try to get it

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.500 
start rolling okay so you try to get it
pretty<00:03:26.480> tight<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.350> keep<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.740> fringe

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
pretty tight and to keep the fringe

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.240 
pretty tight and to keep the fringe
straight<00:03:29.510> going<00:03:29.840> up<00:03:30.140> so<00:03:30.350> it<00:03:30.440> doesn't<00:03:30.500> curl<00:03:31.070> in

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
straight going up so it doesn't curl in

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.000 
straight going up so it doesn't curl in
and<00:03:31.430> get<00:03:31.640> caught<00:03:31.910> in<00:03:32.210> that<00:03:32.240> adhesive<00:03:32.810> now<00:03:33.710> with

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
and get caught in that adhesive now with

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.430 
and get caught in that adhesive now with
the<00:03:34.160> tissue<00:03:34.430> paper<00:03:34.610> when<00:03:35.570> I<00:03:35.600> was<00:03:35.840> rolling<00:03:36.110> it

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
the tissue paper when I was rolling it

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.940 
the tissue paper when I was rolling it
that's<00:03:37.130> what's<00:03:37.580> really<00:03:37.850> hard<00:03:38.240> to<00:03:38.630> manage<00:03:39.230> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
that's what's really hard to manage the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
that's what's really hard to manage the
little<00:03:40.310> it's<00:03:40.610> so<00:03:41.000> flimsy<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.290> thin<00:03:42.850> that<00:03:43.850> it

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
little it's so flimsy and thin that it

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.180 
little it's so flimsy and thin that it
wants<00:03:44.240> to<00:03:44.270> curl<00:03:44.630> back<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.140> get<00:03:45.290> caught<00:03:45.560> in<00:03:45.860> the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
wants to curl back and get caught in the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.810 
wants to curl back and get caught in the
in<00:03:46.660> this<00:03:47.660> adhesive<00:03:48.530> here<00:03:48.770> in<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.130> sticky

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
in this adhesive here in the sticky

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.200 
in this adhesive here in the sticky
strip<00:03:50.060> but<00:03:50.960> with<00:03:51.140> this<00:03:51.470> it's<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.490> fuller<00:03:52.760> body

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
strip but with this it's a fuller body

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.990 
strip but with this it's a fuller body
it's<00:03:53.690> got<00:03:54.080> a<00:03:54.110> little<00:03:54.470> bit<00:03:54.680> more<00:03:54.710> stiffness<00:03:55.400> to

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
it's got a little bit more stiffness to

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
it's got a little bit more stiffness to
it<00:03:56.240> and<00:03:56.800> so<00:03:57.800> it<00:03:58.640> makes<00:03:58.820> a<00:03:59.030> really<00:03:59.300> pretty<00:03:59.720> and

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
it and so it makes a really pretty and

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.490 
it and so it makes a really pretty and
easy<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.280> roll<00:04:01.520> up<00:04:01.790> bloom<00:04:02.180> now<00:04:02.990> normally<00:04:03.470> I

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
easy to roll up bloom now normally I

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.010 
easy to roll up bloom now normally I
would<00:04:03.590> have<00:04:03.800> this<00:04:04.190> down<00:04:04.490> probably<00:04:05.330> down<00:04:05.630> here

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
would have this down probably down here

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.050 
would have this down probably down here
doing<00:04:06.350> it<00:04:06.440> but<00:04:06.620> I'm<00:04:06.740> standing<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.400> video<00:04:07.730> so

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
that you can get a good close look okay

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.710 
that you can get a good close look okay
and<00:04:14.900> this<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.980> forgot<00:04:16.670> to<00:04:16.850> measure<00:04:17.090> how<00:04:17.480> long

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
and this I forgot to measure how long

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.440 
and this I forgot to measure how long
the<00:04:17.950> this<00:04:18.950> is<00:04:19.130> at<00:04:19.370> least<00:04:19.400> twelve<00:04:20.060> inches<00:04:20.390> long

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.900 
the this is at least twelve inches long
and<00:04:21.020> that's<00:04:21.680> when<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.370> make<00:04:22.640> it<00:04:22.760> out<00:04:22.850> of

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
and that's when I make it out of

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.260 
and that's when I make it out of
designer<00:04:23.330> paper<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:24.110> cut<00:04:25.070> my<00:04:25.280> strip<00:04:25.610> 12<00:04:25.910> inches

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270

in<00:04:28.940> half<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.600> then<00:04:30.340> cut<00:04:31.340> with<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.580> fringe

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
in half and then cut with the fringe

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.940 
in half and then cut with the fringe
after<00:04:32.330> I<00:04:32.360> adhere<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.020> two<00:04:33.260> open<00:04:33.770> ends
