00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.110 
see the hijacked boat off in the
distance<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.040> we're<00:00:44.160> playing<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> island

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
distance so we're playing on the island

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.700 
distance so we're playing on the island
that<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:45.660> from<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> hijack<00:00:46.440> boat

and from this island you can see the
hijack<00:00:48.660> boat<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.379> thought<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.010> pretty

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
hijack boat so I thought that was pretty

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.430 
hijack boat so I thought that was pretty
cool<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> devs<00:00:50.789> put<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.600> yeah

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
cool that the devs put that in and yeah

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.689 
cool that the devs put that in and yeah
it's<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.649> kind<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.980> cool<00:00:53.160> little<00:00:53.280> easter

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it's just kind of a cool little easter

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.610 
it's just kind of a cool little easter
egg<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.059> am<00:00:54.629> i<00:00:54.690> talking<00:00:54.930> about<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.199> map<00:00:55.379> why

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
egg so am i talking about this map why

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.250 
egg so am i talking about this map why
did<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.890> say<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.160> was<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.760> crazy<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.719> chaotic

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
did I say it was so crazy and so chaotic

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.590 
did I say it was so crazy and so chaotic
well<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.160> reason<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.640> because<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.149> map<00:01:00.359> is

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
well the reason is because this map is

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.959 
well the reason is because this map is
pretty<00:01:00.960> much<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.379> perfect<00:01:02.070> circle<00:01:02.640> which<00:01:02.820> we

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
pretty much a perfect circle which we

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.640 
pretty much a perfect circle which we
really<00:01:03.210> haven't<00:01:03.629> seen<00:01:03.809> much<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.080> Calder<00:01:04.500> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
really haven't seen much in Calder you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.350 
really haven't seen much in Calder you
know<00:01:04.769> normally<00:01:05.309> maps<00:01:05.549> have<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:05.970> four<00:01:06.240> or

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
know normally maps have like four or

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.750 
know normally maps have like four or
five<00:01:06.390> six<00:01:06.930> corners<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.500> them<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.159> yeah<00:01:08.549> this

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
five six corners on them but yeah this

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.310 
five six corners on them but yeah this
one<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.000> pretty<00:01:09.330> much<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> perfect<00:01:09.869> circle

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
one is pretty much a perfect circle

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.690 
one is pretty much a perfect circle
there<00:01:10.439> are<00:01:10.560> no<00:01:10.770> corners<00:01:11.189> which<00:01:11.340> means<00:01:11.520> there's

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
there are no corners which means there's

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.250 
there are no corners which means there's
no<00:01:11.790> corners<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.299> campers<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> camp<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.140> which

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
no corners for campers to camp in which

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
no corners for campers to camp in which
is<00:01:13.500> good<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.610> also<00:01:14.850> means<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
is good but it also means that the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.719 
is good but it also means that the
center<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> map<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.530> chaos<00:01:17.460> because

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
center of the map is chaos because

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.190 
center of the map is chaos because
people<00:01:18.119> are<00:01:18.210> spawning<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.780> around<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
people are spawning all around the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.899 
people are spawning all around the
outside<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> circle<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.310> there's<00:01:20.759> only

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
outside of the circle and there's only

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.670 
outside of the circle and there's only
one<00:01:21.240> way<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> go<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.049> towards<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
one way to go and that's towards the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.960 
one way to go and that's towards the
center<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.070> map<00:01:23.250> unless<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.670> want<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> try

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
center of the map unless you want to try

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.609 
center of the map unless you want to try
to<00:01:24.030> Franklin<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.659> most<00:01:25.049> people<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.470> run

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
to Franklin but most people just run

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.590 
to Franklin but most people just run
towards<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> center<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> map<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
towards the center of the map and and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
towards the center of the map and and
that<00:01:27.750> makes<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.049> chaos<00:01:28.500> especially<00:01:29.130> when

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that makes for chaos especially when

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.740 
that makes for chaos especially when
you're<00:01:29.369> playing<00:01:29.520> objective<00:01:30.210> game<00:01:30.450> types

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you're playing objective game types

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.749 
you're playing objective game types
because<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.409> V<00:01:31.560> nomination<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.220> right<00:01:32.579> in

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
because like V nomination is right in

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.429 
because like V nomination is right in
the<00:01:32.909> center<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.390> searching<00:01:34.140> destroy

the center you know searching destroy

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.749 
the center you know searching destroy
bomb<00:01:34.650> sites<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.490> center<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
bomb sites are right in the center I

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.340 
bomb sites are right in the center I
should<00:01:35.909> say<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.299> absolutely<00:01:36.450> insane<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.140> do

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
should say it's absolutely insane you do

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.960 
should say it's absolutely insane you do
have<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.740> down<00:01:37.979> plane<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> center<00:01:38.909> of

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
have this down plane in the center of

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.490 
have this down plane in the center of
the<00:01:39.030> map<00:01:39.180> which<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.810> little<00:01:40.049> bit<00:01:40.140> useful<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
the map which is a little bit useful to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.990 
the map which is a little bit useful to
use<00:01:40.650> cover<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.070> know<00:01:41.189> fight<00:01:41.460> off<00:01:41.610> enemies

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
use cover you know fight off enemies

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880 
use cover you know fight off enemies
that<00:01:42.119> are<00:01:42.180> coming<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.659> from<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> outside<00:01:42.960> but

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that are coming in from the outside but

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.520 
that are coming in from the outside but
it's<00:01:44.100> overall<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
it's overall it's kind of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.780 
it's overall it's kind of
disadvantageous<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> center<00:01:47.579> just

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
disadvantageous to be in the center just

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.490 
disadvantageous to be in the center just
because<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.689> hard<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.140> hold<00:01:49.259> down

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
because it's so hard to hold down

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.139 
because it's so hard to hold down
because<00:01:49.740> there's<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:49.979> eight<00:01:50.250> ten<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.119> know

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
because there's like eight ten you know

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.660 
because there's like eight ten you know
twenty<00:01:51.689> maybe<00:01:51.869> different<00:01:52.799> ways<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
twenty maybe different ways that the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.830 
twenty maybe different ways that the
enemies<00:01:53.939> could<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.210> coming<00:01:54.509> from<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
enemies could be coming from and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.760 
enemies could be coming from and
shooting<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.170> from<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.530> there's<00:01:55.649> different

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
shooting you from and there's different

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.980 
shooting you from and there's different
balconies<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> ridges<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.420> snipers<00:01:57.869> will

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
balconies and ridges that snipers will

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.109 
balconies and ridges that snipers will
be<00:01:58.079> sitting<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:59.460> insane<00:01:59.939> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
be sitting on it's just it's insane to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.370 
be sitting on it's just it's insane to
try<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> hold<00:02:00.659> down<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> center<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.259> map

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
try to hold down the center of the map

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.870 
try to hold down the center of the map
and<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.619> makes<00:02:01.770> objective<00:02:02.219> game<00:02:02.369> types<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.729> lot

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and it makes objective game types a lot

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.850 
and it makes objective game types a lot
of<00:02:03.000> fun<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.360> said<00:02:03.570> domination<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.680> dumb
