00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:05.350
 scientists consider that humanity is the result of the evolution of a 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.350
 daily worm between the increase in 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.929
 known as the mini say if they would have been the first humans 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.830
 which originated in Africa almost seven million years ago 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.419
 well before that time they repeat the giants inhabited the earth 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.930
 was one of the dinosaurs 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.400
 they would have lived about 200 million years ago 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.510
 the peak of its feet that occurred in other Jurassic and Cretaceous periods 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.100
 still today show of these animals are found in the four corners of the earth 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.700
 archaeologists go to great lengths to discover the past and civilizations 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.690
 over the years 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.240
 and then stop at museums all over the world 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.650
 as in the biblical archeology museum paulo bora 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.900
 located in the field of dunes large generous with it anterior de sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.370
 since its inauguration ten years ago 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.000
 the museum awakens attention for being the only one in Latin America medicated in 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.050
 biblical theology his collection contains rare pieces kate has been with the context 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.560
 as the history of mankind 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.320
 according to the bea the bernhard archeologist and robot time 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.550
 it is possible that one day the biblical museum will receive part of dinosaurs to compose 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.950
 your partner but the museum's hypothesis has in its collection 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.710
 I can hominid that the hominid is discarded 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.700
 would be a face with respect for man 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.270
 which does not exist 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.810
 So 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.200
 there would be no 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.150
 pressure to try to bind the hominids into the process of 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.600
 job creation so if you work the same through the website of your 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.950
 feelings of concrete composites 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.270
 do not find it with your concrete that is half meta-new aguilar monkey 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.650
 says that two great scientists affirmed in 1956 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.390
 that the Neanderthal man does not exist 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.940
 because ours do not belong to a person who has gone through a process 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.200
 selective 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.999
 this end 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.069
 someone who is a victim of a degenerative disease, the producer explains 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.069
 we are broke 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.569
 from England 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.620
 the two only through studies reached a conclusion mainly 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.859
 first with the doctor this myth 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.259
 he analyzed the efforts 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.439
 and I think 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.789
 do not correspond with their intermediaries 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.119
 to be at one point in common with Bern 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:37.540
 that your bones are 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.759
 of graduates 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.989
 the expert said that a major event recorded in the bible 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.829
 was responsible for the demise of several Libyan servants gathered and 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:48.739
 mental 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.909
 the only way to spray 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.570
 the process was initiated 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.990
 it is through a catastrophic attempt 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.709
 as they do not exist and the bible speaks of a drought catastrophic and heavy event 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.879
 it would be great to see the heart persistence many goals 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.639
 other evidence of the existence of dinosaurs in that 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.339
 on the other hand 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.609
 little dinosaurs this year impressions 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.929
 impressions that are considered also to be right and the footprints 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:20.849
 there are fossil footprints along with human screens 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:28.129
 this indicates that I like dinosaurs with insisting taste does not have millions 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:33.039
 of years so he did not in the previous moments with the flood along with 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.449
 your layout
