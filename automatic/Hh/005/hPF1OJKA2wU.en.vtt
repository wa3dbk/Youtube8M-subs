00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
touched so many people's lives in a

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.480 
touched so many people's lives in a
positive<00:00:23.000> way<00:00:23.570> has<00:00:24.440> been<00:00:24.619> a<00:00:24.650> huge<00:00:25.099> surprise

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
positive way has been a huge surprise

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.320 
positive way has been a huge surprise
and<00:00:25.520> even<00:00:26.180> bigger<00:00:27.020> reward<00:00:27.610> for<00:00:28.610> for<00:00:29.060> me

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.190 
and even bigger reward for for me
definitely

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.410 

I<00:00:33.290> think<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.100> flashbacks<00:00:34.790> are<00:00:35.000> popular

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
I think the flashbacks are popular

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.760 
I think the flashbacks are popular
because<00:00:35.570> they<00:00:36.910> they<00:00:37.910> allow<00:00:38.210> for<00:00:38.240> a<00:00:39.140> bird's-eye

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
because they they allow for a bird's-eye

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.590 
because they they allow for a bird's-eye
view<00:00:42.430> for<00:00:43.430> each<00:00:43.520> of<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.730> characters<00:00:44.210> I<00:00:44.240> mean

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
view for each of the characters I mean

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.960 
view for each of the characters I mean
we<00:00:44.720> you<00:00:45.230> you<00:00:45.440> have<00:00:45.740> you<00:00:46.280> have<00:00:46.430> such<00:00:46.640> amazing

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
we you you have you have such amazing

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.610

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
actors and such amazing writers that

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.470 
actors and such amazing writers that
create<00:00:51.620> such<00:00:51.890> memorable<00:00:52.309> moments<00:00:53.000> for<00:00:53.390> each

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
create such memorable moments for each

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.820 
create such memorable moments for each
of<00:00:53.630> these<00:00:53.720> characters<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.200> so<00:00:54.410> when<00:00:54.559> you<00:00:54.650> go

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
of these characters and so when you go

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.440 
of these characters and so when you go
to<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:55.040> flashbacks<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:55.880> you<00:00:55.970> get<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.210> sort<00:00:56.390> of

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
to the flashbacks and you get to sort of

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.340 
to the flashbacks and you get to sort of
see<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:59.800> where<00:01:00.800> this<00:01:00.950> character<00:01:01.190> comes<00:01:01.640> from

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
see the where this character comes from

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.200 
see the where this character comes from
you<00:01:03.350> as<00:01:03.800> an<00:01:03.980> audience<00:01:04.129> member<00:01:04.460> become<00:01:05.000> more

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
you as an audience member become more

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.290 
you as an audience member become more
invested<00:01:05.479> in<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:05.780> character<00:01:06.170> obviously<00:01:07.300> but

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
invested in the character obviously but

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.480 
invested in the character obviously but
then<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:10.790> flashbacks<00:01:11.360> humanized<00:01:11.960> the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
then the flashbacks humanized the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.630 
then the flashbacks humanized the
characters<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.790> lot<00:01:14.119> more<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:15.500> it<00:01:15.890> really<00:01:16.340> aids

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
characters a lot more so it really aids

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.680 
characters a lot more so it really aids
in<00:01:17.000> this<00:01:17.150> in<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.479> overall<00:01:18.160> storytelling<00:01:19.160> of

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
in this in the overall storytelling of

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
in this in the overall storytelling of
orange<00:01:20.690> is<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.780> new<00:01:20.960> black<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.410> of<00:01:21.530> the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
orange is the new black and of the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.040 
orange is the new black and of the
prisoners<00:01:22.130> because<00:01:22.400> you<00:01:22.550> it<00:01:23.330> humanizes<00:01:23.750> them

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
prisoners because you it humanizes them

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.690 
prisoners because you it humanizes them
in<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.259> way<00:01:24.410> I<00:01:24.440> think<00:01:24.710> people<00:01:24.920> begin<00:01:25.460> to<00:01:25.490> see

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
in the way I think people begin to see

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.859 
in the way I think people begin to see
themselves<00:01:25.880> in<00:01:26.479> these<00:01:27.200> characters

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.399 

the<00:01:31.229> show<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.590> built<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> episodic<00:01:32.490> format

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
the show is built in the episodic format

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.460 
the show is built in the episodic format
so<00:01:34.409> each<00:01:34.890> episode<00:01:35.640> builds<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.140> next

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so each episode builds on the next

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.139 
so each episode builds on the next
episode<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> you're<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.430> sort<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.640> waiting

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
episode and you're just sort of waiting

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.060 
episode and you're just sort of waiting
with<00:01:39.360> bated<00:01:40.079> breath<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.710> what's<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:41.039> to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
with bated breath but what's going to

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.039 
with bated breath but what's going to
happen<00:01:41.399> in<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.549> next<00:01:41.700> episode<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.630> then

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
happen in the next episode and and then

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.569 
happen in the next episode and and then
when<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> final<00:01:43.979> episode<00:01:44.399> you

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
when you get to the final episode you

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.210 
when you get to the final episode you
think<00:01:44.759> what's<00:01:45.180> gonna<00:01:45.600> happen<00:01:46.229> next<00:01:46.409> season

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.630 
think what's gonna happen next season
and<00:01:47.399> then<00:01:47.520> everyone<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:49.009> now<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:50.460> they

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and then everyone is just as now as they

are now just anxious about what is going
to<00:01:53.310> happen<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.789> it<00:01:53.880> creates<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.799> huge

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
to happen so it creates this huge

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.880

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
think we we realized how bored we were

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.970 
think we we realized how bored we were
maybe<00:02:10.720> with<00:02:10.959> seeing<00:02:11.170> each<00:02:11.290> other<00:02:11.440> in<00:02:11.620> prison
