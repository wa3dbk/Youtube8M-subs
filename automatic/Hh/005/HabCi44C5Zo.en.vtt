00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
we do and to be honest I think that's

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.120 
we do and to be honest I think that's
interesting<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:24.900> two<00:00:24.930> reasons<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.529> because

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
interesting for two reasons one because

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
little we actually think about money and

little we actually think about money and
two<00:00:30.510> because<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> propose<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.830> most<00:00:32.759> people

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.910 
the money was coming from I was able to
just<00:01:39.450> book<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.840> first<00:01:40.020> flight<00:01:40.320> out<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.680> day

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
just book the first flight out that day

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.080 
just book the first flight out that day
so<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.460> don't<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:41.729> about<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.060> money

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
so if we don't think about the money

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.639 
so if we don't think about the money
going<00:01:42.360> into<00:01:42.720> our<00:01:42.810> bank<00:01:42.930> account<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.470> don't

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
going into our bank account and we don't

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.960 
going into our bank account and we don't
think<00:01:43.770> about<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.100> money<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.490> out<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.880> our

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
think about the money going out of our

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.270 
think about the money going out of our
bank<00:01:45.149> account<00:01:45.450> why<00:01:45.899> aren't<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.110> broke<00:01:46.290> mostly

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
bank account why aren't we broke mostly

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.130 
bank account why aren't we broke mostly
because<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.970> only<00:01:48.240> spend<00:01:48.600> money<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
because we only spend money on the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.990 
because we only spend money on the
things<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.710> actually<00:01:49.860> need<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.670> more

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
things that we actually need and more

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.520 
things that we actually need and more
importantly<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.899> things<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.320> actually

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
importantly the things that we actually

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.649 
importantly the things that we actually
want<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.670> don't<00:01:53.790> save<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.060> high<00:01:54.180> percentage<00:01:54.540> of

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
want we don't save a high percentage of

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.090 
want we don't save a high percentage of
our<00:01:54.720> income<00:01:54.930> because<00:01:55.350> we've<00:01:55.500> gotten<00:01:55.829> really

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
our income because we've gotten really

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.590 
our income because we've gotten really
good<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.460> budgeting<00:01:56.610> we've<00:01:57.030> gotten<00:01:57.360> really

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
good at budgeting we've gotten really

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.300 
good at budgeting we've gotten really
good<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:57.869> knowing<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:58.950> makes<00:01:59.189> us

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
good at knowing what really makes us

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.889 
good at knowing what really makes us
happy<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.820> when<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.149> do<00:02:00.270> spend<00:02:00.479> money<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:00.810> do

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
happy and when we do spend money we do

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.660 
happy and when we do spend money we do
so<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> way<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> most<00:02:02.159> value

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
so in a way that we get the most value

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.789 
so in a way that we get the most value
out<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.969> each<00:02:03.119> dollar<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.960> find<00:02:04.200> creative

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
out of each dollar we find creative

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.620 
out of each dollar we find creative
methods<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.430> getting<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.790> same<00:02:06.000> things<00:02:06.329> for

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
methods of getting the same things for

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.300 
methods of getting the same things for
cheaper<00:02:06.960> than<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> conventional

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
cheaper than a conventional

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.820 
cheaper than a conventional
we<00:02:08.580> buy<00:02:08.819> quality<00:02:09.539> used<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.379> repairable

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
we buy quality used and repairable

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.000 
we buy quality used and repairable
products<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:12.300> devise<00:02:12.569> win-win<00:02:13.110> situations<00:02:13.800> to

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
also a subtle difference in the way that

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.259 
also a subtle difference in the way that
