the<00:01:57.090> line<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.450> scrimmage<00:01:57.540> should<00:01:58.409> open<00:01:59.219> up

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the line of scrimmage should open up

the line of scrimmage should open up
some<00:01:59.399> opportunities<00:01:59.939> from<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> florida

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
some opportunities from the florida

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.520 
some opportunities from the florida
state<00:02:00.540> seminoles<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.020> think<00:02:01.200> head-to-head

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
state seminoles and I think head-to-head

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.080 
state seminoles and I think head-to-head
ej<00:02:01.829> manuel<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.219> better<00:02:02.399> quarterback<00:02:02.670> right

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
ej manuel is a better quarterback right

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.700 
ej manuel is a better quarterback right
now<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.360> Jeff<00:02:03.540> Driskel<00:02:03.899> Driscoll's<00:02:04.439> coming

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
off of this injury as Jimbo Fisher said

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.029 
off of this injury as Jimbo Fisher said
earlier<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.049> week<00:02:07.229> all<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.740> injuries

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
earlier this week all of the injuries

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.830 
earlier this week all of the injuries
will<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.459> kind<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.640> go<00:02:08.819> away<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.390> week<00:02:09.629> all

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
will just kind of go away this week all

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.839 
will just kind of go away this week all
the<00:02:09.989> aches<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.379> pains<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.310> head-to-head<00:02:11.819> I

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
the aches and pains but a head-to-head I

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.400 
the aches and pains but a head-to-head I
think<00:02:12.090> EJ's<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> better<00:02:12.660> quarterback<00:02:12.930> now

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
think EJ's a better quarterback now

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.750 
think EJ's a better quarterback now
that<00:02:13.500> being<00:02:13.680> said<00:02:13.920> keep<00:02:14.340> an<00:02:14.460> eye<00:02:14.550> out<00:02:14.580> for

hopefully Florida State though can get

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.100 
hopefully Florida State though can get
Driscoll<00:02:26.940> down<00:02:27.120> early<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.480> often<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.960> one

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
Driscoll down early and often the one

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.300 
Driscoll down early and often the one
thing<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.320> defense<00:02:28.440> has<00:02:28.770> been<00:02:28.800> great<00:02:29.070> at<00:02:29.190> this

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
thing the defense has been great at this
