homie though which is very good for
Morty<00:00:30.660> since<00:00:30.810> he<00:00:30.900> did<00:00:31.019> not<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.260> breaker<00:00:31.529> I

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.740 

don't<00:00:35.489> know<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:35.700> Detroit<00:00:36.210> was<00:00:36.420> doing<00:00:36.630> with

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
don't know what Detroit was doing with

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.490 
don't know what Detroit was doing with
that<00:00:36.840> close<00:00:37.170> up<00:00:37.410> stuff<00:00:38.840> Morty<00:00:39.840> I'm<00:00:40.020> not<00:00:40.320> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that close up stuff Morty I'm not to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.150 
that close up stuff Morty I'm not to
cancel<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.329> low<00:00:42.329> into<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.660> cartwheel<00:00:43.160> right

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
cancel that low into the cartwheel right

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.440 
cancel that low into the cartwheel right
now<00:00:44.340> according<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:44.969> Mark<00:00:45.149> told<00:00:45.270> me

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
now according to what Mark told me

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.779 
now according to what Mark told me
actually<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.140> double<00:00:46.920> fist<00:00:47.129> has<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> slightly

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
actually the double fist has a slightly

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.979 
actually the double fist has a slightly
slightly<00:00:48.210> more<00:00:48.450> advantage<00:00:48.780> than<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
slightly more advantage than the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.479 
slightly more advantage than the
cartwheels<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> mix<00:00:50.129> ups<00:00:50.250> are<00:00:50.340> slightly

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
cartwheels so the mix ups are slightly

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.630 
cartwheels so the mix ups are slightly
different<00:00:51.590> okay<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.739> makes<00:00:52.920> sense<00:00:52.980> you'll

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
different okay that makes sense you'll

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.010 
different okay that makes sense you'll
notice<00:00:53.850> he<00:00:53.910> tried<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.600> dive<00:00:54.780> kick

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
notice he tried to go for a dive kick

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.090 
notice he tried to go for a dive kick
immediately<00:00:55.410> afterwards

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
immediately afterwards

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.439 
immediately afterwards
looks<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.640> Detroit<00:00:56.910> snuffed<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.300> with

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
looks like Detroit snuffed it out with

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.580 
looks like Detroit snuffed it out with
that<00:00:57.570> jump<00:00:57.750> kick<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.170> idea<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.559> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
that jump kick but the idea is if you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.810 
that jump kick but the idea is if you
would<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.859> tried<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.039> down<00:00:59.250> three<00:00:59.520> or<00:00:59.670> down

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
would have tried a down three or down

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.459 
would have tried a down three or down
anything<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.719> figured<00:01:00.750> stuff<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.350> got<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
anything so I figured stuff that got a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.290 
anything so I figured stuff that got a
full<00:01:01.649> combo<00:01:01.829> whereas<00:01:02.670> that's<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.210> an

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
full combo whereas that's not really an

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.390 
full combo whereas that's not really an
option<00:01:03.420> after<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.290> cartwheel<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.860> don't

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
option after the the cartwheel I don't

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.789 
option after the the cartwheel I don't
think<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.479> more<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.960> using<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> e<00:01:07.409> expert

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
think I like more to using the e expert

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.320 
think I like more to using the e expert
role<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.040> wake<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.340> against<00:01:08.640> Detroit<00:01:09.090> just

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
role on wake up against Detroit just

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.670 
role on wake up against Detroit just
because<00:01:09.570> Detroit<00:01:09.810> knows<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.350> coming

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
because Detroit knows it's coming

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
because Detroit knows it's coming
I<00:01:10.830> think<00:01:11.760> Morty<00:01:12.000> should<00:01:12.150> wait<00:01:12.330> until<00:01:12.479> Detroit

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
I think Morty should wait until Detroit

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.560 
I think Morty should wait until Detroit
pressures<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.500> wake<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.070> venues<00:01:14.430> ideas

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.090 

rigor<00:01:18.570> there<00:01:18.780> by<00:01:18.990> Detroit

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
rigor there by Detroit

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.920 
rigor there by Detroit
although<00:01:20.939> Kingston<00:01:21.360> without<00:01:21.570> meter<00:01:21.810> is

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
although Kingston without meter is

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.320 
although Kingston without meter is
definitely<00:01:22.320> limited<00:01:22.409> his<00:01:22.710> combos<00:01:23.040> damage

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
definitely limited his combos damage

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
definitely limited his combos damage
yeah<00:01:24.330> he<00:01:24.479> doesn't<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.810> bar<00:01:25.020> he<00:01:25.170> doesn't

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
yeah he doesn't have a bar he doesn't

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.880 
yeah he doesn't have a bar he doesn't
really<00:01:25.439> get<00:01:25.590> much<00:01:25.650> damage<00:01:26.070> off<00:01:26.159> anything

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
really get much damage off anything

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.080 
really get much damage off anything
although<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.400> pressure<00:01:29.640> game<00:01:29.880> it's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
although with that pressure game it's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.490 
although with that pressure game it's
not<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.750> don't<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:30.990> he<00:01:31.140> wants<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.380> get

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
not really I don't think he wants to get

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.539 
not really I don't think he wants to get
that<00:01:31.560> kiss<00:01:31.890> off<00:01:33.500> no<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:35.009> he's<00:01:35.100> kind<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.310> try<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that kiss off no but he's kind of try to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.520 
that kiss off no but he's kind of try to
get<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.930> time<00:01:36.930> take<00:01:37.079> your<00:01:37.110> time<00:01:37.229> getting

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
get that time take your time getting

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.120 
get that time take your time getting
