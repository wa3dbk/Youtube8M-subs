day<00:02:09.720> 5<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.379> day<00:02:11.310> for<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.940> know<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.599> basics

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
day 5 and a day for you know the basics

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.180 
day 5 and a day for you know the basics
in<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.370> manufacturing<00:02:15.060> process<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:16.190> yeah

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
in that manufacturing process and yeah

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.330 
in that manufacturing process and yeah
Apple<00:02:18.060> base<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.420> saying<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:19.040> something<00:02:20.040> is

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
Apple base is saying that something is

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.580 
Apple base is saying that something is
copying<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.820> look<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.270> feel<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.780> basically

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
copying the look and feel and basically

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.740 
copying the look and feel and basically
what<00:02:22.740> you<00:02:22.860> mean<00:02:23.040> with<00:02:23.220> look<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:23.820> obviously<00:02:24.360> how

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
what you mean with look is obviously how

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.770 
what you mean with look is obviously how
looked<00:02:25.020> like<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:26.160> UI<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.970> yeah<00:02:27.570> that

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
looked like and the UI and yeah that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.140 
looked like and the UI and yeah that
could<00:02:27.900> also<00:02:28.020> be<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.350> feel<00:02:28.530> but<00:02:28.820> they<00:02:29.820> are

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
could also be the feel but they are

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.090 
could also be the feel but they are
basically<00:02:30.390> saying<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.750> something<00:02:31.170> isn't<00:02:31.560> you

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
basically saying the something isn't you

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.710 
basically saying the something isn't you
know<00:02:32.130> innovating<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.940> developing<00:02:33.510> their<00:02:33.690> own

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
know innovating and developing their own

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.890 
know innovating and developing their own
technology<00:02:34.110> with<00:02:34.980> their<00:02:35.640> own<00:02:35.900> channel

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
technology with their own channel

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.680 
technology with their own channel
sampling<00:02:37.200> style<00:02:37.560> for<00:02:38.490> their<00:02:38.760> smartphones<00:02:39.360> and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
sampling style for their smartphones and

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.410 
sampling style for their smartphones and
tablets<00:02:40.170> but<00:02:40.470> they're<00:02:40.830> copying<00:02:41.340> Apple<00:02:41.790> their

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
tablets but they're copying Apple their

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.160 
tablets but they're copying Apple their
UI<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.680> they're<00:02:44.160> cool<00:02:44.790> style<00:02:45.209> apples<00:02:45.750> doing

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
UI and they're cool style apples doing

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.520 
UI and they're cool style apples doing
and<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:47.520> know<00:02:47.640> Apple<00:02:48.300> they<00:02:48.540> doesn't<00:02:49.170> like

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
and you know Apple they doesn't like

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.910 
and you know Apple they doesn't like
that<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.760> think<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.570> good<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.320> Apple<00:02:52.800> is

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
that and I think it's good that Apple is

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.740 
that and I think it's good that Apple is
doing<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:54.030> going<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.270> be<00:02:54.390> fun<00:02:54.600> to

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
doing this and it's going to be fun to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.030 
doing this and it's going to be fun to
see<00:02:54.870> what<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:56.040> going<00:02:56.520> to<00:02:56.550> happen<00:02:57.209> but<00:02:57.650> yeah<00:02:58.650> so

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
see what is going to happen but yeah so

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.979 
see what is going to happen but yeah so
do<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.520> think<00:02:59.580> that<00:03:00.030> something<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.480> copying

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
do you think that something is copying

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.280 
do you think that something is copying
Apple<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.760> know<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:02.940> if<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.660> don't<00:03:03.840> do<00:03:04.080> it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
Apple you know you if you don't do it

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.070 
Apple you know you if you don't do it
well<00:03:05.040> then<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:06.030> must<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.450> something<00:03:06.660> pretty

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
well then you must have something pretty

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.410 
well then you must have something pretty
good<00:03:07.200> say<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.190> comment<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.850> let<00:03:09.420> me<00:03:09.510> know<00:03:09.660> see
