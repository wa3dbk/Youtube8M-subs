00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.540
 Cruel was the fate and infamous fate 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.000
 What sorrow did you suffer? 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.660
 The sentence was yours 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.580
 and the crime of mine. 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.160
 Silence replaces harmony. 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.000
 But in your stupor, 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.480
 I'm sending you a song. 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.920
 And I'll keep you company. 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.500
 So that you finally find deep sleep, 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.140
 rocked by this sweet melody. 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.520
 One day, a pony to the sun 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.660
 saw his kingdom and sighed. 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.160
 She smiles and says: there is no pony 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.240
 more loved and as blessed as me. 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.660
 So great was his reign, 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.340
 so famous was his glory 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.660
 So long was the shadow she projected 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.080
 That she plunged her dear little sister into the dark 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.540
 and darkens again as time passes. 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.460
 This pony ends up seeing 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.000
 that his subjects did not render his due to his sister. 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.460
 She did not like it either 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.800
 as she deserved 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.060
 she saw her drowning in 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.260
 a deep misfortune. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.640
 But this is how fame proceeds; 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.060
 she gently intoxicates the soul 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.940
 of the one she lives. 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.180
 Blinded by her brilliance, 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.200
 she could not prevent 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.580
 that the one she loved the most would be destroyed. 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.920
 Rest yourself princess, good night little sister 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.560
 in the glow of the moon that flares you. 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.060
 Wear him my lullaby, winds of the earth 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.200
 It crosses time and space. 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.080
 Bring the freshness of the night too. 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.120
 and with her all my regrets. 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.240
 Luna, I love you more 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.940
 that you do not believe it. 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.660
 May you in peace remain. 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.820
 And forgive me for my blindness. 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.960
 All these years before us ... 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.440
 Are to be feared, I believe it. 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.640
 I never imagined 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.460
 face them without you. 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.500
 May this thousand winters 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.820
 Go in a flash. 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.640
 I loved you. 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.980
 I miss you so much. 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.920
 You are so far from Earth ... 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:53.040
 May all your dreams be sweet tonight. 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.540
 Safe and sound in the moonlight 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.320
 who is your bed. 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.800
 That you do not know the suffering 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.980
 Neither fear. 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.180
 And in my dreams, I will fly 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.060
 to see you, my sister. 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.560
 Dors ... 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.380
 Dors ... 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:39.540
 Dors ... 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.280
 Thank you for watching!!!
