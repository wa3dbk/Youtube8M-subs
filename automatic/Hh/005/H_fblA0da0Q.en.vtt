looks<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.600> mix<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> normal<00:01:19.470> slam<00:01:19.710> van

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
looks like a mix of the normal slam van

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.460 
looks like a mix of the normal slam van
as<00:01:20.159> well<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:21.270> hearse<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.140> kind<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
as well as a hearse it's kind of like a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.590 
as well as a hearse it's kind of like a
mix<00:01:22.680> between<00:01:22.740> those<00:01:23.189> two<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> don't<00:01:24.479> know<00:01:24.570> I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.910 
mix between those two so I don't know I
think<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> would<00:01:25.290> look<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> little<00:01:25.590> bit<00:01:25.799> better

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
think it would look a little bit better

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.649 
think it would look a little bit better
if<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.520> had<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> different<00:01:27.090> paint<00:01:27.270> job<00:01:27.479> or

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
if like you had a different paint job or

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.600 
if like you had a different paint job or
something<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:29.009> obviously<00:01:29.159> we

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
something like that but obviously we

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.520 
something like that but obviously we
cannot<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.329> because<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.110> capture

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
cannot do that because this is a capture

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.620 
cannot do that because this is a capture
mission<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:32.549> if<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.759> guys<00:01:32.880> figure<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.329> how

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
mission but if you guys figure out how

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.020 
mission but if you guys figure out how
to<00:01:33.689> get<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.710> online<00:01:34.950> or<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.670> figure<00:01:35.939> out

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
to get this in online or if I figure out

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.310 
to get this in online or if I figure out
how<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> I'll<00:01:36.479> make<00:01:36.509> sure<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.780> tell<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.170> guys
