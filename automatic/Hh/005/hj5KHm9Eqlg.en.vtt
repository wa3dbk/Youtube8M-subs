 of their own fashions and therefore also 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.090
 many fashions tutorials 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.970
 today we have a very particular fashion 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.450
 that before had never been released for 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.579
 minecraft version 1.5.1 this 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.409
 model the zeppelin 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.960
 already because its name has changed now 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.729
 he calls to aircraft in fact from already 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.270
 will take was only for the versions 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.430
 2 kraft old now my day e 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.140
 so me to show the only one while 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.600
 block that adds this to the world 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.110
 pixies that serves to fly 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.930
 meanwhile seacraft col composes the same 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.909
 table form of cates ministers of 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.420
 rafah obsidian blanket in the part 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.210
 low a gold block in the middle next 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.580
 at the golden block two forward is sober 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.299
 for crown 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:12.010
 so after building a structure 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:15.010
 must be absolutely must not 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.049
 touch the ground built duty 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.599
 this small bilic built structure 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.810
 to show you the block is positioned 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:26.650
 above this structure right click e 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:30.579
 turn the tiago blog this is formed 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.510
 structure the recognized and will tell you by 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:39.040
 me for example doctors 77 blocks because 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.500
 336 plus the block of the dl pixies 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.819
 now there are no need to move 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.200
 the darts 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.730
 in fact if we try again we would say about the proofs 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.190
 to move with darts and not there 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.480
 I can't even jump by moving with it 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.269
 then numeric pad next to it 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.200
 right and where there was numbers from 1 to 9 with 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.579
 the one goes on we look hospitable ok 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.650
 see that we are moving forward 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:10.629
 hello paul hello we stop with the 5 there yes 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.849
 stop all options already untapped 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:17.199
 put with 7 you move to the right 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.900
 to the left turn left into 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:21.900
 practice with 9 to the right 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:31.510
 see we do this ambiguous pole with 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:33.310
 5 c we stop blanket you go back me 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.359
 I forgot to mention in fact we are 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.340
 going backwards 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:40.930
 ok call call 4 go to the left 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.440
 look we are moving towards 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.130
 left towards which other stamp 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.060
 is 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:54.160
 with five we use some stop 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.160
 right with if instead you go to the right 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:02.540
 see so now enough with the parts yes 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.590
 instead he goes up instead 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.930
 the other that without quota is the 2 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.440
 the match we stop with 2 instead we go 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.440
 downward 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.970
 we are now coming down a catch on the names 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.459
 crash with the ground after to stop 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.150
 you wind enough still with col 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.560
 right click on this pixies and silvio 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.760
 of the world and we cannot move with the 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.970
 darts at the beginning during the flight le 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:36.190
 the blocks will be twisted ie it is not 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:39.230
 normal shape instead when we stop 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.630
 this machines there is this notepad 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.480
 we will stop the dinner blocks from flying 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.430
 however, they will do this with this 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.110
 so it is very useful because you can 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.740
 build many beautiful structures 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.050
 as ray ask and you can fly then 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.410
 it is something that there was no minecraft ed 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.530
 it's very nice so you can create them 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.150
 of the structures to your liking e 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.410
 then I advise him in short to 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.740
 combine them together with another mode that the 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.040
 better da jobs that we will naturally do 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.040
 to see 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.580
 that I'll show you nothing because this 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.430
 base dungeons adds castles from 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.690
 strip of dungeons precisely and also 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.610
 of planes 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.030
 you were naturally not flying though 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.280
 to the structures manors and ships and therefore 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.710
 you can do some pirate life 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.720
 from corsair and going around the 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.910
 world to beat then there are also mobs 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.880
 inside these dungeons and therefore it is a lot 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.000
 beautiful paired with the dungeon beat 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.690
 now for this way it's all at 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.690
 next hello
