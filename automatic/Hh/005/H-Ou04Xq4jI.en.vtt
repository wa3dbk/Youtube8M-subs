00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.610 
and ball socket joint at the shoulder
the<00:03:20.670> head<00:03:20.880> does<00:03:21.090> not<00:03:21.120> turn<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:22.110> his<00:03:22.290> helmet

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
the head does not turn and his helmet

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.550 
the head does not turn and his helmet
does<00:03:22.800> not<00:03:22.980> come<00:03:23.160> off<00:03:23.310> as<00:03:23.550> part<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.850> that

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
does not come off as part of that

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.440 
does not come off as part of that
impulse<00:03:25.560> projection<00:03:26.430> technology<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:27.209> course

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
impulse projection technology of course

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.840 
impulse projection technology of course
and<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:28.380> his<00:03:28.560> back<00:03:28.800> then<00:03:29.370> you've<00:03:29.520> got<00:03:29.700> this

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
and in his back then you've got this

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.360 
and in his back then you've got this
on/off<00:03:30.330> switch<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.900> also<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.320> try<00:03:31.950> me<00:03:31.980> mode

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
on/off switch and also the try me mode

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.270 
on/off switch and also the try me mode
and<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:33.180> if<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.450> get<00:03:33.630> one<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:33.930> these<00:03:34.130> in<00:03:35.130> a

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
and so if you get one of these in a

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.820 
and so if you get one of these in a
store<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:36.300> want<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.050> pick<00:03:37.200> one<00:03:37.380> from<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.650> back

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
store you want to pick one from the back

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.960 
store you want to pick one from the back
of<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.070> shelf<00:03:38.340> because<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.640> one<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:38.880> the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
of the shelf because the one in the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.970 
of the shelf because the one in the
front<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.330> shelf<00:03:39.600> has<00:03:40.380> probably<00:03:40.709> had<00:03:40.860> the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
front of the shelf has probably had the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.740 
front of the shelf has probably had the
kids<00:03:41.220> pressing<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.760> try<00:03:42.030> B<00:03:42.209> button<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.600> lot

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
kids pressing that try B button a lot

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.560 
kids pressing that try B button a lot
and<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.980> batteries<00:03:44.370> will<00:03:45.060> probably<00:03:45.360> run<00:03:45.510> out

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
and the batteries will probably run out

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.710 
and the batteries will probably run out
faster<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.800> suit<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.340> Tron<00:03:47.670> suit<00:03:47.970> just
