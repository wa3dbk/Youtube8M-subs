one<00:00:59.600> of<00:00:59.750> my<00:00:59.899> best<00:01:00.230> tests<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.129> they<00:01:01.219> let<00:01:01.429> plants

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
one of my best tests and they let plants

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.530 
one of my best tests and they let plants
grow<00:01:02.180> here<00:01:02.710> can<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:03.739> believe<00:01:04.129> this<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:05.299> can

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
grow here can you believe this you can

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.980 
grow here can you believe this you can
test<00:01:05.780> can't<00:01:06.140> we<00:01:06.830> tried<00:01:07.390> they<00:01:08.390> just<00:01:08.720> sit<00:01:08.960> there

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
test can't we tried they just sit there

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.880 
test can't we tried they just sit there
never<00:01:09.979> showing<00:01:10.280> pain<00:01:10.640> nor<00:01:11.119> fear<00:01:11.509> that<00:01:12.500> is<00:01:12.740> in

science<00:01:16.659> now<00:01:17.659> what<00:01:18.020> we<00:01:18.170> need<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.380> do<00:01:18.590> here<00:01:18.920> is

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
science now what we need to do here is

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.800 
science now what we need to do here is
to<00:01:19.460> place<00:01:19.729> one<00:01:20.360> portal<00:01:21.170> there<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.909> acquire<00:01:23.330> the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
to place one portal there to acquire the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.070 
to place one portal there to acquire the
hard<00:01:24.530> light<00:01:24.710> page<00:01:24.950> then<00:01:25.549> one<00:01:25.789> portal<00:01:26.090> there<00:01:26.299> so

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
hard light page then one portal there so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.580 
hard light page then one portal there so
we<00:01:27.140> can<00:01:27.289> get<00:01:27.409> over<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.390> on<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.720> witch<00:01:29.930> so

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
we can get over and on to that witch so

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.040 
we can get over and on to that witch so
that's<00:01:30.950> what<00:01:31.100> I'm<00:01:31.250> going<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.580> do<00:01:31.729> right<00:01:31.880> now

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
that's what I'm going to do right now
