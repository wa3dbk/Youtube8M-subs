00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.030 
smudged out I always do a winged liner
let's<00:02:52.180> face<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:52.960> I<00:02:52.990> thought<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.710> would<00:02:53.740> do<00:02:54.010> a

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
let's face it so I thought I would do a

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:08.390 
let's face it so I thought I would do a
really<00:02:54.370> smudged<00:02:54.940> out<00:02:55.270> gel<00:02:55.690> liner<00:02:55.960> look

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.770 

so<00:03:09.400> once<00:03:09.580> you've<00:03:09.730> smudged<00:03:10.030> out<00:03:10.300> all<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.630> that

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
so once you've smudged out all of that

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.780 
so once you've smudged out all of that
gel<00:03:11.020> liner<00:03:11.230> underneath<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:12.010> eyes<00:03:12.130> make<00:03:12.760> sure

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
gel liner underneath the eyes make sure

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.670 
gel liner underneath the eyes make sure
to<00:03:13.120> apply<00:03:13.360> some<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:13.900> blue<00:03:14.110> shadow<00:03:14.440> as

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
to apply some of that blue shadow as

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:45.820 
to apply some of that blue shadow as
well<00:03:15.160> just<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.880> finish<00:03:16.150> off<00:03:16.360> under<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.810> eyes

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.320 

when<00:03:46.830> putting<00:03:47.070> so<00:03:47.370> much<00:03:47.490> product<00:03:47.880> underneath

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
when putting so much product underneath

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.000 
when putting so much product underneath
the<00:03:48.510> eyes<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.900> run<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.290> risk<00:03:49.320> of<00:03:49.710> them

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
the eyes you run the risk of them

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.060 
the eyes you run the risk of them
looking<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.610> little<00:03:50.760> bit<00:03:50.940> punched<00:03:51.390> in<00:03:51.740> so<00:03:52.740> i

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
looking a little bit punched in so i

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.180 
looking a little bit punched in so i
really<00:03:53.610> suggest<00:03:53.840> blending<00:03:54.840> out<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.230> edges<00:03:55.410> so

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
really suggest blending out the edges so

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.420 
really suggest blending out the edges so
that<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.520> looks<00:03:56.670> more<00:03:57.380> diffused<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.740> softer

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
that it looks more diffused and softer

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.850 
that it looks more diffused and softer
