00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.450 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.630> it<00:00:00.780> was<00:00:01.020> like<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.290> for<00:00:02.129> me<00:00:02.250> it's<00:00:02.399> like

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
I think it was like a for me it's like

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.679 
I think it was like a for me it's like
more<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:02.760> like<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.939> roller<00:00:03.240> coaster<00:00:03.330> because

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
more of like a roller coaster because

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.249 
more of like a roller coaster because
like<00:00:03.899> we<00:00:04.080> go<00:00:04.230> up<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.680> then<00:00:04.770> we<00:00:04.920> got<00:00:05.130> the

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
like we go up and then we got the

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.629 
like we go up and then we got the
national<00:00:07.259> championship<00:00:07.890> at<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.280> national

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
national championship at that national

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.850 
national championship at that national
champion<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.240> then<00:00:09.389> we<00:00:10.050> come<00:00:10.230> back<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.740> then

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
champion and then we come back and then

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.709 
champion and then we come back and then
we<00:00:10.980> have<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.219> do<00:00:11.340> our<00:00:11.429> finals<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.240> then<00:00:12.389> and

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
we have to do our finals and then and

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.720 
we have to do our finals and then and
then<00:00:13.349> we<00:00:13.530> take<00:00:13.679> out<00:00:13.860> sort<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.250> like<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> break

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
then we take out sort of like a break

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.039 
then we take out sort of like a break
but<00:00:14.940> not<00:00:15.059> really<00:00:15.360> because<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.630> ride<00:00:15.780> off<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
but not really because I ride off the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.660 
but not really because I ride off the
finals<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.440> get<00:00:16.560> back<00:00:16.740> right<00:00:16.920> into<00:00:17.100> swimming

London right before legs just to get the
just<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> get<00:00:57.539> used<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.800> London

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
just to get used to like the London

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.119 
just to get used to like the London
weather<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.719> everything<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.859> that's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
weather and everything so that's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.140 
weather and everything so that's
basically<00:01:02.670> our<00:01:02.940> plan<00:01:03.650> since<00:01:04.650> cherry<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.850> set

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
basically our plan since cherry it's set

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.149 
basically our plan since cherry it's set
up<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:06.600> good<00:01:06.810> example<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.500> us<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.890> we

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
up a really good example for us like we

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.210 
up a really good example for us like we
can<00:01:08.490> both<00:01:08.729> study<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.600> swim<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> same<00:01:10.979> time

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
can both study and swim at the same time

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.380 
can both study and swim at the same time
like<00:01:11.520> having<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.090> good<00:01:12.210> balance

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
like having a really good balance

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.320 
like having a really good balance
between<00:01:12.750> them<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.979> guess<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:15.000> something

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
between them I guess that's something

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.600 
between them I guess that's something
really<00:01:15.659> unique

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
really unique

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.040 
really unique
home<00:01:17.440> everyone<00:01:18.440> because<00:01:18.830> we<00:01:19.070> I<00:01:19.760> guess<00:01:20.690> we

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
home everyone because we I guess we

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.400 
home everyone because we I guess we
really<00:01:21.500> like<00:01:22.160> value<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.850> education<00:01:23.600> part<00:01:24.320> as

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
think it will be so much different cuz

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.840 
think it will be so much different cuz
the<00:01:50.360> first<00:01:50.600> time<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:50.990> was<00:01:51.229> in<00:01:51.500> 2008<00:01:52.430> I<00:01:52.700> was

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
the first time that I was in 2008 I was

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.290 
the first time that I was in 2008 I was
all<00:01:53.150> alone<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.140> wasn't<00:01:54.440> even<00:01:54.680> like<00:01:55.300> expecting

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
all alone I wasn't even like expecting

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.480 
all alone I wasn't even like expecting
anything<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.840> happen<00:01:57.020> but<00:01:57.530> then<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:58.220> was<00:01:58.400> an

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
anything to happen but then it was an

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.300 
anything to happen but then it was an
amazing<00:01:58.880> experience<00:01:59.619> because<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.890> was<00:02:01.070> my

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
amazing experience because it was my

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.570 
amazing experience because it was my
first<00:02:01.850> like<00:02:02.410> International<00:02:03.410> Bank<00:02:03.710> meet<00:02:03.920> but

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
first like International Bank meet but

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.550 
first like International Bank meet but
this<00:02:04.759> time<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.330> think<00:02:05.660> I'm<00:02:05.780> more<00:02:06.050> experienced

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
this time I think I'm more experienced

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.690 
this time I think I'm more experienced
and<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:07.340> will<00:02:08.300> be<00:02:08.600> really<00:02:08.959> trying<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.670> but<00:02:10.670> I

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
and I will be really trying to but I

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.090 
and I will be really trying to but I
have<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.480> performance<00:02:12.170> part<00:02:12.380> like<00:02:12.709> because

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
have the performance part like because

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.530 
have the performance part like because
last<00:02:13.280> time<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> little<00:02:13.489> more<00:02:13.640> participation

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
last time a little more participation

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.970 
last time a little more participation
and<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.110> time<00:02:15.320> will<00:02:15.470> be<00:02:15.560> more<00:02:15.739> for<00:02:15.920> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
and this time will be more for the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.250 
and this time will be more for the
performance<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.330> with<00:02:17.780> all<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.080> bears

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
performance so and with all the bears

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.350 
performance so and with all the bears
around<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.830> we'll<00:02:19.100> see<00:02:19.370> each<00:02:19.400> other<00:02:19.580> up<00:02:19.880> and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
around and we'll see each other up and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.470 
around and we'll see each other up and
that<00:02:20.870> would<00:02:20.959> be<00:02:21.019> really<00:02:21.110> fun
