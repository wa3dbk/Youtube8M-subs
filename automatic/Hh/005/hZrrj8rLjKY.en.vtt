00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
there for them to cut out I'll just do

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.039 
there for them to cut out I'll just do
one<00:01:46.740> side<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.490> there<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.689> I've<00:01:48.899> already

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
one side of that there and I've already

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.480 
one side of that there and I've already
measured<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.890> my<00:01:50.040> big<00:01:50.759> old<00:01:50.970> head<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.810> I

measured this to my big old head so I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:03.319 
measured this to my big old head so I
can<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.640> glue<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.909> right<00:01:54.180> into<00:01:54.360> place

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
