00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.200
 weening with donalds people this is the lakers has been around as long as their new it is 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.800
 find good today lagasse that always finds it the nicest as people 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.810
 come to the studio we can talk a little more with his music a pillow 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.289
 so viewed small we are going to talk about the suu kyi meditation center that serbia 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.749
 the ten year anniversary with a zucchini festival 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.589
 this choice is in the studio 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.260
 kwo you have in time you have food 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.040
 who search it and founded it in 19 98 where does that come from at a given 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.039
 moment something has to bubble and 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.370
 then I told myself I repeat that founder 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.980
 yes it is a set combination of bolhuis if you say that very well and the 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.650
 practical circumstances 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.990
 we live with our family in Amsterdam the man had a very nice job in lead 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.480
 hehe was plagued by traffic jams and we thought we were going to work 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.800
 nice lead move but my work is all in Amsterdam gave the city 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.100
 actually a kind of idea 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.100
 I can also make that kind of a new beginning 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.970
 and I already gave some meditation courses but more besides that he is busy doing it 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.580
 the music in this theater in Amsterdam 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.360
 and then found the step following their home after which a beautiful 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.570
 green could create the room 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.390
 that was actually the step to start the meditation center but it is 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.350
 not an actress rian was lost 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.350
 no 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.570
 what effects 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.030
 probably approve 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.580
 but my passion has always been to me 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.360
 year 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.290
 I am not stopping to convey to people something unique when you call unspeakable 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.200
 we could actually call it all art pass 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.430
 and yes mediq if medication is about something then it is because they are insufficient 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.490
 start the invisible within yourself 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.600
 and people who point away yaris actually much nicer we say they 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.230
 of course always against you 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.540
 i kinda like this if you have no behavior 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.910
 yes I can imagine everything I have to tell you honestly 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.910
 that before I started, I thought the same way 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.680
 but we're just going to know more about it 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.460
 because they speak our mouths if I pronounce it so well this can fall yes 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.769
 that's right 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.099
 and that the chance that the bayarena I do not know anymore what lives there no longer 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.689
 what if someone 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.579
 he died in 2000 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.669
 and when I met him, I was also a meditation teacher for ten years 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.659
 mr I ran into a coincidence more or less by chance because I thought 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:29.529
 he 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:34.419
 gosh and cats young children I have to do enough to myself again 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:37.849
 cas not really looking it not really on the spiritual path 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.200
 but he gave he the intensive a the meditations that customers marib press as 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.540
 I also offer them and I just went once with a girlfriend and I notice that 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.529
 I just recovered terribly 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:51.600
 the sleeve or not floaty I thought I am now judging but for a moment aside 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.819
 I had incurred 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.149
 I will continue 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:59.100
 as simple as entertained when it says something about quotes you must be you 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.479
 check breathing 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:03.869
 although you mediq directly on your breath 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:08.599
 familiar meditation means that you really focused your attention on me 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.989
 in the present miele world of thought, therefore, a sort of painting actually takes place 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.819
 world a fantasy world based on your memories and you 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.549
 dreams for the future 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.909
 and with meditation yes focus on the now and the quay 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.249
 is a typical thing that takes place in you 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:28.919
 as something that always happens at the moment 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.939
 when you focus on your breath 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.589
 and in doing so you also start cutting your whole body 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:38.899
 you open your inner windows here and you send a good dose 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.520
 creepy through it and that 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.630
 makes you redecorate after so much, but that's what makes you 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.829
 of course a lot of variants with rossignol 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.949
 and see mantra 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.409
 and 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.549
 the 31 year old 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.969
 employers want to indicate 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:00.359
 yes you can say that its several thousand roads to rome 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.889
 they are also thousands of ways to a deepest point in yourself into the silence 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.659
 yourself 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.320
 that these 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.490
 singing the mantra and yoga portraiture those things you do 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:16.969
 I am also very much a fan of that, which is why I also like animals 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:19.419
 walking away have asked at 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.710
 contribute suu kyi festival 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.610
 so that the five tons can show them to people what you can do 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.610
 do to develop yourself intellect 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.150
 He then came from Paris is really pure medication and very important 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.379
 both sides are that you also get the opportunity to express your emotions 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:40.240
 to express 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.790
 which means sharpened search team that sounds japan if that's right it became 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.759
 have been seen well 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.229
 who is your chance and it means 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.610
 it is in japanese one is the symbol for enlightenment 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:57.749
 You are mainly concerned with the let you process that they are talking about 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:59.949
 people expect 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:00.610
 I
