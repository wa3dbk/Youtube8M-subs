00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.930
 I do not hope that 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.949
 that we are on it 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.589
 the percent 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.159
 second, because of her 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.159
 Now, really, what to do 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.819
 Loew that's what I'm special 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.279
 I have the game against Hagen 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.279
 we looked again completely 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 tactical alignment all the games 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.350
 and finally come to the realization that 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.400
 becomes very difficult game 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.810
 I believe something like that 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.810
 Otte dpa on 04 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.550
 Africa does not have something 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.620
 did not like to see you love me Â»on 2 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.500
 not as desired 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 I hope that we rehearsed the final training tomorrow 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.260
 complete 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
 but usually has to 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.850
 the nine stages 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.850
 when she comes to Sal 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.720
 to smell the grass and Germany in Spain was not easy 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.870
 the team 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.690
 economic games have the percent 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.120
 and that's something you want 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.250
 not in our opinion not with us 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.470
 Yes 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.090
 also counter 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.830
 that will be the teacher 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.970
 and so less 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.210
 that is percent 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.210
 the security level 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.180
 that is that everyone 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.610
 the playhouse they care about 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.950
 surround Schlarmann in graduation
