way brace a breeze I think it's the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.010 
way brace a breeze I think it's the
safer<00:01:56.579> pick<00:01:56.909> Brady's<00:01:57.270> got<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.509> most<00:01:57.659> up<00:01:57.840> side

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
safer pick Brady's got the most up side

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.420 
safer pick Brady's got the most up side
because<00:01:58.259> yeah<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> don't<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:58.860> Brees<00:01:59.219> could

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
because yeah I don't think Brees could

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.160 
because yeah I don't think Brees could
throw<00:01:59.610> 50<00:01:59.850> right<00:02:00.360> Brady's<00:02:00.719> always<00:02:00.899> got<00:02:01.020> the
