was spectacular tonight no it's funny we

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.650 
was spectacular tonight no it's funny we
I<00:00:43.980> think<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.550> two<00:00:44.730> planes<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.180> called<00:00:45.450> for

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
I think the two planes that I called for

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.260 
I think the two planes that I called for
him<00:00:45.840> he<00:00:45.930> didn't<00:00:46.200> score<00:00:46.469> he<00:00:47.190> scored<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.789> all<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
him he didn't score he scored on all the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.650 
him he didn't score he scored on all the
plays<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.899> wasn't<00:00:49.500> his<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.239> that's<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.480> we

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
plays that wasn't his and that's what we

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.200 
plays that wasn't his and that's what we
kept<00:00:52.440> telling<00:00:52.710> me<00:00:52.800> he<00:00:52.860> has<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.550> stop

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
kept telling me he has to do stop

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.810 
kept telling me he has to do stop
waiting<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.840> us<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.199> call<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.520> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
waiting for us to call it go get it and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.529 
waiting for us to call it go get it and
I<00:00:57.449> thought<00:00:57.690> he<00:00:57.809> did<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.520> tonight<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.940> lot<00:01:00.510> of

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
I thought he did that tonight a lot of

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.240 
I thought he did that tonight a lot of
good<00:01:00.660> efforts<00:01:01.020> no<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.350> thought<00:01:01.620> our<00:01:01.739> bench<00:01:01.980> was

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
good efforts no I thought our bench was

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.759 
good efforts no I thought our bench was
huge<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:03.210> thought<00:01:03.690> verbose<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.409> funny<00:01:04.619> he

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
huge I thought verbose it's funny he

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.800 
huge I thought verbose it's funny he
didn't<00:01:04.920> score<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> point<00:01:05.450> and<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.570> thought<00:01:06.750> I

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
didn't score a point and I thought I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.219 
didn't score a point and I thought I
defensa<00:01:07.320> pressure<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:08.750> extremely<00:01:09.750> effective

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
defensa pressure was extremely effective

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.370 
defensa pressure was extremely effective
tonight<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:12.180> know<00:01:12.299> he<00:01:12.720> has<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.110> reputation

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
tonight you know he has that reputation

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.770 
tonight you know he has that reputation
of<00:01:13.860> being<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.640> all<00:01:14.880> offensive<00:01:15.270> player<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
of being this all offensive player and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.440 
of being this all offensive player and
what<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.040> found<00:01:17.220> since<00:01:17.970> getting<00:01:18.270> them

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
what we have found since getting them

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.080 
what we have found since getting them
he's<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> heck<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.320> defensive<00:01:19.799> player<00:01:20.009> he<00:01:20.250> has

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
he's a heck of a defensive player he has

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.609 
he's a heck of a defensive player he has
the<00:01:21.299> ability<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.720> put<00:01:21.930> pressure<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> ball

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the ability to put pressure on the ball

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.800 
the ability to put pressure on the ball
that's<00:01:22.979> something<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.250> didn't<00:01:23.490> know<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.330> again

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
that's something we didn't know so again

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.480 
that's something we didn't know so again
we're<00:01:25.020> still<00:01:25.200> discovering<00:01:25.560> guys<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.340> our<00:01:26.460> team

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
we're still discovering guys on our team

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.249 
we're still discovering guys on our team
but<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> good<00:01:27.420> effort<00:01:27.540> how<00:01:28.049> much

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
but that was a good effort how much

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.120 
but that was a good effort how much
could<00:01:28.880> probably<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.240> opponent<00:01:30.810> man<00:01:31.130> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
could probably the opponent man it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.160 
could probably the opponent man it
doesn't<00:01:32.400> for<00:01:32.729> me<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.720> need<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.960> play

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
doesn't for me we just need to play

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.450 
doesn't for me we just need to play
right<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.590> didn't<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:34.860> matter<00:01:35.130> i<00:01:35.310> mean

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
right it didn't really matter i mean

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.310 
right it didn't really matter i mean
it's<00:01:35.579> great<00:01:35.790> bingo<00:01:36.180> coma<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.840> mean<00:01:37.140> they<00:01:37.259> were

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it's great bingo coma I mean they were

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.600 
it's great bingo coma I mean they were
in<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> finals<00:01:37.890> last<00:01:38.040> year<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.490> they're<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
in the finals last year and they're a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.319 
in the finals last year and they're a
team<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.000> beat<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.329> guess<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.780> West<00:01:40.790> but<00:01:41.790> it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
team to beat I guess in the West but it

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.600 
team to beat I guess in the West but it
was<00:01:42.479> more<00:01:42.630> how<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:42.869> play<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:44.250> played<00:01:44.460> with

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
was more how we play we played with

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.030 
was more how we play we played with
great<00:01:44.850> force<00:01:45.240> tonight<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.470> thought<00:01:46.979> that
