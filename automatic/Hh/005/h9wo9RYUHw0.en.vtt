straws been used for building for
thousands<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.800> years<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:18.180> very<00:00:18.390> durable

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
thousands of years and it's very durable

buildings that process was invented in

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.089 
buildings that process was invented in
the<00:00:28.109> 1850s

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the 1850s

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.550 
the 1850s
because<00:00:29.670> baling<00:00:30.210> machines<00:00:30.539> were<00:00:30.810> invented<00:00:30.840> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
because baling machines were invented so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.799 
because baling machines were invented so
the<00:00:32.160> white<00:00:32.340> settlers<00:00:32.700> on<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.300> plains<00:00:33.540> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the white settlers on the plains of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.810 
the white settlers on the plains of
Nebraska<00:00:33.989> had<00:00:34.950> nothing<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.430> build<00:00:35.610> their

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
Nebraska had nothing to build their

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.639 
Nebraska had nothing to build their
houses<00:00:36.059> with<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.750> they<00:00:36.870> did<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.170> these

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
houses with but they did have these

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.850 
houses with but they did have these
giant<00:00:38.010> building<00:00:38.820> blocks<00:00:39.149> which<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.710> them

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
giant building blocks which for them

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.700 
giant building blocks which for them
were<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.820> waste<00:00:42.300> product<00:00:42.660> or<00:00:43.050> something<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.620> be

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
were a waste product or something to be

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.369 
were a waste product or something to be
stored<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.489> animals<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.239> over<00:00:46.230> that

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
stored for the animals and over that

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.840 
stored for the animals and over that
first<00:00:46.649> winter<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.219> built<00:00:47.489> them<00:00:47.700> into

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
first winter they built them into

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.910 
first winter they built them into
temporary<00:00:48.390> homes<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:49.530> didn't<00:00:49.770> have

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
temporary homes because they didn't have

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.920 
temporary homes because they didn't have
anything<00:00:50.129> else<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.579> build<00:00:50.789> with<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.329> what

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
anything else to build with and what

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.439 
anything else to build with and what
they<00:00:52.079> found<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.800> those<00:00:53.219> blocks<00:00:53.699> kept

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
they found was that those blocks kept

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.170 
they found was that those blocks kept
them<00:00:54.690> really<00:00:55.410> cozy<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.160> first<00:00:56.520> winter<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
them really cozy that first winter and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.020 
them really cozy that first winter and
then<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.770> summer<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.399> kept<00:00:59.670> them<00:00:59.850> nice

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
then in the summer they kept them nice

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.280 
then in the summer they kept them nice
and<00:01:00.059> cool<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:04.080> was

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and cool and that was what the that was

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
and cool and that was what the that was
the<00:01:04.409> birth<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.769> insulation<00:01:05.220> although<00:01:05.790> they

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the birth of insulation although they

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.359 
the birth of insulation although they
didn't<00:01:06.210> call<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.450> insulation<00:01:07.290> at<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.830> time<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
didn't call it insulation at that time a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.940 
didn't call it insulation at that time a
barrier<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.299> prevented<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> passage<00:01:10.799> of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
barrier that prevented the passage of

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.280 
barrier that prevented the passage of
heat<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.340> cold<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.030> that's<00:01:12.540> what<00:01:12.869> straw

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
heat and cold and that's what straw

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.590 
heat and cold and that's what straw
bales<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.400> straw<00:01:14.790> bale<00:01:15.030> building<00:01:15.270> there

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
bales do in straw bale building there

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719 
bales do in straw bale building there
are<00:01:15.720> different<00:01:16.110> techniques<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.369> building

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
are different techniques to building

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.780 
are different techniques to building
with<00:01:17.909> straw<00:01:18.439> there's<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.680> true<00:01:19.979> load-bearing

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
with straw there's the true load-bearing

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.260 
with straw there's the true load-bearing
or<00:01:21.210> Nebraska<00:01:21.780> style<00:01:22.409> where<00:01:23.220> which<00:01:23.970> this

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
or Nebraska style where which this

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.469 
or Nebraska style where which this
behind<00:01:24.659> us<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> fine<00:01:25.290> example<00:01:26.240> where<00:01:27.240> there

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
behind us is a fine example where there

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.050 
behind us is a fine example where there
is<00:01:27.600> no<00:01:28.049> timber<00:01:28.590> framework<00:01:28.860> no<00:01:29.369> framework<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
is no timber framework no framework of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.270 
is no timber framework no framework of
any<00:01:30.210> sort<00:01:30.659> don't<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.380> fooled<00:01:31.619> by<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.040> two

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
any sort don't be fooled by the two

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.190 
any sort don't be fooled by the two
pieces<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> timber<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.960> walls

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
pieces of timber you see on the walls

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.270 
pieces of timber you see on the walls
those<00:01:34.619> are<00:01:34.860> only<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.430> hold<00:01:35.579> compression<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
those are only to hold compression and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.149 
those are only to hold compression and
then<00:01:38.280> there's<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.659> other<00:01:40.290> method<00:01:40.710> which<00:01:40.979> we

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
then there's the other method which we

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.090 
then there's the other method which we
call<00:01:41.400> infill<00:01:42.229> whereby<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.649> frame

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
call infill whereby there is a frame

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.280 
call infill whereby there is a frame
which<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.729> usually<00:01:45.149> timber<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.899> might<00:01:46.079> be

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
which is usually timber but it might be

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.230 
which is usually timber but it might be
concrete<00:01:46.710> blocks<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.250> might<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.579> steel<00:01:47.909> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
concrete blocks it might be steel and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.469 
concrete blocks it might be steel and
the<00:01:49.049> straw<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.649> only<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.340> insulation<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.240> not

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the straw is only the insulation is not

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.399 
the straw is only the insulation is not
taken

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
taken

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.080 
taken
this<00:01:52.859> one<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.249> have<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.429> be<00:01:53.609> delicate<00:01:53.820> with

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
this one we have to be delicate with

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.399 
this one we have to be delicate with
because<00:01:54.569> it's<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.929> mouth<00:01:57.920> yeah<00:01:59.780> that's<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.960> nice
