think six pieces um so it comes with six
pieces<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.880> prototype<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.630> guns<00:00:33.809> motor

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
pieces in a prototype for guns motor

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.040 
pieces in a prototype for guns motor
mortar<00:00:34.800> shell<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.910> most<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.840> guys<00:00:36.989> will

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
mortar shell and most of you guys will

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.880 
mortar shell and most of you guys will
probably<00:00:37.829> get<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.890> mortar

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
probably get this just for the mortar

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.920 
probably get this just for the mortar
it's<00:00:41.370> really<00:00:41.640> cheap<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.030> only<00:00:42.180> six<00:00:42.510> dollars

birth<00:00:45.660> mania<00:00:45.989> sets<00:00:46.289> well<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:47.730> them<00:00:47.879> but

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
birth mania sets well I have them but

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.630 
birth mania sets well I have them but
some<00:00:48.570> people<00:00:48.930> some<00:00:49.800> people<00:00:50.070> can't<00:00:50.250> buy<00:00:50.399> and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
some people some people can't buy and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.970 
some people some people can't buy and
don't<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.600> me<00:00:51.719> wrong<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:52.140> some<00:00:52.710> pretty

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
don't get me wrong there's some pretty

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.639 
don't get me wrong there's some pretty
pricey<00:00:53.370> ones<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.120> don't<00:00:54.989> spend<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:55.500> my

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
pricey ones and I don't spend all my

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.310 
pricey ones and I don't spend all my
money<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> stuff<00:00:56.760> anyway<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.360> they're

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
money on the stuff anyway but they're

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.689 
money on the stuff anyway but they're
pricey<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.980> they're<00:00:59.100> worth<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:01.489> this<00:01:02.489> is

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
pricey but they're worth it so this is

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.179 
pricey but they're worth it so this is
the<00:01:02.879> Brooklyn's<00:01:03.390> mortar

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the Brooklyn's mortar

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.050 
the Brooklyn's mortar
I<00:01:05.220> think<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.170> version<00:01:07.170> 2<00:01:07.650> version<00:01:08.060> one

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
I think this version 2 version one

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.580 
I think this version 2 version one
didn't<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.510> little<00:01:09.840> tip<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
didn't have this little tip on it so you

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.530 
didn't have this little tip on it so you
can't<00:01:10.860> hold<00:01:11.130> it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
can't hold it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.880 
can't hold it
it<00:01:13.350> comes<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> grey<00:01:14.509> mostly<00:01:15.509> gray<00:01:15.890> mortar

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it comes with a grey mostly gray mortar

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.039 
it comes with a grey mostly gray mortar
and<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.850> about<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> height<00:01:18.509> same<00:01:18.840> height

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
and it's about the height same height

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.480 
and it's about the height same height
that<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> Lego<00:01:19.860> minifigure<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
that this is a Lego minifigure it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.730 
that this is a Lego minifigure it
depends<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.880> how<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.270> angle<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.229> there's

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
depends on how you angle it and there's

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
it fighter well it's not how it fires

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.450

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
but okay guys this thing does not fire

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.100 
but okay guys this thing does not fire
just<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.570> guys<00:01:33.720> know<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.909> it<00:01:36.110> looks

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
just so you guys know but it looks

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.940 
just so you guys know but it looks
really<00:01:37.409> cool<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.250> set<00:01:38.670> them<00:01:38.880> up<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:40.770> can

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
really cool you can set them up you can

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.940 
really cool you can set them up you can
and<00:01:41.220> it's<00:01:41.790> pretty<00:01:42.060> basic<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.770> make

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and it's pretty basic so you can make

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.789 
and it's pretty basic so you can make
more<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.340> them<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.700> wanted<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.710> you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
more of them if you wanted to so you

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.200 
more of them if you wanted to so you
could<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.159> set<00:01:47.310> them<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
could just set them up like that and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.359 
could just set them up like that and
there's<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.450> whole<00:01:48.630> bunch<00:01:48.810> maybe<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.829> don't<00:01:50.189> know

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
there's a whole bunch maybe I don't know

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
the black edition so this is what the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.720 
the black edition so this is what the
packaging<00:02:10.860> comes<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> little<00:02:11.760> baggie

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.530 

Green<00:02:16.350> if<00:02:17.350> you<00:02:17.500> guys<00:02:17.650> want<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.160> choose

Green if you guys want to choose
personally<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.600> thought<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.610> dark<00:02:21.610> green

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
personally I thought the dark green

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.080 
personally I thought the dark green
would<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.230> cooler<00:02:23.500> water<00:02:24.280> shell<00:02:24.670> cuz<00:02:25.000> it

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
would be the cooler water shell cuz it

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.370 
would be the cooler water shell cuz it
kind<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.300> looks<00:02:25.450> like<00:02:25.510> what<00:02:25.810> they<00:02:25.960> use<00:02:25.990> today

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
kind of looks like what they use today

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.750 
kind of looks like what they use today
but<00:02:27.960> maybe<00:02:28.960> you<00:02:29.230> don't<00:02:29.380> really<00:02:30.130> care<00:02:30.430> for<00:02:30.460> that

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
but maybe you don't really care for that

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.940 
but maybe you don't really care for that
I<00:02:30.790> think<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.240> looks<00:02:31.450> cooler<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.500> cleaner<00:02:32.800> let

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
I think it looks cooler and cleaner let

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.760 
I think it looks cooler and cleaner let
me<00:02:33.420> do<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.450> little<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:36.400> kind<00:02:36.820> of<00:02:36.940> swirled<00:02:37.360> -

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
me do a little it's kind of swirled -

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.100 
me do a little it's kind of swirled -
that's<00:02:38.770> what<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.010> think<00:02:39.340> it's<00:02:39.460> cool<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.330> here's

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
that's what I think it's cool so here's

think you will be able to focus into it

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.530 
think you will be able to focus into it
but<00:03:26.080> there's<00:03:26.680> our<00:03:26.860> two<00:03:27.160> choices<00:03:27.430> black<00:03:28.210> seems

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
but there's our two choices black seems

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.450 
but there's our two choices black seems
as<00:03:28.780> though<00:03:28.960> it's<00:03:29.140> more<00:03:29.320> popular<00:03:29.560> but<00:03:30.010> more

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
as though it's more popular but more

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.390 
as though it's more popular but more
black<00:03:30.910> mortar<00:03:31.660> shells<00:03:31.990> have<00:03:32.230> been<00:03:32.380> sold<00:03:33.070> than

black mortar shells have been sold than
the<00:03:33.580> dark<00:03:33.970> green<00:03:34.240> but<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:34.960> don't<00:03:35.170> know<00:03:35.260> why

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
the dark green but I don't know why

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.620 
the dark green but I don't know why
maybe<00:03:35.680> it's<00:03:35.920> just<00:03:36.040> it's<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.370> first<00:03:36.580> one<00:03:36.820> first

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
maybe it's just it's the first one first

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.730 
maybe it's just it's the first one first
option<00:03:38.050> but<00:03:38.620> okay<00:03:39.430> so<00:03:39.690> there's<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:41.440> two

to<00:03:44.890> our<00:03:45.209> models<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:48.360> yay<00:03:50.520> now<00:03:51.520> I'm<00:03:52.209> going<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.480> go

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
to our models of yay now I'm going to go

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.720 
to our models of yay now I'm going to go
into<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:52.870> little<00:03:53.050> bit<00:03:53.170> more<00:03:53.260> in<00:03:53.560> depth<00:03:53.830> into<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
into a little bit more in depth into the

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.440 
into a little bit more in depth into the
martyr<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:56.160> think<00:03:57.160> you<00:03:57.250> can<00:03:57.400> go<00:03:57.550> too<00:03:58.030> far<00:03:58.270> in

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
martyr I think you can go too far in

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:07.500 
martyr I think you can go too far in
depth<00:03:58.930> but<00:03:59.820> it's<00:04:01.140> very<00:04:02.140> small<00:04:02.680> it's<00:04:06.450> there's<00:04:07.450> a

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
depth but it's very small it's there's a

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.360 
depth but it's very small it's there's a
little<00:04:07.870> thing<00:04:08.110> well<00:04:08.800> I<00:04:08.830> think<00:04:09.010> I'm<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.340> only

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
little thing well I think I'm the only

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.400 
little thing well I think I'm the only
problem<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.180> doesn't<00:04:10.330> attach<00:04:10.690> too<00:04:10.990> well<00:04:11.200> he

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
problem is it doesn't attach too well he

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.860 
problem is it doesn't attach too well he
could<00:04:11.530> have<00:04:11.650> made<00:04:11.800> that<00:04:11.920> better<00:04:12.160> but<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.600> kind

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
could have made that better but it kind

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.640 
could have made that better but it kind
of<00:04:13.900> like<00:04:14.050> falls<00:04:14.410> over<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:15.070> lot<00:04:16.770> but<00:04:18.270> compared<00:04:19.270> to

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
of like falls over a lot but compared to

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.190 
of like falls over a lot but compared to
the<00:04:20.650> mortar<00:04:20.979> I<00:04:21.010> made<00:04:21.400> it's<00:04:21.609> I<00:04:22.030> guess<00:04:22.570> better<00:04:22.780> it

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
the mortar I made it's I guess better it

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.600 
the mortar I made it's I guess better it
just<00:04:23.380> depends<00:04:23.740> on<00:04:23.800> what<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:24.070> like<00:04:24.190> I'm<00:04:24.460> not
