cover the theory section today and I

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.429 
cover the theory section today and I
will<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.760> another<00:00:20.789> video<00:00:21.359> showing<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> trim

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
will have another video showing the trim

simple we first we allow the plants to
grow<00:00:48.239> out<00:00:48.480> then<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.559> trim<00:00:49.829> off<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.129> tips<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
grow out then we trim off the tips to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.240 
grow out then we trim off the tips to
allow<00:00:50.850> more<00:00:51.149> site<00:00:51.449> shows<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.930> sprout<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.500> with

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
allow more site shows to sprout and with

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.000 
allow more site shows to sprout and with
each<00:00:53.520> trim<00:00:53.940> more<00:00:54.840> sideshows<00:00:55.350> are<00:00:55.530> form<00:00:55.829> and

each trim more sideshows are form and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.889

eventually<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> site<00:00:56.969> shoes<00:00:57.239> will<00:00:57.480> form<00:00:57.780> a
