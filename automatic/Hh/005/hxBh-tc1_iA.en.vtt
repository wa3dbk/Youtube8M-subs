that by sprouting quinoa if its raw form

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.500 
that by sprouting quinoa if its raw form
you<00:02:30.320> can<00:02:30.470> actually<00:02:30.739> boost<00:02:31.340> your<00:02:31.580> nutritional

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
value because when you sprout it you

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.729 
value because when you sprout it you
activate<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.640> natural<00:02:38.150> enzymes<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.560> can

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
activate the natural enzymes and you can

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.479 
activate the natural enzymes and you can
apply<00:02:40.130> them<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:40.970> content<00:02:41.420> even<00:02:41.630> more<00:02:42.489> and

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
apply them in the content even more and

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.340 
apply them in the content even more and
this<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.940> great<00:02:44.150> tip<00:02:44.450> for<00:02:44.690> people<00:02:44.840> who<00:02:45.260> are
