00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
you look at my numbers each year have

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.380 
you look at my numbers each year have
improved<00:00:29.489> almost<00:00:30.489> double<00:00:30.730> my<00:00:30.759> system<00:00:31.239> last

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
improved almost double my system last

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.090 
improved almost double my system last
year<00:00:31.540> so<00:00:31.840> looking<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:32.590> be<00:00:32.680> a<00:00:32.710> little<00:00:32.890> bit<00:00:33.010> more

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
year so looking to be a little bit more

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.590 
year so looking to be a little bit more
of<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.250> play<00:00:33.399> like<00:00:33.550> playmaker<00:00:34.030> as<00:00:34.149> I<00:00:34.239> get<00:00:34.420> to<00:00:34.510> the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
of a play like playmaker as I get to the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.819 
of a play like playmaker as I get to the
league<00:00:34.750> and<00:00:34.960> I<00:00:35.140> think<00:00:35.500> they'd<00:00:35.620> see<00:00:35.800> the

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
league and I think they'd see the

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.229 
league and I think they'd see the
potential<00:00:36.280> I<00:00:36.340> have<00:00:36.370> you<00:00:36.670> know<00:00:36.760> despite<00:00:37.090> my<00:00:37.210> age

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239

potential I have you know despite my age
I<00:00:37.750> don't<00:00:37.870> think<00:00:38.020> that's<00:00:38.170> a<00:00:38.230> big<00:00:38.350> deal<00:00:39.780> yeah

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780

I don't think that's a big deal yeah
exactly<00:00:41.140> one<00:00:41.530> of<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.680> two<00:00:41.829> and<00:00:42.040> making<00:00:42.850> that

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
exactly one of the two and making that

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.220 
exactly one of the two and making that
transition<00:00:43.180> to<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.600> one<00:00:43.720> a<00:00:43.750> little<00:00:43.960> bit<00:00:44.079> more

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
transition to the one a little bit more

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.000 
transition to the one a little bit more
right<00:00:44.320> now

transition world of the one and the NBA
I<00:01:03.969> could<00:01:04.690> see<00:01:04.809> myself<00:01:04.960> doing<00:01:05.170> exactly<00:01:05.710> the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
I could see myself doing exactly the

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.990 
I could see myself doing exactly the
things<00:01:06.010> he<00:01:06.159> does<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.520> we<00:01:06.610> have<00:01:06.700> similar

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
things he does and we have similar

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.060 
things he does and we have similar
styles<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.360> game<00:01:07.510> too<00:01:07.750> so<00:01:08.020> you<00:01:08.680> know<00:01:08.710> if<00:01:08.830> he<00:01:08.920> can

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
styles of game too so you know if he can

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.590 
styles of game too so you know if he can
make<00:01:09.159> that<00:01:09.280> transition<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:10.150> can<00:01:10.300> i<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:15.540> mean<00:01:16.540> I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
make that transition so can i I mean I

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.940 
make that transition so can i I mean I
think<00:01:16.690> that<00:01:16.840> transition<00:01:17.380> from<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.560> zone<00:01:17.770> to

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
think that transition from the zone to

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.800 
think that transition from the zone to
man-to-man<00:01:18.280> isolation<00:01:19.090> type<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.329> defense<00:01:19.630> I

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
man-to-man isolation type of defense I

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.030 
man-to-man isolation type of defense I
mean<00:01:20.020> that's<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.290> thing<00:01:20.320> that's<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:20.979> thing

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040
