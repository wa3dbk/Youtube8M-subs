 the truth is total depression 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.290
 meaninglessness when you don't want anything 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.890

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.790
 In the world, people think that I have this 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.040

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.340

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.420
 almost always they are identical and they 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.360
