you want just slow it down and get the
move<00:04:24.960> step<00:04:25.260> by<00:04:25.289> step<00:04:25.710> once<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.370> got<00:04:26.550> it<00:04:26.729> it's

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
move step by step once you got it it's

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.220 
move step by step once you got it it's
time<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.180> speed<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.659> up<00:04:27.719> a<00:04:27.870> lot

this<00:05:20.250> combination<00:05:20.760> would<00:05:21.120> really<00:05:21.300> work<00:05:21.540> for<00:05:21.570> a

this combination would really work for a

there's not a lot of changes in the beat
it<00:05:31.350> would<00:05:31.470> work<00:05:31.590> perfectly<00:05:32.190> eight<00:05:33.120> count<00:05:33.480> on

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
it would work perfectly eight count on

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.990 
it would work perfectly eight count on
each<00:05:34.230> side<00:05:34.560> will<00:05:34.770> be<00:05:34.890> would<00:05:35.460> be<00:05:35.490> great<00:05:35.820> for

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
each side will be would be great for

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.820 
each side will be would be great for
this<00:05:36.120> one<00:05:36.390> okay<00:05:36.750> so<00:05:36.960> before<00:05:37.320> you<00:05:37.530> guys<00:05:37.620> like
