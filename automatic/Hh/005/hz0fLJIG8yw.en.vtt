these<00:00:47.070> myriad<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.550> attacks<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.030> he's

these myriad of attacks that he's

these myriad of attacks that he's
showing<00:00:48.600> off<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:49.289> there<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> few<00:00:49.710> things

showing off but there are a few things

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.889 
showing off but there are a few things
that<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.460> talk<00:00:50.640> about<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.059> make<00:00:51.329> him<00:00:51.539> not

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
that we can talk about that make him not

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.229 
that we can talk about that make him not
as<00:00:52.140> good<00:00:52.440> as<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.710> might<00:00:52.890> think<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.030> his

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
as good as we might think for one is his

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.970 
as good as we might think for one is his
range<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.020> range<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.350> his<00:00:55.440> attacks<00:00:55.770> seems

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
range the range of his attacks seems

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.410 
range the range of his attacks seems
relatively<00:00:56.340> short<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.879> comparison<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.300> other

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
relatively short in comparison to other

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.819 
relatively short in comparison to other
characters<00:00:57.870> some<00:00:58.140> characters<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.500> weapons

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
characters some characters have weapons

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.139 
characters some characters have weapons
in<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.190> game<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.640> extends<00:00:59.969> their

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
in this game and that extends their

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.790 
in this game and that extends their
range<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.899> really<00:01:01.140> depends<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:01.649> little

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
range it really depends on what little

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.100 
range it really depends on what little
Mac<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.340> as<00:01:02.640> far<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.239> moves<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:03.899> a

Mac has as far as like moves that go a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.080 
Mac has as far as like moves that go a
greater<00:01:04.379> distance<00:01:04.769> now<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.729> biggest

a<00:02:48.300> lot<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.600> other<00:02:48.720> smash<00:02:49.080> characters<00:02:49.560> and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
a lot of other smash characters and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.980 
a lot of other smash characters and
that's<00:02:49.770> his<00:02:50.010> recovery<00:02:50.490> ability<00:02:50.850> recovery<00:02:51.840> in

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
that's his recovery ability recovery in

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.750 
that's his recovery ability recovery in
smash<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.470> extremely<00:02:52.980> important<00:02:53.400> depending

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
smash is extremely important depending

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.280 
smash is extremely important depending
on<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.940> angles<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.450> your<00:02:54.600> recovery<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.080> how

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
on the angles of your recovery and how

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.170 
on the angles of your recovery and how
far<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.770> distance<00:02:55.890> actually<00:02:56.310> goes<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.970> they

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
far the distance actually goes and they

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.990 
far the distance actually goes and they
actually<00:02:57.570> show<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.840> specific<00:02:58.290> example<00:02:59.280> against

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
actually show a specific example against

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.910 
actually show a specific example against
the<00:03:00.090> Wii<00:03:00.240> Fit<00:03:00.480> trainer<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:01.290> little<00:03:01.560> Mac<00:03:01.680> goes

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
the Wii Fit trainer that little Mac goes

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.830 
the Wii Fit trainer that little Mac goes
off<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.430> edge<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.910> has<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.270> very<00:03:03.630> difficult

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
off the edge and has a very difficult

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.660 
off the edge and has a very difficult
time<00:03:04.200> recovering<00:03:04.770> this<00:03:05.070> most<00:03:05.280> likely<00:03:05.370> means

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
time recovering this most likely means

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.610 
time recovering this most likely means
that<00:03:05.940> Mac<00:03:06.240> is<00:03:06.390> gonna<00:03:06.570> be<00:03:06.720> very<00:03:07.110> dominant<00:03:07.500> in

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
that Mac is gonna be very dominant in

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.230 
that Mac is gonna be very dominant in
the<00:03:07.680> ground<00:03:07.890> game<00:03:08.130> very<00:03:08.400> dominant<00:03:08.850> in<00:03:09.030> the

the ground game very dominant in the

ring<00:03:09.450> itself<00:03:09.840> on<00:03:10.080> platforms<00:03:10.710> but<00:03:10.920> when<00:03:11.070> it

it's<00:03:13.620> probably<00:03:13.890> gonna<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.190> difficult<00:03:14.400> thing

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
it's probably gonna be a difficult thing

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.280 
it's probably gonna be a difficult thing
he<00:03:14.910> might<00:03:15.060> be<00:03:15.210> able<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.390> get<00:03:15.570> Kayode<00:03:15.960> pretty

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
he might be able to get Kayode pretty

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.110 
he might be able to get Kayode pretty
fast<00:03:16.620> depending<00:03:17.100> on<00:03:17.190> how<00:03:17.310> much<00:03:17.490> his<00:03:17.700> stock<00:03:17.940> is

fast depending on how much his stock is
up<00:03:18.300> and<00:03:18.510> last<00:03:19.110> but<00:03:19.290> not<00:03:19.440> least<00:03:19.710> is<00:03:19.950> his<00:03:20.250> unique

KO meter this is something that's

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.470 
KO meter this is something that's
actually<00:03:23.160> fairly<00:03:23.550> special<00:03:24.090> throughout<00:03:24.360> the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
actually fairly special throughout the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.060 
actually fairly special throughout the
entire<00:03:24.750> smash<00:03:25.200> at<00:03:25.410> least<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.710> new<00:03:25.830> smash

entire smash at least the new smash
brothers<00:03:26.250> game<00:03:26.610> because<00:03:27.180> it's<00:03:27.360> an<00:03:27.450> additional

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
brothers game because it's an additional

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.240 
brothers game because it's an additional
element<00:03:28.110> it's<00:03:28.530> an<00:03:28.650> additional<00:03:29.010> gameplay

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250

element<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.120> was<00:03:30.360> theorizing<00:03:30.810> different

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
element and I was theorizing different

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.510 
element and I was theorizing different
things<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:31.680> could<00:03:31.830> possibly<00:03:31.980> lead<00:03:32.400> up

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
things that this could possibly lead up

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.010 
things that this could possibly lead up
to<00:03:32.640> be<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.390> more<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.660> look<00:03:33.780> at<00:03:33.870> the

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
to be but the more you look at the

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.540 
to be but the more you look at the
trailer<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.530> it's<00:03:34.650> edited<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:35.100> certain<00:03:35.340> way<00:03:35.490> to

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
trailer and it's edited a certain way to

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.520 
trailer and it's edited a certain way to
kind<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:35.940> cover<00:03:36.150> up<00:03:36.240> what<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.050> appears

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
kind of cover up what it is and appears

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.530 
kind of cover up what it is and appears
to<00:03:37.650> be<00:03:37.770> a<00:03:37.800> charged<00:03:38.220> attack<00:03:38.580> but<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.210> thing<00:03:39.390> I'm

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
to be a charged attack but the thing I'm

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.090 
to be a charged attack but the thing I'm
kind<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.780> curious<00:03:40.020> about<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.800> it<00:03:40.950> might

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
kind of curious about is that it might

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.370 
kind of curious about is that it might
just<00:03:41.250> be<00:03:41.340> an<00:03:41.490> exaggerated<00:03:42.270> smash<00:03:42.540> attack<00:03:42.930> of

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
just be an exaggerated smash attack of

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.690 
just be an exaggerated smash attack of
course<00:03:43.650> with<00:03:43.800> smashing<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.280> can<00:03:44.430> hold<00:03:44.640> down

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
course with smashing you can hold down

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.640 
course with smashing you can hold down
the<00:03:45.030> attack<00:03:45.330> and<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.630> charges<00:03:45.840> up<00:03:46.080> for<00:03:46.290> longer

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
the attack and it charges up for longer

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.890 
the attack and it charges up for longer
and<00:03:46.770> more<00:03:46.920> damage<00:03:47.130> but<00:03:47.940> I'm<00:03:48.090> curious<00:03:48.390> if<00:03:48.750> this

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
and more damage but I'm curious if this

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.660 
and more damage but I'm curious if this
is<00:03:49.080> just<00:03:49.350> that<00:03:49.680> or<00:03:49.920> there's<00:03:50.100> something<00:03:50.310> more

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
is just that or there's something more

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.180 
is just that or there's something more
involved<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.720> do<00:03:52.050> see<00:03:52.260> him<00:03:52.380> charging<00:03:52.680> several

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
involved you do see him charging several

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.620 
involved you do see him charging several
times<00:03:53.460> throughout<00:03:53.760> this<00:03:54.000> trailer<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.570> I'm

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
times throughout this trailer and I'm

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.670 
times throughout this trailer and I'm
pretty<00:03:54.870> sure<00:03:54.960> that's<00:03:55.140> what<00:03:55.260> it's<00:03:55.470> sending

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
pretty sure that's what it's sending

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.140 
pretty sure that's what it's sending
towards<00:03:56.100> that<00:03:56.520> he's<00:03:56.640> got<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:56.910> special

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
towards that he's got this special

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.550 
towards that he's got this special
unique<00:03:57.630> thing<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:57.900> if<00:03:58.170> you're<00:03:58.290> able<00:03:58.380> to

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
unique thing that if you're able to

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.040 
unique thing that if you're able to
charge<00:03:58.830> a<00:03:59.070> lot<00:03:59.100> this<00:03:59.760> ko<00:04:00.060> meter<00:04:00.390> gets<00:04:00.660> even

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
charge a lot this ko meter gets even

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.690 
charge a lot this ko meter gets even
higher<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.680> you're<00:04:01.800> able<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:02.040> deliver<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.430> blow

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
higher and you're able to deliver a blow

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.460 
higher and you're able to deliver a blow
that<00:04:03.000> might<00:04:03.150> be<00:04:03.300> even<00:04:03.570> more<00:04:03.780> powerful<00:04:04.350> than

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
that might be even more powerful than

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.410 
that might be even more powerful than
smashes<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.100> other<00:04:05.280> characters<00:04:05.820> charged<00:04:06.180> up

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
smashes of other characters charged up

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.270 
smashes of other characters charged up
I'd<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:07.200> see<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.500> different<00:04:07.800> variances

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
I'd like to see the different variances

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.590 
I'd like to see the different variances
that<00:04:08.340> there's<00:04:08.640> better<00:04:08.760> ways<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.000> charge<00:04:09.360> this

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
that there's better ways to charge this

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.910 
that there's better ways to charge this
and<00:04:09.810> stuff<00:04:09.990> like<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.320> but<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.590> could<00:04:10.770> be

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
and stuff like that but it could be

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.500 
and stuff like that but it could be

these<00:04:15.959> in-depth<00:04:16.440> elements<00:04:16.890> into<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.190> game

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
these in-depth elements into the game

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.949 
these in-depth elements into the game
but<00:04:17.640> until<00:04:17.910> we<00:04:18.030> actually<00:04:18.390> play<00:04:18.660> it<00:04:18.810> and

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
but until we actually play it and

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.690 
but until we actually play it and
understand<00:04:19.350> how<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.560> works<00:04:19.980> then<00:04:20.520> we'll

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
understand how it works then we'll

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.610 
understand how it works then we'll
really<00:04:20.880> figure<00:04:21.210> it<00:04:21.330> out<00:04:21.450> overall<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.410> was

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620
