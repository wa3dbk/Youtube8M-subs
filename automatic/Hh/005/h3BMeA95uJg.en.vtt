00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
know what keeps on coming up with that

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.110 
know what keeps on coming up with that
um<00:03:20.060> but<00:03:21.060> yes<00:03:21.329> I<00:03:21.569> would<00:03:21.720> definitely<00:03:22.879> here's<00:03:23.879> the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
um but yes I would definitely here's the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.809 
um but yes I would definitely here's the
file<00:03:24.329> that<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.659> backed<00:03:24.870> up<00:03:25.159> it<00:03:26.159> was<00:03:26.459> one<00:03:26.639> that

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
file that it backed up it was one that

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.210 
file that it backed up it was one that
I'd<00:03:26.970> copied<00:03:27.479> and<00:03:27.780> pasted<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:29.959> um<00:03:31.190> then<00:03:32.190> I

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
I'd copied and pasted and um then I

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.849 
I'd copied and pasted and um then I
deleted<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:33.120> files<00:03:33.659> at<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.260> secondary<00:03:34.739> or

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
deleted the files at the secondary or

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.979 
deleted the files at the secondary or
the<00:03:35.129> second<00:03:35.430> file<00:03:35.579> that<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.819> created<00:03:35.970> but<00:03:36.359> no<00:03:36.479> it

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
the second file that I created but no it

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.399 
the second file that I created but no it
found<00:03:37.169> that<00:03:37.379> so<00:03:37.769> I<00:03:38.069> mean<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.729> does<00:03:39.000> work<00:03:39.409> if

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
found that so I mean this does work if

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.030 
found that so I mean this does work if
you<00:03:40.590> need<00:03:40.829> any<00:03:41.459> more<00:03:42.229> back<00:03:43.229> than<00:03:43.620> just<00:03:43.829> one

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
you need any more back than just one

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.569 
you need any more back than just one
file<00:03:44.459> back<00:03:45.359> or<00:03:45.989> recovered<00:03:46.530> then<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:47.099> would

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
file back or recovered then I would

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.430 
file back or recovered then I would
suggest<00:03:47.760> getting<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.209> full<00:03:48.419> version<00:03:48.930> um<00:03:49.169> I've

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
suggest getting the full version um I've

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.319 
suggest getting the full version um I've
not<00:03:49.919> gotten<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.400> full<00:03:50.549> version<00:03:50.909> so<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.090> cannot

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
not gotten the full version so I cannot

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.929 
not gotten the full version so I cannot
guarantee<00:03:51.840> anything<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.639> it<00:03:53.639> would<00:03:53.760> probably

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
guarantee anything but it would probably

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.969 
guarantee anything but it would probably
be<00:03:54.180> my<00:03:55.139> best<00:03:55.379> bet<00:03:55.650> um<00:03:56.359> if<00:03:57.359> you<00:03:58.079> lost<00:03:58.319> a<00:03:58.769> lot<00:03:58.949> of

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
be my best bet um if you lost a lot of

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.770 
be my best bet um if you lost a lot of
files<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.939> would<00:04:00.180> probably<00:04:00.299> be<00:04:00.479> the<00:04:00.629> best

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
files this would probably be the best

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.939 
files this would probably be the best
way<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:00.959> back<00:04:01.409> it<00:04:01.590> up

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
way to back it up

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.360
