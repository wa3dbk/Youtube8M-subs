00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
something that you could talk while

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.479 
something that you could talk while
sitting<00:00:36.510> down<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:37.469> know<00:00:37.710> from<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.129> sitting

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
sitting down you know from a sitting

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.660 
sitting down you know from a sitting
position<00:00:38.870> or<00:00:39.870> anything<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.489> is

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
position or anything like that this is

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.760 
position or anything like that this is
what<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> came<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:43.910> some<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> features

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
what I came up with some of the features

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.250 
what I came up with some of the features
got<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.950> there<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> laser<00:00:47.789> that's<00:00:48.780> mounted

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
got on there is a laser that's mounted

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
got on there is a laser that's mounted
here<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:51.530> got<00:00:52.530> wing<00:00:52.920> nuts<00:00:54.020> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.350> fork<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.940> if

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
here I got wing nuts on the fork so if

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.040 
here I got wing nuts on the fork so if
you<00:00:57.300> had<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.829> band<00:00:58.829> break<00:00:59.629> something<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
you had a band break something like that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.650 
you had a band break something like that
you<00:01:01.289> could<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> spare<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:03.359> if

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
you could have a spare one like if

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.950 
you could have a spare one like if
you're<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> combat<00:01:04.680> situation<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:06.630> could

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you're in a combat situation you could

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.429 
you're in a combat situation you could
change<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.979> quickly<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:09.780> another<00:01:10.170> went

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
change it quickly and get another went

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.300 
change it quickly and get another went
on<00:01:10.619> start<00:01:11.430> shooting<00:01:11.880> again<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
on start shooting again the first one I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.249 
on start shooting again the first one I
made<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:17.610> fork<00:01:17.939> was<00:01:18.180> about<00:01:19.170> an<00:01:19.799> inch<00:01:20.250> shorter

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
made the fork was about an inch shorter

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.249 
made the fork was about an inch shorter
what<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.290> found<00:01:22.939> when<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:23.970> was<00:01:24.330> trying<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.810> dial

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
what I found when I was trying to dial

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.420 
what I found when I was trying to dial
in<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> laser<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:27.270> bottom<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.960> laser<00:01:28.430> was

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
in the laser the bottom of the laser was

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.179 
in the laser the bottom of the laser was
hitting<00:01:29.759> right<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.390> fork<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:31.259> so

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
hitting right on the fork right there so

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.030 
hitting right on the fork right there so
that<00:01:32.220> showed<00:01:32.759> me<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.860> shooting<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that showed me that I was shooting at a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.069 
that showed me that I was shooting at a
downward<00:01:35.430> angle<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.240> reason<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.659> got<00:01:36.840> this

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
downward angle the reason I got this

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.120 
downward angle the reason I got this
block<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.810> thought<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.380> idea<00:01:40.590> behind

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
block on here I thought the idea behind

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.649 
block on here I thought the idea behind
that<00:01:41.659> was<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> consistent<00:01:44.270> space<00:01:45.270> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that was to have a consistent space to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.760 
that was to have a consistent space to
go<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
go to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.280 
go to
it<00:01:46.950> was<00:01:47.250> located<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.840> every<00:01:48.899> time

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
it was located to go to you every time

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.020 
it was located to go to you every time
so<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.610> some<00:01:50.759> consistency<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:53.030> so

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
so I get some consistency out of it so

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.499 
so I get some consistency out of it so
that<00:01:54.180> was<00:01:54.360> showing<00:01:54.600> me<00:01:55.159> that<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> was<00:01:56.509> shooting

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that was showing me that I was shooting

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.510 
that was showing me that I was shooting
at<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> downward<00:01:57.990> angle<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.250> rather

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
at a downward angle like that so rather

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.139 
at a downward angle like that so rather
than<00:01:59.850> lowered<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:01.340> which<00:02:02.340> wouldn't<00:02:02.729> give<00:02:02.970> me

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
than lowered this which wouldn't give me

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.880 
than lowered this which wouldn't give me
enough<00:02:03.420> clearance<00:02:03.840> over<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.409> top<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
enough clearance over the top of the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.589 
enough clearance over the top of the
laser<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.610> had<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.450> raise<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.720> fort<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.649> niche<00:02:08.599> so

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
laser I had to raise the fort a niche so

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.540 
laser I had to raise the fort a niche so
that's<00:02:09.810> why<00:02:10.019> I<00:02:10.050> did<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.039> haven't<00:02:11.280> made

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
that's why I did that so I haven't made

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.479 
that's why I did that so I haven't made
any<00:02:11.819> attempt<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.720> smooth<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:14.010> up<00:02:14.280> or

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
any attempt to smooth this up or

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.440 
any attempt to smooth this up or
anything<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:17.220> stick<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.880> wood<00:02:17.910> I

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
anything this is just a stick of wood I

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.050 
anything this is just a stick of wood I
found<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.140> garage<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:20.069> didn't<00:02:20.580> even<00:02:20.670> sawed

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
found in the garage I didn't even sawed

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.210 
found in the garage I didn't even sawed
it<00:02:21.269> off

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
it off

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.640 
it off
so<00:02:23.220> later<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:24.000> I'm<00:02:24.660> going<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:24.989> smooth<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.470> all

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
so later on I'm going to smooth it all

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.720 
so later on I'm going to smooth it all
up<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.209> stain<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:28.160> I'll<00:02:29.160> show<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.400> that

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
up and stain it and I'll show you that

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.590 
up and stain it and I'll show you that
when<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:31.190> finish<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.220> up<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:34.170> now<00:02:35.269> so<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.390> just

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
when I finish that up so now so you just

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.110 
when I finish that up so now so you just
push<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.580> button<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.670> for<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.209> laser<00:02:41.000> now<00:02:42.000> I'm

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
push the button on for the laser now I'm

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.820 
push the button on for the laser now I'm
not<00:02:42.330> using<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:43.130> trigger<00:02:44.130> mechanism<00:02:44.430> on<00:02:45.299> this

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
not using the trigger mechanism on this

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.440 
not using the trigger mechanism on this
just<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.950> keep<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.549> simple<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:51.120> reason

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
just to keep it simple and the reason

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.979 
just to keep it simple and the reason
I'm<00:02:51.570> wearing<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:52.049> glove<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:53.660> because<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.810> is

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
I'm wearing a glove is because it is

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.620 
I'm wearing a glove is because it is
kind<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.350> hard<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.769> hold<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.010> ball<00:02:56.250> actually<00:02:56.940> a

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
kind of hard to hold the ball actually a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.430 
kind of hard to hold the ball actually a
release<00:02:58.170> mechanism<00:02:58.340> like<00:02:59.340> George<00:02:59.760> bras<00:03:00.440> would

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
release mechanism like George bras would

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.440 
release mechanism like George bras would
be<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.980> good<00:03:02.310> idea<00:03:03.650> but<00:03:04.650> if<00:03:04.859> you<00:03:05.010> don't<00:03:05.450> have

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
be a good idea but if you don't have

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.220 
be a good idea but if you don't have
that<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.739> need<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.269> get<00:03:09.269> you<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.480> glove<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.170> you

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
that you need to get you a glove so you

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.810 
that you need to get you a glove so you
can<00:03:10.470> hang<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.180> way<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:13.519> you<00:03:14.519> get<00:03:14.730> her

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
can hang on to way you you get her

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.860 
can hang on to way you you get her

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
loaded up ready to go you just give hold

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.289 
loaded up ready to go you just give hold
it<00:03:19.019> like<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.380> give<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:19.799> good<00:03:19.950> pull<00:03:20.250> put<00:03:21.180> it

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
it like that give it a good pull put it

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:30.979 
it like that give it a good pull put it
back<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.900> wrist

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.910 

pop<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:33.049> try<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:34.079> another<00:03:34.379> and<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.769> was

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
pop it and try it another and that was

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.780 
pop it and try it another and that was
kind<00:03:35.219> of

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.699 

there's<00:03:43.180> plenty<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.659> adjustment<00:03:44.439> another

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
there's plenty of adjustment another

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.270 
there's plenty of adjustment another
thing<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.159> recommend<00:03:45.430> is<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.590> outside<00:03:48.159> of

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
thing I recommend is on the outside of

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.690 
thing I recommend is on the outside of
your<00:03:48.310> couch<00:03:49.500> draw<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.530> center<00:03:50.920> line<00:03:51.069> that<00:03:51.280> you

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
your couch draw a center line that you

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
your couch draw a center line that you
can<00:03:51.879> see<00:03:52.060> easily<00:03:52.269> that<00:03:52.510> way<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.019> can<00:03:53.409> easily

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
can see easily that way you can easily

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.970 
can see easily that way you can easily
determine<00:03:56.280> if<00:03:57.280> your<00:03:57.959> bands<00:03:58.959> are<00:03:59.290> twisted<00:03:59.829> or

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
determine if your bands are twisted or

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.380 
determine if your bands are twisted or
not<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.019> just<00:04:02.310> put<00:04:03.310> her<00:04:03.400> up<00:04:03.549> like<00:04:03.730> that

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
not so I just put her up like that

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:18.450 
not so I just put her up like that
pull<00:04:05.260> it<00:04:05.379> back<00:04:08.010> find<00:04:09.010> your<00:04:09.190> point

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.320 

okay<00:04:19.460> that<00:04:19.700> was<00:04:20.230> pretty<00:04:21.230> close<00:04:21.500> right<00:04:21.950> there

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
okay that was pretty close right there

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:39.450 
okay that was pretty close right there
now<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:23.390> take<00:04:23.600> one<00:04:23.660> more<00:04:24.020> shot

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.930 

so<00:04:40.000> this<00:04:40.300> is<00:04:40.480> just<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.840> give<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.110> an<00:04:41.170> idea<00:04:41.940> of

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
so this is just to give you an idea of

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.880 
so this is just to give you an idea of
something<00:04:43.420> you<00:04:43.600> can<00:04:43.780> do<00:04:43.990> real<00:04:44.350> quick<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:47.410> use

something you can do real quick and use

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:55.670 
something you can do real quick and use
a<00:04:47.920> laser<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:50.100> look<00:04:51.100> like<00:04:51.250> a<00:04:51.310> pearl<00:04:53.970> shooting
