to make the procedure much more easier

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.250 
to make the procedure much more easier
and<00:00:49.710> obtainable<00:00:50.870> executi<00:00:51.870> we're<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> be

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and obtainable executi we're going to be

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.100 
and obtainable executi we're going to be
doing<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.559> under<00:00:52.800> ultrasound<00:00:53.250> guidance

doing this under ultrasound guidance

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.439 
doing this under ultrasound guidance
what<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.750> 27-gauge<00:00:57.750> needle<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
what we have here is a 27-gauge needle a

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.569 
what we have here is a 27-gauge needle a
very<00:01:00.449> thin<00:01:00.780> needle<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> much<00:01:02.160> smaller

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
very thin needle it's a much smaller

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.980 
very thin needle it's a much smaller
needle<00:01:03.059> than<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.390> would<00:01:03.539> use<00:01:04.880> then<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.689> to

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
needle than you would use then going to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.910 
needle than you would use then going to
a<00:01:07.650> lab<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.909> getting<00:01:09.119> blood<00:01:09.420> drawn<00:01:09.920> those

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
a lab and getting blood drawn those

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.020 
a lab and getting blood drawn those
needles<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.400> typically<00:01:12.830> 22<00:01:13.830> 8<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.340> 23<00:01:14.820> gauge

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
needles are typically 22 8 or 23 gauge

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.390 
needles are typically 22 8 or 23 gauge
needles<00:01:15.450> okay<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:17.070> see<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
needles okay so as you can see in the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.050 
needles okay so as you can see in the
ultra<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.570> zoom<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:20.060> mother

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
ultra and you can zoom in on the mother

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.200 
ultra and you can zoom in on the mother
you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.460> calcified<00:01:23.460> nodule<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
you can see the calcified nodule to the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.310 
you can see the calcified nodule to the
right<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> screen<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:26.180> that<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.900> needle

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
right of the screen and that the needle

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.289 
right of the screen and that the needle
is<00:01:28.350> now<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.130> placed<00:01:30.350> into<00:01:32.299> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
is now going to be placed into the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:44.250 
is now going to be placed into the
nodule

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.460 

we're<00:01:44.740> currently<00:01:45.040> in<00:01:45.370> the<00:01:45.520> nodule<00:01:46.470> we're

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
we're currently in the nodule we're

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.150 
we're currently in the nodule we're
drawing<00:01:47.770> fluid<00:01:48.100> for<00:01:48.850> drawing<00:01:49.060> cells<00:01:49.510> from<00:01:49.960> it

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
drawing fluid for drawing cells from it

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.680 
drawing fluid for drawing cells from it
technically<00:01:51.160> this<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.490> not<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.670> biopsy<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:52.570> is

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
technically this is not a biopsy this is

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.490 
technically this is not a biopsy this is
actually<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.080> fine<00:01:53.470> needle<00:01:53.800> aspiration<00:01:55.500> we're

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
actually a fine needle aspiration we're

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.100 
actually a fine needle aspiration we're
not<00:01:56.710> actually<00:01:56.890> obtaining<00:01:57.510> full<00:01:58.510> tissue

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
not actually obtaining full tissue

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.350 
not actually obtaining full tissue
we're<00:01:59.620> just<00:01:59.770> looking<00:01:59.860> obtaining<00:02:00.820> cells<00:02:01.090> for

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
we're just looking obtaining cells for

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.430 
we're just looking obtaining cells for
analysis

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.800 

then<00:02:10.820> Jason<00:02:11.820> our<00:02:11.970> medical<00:02:12.270> assistants<00:02:12.660> get<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
then Jason our medical assistants get a

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.950 
then Jason our medical assistants get a
whole<00:02:12.990> pressure<00:02:14.150> in<00:02:15.150> between<00:02:15.780> the

whole pressure in between the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.450 
whole pressure in between the
aspirations<00:02:16.890> while<00:02:17.130> we<00:02:17.250> prepare<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.700> slides
