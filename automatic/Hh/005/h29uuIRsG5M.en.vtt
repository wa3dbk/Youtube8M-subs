00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
opened my eyes towards our build

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
opened my eyes towards our build
environment<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:48.870> more<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.200> an<00:00:49.350> artistic

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

scale<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.940> my<00:00:57.149> studies<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:57.989> expand<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
scale in my studies and then expand the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.970 
scale in my studies and then expand the
discipline<00:00:59.520> towards<00:00:59.850> art<00:01:00.239> design<00:01:00.690> and

and just opened in Seville Spain can you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.700 
and just opened in Seville Spain can you
tell<00:01:12.090> us<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.270> little<00:01:12.390> bit<00:01:12.540> about<00:01:12.810> how<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.409> got

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710

involved<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.250> project<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.150> maybe

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
involved in that project and and maybe

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200 
involved in that project and and maybe
also<00:01:15.600> what<00:01:16.140> inspired<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.009> design<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.090> in

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
also what inspired you to design this in

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.270 
also what inspired you to design this in
wood<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:19.170> was<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> competition<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.070> won<00:01:20.100> in

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
wood it was a competition that we won in

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.240 
wood it was a competition that we won in
2004<00:01:20.939> which<00:01:21.210> was<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.659> creating<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.710> new<00:01:22.740> kind

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
2004 which was about creating a new kind

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.890 
2004 which was about creating a new kind
of<00:01:23.400> iconic<00:01:23.700> piece<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.210> Sevilla<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.720> also

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
of iconic piece for Sevilla but also

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.960 
of iconic piece for Sevilla but also
creating<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.560> new<00:01:25.740> idea<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.430> urban<00:01:26.759> space

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
creating a new idea for this urban space

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330 
creating a new idea for this urban space
and<00:01:27.180> 21st<00:01:27.600> century<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.680> proposed<00:01:29.040> this

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and 21st century so we proposed this

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.550 
and 21st century so we proposed this
structure<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.060> sits<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> Roman<00:01:31.409> ruins

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
structure that sits on the Roman ruins

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.950 
structure that sits on the Roman ruins
which<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.130> an<00:01:32.220> archaeology<00:01:32.759> Museum<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.299> for

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
which is an archaeology Museum now for

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.480 
which is an archaeology Museum now for
expect<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> food<00:01:34.650> market<00:01:35.009> which<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.280> there

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
expect the food market which was there

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.600 
expect the food market which was there
before<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.180> also<00:01:36.900> elevates<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.130> above

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
before and also elevates you up above

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.010 
before and also elevates you up above
the<00:01:38.820> horizon<00:01:38.939> line<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.570> buildings

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.859 

besides<00:01:43.020> being<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.310> largest<00:01:45.090> wood<00:01:45.390> or<00:01:45.630> timber

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
besides being the largest wood or timber

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.389 
besides being the largest wood or timber
construction<00:01:46.409> also<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.829> maybe<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.189> largest

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
construction also is maybe the largest

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.160 
construction also is maybe the largest
one<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.729> has<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> glued<00:01:48.299> bonding<00:01:48.840> technology

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
one it has a glued bonding technology

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.649 
one it has a glued bonding technology
because<00:01:50.040> all<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> joints<00:01:50.790> are<00:01:50.909> actually<00:01:51.149> hold

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
because all the joints are actually hold

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
developed out to three years ago there

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.899 
developed out to three years ago there
no<00:01:54.570> nails<00:01:54.950> there<00:01:55.950> are<00:01:56.009> some<00:01:56.159> nails<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.579> steel

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.649 
connections are executed into the wood
with<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.829> long<00:01:59.040> fort<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.490> steel<00:01:59.850> rods

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
with like long fort like steel rods

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.789 
with like long fort like steel rods
that's<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.799> very<00:02:02.040> new<00:02:02.189> technology<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.960> transfer

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
that's a very new technology to transfer

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.530 
that's a very new technology to transfer
the<00:02:05.189> forces<00:02:05.610> from<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:05.969> element<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> other

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the forces from one element to the other

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.749 
the forces from one element to the other
and<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:07.710> actually<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.310> most

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
and that was actually the most

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.559 
and that was actually the most
innovative<00:02:09.030> part<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.959> structure<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.780 

can<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.170> walk<00:02:16.349> on<00:02:16.379> top<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.980> yes<00:02:17.459> there's<00:02:17.700> a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
can you walk on top of it yes there's a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.160 
can you walk on top of it yes there's a
panoramic<00:02:18.239> platform<00:02:18.659> that's<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.930> restaurant

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
panoramic platform that's a restaurant

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.440 
panoramic platform that's a restaurant
on<00:02:19.379> top<00:02:19.409> it<00:02:20.069> has<00:02:20.129> a<00:02:20.280> very<00:02:20.549> kind<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:21.299> know

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
on top it has a very kind of you know

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.170 
on top it has a very kind of you know
said<00:02:22.049> using<00:02:22.579> atmosphere<00:02:23.579> up<00:02:23.700> there<00:02:23.879> to<00:02:24.030> be

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
said using atmosphere up there to be

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.539 
said using atmosphere up there to be
kind<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.049> cloud<00:02:25.319> above<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.799> city<00:02:28.549> it's

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
kind of on a cloud above the city it's

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.130 
kind of on a cloud above the city it's
been<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.790> response<00:02:30.239> that<00:02:30.390> you've<00:02:30.629> heard<00:02:30.959> so

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
been the response that you've heard so

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.649 
been the response that you've heard so
far<00:02:31.170> since<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.129> opened<00:02:32.280> about<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:33.329> three

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
far since it opened about like three

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.000 
far since it opened about like three
weeks<00:02:33.750> ago<00:02:34.049> people<00:02:34.349> are<00:02:34.650> really<00:02:34.860> excited

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
weeks ago people are really excited

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.370 
weeks ago people are really excited
about<00:02:35.340> it

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.750 

there<00:02:43.380> was<00:02:43.470> some<00:02:43.650> doubt<00:02:43.800> before<00:02:44.190> because<00:02:44.550> it

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
there was some doubt before because it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.190 
there was some doubt before because it
was<00:02:44.940> such<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> different<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.110> new

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
was such a different and new

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.860 
was such a different and new
architectural<00:02:47.100> language<00:02:47.510> but<00:02:48.510> since<00:02:48.750> it

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
architectural language but since it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.450 
architectural language but since it
opened<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.260> became<00:02:49.530> accessible<00:02:50.070> it's<00:02:50.190> super

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
opened it became accessible it's super

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.550 
opened it became accessible it's super
busy<00:02:50.610> people<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.930> they<00:02:51.960> hang<00:02:52.260> out<00:02:52.350> there

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
busy people like it they hang out there

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.810 
busy people like it they hang out there
at<00:02:52.620> night<00:02:52.770> they<00:02:53.010> go<00:02:53.160> up<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.430> think<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.670> effect

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
at night they go up I think the effect

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.730 
at night they go up I think the effect
1700<00:02:54.450> people<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.750> day<00:02:54.930> on<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.200> top<00:02:55.380> right<00:02:55.590> now

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
1700 people a day on the top right now

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.470 
1700 people a day on the top right now
so<00:02:56.310> it's<00:02:56.430> really<00:02:56.520> becoming<00:02:57.300> part<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.750> city

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
so it's really becoming part of the city

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.000 
so it's really becoming part of the city
was<00:03:00.480> there<00:03:00.660> an<00:03:00.750> element<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.380> sort<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.770> drawing

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
was there an element of sort of drawing

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.890 
was there an element of sort of drawing
inspiration<00:03:02.520> from<00:03:02.670> nature<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.270> this<00:03:03.420> design

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
inspiration from nature in this design

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.220 
inspiration from nature in this design
we<00:03:04.800> had<00:03:04.950> some<00:03:05.190> references<00:03:05.700> from<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.940> city<00:03:06.230> one

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
we had some references from the city one

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.080 
we had some references from the city one
was<00:03:07.440> big<00:03:07.650> trees<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.190> neighboring<00:03:08.460> plaza<00:03:08.760> so

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
was big trees and a neighboring plaza so

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.760 
was big trees and a neighboring plaza so
we<00:03:09.210> are<00:03:09.300> doing<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.630> same<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.140> build<00:03:10.380> version

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
we are doing the same in a build version

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.740 
we are doing the same in a build version
which<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.070> actually<00:03:11.370> grown<00:03:11.610> there<00:03:12.570> are<00:03:12.630> also

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
which is actually grown there are also

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.240 
which is actually grown there are also
references<00:03:12.990> to<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.440> Cathedral<00:03:13.920> which<00:03:14.100> has

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
references to the Cathedral which has

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.640 
references to the Cathedral which has
this<00:03:14.340> beautiful<00:03:14.640> undulated<00:03:15.420> stone<00:03:15.750> roof<00:03:16.020> the

open<00:03:24.380> Cathedral<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.620> know<00:03:25.860> that<00:03:26.100> actually<00:03:26.400> is

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
open Cathedral you know that actually is

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.100 
open Cathedral you know that actually is
pulled<00:03:27.150> together<00:03:27.300> by<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.690> people<00:03:28.020> in<00:03:28.080> the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
pulled together by the people in the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.330 

there<00:03:35.010> seems<00:03:35.250> like<00:03:35.489> there<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.730> kind<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.510> and

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
there seems like there is kind of a and

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.000 
there seems like there is kind of a and
somewhat<00:03:38.340> organic<00:03:38.909> and<00:03:39.150> also<00:03:40.010> mathematical

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
somewhat organic and also mathematical

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.220 
somewhat organic and also mathematical
pattern<00:03:41.519> thing<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.269> have<00:03:42.450> going<00:03:42.780> on

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
pattern thing that you have going on

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.649 
pattern thing that you have going on
well<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.799> digital<00:03:44.220> world<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.640> course<00:03:44.909> comes

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
well the digital world of course comes

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.670 
well the digital world of course comes
also<00:03:45.930> into<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:47.599> mythology<00:03:48.599> is<00:03:48.660> how<00:03:48.930> we<00:03:48.989> design

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
also into the mythology is how we design

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.369 
also into the mythology is how we design
things<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.190> how<00:03:50.370> we<00:03:50.430> understand<00:03:51.360> our<00:03:51.780> build

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
things and how we understand our build

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.410 
things and how we understand our build
environment<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.400> for<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.940> project<00:03:54.120> of

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
environment so for that project of

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.920 
environment so for that project of
course<00:03:54.629> using<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.650> computer<00:03:56.069> using<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.670> know

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
course using the computer using you know

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.180 
course using the computer using you know
contemporary<00:03:57.930> software<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.680> work<00:03:58.709> with<00:03:59.040> it

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
contemporary software to work with it

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.979 
contemporary software to work with it
also<00:03:59.549> in<00:03:59.849> the<00:03:59.910> production<00:04:00.209> process<00:04:00.360> not<00:04:00.810> just

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
also in the production process not just

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.360 
also in the production process not just
in<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.140> design<00:04:01.379> process<00:04:01.409> was<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.040> really

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
in the design process was a really

work on an aesthetic level so I think

work on an aesthetic level so I think
it's<00:04:48.000> one<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.419> parameters<00:04:48.870> that<00:04:49.639> help<00:04:50.639> us

it's one of the parameters that help us

it's one of the parameters that help us
to<00:04:51.180> define<00:04:51.780> our<00:04:51.990> environment<00:04:52.560> so<00:04:52.950> it's<00:04:53.099> a<00:04:53.250> much

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
to define our environment so it's a much

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.339 
to define our environment so it's a much
