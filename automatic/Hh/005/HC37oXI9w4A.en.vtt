00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.710
 Ah 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.500
 This time I will explain about Cosmos 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.300
 The place is located in Nagano Prefecture called Kurohime Kogen 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.880
 This picture is taken 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.030
 ç£¯ 200 days 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:36.059
 The shutter speed is 11 shutter speeds 1/250 seconds. 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.460
 The lens uses a 28 mm lens 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.980
 Shoot in this situation 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.070
 The point is 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.110
 It means that I wake up with the blue sky 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:01:06.100
 Just squid plugs 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:01:06.870
 Lens 3 form alkali 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.130
 The 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:17.460
 In this way, I will express the cosmos in a mountainous condition, so more than this picture above 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.330
 Much unity does not think you only regret the good 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.050
 This work is also- 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:29.010
 The whole balance is not always good 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:33.690
 And in the middle part of the cosmos Cosmos has already ended 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:38.600
 It is part of here, and this neighborhood is already in a state which is already over 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:44.120
 So I say that this way of shooting is a car body that is not very suitable 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:49.670
 That's to say, rather than targeting from below 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:53.690
 If you aim from a slightly higher position, you may be able to get the overall balance. 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:58.490
 And this time I will introduce the photos taken at eye level 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.730
 It is a photograph taken with this choice, but it is better than the previous one . 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.820
 On the near side 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:08.290
 A state that is clustered in that becomes smaller as the cosmos and go to the back 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.480
 I think I understand 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:21.160
 I also went to a very effective position to think that the blue sky and white 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:26.440
 If you shoot in this condition, you will be able to get a good balance 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:31.060
 Basically, you should do something good with this kind of shooting, but 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:36.700
 I can say that I can express more 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:41.150
 Overall it when the aim is what kind of thing or a higher angle rather than Areberu say 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.810
 Of gregarious to is not how it is seen well-then finally 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.430
 Good 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:54.330
 I will explain what was expressed as this work 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:59.760
 Here's a work from the same place I also photographed at eye high angle 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:05.600
 As you can see, this means that the cosmos is not sticking out of the mountain 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:09.770
 It's the whole and it's from the cosmos here to the back 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:14.550
 It sense of distance has been more and more placed 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.650
 It is an expression of cosmos that seems to be spread all over 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.130
 Well of course Ensei 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:25.370
 Clouds and blue sky gar 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:30.830
 Although the effect is enhanced, when you take a picture like this , the image 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.720
 I think it will change Let's compare it with the work taken at the previous eye level again 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:38.560
 Right side 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:43.630
 I took a high level and the left side 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:48.819
 Of course, the state of the reserve also changes because I took it with a quick guru 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:53.709
 Again more than anything than it Kedomo different also vividness of color 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:04:00.249
 I can say that the balance of the cosmos is so good 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:06.219
 It can be said that it is also a wide-angle lens that such a change becomes 2 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:07.960
 This means that 28 mm of go taking advantage of it well fur Soiku is using a wide-angle lens 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:13.050
 Because it will be like the angle 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.819
 When using a wide-angle lens by all means 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.010
 Coming moss 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:25.010
 Condition to put in and back 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:30.140
 How to put perspective Perspective It is recommended that you take this perspective and take care of yourself 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:35.570
 This is actually because I shoot it so fast 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:37.160
 Make the finder live view and lift the camera up while looking from below 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.080
 I have decided on the structure 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:45.770
 Of course it is necessary to get used to taking that proper structure 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.150
 Form, such as writing a little the day the I's had been a point camera 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.780
 That is 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:57.360
 After opening the camera on the camera, pull in a little 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:05:03.660
 It is a point that the shot in the angle of view, such as Enlarges the front side 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:05.950
 It's easy to say by mouth, but it's so difficult when you actually see it, so this work until you get used to it 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:10.550
 Please refer to 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:15.940
 Such a difference in paas by the same lens 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.940
 I hope you will recognize that it will change
