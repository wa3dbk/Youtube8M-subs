00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.870 
incorporated with the golf pro designs
for<00:00:09.599> example<00:00:09.990> here<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:10.440> have<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.620> lily<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.280> has

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
for example here we have a lily that has

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.120 
for example here we have a lily that has
come<00:00:12.030> from<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.360> vector<00:00:13.019> art<00:00:13.170> 3d<00:00:13.469> collection

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
software and then we're going to import

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.790 
software and then we're going to import
them<00:00:25.230> into<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.250> golf<00:00:26.519> pro<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.410> start<00:00:28.650> by

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
them into be golf pro so we start by

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.490 
them into be golf pro so we start by
closing<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> moment

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
why close let's just Center that it in

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.289 
why close let's just Center that it in
the<00:01:13.799> middle<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.130> our<00:01:14.250> sheet<00:01:16.610> ok<00:01:17.610> next<00:01:18.090> we're

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
the middle of our sheet ok next we're

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.690 
the middle of our sheet ok next we're
going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> import<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.470> lily<00:01:19.710> into<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> center

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
going to import the lily into the center

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.830 
going to import the lily into the center
of<00:01:20.729> our<00:01:20.909> design<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:22.080> say<00:01:22.350> import<00:01:23.509> here<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:24.659> have

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
of our design so say import here we have

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.920 
of our design so say import here we have
the<00:01:25.189> v3m<00:01:26.189> file<00:01:26.549> which<00:01:27.180> has<00:01:27.210> come<00:01:27.540> from<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the v3m file which has come from the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
the v3m file which has come from the
vector<00:01:28.740> art<00:01:28.920> 3d<00:01:29.189> machinist<00:01:29.790> software<00:01:30.950> open

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
vector art 3d machinist software open

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.850 
vector art 3d machinist software open
the<00:01:32.040> file<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> file<00:01:34.200> comes<00:01:34.470> in

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the file and see that the file comes in

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.130 
the file and see that the file comes in
it<00:01:35.240> with<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> origin<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.020> was

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
it with the origin that it was

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.310 
it with the origin that it was
calculated<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:39.000> design<00:01:39.329> had<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.750> x<00:01:40.049> 0

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
calculated at so this design had the x 0

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.399 
calculated at so this design had the x 0
y<00:01:40.530> 0<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.579> middle<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.570> click<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> second

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
y 0 in the middle if I click a second

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.539 
y 0 in the middle if I click a second
time<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.610> pick<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.060> drag<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.380> object<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
time I can pick and drag the object to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.200 
time I can pick and drag the object to
what<00:01:48.000> any<00:01:48.299> position<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.810> wish<00:01:49.880> say<00:01:50.880> want<00:01:51.090> that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
what any position I wish say want that

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.700 
what any position I wish say want that
to<00:01:51.329> be<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.540> center<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.380> use<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
to be in the center so I can use the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.300 
to be in the center so I can use the
centering<00:01:53.549> material<00:01:54.890> we<00:01:55.890> look<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
centering material we look in the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.700 
centering material we look in the
3-dimensional<00:01:57.030> view<00:01:59.899> see<00:02:00.899> now<00:02:01.079> we<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
3-dimensional view see now we have the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.609 
3-dimensional view see now we have the
tool<00:02:02.640> path<00:02:02.850> drawn<00:02:03.240> they've<00:02:03.960> been<00:02:04.140> moved<00:02:04.409> from
