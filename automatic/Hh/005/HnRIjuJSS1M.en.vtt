00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
same process cut out two strips that are

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.890 
same process cut out two strips that are
exactly<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.130> same<00:04:21.159> length<00:04:21.310> come<00:04:22.210> directly

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
exactly the same length come directly

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.390 
exactly the same length come directly
across<00:04:23.229> to<00:04:23.349> the<00:04:23.560> other<00:04:23.770> side<00:04:23.979> which<00:04:24.130> will<00:04:24.250> be

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
across to the other side which will be

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.170 
across to the other side which will be
right<00:04:24.550> over<00:04:24.610> here

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180
