what I'm showing you on this one is just
it's<00:00:06.509> very<00:00:06.540> simple<00:00:06.899> one<00:00:07.109> quick<00:00:07.350> video<00:00:07.589> really

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
it's very simple one quick video really

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.459 
it's very simple one quick video really
it's<00:00:08.400> just<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.760> show<00:00:09.059> you<00:00:09.090> how<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:10.170> know<00:00:10.260> but

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
it's just to show you how you know but

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.080 
it's just to show you how you know but
buying<00:00:10.710> players<00:00:11.070> without<00:00:11.309> contracts<00:00:11.910> can

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
buying players without contracts can

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.690 
buying players without contracts can
actually<00:00:12.389> be<00:00:12.540> quite<00:00:12.570> rewarding<00:00:13.610> and<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
actually be quite rewarding and the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.760 
actually be quite rewarding and the
reason<00:00:14.820> for<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.330> they<00:00:16.289> just<00:00:16.529> lose<00:00:16.710> a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
reason for that is they just lose a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.349 
reason for that is they just lose a
little<00:00:16.980> bit<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.220> value<00:00:17.609> when<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.240> know

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
little bit of value when you know

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.870 
little bit of value when you know
they're<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:19.140> players<00:00:19.350> got<00:00:19.529> no<00:00:19.619> contract<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
they're the players got no contract and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.609 
they're the players got no contract and
you'll<00:00:21.330> find<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> open<00:00:22.140> market<00:00:22.289> then

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
you'll find that on the open market then

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.710 
you'll find that on the open market then
they<00:00:22.710> go<00:00:23.340> for<00:00:23.519> as<00:00:23.580> much<00:00:23.730> as<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:24.240> know<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> same

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
they go for as much as you know the same

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.660 
they go for as much as you know the same
player<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.260> same<00:00:25.470> formation<00:00:25.769> with<00:00:26.490> some

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
player in the same formation with some

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.269 
player in the same formation with some
contracts<00:00:27.180> obviously<00:00:27.810> now<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.980> obviously

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
contracts obviously now this obviously

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.339 
contracts obviously now this obviously
works<00:00:29.460> best<00:00:29.730> with<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.269> cheaper<00:00:31.109> players

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
works best with the cheaper players

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.260 
works best with the cheaper players
because<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.040> know<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> more<00:00:32.940> expensive

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
because you know the more expensive

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.389 
because you know the more expensive
player<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:34.649> less<00:00:34.800> important<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
player is then less important the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.520 
player is then less important the
contract<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> house<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.230> dylan<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
contract the house but it's dylan is a

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.360 
contract the house but it's dylan is a
small<00:00:38.040> factor<00:00:38.570> but<00:00:39.570> yeah<00:00:40.050> basically<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:41.219> can

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
small factor but yeah basically you can

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
small factor but yeah basically you can
buy<00:00:41.550> them<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.850> open<00:00:42.360> market<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.710> know

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
buy them on the open market or you know

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.069 
buy them on the open market or you know
the<00:00:44.180> buy<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.300> our<00:00:45.390> market<00:00:45.780> you're<00:00:45.899> probably

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the buy in our market you're probably

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.350 
the buy in our market you're probably
more<00:00:46.530> likely<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.010> pick<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.280> some<00:00:47.460> bargains<00:00:47.820> now

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
more likely to pick up some bargains now

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.270 
more likely to pick up some bargains now
market<00:00:48.750> because<00:00:48.960> people<00:00:49.379> think<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.770> when<00:00:50.190> I've

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
market because people think I when I've

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
nobody's going to buy them so I'll just

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.439 
nobody's going to buy them so I'll just

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
way but that's not using this method

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.929 
way but that's not using this method
yeah<00:01:13.710> kieran<00:01:14.040> gibbs<00:01:14.070> all<00:01:14.310> got<00:01:14.460> Kieran<00:01:14.790> Gibbs

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
yeah kieran gibbs all got Kieran Gibbs

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.060 
yeah kieran gibbs all got Kieran Gibbs
there<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.990> eight<00:01:16.110> hundred<00:01:16.290> coins<00:01:16.650> which<00:01:16.950> is

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
there for eight hundred coins which is

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.550 
there for eight hundred coins which is
very<00:01:17.250> good<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.450> reason<00:01:18.750> I'm<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.470> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
very good and the reason I'm going to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.170 
very good and the reason I'm going to
get<00:01:19.650> down<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> reason<00:01:20.310> why<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:21.030> so

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
get down to it the reason why this is so

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.789 
get down to it the reason why this is so
good<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.960> apply<00:01:22.439> bronze

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
good is because we apply bronze

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.280 
good is because we apply bronze
contracts<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.549> them<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.259> gives

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
contracts to them and that just gives

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.539 
contracts to them and that just gives
the<00:01:25.500> effect<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.860> they've<00:01:26.040> actually<00:01:26.220> got

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the effect that they've actually got

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.859 
the effect that they've actually got
contracts<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.180> lot<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> people<00:01:27.630> when

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
contracts and a lot of people when

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.050 
contracts and a lot of people when
buying<00:01:28.170> players<00:01:28.740> now<00:01:29.040> don't<00:01:29.670> even<00:01:29.939> really

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
buying players now don't even really

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.760 
buying players now don't even really
bother<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.509> check<00:01:30.689> how<00:01:31.079> many<00:01:31.140> contracts<00:01:31.650> they

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
bother to check how many contracts they

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.760 
bother to check how many contracts they
have<00:01:32.119> obviously<00:01:33.119> some<00:01:33.329> people<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.750> i<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
have obviously some people do i do but a

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.350 
have obviously some people do i do but a
lot<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:34.979> people<00:01:35.070> don't<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:36.030> they've<00:01:36.240> got

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
lot of people don't so if they've got

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.800 
lot of people don't so if they've got
one<00:01:36.570> contract<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.650> they'll<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.280> buy<00:01:38.430> them

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
one contract then they'll just buy them

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.880 
one contract then they'll just buy them
so<00:01:39.810> basically<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.530> I've<00:01:40.740> already

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
what you have to do so it's just using

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.670 
what you have to do so it's just using
the<00:02:17.510> bronze<00:02:17.720> pack<00:02:17.990> method<00:02:18.290> which<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.530> showed

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
the bronze pack method which I showed

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.650 
the bronze pack method which I showed
you<00:02:18.800> earlier<00:02:18.830> which<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:20.150> way<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.360> can<00:02:20.540> make

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
you earlier which is a way you can make

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.650 
you earlier which is a way you can make
a<00:02:20.810> small<00:02:21.110> profit<00:02:21.260> but<00:02:21.650> with<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:22.459> method<00:02:22.700> you

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
a small profit but with this method you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.970 
a small profit but with this method you
know<00:02:23.750> buying<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.080> 400<00:02:24.470> packs<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:24.739> means<00:02:24.890> we

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
know buying the 400 packs it means we

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.830 
know buying the 400 packs it means we
get<00:02:25.100> free<00:02:25.310> contracts<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.000> some<00:02:26.300> players<00:02:26.540> and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
get free contracts and some players and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.170 
get free contracts and some players and
you<00:02:27.739> know<00:02:27.860> stuff<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.760> never

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
you know stuff like that so you never

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.970 
you know stuff like that so you never
really<00:02:29.360> lose<00:02:29.600> much<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:30.140> doing<00:02:30.590> this<00:02:30.680> anyway

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
really lose much on doing this anyway

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.160 
really lose much on doing this anyway
this<00:02:31.670> pack<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:32.060> have<00:02:32.270> as<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.570> can<00:02:32.690> see<00:02:32.870> because
