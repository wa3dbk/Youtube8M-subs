00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
is the approximate speed so we're going

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.929

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.380 

it's<00:02:32.860> like

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:45.070 

t<00:02:35.900> 6%<00:02:36.530> stabilizer<00:02:37.070> take<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.460> trust

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.570 

v1

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:56.190 

okay

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:05.350 

great<00:02:56.709> Europe

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.470 

so<00:03:05.720> between<00:03:05.960> these<00:03:06.350> two<00:03:06.410> we<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:07.400> equal<00:03:08.300> time

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
so between these two we the equal time

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.370 
so between these two we the equal time
points<00:03:08.840> we<00:03:09.560> use<00:03:09.800> Gander<00:03:10.310> as<00:03:10.490> our<00:03:11.170> alternate<00:03:12.170> in

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
points we use Gander as our alternate in
