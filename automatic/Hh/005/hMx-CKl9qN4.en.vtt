00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.650
 I'm not here 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.269
 after you are going to have a page co psy 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.150
 then my cursor there will be sliders 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.549
 which will be offered to you so I 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.709
 have never downloaded but I have you 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:31.450
 would have basic sliders the effects 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:35.629
 so that's the effects hanging around 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:39.560
 download here are the parameters 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:42.530
 then there is the shadow I do not touch 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.010
 personally pressing not to wear themselves there 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.440
 let's go there to look like that's it then 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.359
 if you want to put slider you go 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.970
 in my cursor you have for example 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.920
 this one and you get it enforced and there 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.439
 he has changed so I do not know if you 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:06.519
 see me correctly I regret it I 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:08.720
 here is basic applied here 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:13.790
 now if you want to download the 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:17.329
 new cursor you have on the window 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.699
 download and there you will have a link to 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:25.190
 click on it and that will take you on 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:30.320
 a web page where there will be full 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.389
 of the slider there will be sliders that 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.960
 will pay and sliders that 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:42.530
 will be free so 259 so I believe 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.000
 not that his 259 pages it looks like a 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.289
 little bit 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.820
 so there you have plenty of slider that 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:56.860
 we promised are available here 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:02.020
 I will choose one to show you 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.310
 a bit so I know I have more too 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:10.800
 how does it work to install them 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:10.800
 finally brief e paper up 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.730
 go hop people choose a I'm here by 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:31.360
 example the vapo glorify not if he is 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:33.780
 paying now that's what you do in 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.780
 the Aude 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:45.310
 I think that's how it'll give 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:49.510
 took to shit 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.050
 this bar of thiais a little bit 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.740
 Bitchy 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:58.210
 for the sake you can not put it 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:04.830
 there my arm we're just doing some 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:11.400
 positions a little the master most 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.400
 station excuse me just for that 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:22.970
 that's ok so recorded open the 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.970
 folder 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:32.820
 now we will see if he is in this 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:42.510
 that I do not think that's the case these 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:45.690
 events have new so I'm going 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:49.110
 take a break the time I 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.850
 remember how we settled 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.220
 sliders and we find ourselves right away 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.050
 after re friends so I found 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.230
 how to do so after you go 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.040
 go on in your downloads 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:05.940
 no that's not it 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:07.380
 here's up some changes after you 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.100
 will have something like that you're going 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:14.900
 double-click on theme for 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:22.230
 the name already exists no trick so j yes 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:24.120
 but after that you change that or 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:28.070
 so you can go I think on 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.070
 corner and fx I think it works 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:44.160
 that's it then it's not so two times 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:47.100
 this is this one so I hope this 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:51.600
 video you will have liked I want to go to 

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:53.539
 second pole that will show you 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:58.710
