00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.190 
would also be you know realistic and
that's<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.180> everything<00:01:57.540> they<00:01:57.659> could<00:01:57.719> put<00:01:58.110> in

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
that's that everything they could put in

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.219 
that's that everything they could put in
the<00:01:58.320> game<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.700> know<00:01:59.820> interact<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.810> lot<00:02:00.930> more

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the game to you know interact a lot more

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.190 
the game to you know interact a lot more
with<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> environment<00:02:02.270> for<00:02:03.270> example<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:03.659> is

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
with the environment for example here is

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.770 
with the environment for example here is
eating<00:02:04.770> snacks<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.520> water<00:02:05.790> why<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:06.600> add<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
eating snacks and water why not add a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.150 
eating snacks and water why not add a
meter<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:08.009> these<00:02:08.670> items<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:10.560> know<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:11.009> not

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
meter to these items you know it's not

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.760 
meter to these items you know it's not
going<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.430> drink<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.910> 1-liter<00:02:12.810> bottle<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.260> water

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
going to drink a 1-liter bottle of water

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.190 
going to drink a 1-liter bottle of water
in<00:02:14.160> one<00:02:14.490> drink<00:02:14.850> it'd<00:02:15.450> probably<00:02:15.810> make<00:02:15.930> himself

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
in one drink it'd probably make himself

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.150 
in one drink it'd probably make himself
sick<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:18.120> why<00:02:18.300> not<00:02:18.510> add<00:02:18.690> like<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.200> meter<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:20.040> you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
sick so why not add like a meter so you

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.010 
sick so why not add like a meter so you
can<00:02:20.280> actually<00:02:20.400> take<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.090> five<00:02:21.390> swigs<00:02:21.870> of

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
can actually take up to five swigs of

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.320 
can actually take up to five swigs of
that<00:02:22.230> one<00:02:22.710> liter<00:02:22.920> bottle<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.150> would

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
that one liter bottle and that would

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.140 
that one liter bottle and that would
last<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.080> very<00:02:25.110> long<00:02:25.590> time<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.400> naturally

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
last you a very long time and naturally

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.730 
last you a very long time and naturally
what<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.420> would<00:02:27.570> do<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:28.020> real<00:02:28.140> life<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.620> will

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
what you would do in real life you will

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.160 
what you would do in real life you will
just<00:02:28.860> go<00:02:29.130> down<00:02:29.460> an<00:02:29.790> entire<00:02:30.030> one<00:02:30.510> liter<00:02:30.840> bottle

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
just go down an entire one liter bottle

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.720 
just go down an entire one liter bottle
of<00:02:31.320> water<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.920> would<00:02:32.070> actually<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.610> know

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
of water you would actually you know

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.520 
of water you would actually you know
consume<00:02:33.210> that<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.660> drink<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.230> when<00:02:34.380> you're

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
consume that and drink it when you're

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.190 
consume that and drink it when you're
only<00:02:34.740> first<00:02:35.190> they<00:02:35.460> are<00:02:35.490> dehydrated<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:37.080> know

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
only first they are dehydrated you know

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.470 
only first they are dehydrated you know
you<00:02:37.260> wouldn't<00:02:37.500> actually<00:02:37.800> just<00:02:38.250> drink<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.270> just

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
you wouldn't actually just drink it just

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.030 
you wouldn't actually just drink it just
because<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.840> get<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.200> sake<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.440> drinking

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
because you get the sake of drinking

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.680 
because you get the sake of drinking
especially<00:02:41.490> in<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.790> scenario<00:02:41.970> where<00:02:42.330> it's

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
especially in a scenario where it's

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.140 
especially in a scenario where it's
trying<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.260> represent<00:02:43.520> you<00:02:44.520> know<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.670> zombie

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
trying to represent you know a zombie

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.600 
trying to represent you know a zombie
apocalypse<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:47.010> know<00:02:47.100> all<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.400> stuff

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
apocalypse you know all this stuff

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.430 
apocalypse you know all this stuff
really<00:02:48.030> needs<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.420> be<00:02:48.540> improved<00:02:48.810> for<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.230> game

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
really needs to be improved for the game

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.490 
really needs to be improved for the game

perfect<00:02:53.100> don't<00:02:53.310> get<00:02:53.460> me<00:02:53.580> wrong<00:02:53.760> but<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.390> has

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
perfect don't get me wrong but it has

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.380 
perfect don't get me wrong but it has
such<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.900> factor<00:02:55.440> realism<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.730> really<00:02:57.060> good

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
such a factor realism it's really good

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.970 
such a factor realism it's really good
and<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.260> fact<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.560> they're<00:02:58.740> going<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.890> be

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
and the fact that they're going to be

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.530 
and the fact that they're going to be
using<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.370> am<00:02:59.550> free<00:02:59.970> engine<00:03:00.180> for<00:03:00.510> the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
standalone of dizzy it just makes this

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.970 
standalone of dizzy it just makes this
game<00:03:03.030> not<00:03:03.240> even<00:03:03.450> worth<00:03:03.630> looking<00:03:04.080> at<00:03:04.200> but<00:03:04.890> you

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
game not even worth looking at but you

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.460 
game not even worth looking at but you
know<00:03:05.100> hopefully<00:03:05.310> they<00:03:05.670> will<00:03:05.790> improve<00:03:06.210> and<00:03:06.600> you

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
know hopefully they will improve and you

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.230 
know hopefully they will improve and you
know<00:03:07.590> take<00:03:07.830> things<00:03:08.160> into<00:03:08.340> consideration<00:03:08.520> from

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
know take things into consideration from

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.210 
know take things into consideration from
feedback<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.110> whatnot<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.740> actually

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
feedback and whatnot and actually

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.340 
feedback and whatnot and actually
improve<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.790> game<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.240> terms<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.840> trying<00:03:13.200> to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
improve the game in terms of trying to

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.640 
improve the game in terms of trying to
keep<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.620> an<00:03:13.740> MMO<00:03:14.130> but<00:03:14.970> still<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.960> know<00:03:16.140> adding

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
keep it an MMO but still you know adding

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.980 
keep it an MMO but still you know adding
some<00:03:16.890> realism<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.520> there<00:03:17.730> now<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.630> one<00:03:18.810> thing

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.020 
sight at arch you know you're not going
to<00:03:46.740> have<00:03:46.890> this<00:03:47.070> but<00:03:47.340> yeah<00:03:47.490> just<00:03:47.670> look<00:03:47.820> at<00:03:47.940> this

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
to have this but yeah just look at this

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.230 
to have this but yeah just look at this
anyways<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:49.260> doesn't<00:03:49.500> really<00:03:49.740> make<00:03:49.920> sense<00:03:50.240> and

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
anyways it doesn't really make sense and

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.330 
anyways it doesn't really make sense and
only<00:03:51.720> at<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.930> end<00:03:52.140> he<00:03:52.530> actually<00:03:52.650> uses<00:03:53.040> an

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
only at the end he actually uses an

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.270 
only at the end he actually uses an
unsound<00:03:53.730> weapon<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.570> then<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.650> cuts<00:03:55.890> out<00:03:56.070> we

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
unsound weapon and then it cuts out we

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.340 
unsound weapon and then it cuts out we
don't<00:03:56.459> know<00:03:56.580> what<00:03:56.760> happens<00:03:57.240> do<00:03:57.660> more<00:03:57.870> zombies

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
don't know what happens do more zombies

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.390 
don't know what happens do more zombies
come<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.890> guess<00:03:59.700> not<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.709> fact<00:04:01.950> that<00:04:02.010> you

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
come I guess not so the fact that you

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.460 
come I guess not so the fact that you
know<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.730> displayed<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:03.600> like<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:03.840> is<00:04:04.080> very

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
know it displayed it like this is very

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.190 
know it displayed it like this is very
poor<00:04:04.820> but<00:04:05.820> again<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.360> main<00:04:06.540> focus<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:07.080> the

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
poor but again the main focus of the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.820 
poor but again the main focus of the
gameplay<00:04:07.709> really<00:04:08.160> is<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.490> gunfight<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.989> dayz

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
gameplay really is the gunfight in dayz

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.770 
gameplay really is the gunfight in dayz
it's<00:04:11.100> not<00:04:11.280> like<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.550> dizzy<00:04:12.270> is<00:04:12.420> all<00:04:12.570> about

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
it's not like that dizzy is all about

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.949 
it's not like that dizzy is all about
consequences<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:14.250> pay<00:04:14.640> more<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:15.420> your<00:04:15.720> UI

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
consequences you pay more to your UI

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.590 
consequences you pay more to your UI

game<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:47.250> very<00:04:47.310> bad<00:04:47.670> as<00:04:47.790> well<00:04:47.940> at<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.150> graphics

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
game is very bad as well at the graphics

game is very bad as well at the graphics
is<00:04:48.870> backpack<00:04:49.500> is<00:04:49.680> massive<00:04:50.460> I<00:04:50.700> think<00:04:50.940> it's

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
is backpack is massive I think it's

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.600 
is backpack is massive I think it's
carrying<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.450> entire<00:04:52.140> Steve<00:04:52.590> Texas<00:04:53.160> in<00:04:53.310> there

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
carrying the entire Steve Texas in there

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.530 
carrying the entire Steve Texas in there
and<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:54.840> know<00:04:54.990> it<00:04:55.200> is<00:04:55.350> just<00:04:55.760> for<00:04:56.760> its<00:04:56.940> comical

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
and you know it is just for its comical

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.740 
and you know it is just for its comical
really<00:04:57.960> how<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.650> textures<00:04:59.250> look<00:04:59.550> now<00:05:00.060> again<00:05:00.480> I

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
really how the textures look now again I

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.350 
really how the textures look now again I
think<00:05:01.110> this<00:05:01.410> is<00:05:01.560> alpha<00:05:01.980> gameplay<00:05:02.160> not<00:05:03.120> quite

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
think this is alpha gameplay not quite

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.020 
think this is alpha gameplay not quite
sure<00:05:03.390> but<00:05:03.870> if<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:04.830> is<00:05:05.010> then<00:05:05.430> hopefully<00:05:05.880> that

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
sure but if it is then hopefully that

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.390 
sure but if it is then hopefully that
will<00:05:06.090> change<00:05:06.150> that<00:05:06.720> now<00:05:07.560> here<00:05:07.860> we<00:05:07.980> see<00:05:08.160> is

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
will change that now here we see is

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.330 
will change that now here we see is
actually<00:05:08.550> firing<00:05:09.030> is<00:05:09.410> unsilenced<00:05:10.410> weapon<00:05:11.130> and

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
actually firing is unsilenced weapon and
