 most open television chain that 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.650
 we never need curry zest from 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.590
 orange and ginger ok is the first thing that 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.970
 I'm going to add the ginger ginger the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.530
 curry 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:22.110
 and the zest as soon as I feel that 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.480
 odors come out 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.120
 it's time to add water 30 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.430
 seconds 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.700

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.579
 direct 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.980
 you can see the pepillo mixture 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.530
 and here we can see this type of rice is 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.420
 a long grain rice 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.100
 this time I'm using type 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.379
 morelos ok 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.960
 were the morelos do not go up very well for 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.170
 make this recipe remember that there 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.989
 several types of rice there is a we 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.049
 chiquito and chubby and is the tree yo and 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.780
 how about this has a high content in 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:02.640
 starch is risotto awareness ok 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.799
 although then we also have one that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.360
 it seems a lot that is with which they do the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.460
 sushi that is also the short and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.610
 chubby 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.740
 and we have is the var matin that is a lot 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.530
 more skinny than this and used a lot 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.619
 for the hindu food ok all the manidos 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.750
 See if you know how to use slaves 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.560
 some of you have some starting to take 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.240
 I like to see and appreciate the income 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.700
 add the scallion tossing 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 sliced ​​cambrai 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.399
 I will add the peppers do not want 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.110
 that smells different and I could have used 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.940
 Butter 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.860
 or oil 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.860
 it's time to add the cauliflower 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.479
 is our star element on the day of 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.039
 today exactly this cross from florets 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.390
 florets size snack you like us 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.179
 make smaller is also very 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.420
 valid and nothing else the cases of water 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.420
 sorry 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.790
 we add the peas and you can see them 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.490
 with peas that are previously pre 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.380
 cooked and come caught what happens is 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.020
 I like the color of the pea that 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.460
 is frozen and we avoid sewing from 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.410
 It's suddenly too late to do the 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.810
 peas and I think the price 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.850
 of the frozen sachet at the price of 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.850
 we have in the market is not worth it 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.690
 and like this in a precaution I'm going to 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.690
 leave the end just 5 minutes away 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.060
 well we do not want the peas 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.850
 no one's consumption or anything else 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.459
 beautiful is redondito perfectly well 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.360
 rich the Chilean is very rich there are kick-off 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.700
 as a statue of the kingfisher and nature 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.180
 it really gives us wonderful things 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.330
 good clever ready that's all we're going to 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.040
 cover what we were going to do a cooking that 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.110
 it's called slow boiling 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.330
 the violent one that means not to put a 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.720
 I'll leave it slightly 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.560
 uncovered to low fire and that's all 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.560
 I'm missing something 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.000
 They had not cast to be cut very 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.040
 pending of me how good it has been to 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.590
 cover our rice cooker and I'm going to 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.840
 leave slightly uncovered so that 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.480

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.150
