00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 we do not have any problem 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.049
 next we are going to 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.460
 we have the index of a rolled sorbet 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.109
 in this case on topics like 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.140
 i do not go to your life 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.060
 we explained a little before the operation of 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.810
 after having left out the perforated vale 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.970
 i 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.970
 it's very easy it's just a couple of little things 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:29.759
 percent 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:30.739
 to get started 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.780
 the sorbet we have the base is worth the base by the way in it recipes to the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.360
 notes and I as a tutor or facilitate what you need 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720
 happy easy, I do not think 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.230
 interesting to do 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.500
 what is he the practical module of royalty 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.330
 the container where we will go to the berger inn later with once it is 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.129
 this count 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.930
 although it is a major fire 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170
 and completely dry it's worth 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.140
 that's important because because when we put a 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.990
 something 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.950
 something that is already finished 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.830
 but stabilized 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.390
 the how of some drop of water that only voice 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.490
 in contact with the freezer for a hundred will crystallize tour 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.810
 and that strange feeling remains that does not happen to greater 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.630
 when it returns senate that has as main parquet 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.320
 so 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.640
 clean dry 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.830
 important 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.830
 think that this 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.840
 we're going to get him out of here to a negative machine appears then 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.250
 this is 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.300
 this plastic was 27 degrees right now 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.590
 what happens when we put something 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.270
 at minus 20 degrees api 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.869
 if they thought criticized the judge that will happen in what is going with the edge 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.790
 it's going to melt, that's why it's important 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.990
 the container once clean and completely dry put it in a 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.430
 domestic freezer freezer 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.430
 ap has turned out something else for me 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.620
 that same year 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.980
 on the other hand 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.450
 same process from before the afa machine to machine completely clean 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.320
 and completely dry vale 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.100
 It is very attractive but it is a pity to do 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.970
 spend time and money because he knows he was buying fruit pulp from him 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.319
 depending on what it is because it has a cost 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.809
 and then for a silly thing that there is a 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:17.860
 of the water 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.559
 and what comes 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.559
 so 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:27.900
 these are also mechanical processes if we do it from the beginning 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.679
 in the water test 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:33.219
 dehesa of the muddy ticotin water this water the armpits with the partizán 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.849
 cz well perfectly 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:01.419
 another important thing 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.129
 in us we see here 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.669
 a volume 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.280
 volume of 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.309
 to achieve the goal of the machine not 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:10.349
 What's up 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.620
 us the command said before we are going to all air and 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.869
 deferred 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:18.309
 at the moment the volume 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:21.540
 from the oswaldo turbine he made his idea and decided cold winds 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.719
 we celebrate - we criminalize this part 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.139
 when we take him out for himself 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.989
 does it mean Peruvian josé josé 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.749
 in function of 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:35.909
 to see the brand or system systems that are vertical 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.489
 the same 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.280
 percent and the idea and the boldness of three quarters a little less than three 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:43.699
 fourths and we take it many do not 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:47.139
 right now quite cool within the term all palermo 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:49.020
 pamplona 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.020
 we solve 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.379
 - three quarters 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.099
 in fact everything 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.739
 three quarters valette I'm left with three fingers of security 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.339
 to increase the volume 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:13.219
 I would be in 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.849
 now we close 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.159
 and then the morning already spreads when for example 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.439
 if we do not give 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:22.710
 it does not work 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.770
 is already has no time is on 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.770
 for this goes circling bando fines percent 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.270
 his Mayan heritage will be extended 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.330
 clear mentando emolumentos of the system 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.509
 reservations 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.139
 is already founded we are going to count in a while when it is stopped 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.499
 at the optimum point 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.499
 we will return to 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.249
 have handled the mango sorbet will submit it 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.379
 we have made a plan or before to see how half was half finished 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.360
 big up saints is good we're going let's see 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.659
 the texture that it has 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.659
 we stopped 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.759
 those that are creamy 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.969
 but how good is that of his group that we are malleable 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.629
 talat star to this if we did not have more for heaven or think that this see a 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:27.460
 Hidden camera freezing or serving hits with potatoes this is ideal jácome you 

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:30.689
 a sorbet like that is ideal lending the ones that nobody 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.999
 commented that the newly finished tea would think that this now that it has 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.279
 refrozen 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.580
 min baa by taking one more point of consistency 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.840
 would be to ministerial if we had no more that point of self-information 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.879
 of fairly hard quality 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.789
 and if you do not get to go 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.430
 it is possible that instead of that I would have less to go in three wage sub-categories 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.900
 mazacote without having air 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.830
 and it would not be that while 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.820
 we also agreed that he had handled the container 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.020
 we miss drying it's fine in defense and cooking moisture and this shows 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.749
 frozen 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:04.749
 let's go for him 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:07.909
 we remember that it was for the government 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.939
 in this technique 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:11.479
 It will be cold 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.120
 if you were agenda pro environment in the professional kitchen as a typical 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.409
 degrees of room temperature 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:20.669
 in you we will take you the first shovel until we finish it because that would be 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.150
 candidate 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.050
 slowly 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.710
 these fights a 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.850
 that depends on the commercial brand, so each one has its system that 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.850
 is making good use of that mason system of mechanics 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.460
 as in the waiting is perfect 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.659
 what is going to see is how everything does not 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:46.369
 depending on the progress you have to the side 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:49.369
 if it is a base without luck and lemon that is a base 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.710
 very accused by good that it was different 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.129
 to a homeland base 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:58.129
 just made with kills an English cream or 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:02.089
 says there is no document 

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:03.969
 such work examples 

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:08.080
 percent a sorbet an ice cream of something very citrus for example was something very 

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:10.830
 refreshing like a pineapple 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.830
 Well, man, we have to try a little percent 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.309
 accompany us who repeated the characteristics of each ingredient 

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:21.429
 he saw it for example has very fresh floral nuances and very handsome so 

00:07:21.429 --> 00:07:24.659
 that Maria gave herself a distant dairy base confirming what she would do 

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:26.409
 something very watery 

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:29.710
 with concon in opposite coffee or chocolates and 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.259
 yes I would do it with 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:34.259
 he tried in that dialogue he knocked down a good during the course 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:41.800
 for these prof 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.639
 we warn you well 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:45.909
 for what 

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:49.680
 when we go to have it, let's do what is called having a ball 

00:07:49.679 --> 00:07:50.409
 whatever is 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:53.409
 first because it's a little bit of paper 

00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:00.539
 and good and we could even the deep freeze tapatía 

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:02.050
 one
