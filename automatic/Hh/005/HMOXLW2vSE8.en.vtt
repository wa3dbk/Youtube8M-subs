00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:21.560
 variable variable and kiwi like fruits 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.560
 but more tasty 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:31.090
 and since today 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:39.930
 maricarmen efe h 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:42.040
 farmatodo forms all eyeliner 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.680
 even though I do not like to put on makeup 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.890
 I think the eyeliner is vital 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.890
 for all the girls outlined 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.690
 I'm making up 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.740
 something has to serve this 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.740
 coexistence with you 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:13.410
 for an envoy of eyes you will need 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:15.440
 or a liquid shadow pencil I say that I 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.290
 I said color and a son first color 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.360
 to me personally as you already know no 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.340
 I like dark tones and colors 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.810
 dark tend to close the eye and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.430
 light colors can not open so 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.350
 If you have small eyes then use 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.180
 the light colors so that your eyes will 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.850
 look wide open like kiwi because 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.530
 I have small eyes you know you can 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.780
 choose the color you want to give 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.030
 to delineate you do not have brown 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.010
 Well, if purple, as I have, I can 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.990
 be a stroke that they are throughout all 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.180
 your party always sticky eyelashes 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.400
 but I recommend you start from 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.370
 the set then let's say this is for 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.290
 create a point to go to strength 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.560
 little by little always from the side 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.450
 internal to the external part of how 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.340
 from the middle of the eye there so that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.260
 is bigger and even more open 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.650
 in cute what if we are going to use 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.930
 a pencil tries to always be sharp 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.039
 for this you're going to need a pencil sharpener 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.409
 How is it 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.859
 if you want you can do another way 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:19.219
 fabulous for most eyes 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:19.219
 awake up 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.069
 to make the shoe what he is going to do 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.769
 is to align the outside part all with 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.200
 the final point with your eyebrows that we 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.939
 they will continue this line now to arrive 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.950
 this can already make a longer one 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.560
 short depending on the occasion or the bus 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.750
 what you get a little bit without almost 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.019
 see up is always announced 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.019
 down 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.030
 and if you want to highlight a little more 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.030
 word you can add a shadow 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.580
 to fix that highlighting more you can 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.750
 combine a delineator put on the liquid 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.340
 let it be a color and then with another 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.310
 shadow another color 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.910
 I have to try while I 'm 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.680
 outlining if he has any 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.960
 Anything that is not going to look good 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.220
 in your makeup because you use a cotton swab 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:22.230
 Hyssop tips and removes them is basic 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.230
 it's simple until I do not know how to do
