00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.550
&gt;&gt;Adagio Dazzle: Stop making noise out there,
this is my video!

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.240
[Intro Music]

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.960
&gt;&gt;Jon: Hi everyone! It's Jon

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.179
&gt;&gt;Bin: And Bin

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.070
&gt;&gt;Jon: Pony palooza is getting ready to rock!

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.580
&gt;&gt;Bin: (Laughs) That was bad.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.130
&gt;&gt;Jon: By popular demand look who we are finally
reviewing. We finally got one.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.210
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea, we finally own one!

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.630
It took us forever! Forever to get her

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.839
&gt;&gt;Jon: How about you tell everybody what it
is before we get too far.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:38.980
&gt;&gt;Bin: Oh yea. Okay, so this is the Rainbow
Rocks Adagio Dazzle Equestria Girl.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.860
&gt;&gt;Jon: The singing Adagio Dazzle.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.050
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.030
[Doll sings a short song]

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.200
That's just a little teaser I hope.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.469
&gt;&gt;Jon: Now, if you don't know who Adagio Dazzle
is, she is the leader of the bad girl band

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.350
in Rainbow Rocks. The villains.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.960
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea, she is the head villain.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.880
&gt;&gt;Jon: Now these haven't really shown up in
stores yet.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.840
&gt;&gt;Bin: No.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.860
&gt;&gt;Jon: And when they show up online like on
Amazon or on Hasbro Toy Shop they sell out

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.580
super fast.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.710
We were lucky to nab one and got it just a
few days ago

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.130
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes. She just showed up. So we are
very excited to actually open her up and add

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.049
her to our collection.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.520
&gt;&gt;Jon: I'm sure they will be showing up at
Toys R Us, Target and Wal-Mart very soon.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.320
You have been asking for months for us to
review this. We finally got it. We didn't

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.880
want to pay a crazy amount of money.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.880
&gt;&gt;Bin: No. We didn't want to pay over one
hundred dollars for it. (Laughs)

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.759
&gt;&gt;Jon: (Laughs) We love you guys but we do
have our limits.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:40.310
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.000
&gt;&gt;Jon: Here is the back of the box. There's
Adagio looking as evil as ever and she's thinking

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.630
in song.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.500
&gt;&gt;Bin: (sings) "We've got the music, makes
you move it, got the song that makes you lose

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.009
it..."

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.240
&gt;&gt;Jon: And the description of Adagio is "I'm
going to rock this school and then I'm going

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.490
to take it over!" which pretty much sums it
up.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.000
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea, that pretty much sums up the movie.
(Laughs)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.860
&gt;&gt;Jon: Down in the corner it say "You can
complete the band!" With Sonata and Aria and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.360
we just happen to have them [...]

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.890
&gt;&gt;Bin: Right here

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.050
&gt;&gt;Jon: We are finally going to complete the
trio.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.690
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.000
&gt;&gt;Jon: Bad news for the Equestria Girls

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.840
Now the two pack with Sonata and Aria, we
reviewed it before the movie came out back

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.280
in September or October?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.780
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea, something like that.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.920
&gt;&gt;Jon: We love this set. This is an awesome
set. Now it's on clearance at a lot of stores.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.060
&gt;&gt;Bin: It is. Yea.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.320
&gt;&gt;Jon: So if you don't have these guys already,
go right on down to Target or wherever.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.890
I think the set is fifteen or twenty dollars,
which is a really good buy.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.420
Okay enough talk, let's open up Adagio.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.960
[Doll sings]

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.990
We have Adagio out of the packaging now.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.590
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.550
&gt;&gt;Jon: For accessories, she comes with her
little microphone here on her arm.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.080
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea, I put that there.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.770
&gt;&gt;Jon: She comes with her wings

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.960
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea, I put those there too. Actually
Jon did. (Laughs)

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.380
&gt;&gt;Jon: And her backstage pass

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.970
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.590
&gt;&gt;Jon: Now, you've heard a little snippet
there of what she sings and that's pretty

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.170
much all she sings is little snippets.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.480
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea, so we will go through the three
things.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.620
You've heard one.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.540
[Doll sings]

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.940
Two. (Laughs) Which yes it was the same thing.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:48.260
[Doll Sings]

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.400
&gt;&gt;Jon: And that's it. It's pretty much just
that "Under our Spell" song split up into

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.980
little chunks.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.770
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea, pretty much

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.850
&gt;&gt;Jon: She doesn't say anything evil like
"Hahaha!" or anything. She just sings the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.360
song.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.370
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.320
Which is kind of a disappointment.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.400
I mean it would be kind of cool if she said
something other than the song.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.530
And if the song was just a little bit longer
instead of just a whole bunch of two second

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.830
blurbs.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:56.240
[Doll Sings and Stops Singing]

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.240
&gt;&gt;Jon: So that's how a Dazzlings concert would
go

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.090
&gt;&gt;Bin: (Laughs) Yea!

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.550
&gt;&gt;Jon: They would sing a couple of lines and
then they would have to stop short. (Laughs)

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.410
&gt;&gt;Bin: (Laughs) It's kind of funny.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.020
&gt;&gt;Jon: Well other than that I do like this
doll. It looks really cool.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.900
&gt;&gt;Bin: Me too. I'm very excited to have her
and to put her along with all the other ones

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.270
that we have.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.010
&gt;&gt;Jon: And we have completed the Dazzling's.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.280
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes. The Dazzling's band is complete.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.500
&gt;&gt;Jon: They are ready to cause some havoc
at Canterlot High.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.770
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes. Good thing that we have that stage
so that they can all perform.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.520
&gt;&gt;Jon: Now as a little teaser Bin, I'll hold
onto Adagio here for a second.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.960
&gt;&gt;Bin: Okay.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.850
&gt;&gt;Jon: Not relating to the Dazzling's, but
relating to Rainbow Rocks we have another

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.880
performer who will be taking the stage here
shortly. Stay tuned because coming up in Pony

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.450
Palooza we have the Equestria Girl Rainbow
Rocks Styling Pony set of [...]

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.180
&gt;&gt;Bin: Octavia

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.280
&gt;&gt;Jon: Let's get a quicker look, the lights
are reflecting all over her.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.220
Her dress looks awesome. The doll looks amazing.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.680
And it comes with this pony of Octavia. The
first comb-able, three-inch pony of Octavia.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.550
&gt;&gt;Bin: Woohoo!

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.970
&gt;&gt;Jon: But that's for another day.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.250
&gt;&gt;Adagio: Yea! It's my video!

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.270
[Doll Sings]

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.360
That's right!

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.630
&gt;&gt;Bin: (Laughs)

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.719
[Doll Sings]

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:26.860
&gt;&gt;Jon: Well we better stop this video before
we too are under Adagio's spell and start

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.240
fighting with each other.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.170
Just like in the movie.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.389
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes.

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.460
Because that could happen

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.320
(Laughs)

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.260
&gt;&gt;Jon: No it couldn't. (Laughs)

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.120
&gt;&gt;Bin: (Laughs) Yes it could.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.490
&gt;&gt;Jon: No it couldn't!

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.860
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes it could!

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.550
