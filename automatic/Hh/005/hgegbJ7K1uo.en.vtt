00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.779
 hello how about this time we are going to 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.800
 learn to play a very popular song 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.800
 called the mañanitas 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.449
 good for this song we are going to use 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.640
 four chords let's use the 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:20.640
 age chord 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.310
 that you touch index fourth string second 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.640
 after the middle third string of the second 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.759
 fret and cancel second string third the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.680
 second fret we are going to touch the love of 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.510
 my 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.920
 index between is remembered the first 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.920
 fret half interpose the 2nd the second 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.770
 fret and cancel fourth string and the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.490
 second fret we are going to play also in 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.820
 network chords 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.090
 index of third string second fret 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.270
 medium first second fret string and 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.540
 cancel second string third fret and 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.900
 Finally the chord of the seven is 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.970
 just take it by releasing the finger 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.280
 medium if that means that nothing else 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.210
 we would be pushing the fourth for the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.030
 second fret and the second string in the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.190
 second fret and to learn them 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.350
 we will easily divide the song into 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.170
 four parts the first part is the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.500
 next for the first part we're going to 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.619
 use this rhythm let's press the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.280
 low for example for the chord of the 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.280
 has fifth string 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.490
 and twice down to the agreed 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:39.700
 of me we are going to press the bass in the sixth 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.700
 rope 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.700
 and twice down strum and the 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.579
 chord d 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.819
 let's press the bass of the third 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.819
 rope 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.799
 and twice down 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.649
 ok the first part of the song is in 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.680
 the one that starts with the universe these are 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.380
 the mañanitas and we are going to touch of this 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.380
 way 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.380
 Y 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.170
 ah 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.610
 i 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.870
 the second part is very similar with the 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.800
 same rhythm but the succession of chords 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.220
 is next 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.190
 the verse that we will be touching is 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.650
 wake up my well awake and start 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.740
 immediately after the first 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.740
 part with this succession of chords 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.780
 ah 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.220
 i 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.230
 and there immediately begins the third 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.750
 part the third part we are going to 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.880
 treat two bass for each chord and in the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.720
 case we're going to play the first bass 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.720
 on the fifth string 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.450
 after this rope 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.209
 for the case of my bumpy 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.910
 and for network case it's the same 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.460
 in case of network the lows and also the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.780
 door on the fifth string ok let's 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.840
 play this rhythm in a more 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.640
 fast for the third part 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.000
 and it's the verse that says how pretty the 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.880
 tomorrow and the succession of chords is the 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.840
 following 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.650
 plus 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.650
 ah 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.330
 yes 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.460
 two 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.980
 and there begins the fourth part the fourth 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.910
 part we will use the agreement of the 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.480
 7 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.630
 let's use the same rhythm and it's the 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.320
 verse tells us it is coming dawn of 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.320
 this way 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.370
 A) Yes 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.780
 and good in the hands there is a great 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:25.070
 number of verses that follow that you can 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.660
 add using the third and fourth 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.330
 part of what we have learned 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.730
 using the four parts and putting together 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.730
 the without interruption would remain like this 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.400
 ah 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.910
 i 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.910
 and 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.490
 Y 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.680
 no no 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.760
 yes 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.550
 yes 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.660
 i 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.740
 Y 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.220
 to 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:50.740
 and you 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.710
 Y 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.480
 Y 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.120

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.310

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.440

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.840
 you have not been able to learn to play
