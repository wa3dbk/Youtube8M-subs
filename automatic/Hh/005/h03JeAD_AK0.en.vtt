it<00:00:39.960> kind<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.440> goes<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.710> this

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.229

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
very slowly because I haven't actually

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.700 
very slowly because I haven't actually
seen<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.540> transcribed<00:01:07.200> anywhere<00:01:07.560> so

Cameron you want to come around and

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.719 
Cameron you want to come around and
we're<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.440> key<00:01:10.620> of<00:01:10.650> C<00:01:10.950> which<00:01:11.220> always<00:01:11.520> makes

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we're in the key of C which always makes

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.230 
we're in the key of C which always makes
it<00:01:11.880> slightly<00:01:12.590> simpler<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.880> goes<00:01:15.030> like

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
it slightly simpler and it goes like

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:24.700 
it slightly simpler and it goes like
this<00:01:15.270> okay<00:01:19.100> I'll<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.220> that

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:35.260 

chromatic<00:01:25.710> riff<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.160> very<00:01:26.340> common<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.790> boogie

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.289 

Perl<00:01:36.270> this

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:53.700 

Oh

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.390 

Oh

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.770 

difficult<00:01:58.400> to<00:01:58.460> get<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.670> rhythm<00:01:58.940> of<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.090> when

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
difficult to get the rhythm of that when

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.440 
difficult to get the rhythm of that when
I'm<00:01:59.930> playing<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.260> socially<00:02:00.620> ugly<00:02:01.240> but<00:02:02.240> if<00:02:02.360> you

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
I'm playing it socially ugly but if you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.880 
I'm playing it socially ugly but if you
speed<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.780> up<00:02:02.810> you'll<00:02:03.080> get<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.260> other<00:02:03.350> you'll

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
speed it up you'll get the other you'll

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:13.500 
speed it up you'll get the other you'll
get<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.130> idea

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.369 

and<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:16.000> moderately<00:02:16.659> it<00:02:16.810> goes<00:02:16.959> like<00:02:17.200> this

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
and so this moderately it goes like this

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:54.320 
and so this moderately it goes like this
if<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.709> speed<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:17.950> up<00:02:18.099> slightly

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.650 

and<00:02:54.810> then

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.570 

and<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:02.320> forth<00:03:02.680> that's<00:03:02.980> pretty<00:03:03.160> much<00:03:03.370> all<00:03:03.520> I

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
and so forth that's pretty much all I

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.890 
and so forth that's pretty much all I
wanted<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.880> show<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.060> today<00:03:04.330> camera<00:03:04.720> person

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
wanted to show you today camera person

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.940 
wanted to show you today camera person

doesn't know where she's going
sorry<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:07.210> that's<00:03:07.960> just<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.350> kind<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.620> that's<00:03:08.770> a

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
sorry so that's just a kind of that's a

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.470 
sorry so that's just a kind of that's a
rift<00:03:09.100> that<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.400> remember<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.730> learned<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.210> when

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
rift that I remember I learned that when

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.500 
rift that I remember I learned that when
quite<00:03:11.320> kind<00:03:11.740> of<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.890> long<00:03:12.040> time<00:03:12.250> ago<00:03:12.550> before<00:03:12.730> you

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
quite kind of a long time ago before you

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.690 
quite kind of a long time ago before you
know<00:03:13.630> we<00:03:13.750> had<00:03:13.930> buoy<00:03:14.490> transcriptions<00:03:15.490> and<00:03:15.580> I

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
know we had buoy transcriptions and I

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.300 
know we had buoy transcriptions and I
had<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.150> old<00:03:16.420> vinyl<00:03:17.320> record<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.040> played

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
had the old vinyl record and I played

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.370 
had the old vinyl record and I played
that<00:03:18.490> ages<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.150> get<00:03:19.270> that<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.690> me<00:03:19.810> ages<00:03:20.230> and

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
that ages to get that to me ages and

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.590 
that ages to get that to me ages and
that's<00:03:21.040> probably<00:03:21.340> not<00:03:21.610> exactly<00:03:21.940> how<00:03:22.270> Albert

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
that's probably not exactly how Albert

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.910 
that's probably not exactly how Albert
Amin's<00:03:22.900> plays<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.440> I<00:03:23.500> mean<00:03:23.620> there's<00:03:23.800> probably

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
Amin's plays it I mean there's probably

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.530 
Amin's plays it I mean there's probably
a<00:03:24.130> couple<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.460> notes<00:03:24.670> ever<00:03:24.910> I'm<00:03:25.120> not<00:03:25.300> doing

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
a couple of notes ever I'm not doing

if you listen to dr. John's version of
Pinetops<00:04:02.920> boogie<00:04:03.010> it's<00:04:04.000> completely

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
Pinetops boogie it's completely

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.120 
Pinetops boogie it's completely
different<00:04:04.600> from<00:04:04.870> Pinetops<00:04:05.380> boogie<00:04:05.440> actually

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
different from Pinetops boogie actually

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.300 
different from Pinetops boogie actually
but<00:04:06.850> it's<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.420> think<00:04:08.020> it's<00:04:08.110> actually<00:04:08.200> better<00:04:08.530> so

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
but it's I think it's actually better so

but it's I think it's actually better so
don't<00:04:09.760> be<00:04:10.090> afraid<00:04:10.960> of<00:04:11.260> not<00:04:11.410> doing<00:04:11.650> exactly<00:04:11.890> the
