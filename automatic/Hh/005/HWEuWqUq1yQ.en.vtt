00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.799
 herrera 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.990
 the idea arises from two years a human group we will be able to so many 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.060
 of their forwards 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.230
 some of us have experience as work by wall street country 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.050
 and because of that good 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.230
 we saw that we could apply another type of social policy such as construction 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.310
 of modest homes 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.020
 through it arises through which we contact ibaka and is that the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.110
 founder of tous a movement 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.399
 and well that wine we contacted 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.879
 that event and uruguay 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.740
 the technique is applied 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.200
 and a conference to rivals as well as the initial combat for all this 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.230
 and after that we started another good goal with the collection of bottle 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.920
 be mentioned the bottles 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.060
 this city has a lot of time are a long time 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.610
 but good the idea is to contribute to go adding forces adding people have to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.720
 be that peeks between the neighbors 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.800
 we 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.410
 mainly what moves us is to present a response society 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.290
 we are brilliant and professional men 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.910
 denounces the republic 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.220
 if we want to give our evolution in society 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.220
 I think everything that they had not given that they do not have opportunities 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.970
 later now it is what it seems and giving this already we begin with the contact with 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.050
 Intendance 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.640
 to see the subject the land because here the house does not because we can not build 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.250
 here 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.690
 because this land is not sustainable for the project 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.500
 for the theme of the flood as the unit 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.700
 likewise in a house that comes your name in the best conditions 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.770
 how to go 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.960
 they are like any other family in sos mujuru boasso who can not afford a 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.220
 rent that have no way of sustaining other means of living 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.350
 fiat to become a house as they can 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.700
 and because of that that has not moved because we know that they continue to use 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.440
 country 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.900
 in which some of us were 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.810
 and from there, but it is a committed family that are going to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.420
 compromise with the project because that's the idea the ts also continued 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.899
 us what we 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.729
 we are not going to build the house but 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:17.429
 We are going to give you a hand to build your own house as a result of 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.509
 all deposits of money 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:21.499
 manacor that city 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.439
 do not vote to depend on the typology of 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.439
 percent depends on gandia members must the family 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.869
 of us we bet that it does not have a neighborhood commission 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.509
 therefore it would still be 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.029
 the room for the couple 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.409
 and on Thursday depending on the children who have to see how many rooms are 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.529
 necessary for the family 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:45.529
 santiago from September until they use the house they have made are between 20 thousand and 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:47.199
 25 thousand bottles 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.080
 that's why it's a 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.300
 a work that that step to the time and in addition our consulate of complain 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.579
 Well, in the easiest part 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.889
 if it is not serious then r senate 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.329
 where there is or not crime 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.539
 it will not be betting on youth participation 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.609
 we bet on smartphones percent materials of all kinds of local what 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.439
 same as a normal house 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.629
 the difference of this house is good to replace the brick or the block by 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:11.509
 bottles 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:13.830
 what can not be asked of human 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.799
 but because we are not a material 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.949
 we also have to see the ecological part of all this blind today in 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.579
 day the problem of otsc the plastic 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.909
 it is difficult is to act follow it not a good way to that that residue 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.409
 i by this neither tone was also the subject of environment 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.639
 the matter that was cited the house will be the same for winning and nothing 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.169
 sheet for the roof silly the same material is nothing but as they go 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.560
 use in less quantity because it inhibits that you use a special mixture to paste 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:42.929
 the bottle just 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:46.739
 and good is reduced the cost was case is reduced by at least 50% 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.519
 and we are also betting the donation even if it is real and costs and would have 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.619
 to be almost zero 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:56.189
 and well what he told us that more or less are in 5 thousand dollars 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.939
 but bah baden depend on percent and the materials when stories that is the 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:03.709
 experience was already dying 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.280
 but they were 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.099
 let's see exactly what we want to apply here to see if sustainable 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.989
 study how the area is made long 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.309
 the house of if the material and resistant 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.499
 but that detainees have more than six houses made in Bolivia 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.190
 i good 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.020
 So far it has given you slim result 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.630
 how does the process the good house of all we started with the theme of the 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.580
 pickup we went to the top to collect for the country houses we started 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.750
 to join hunger boats through internet environment taking police to stop 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.879
 subject of joining bottles together 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:40.589
 and after we have now we have to dwarf the person of 35 thousand or 20 

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:42.330
 thousand mothers give the house 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.539
 begins to review the whole bottle with dirt full rubble that's why it all serves 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.529
 that neighbor who has debris and that also serves to 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.139
 this hand can come from any side and for any reason because 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.930
 we have the votes to reservations 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.169
 what we do is also Cuban got the ground that fundamental 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.990
 without the ground we can not control gaza 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.180
 and from there to make the foundations 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.490
 just as any house will depend on the land of the study of the earth 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.960
 decorate delays and lie what is done is perhaps the material resents 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.249
 they behave sand 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.839
 percent iÃ±igo use several element like sugar salt a whole 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:18.410
 little bit 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.900
 all because the common material or hitting boats 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.129
 then there that they have clarified and with the goal of 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.249
 for because they asked and then rationed like the seas and if it ends with 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:31.549
 a sheet metal roof labor will depend on ponce the house as always 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:36.819
 but we estimate that between 10 and 15 people we can build the house in 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:38.089
 less than a month 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:39.809
 everything depends if we have materials
