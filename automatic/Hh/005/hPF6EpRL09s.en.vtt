 christmas gift and ben if 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.750
 firstly for those who do not have 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.640
 the collector's edition a car of 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 the collector's edition how the voice and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.780
 then lacoste m and for the others all 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.489
 the world that will be the robben case then 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.489
 to do this we go on the internet we go 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:03.119
 in legendary we look we see well 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.860
 that the knife hood is not available 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.810
 for the pure and simple reason we did not 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.000
 not the collecting nose but for 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:16.200
 wise and mopti glitch just for you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.939
 we choose the ligier 1,8 and what will 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.520
 have to do is change this 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.630
 address there so there you see cards 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.310
 and at 27 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.770
 we have to modify our to do this we 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.020
 done on home and here I will do 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.789
 because it takes spam b and has the same 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.070
 time must however not arise 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.729
 but until the page appears and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.729
 I'm going to miss 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.430
 and that's how it looks so we're coming back on 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.430
 the places r8 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.850
 we do as we sweat bea 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.910
 time bp has at the same time several times 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.010
 cox appeared is good need to edit 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.030
 the 27 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.430
 so you see knows in the bar 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:07.850
 addressed little changed so we delete 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:11.600
 the 27th and we may 29 instead we do 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.520
 go back to the little virtual keyboard and 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.140
 there we see the high naïve but it's not 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.320
 won because you see that we can 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.150
 not order it but I have the trick 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.100
 so we have to change this again 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.580
 beard address by something so we 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.080
 do as we swoon bea 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.950
 until appear again 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:38.239
 our page and there we will replace cars 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:39.739
 detail 29 not purtschert because what 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.120
 lets buy the car so we 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.120
 erase because this detail 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.410
 we do not write to the chairs anymore 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.030
 because 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.970
 we enter valid and there we see the small 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.130
 second message goes that tells us that 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.830
 we will deliver the car in 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.970
 the garage 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.770
 so I immediately specify you 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.330
 you can see that the 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.130
 car we do not see it in the gard 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.820
 she took a place in garage but 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.010
 we do not see one to be able to 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.980
 see you go a losc this volume since the 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.990
 goal is to customize it we will call 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.660
 the mechanic to get us the book 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:36.990
 you see well that I'm making them the 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:40.000
 losc this tome we do this custom crowd 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:46.330
 so there I spent a lot of money 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.310
 to customize it and so that's it 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.000
 this little concern is that as we did not 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.500
 not the collector's edition we will not see 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.890
 unfortunately the car in the 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.560
 garage 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.230
 but well the goal being the voice for 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.780
 whoever wanted this tip you 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.090
 allows the way every time you 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.610
 want them with you walk from where he 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.830
 just call your mechanic and then 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.120
 will deliver you the car so once 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.989
 that you have completely custom the 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.940
 car you go back put it in the 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.620
 garage 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.690
 so to bring it down garage is 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.980
 the same method as all the others 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.210
 cars that existed before we 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.010
 could not go in because there you 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.690
 see if I want to go back to school 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.940
 of course that will put me the message 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.490
 that's how I do not have the thing 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.010
 I have to buy the stuff and that's it 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.950
 so it's okay for her to 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:43.110
 garage we do as usual between 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:46.320
 take a car on spring 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.820
 and she'll be in your garage at once. 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.680
 new and every time you 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.740
 want to use it just 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.350
 to call the mechanic and to choose the 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.840
 cnef and will you come the pound is 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.000
 now the second little surprise 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:10.020
 the second little Kabul gift is the 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:11.070
 cargo bob so for the cargo bob out there 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.870
 I was still doing there 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.060
 matter to get the car in 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.950
 the garage to the and that we see well 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.870
 that she is not there 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:23.760
 unfortunately so see here is yes to 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.110
 the big fun but it's okay I'm going 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.690
 let the video she's done on the 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.460
 heap so you see well whenever 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.760
 I want my car 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:36.330
 I call our mechanics and bring me back 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.430
 car so now yes the others 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.770
 who wait because bob cargo bob everything 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.340
 in cargo bob we spent good cargö 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.060
 so the same we go on the internet we go on 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.370
 the war stocks 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.690
 here we see that there is no cargo bob 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.120
 since the cargo ship bob dole underwater and 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.210
 must be here we will take the vehicle 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:59.880
 which is right before in the solo which is 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:03.270
 the bar so axis on the address barracks 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.430
 its marks and tiles 3 when in 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.420
 looking at the solo the cargo bug these 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.980
 details 5 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.140
 so you understood it just 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:15.420
 change the 3 by five 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:17.310
 so to do these men we go on 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.870
 the bard addresses one beats himself bea 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.570
 time until it appears 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:25.650
 the ability to change the address on 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:31.229
 modify the 3par 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:33.090
 5 we validate and there we can surprise you 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.240
 buy the cargo bob for the sum 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.240
 indicated 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.960
 we click here we buy pegasus 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:44.610
 confirms that we bought it is 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.400
 hence when you need a 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.030
 bob and ben frame is not a beautiful 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.639

 I was able to play with a lot of you 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.370
 we had pleasant moments of 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:36.419
 moments of delirium and frankly I 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:38.849
 think I have a small project to do 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:41.820
 a video with its subscribers at the same time 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:43.229
 I could not have everyone and 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.720
 I promise you and there you see 

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:47.340

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.960
 I call pegasus I dismiss boboc
