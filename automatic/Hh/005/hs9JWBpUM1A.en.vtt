or excuse me my spinning tunnel vortex
is<00:00:48.989> trademarked<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:51.620> anyway<00:00:52.879> that's<00:00:53.879> it

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
is trademarked so anyway that's it

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.590 
is trademarked so anyway that's it
regularly<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.610> splattered<00:00:57.000> some<00:00:57.180> paint<00:00:57.420> all

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
regularly just splattered some paint all

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.330 
regularly just splattered some paint all
the<00:00:57.690> way<00:00:57.750> across<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.680> decided<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
the way across it and then I decided to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.270 
the way across it and then I decided to
put<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.579> some<00:00:59.760> lines<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.500> don't<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.680> if

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
put on some lines I don't know if

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.009 
put on some lines I don't know if
painting<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.670> lines<00:01:02.940> was<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> good<00:01:03.539> idea<00:01:03.690> or

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
painting the lines was a good idea or

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.950 
painting the lines was a good idea or
not<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:05.100> too<00:01:05.280> late<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:07.430> I<00:01:08.540> got<00:01:09.540> into<00:01:09.750> MIT

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
not but it's too late now I got into MIT

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.100 
not but it's too late now I got into MIT
doing<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.100> thing<00:01:11.369> by<00:01:12.119> yourself<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:15.110> real

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
doing this thing by yourself is a real

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.690 
doing this thing by yourself is a real
pain<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.950> butt

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
pain in the butt

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300 
pain in the butt
we<00:01:18.180> definitely<00:01:18.450> need<00:01:18.810> two<00:01:19.259> people<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.830> not

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
we definitely need two people if not

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.679 
we definitely need two people if not
more<00:01:20.689> to<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:22.259> set<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.650> thing<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.460> had<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
more to to set this thing up I had the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:32.230 
more to to set this thing up I had the
the<00:01:25.610> railing<00:01:28.579> fabricated<00:01:29.579> at<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.320> metal<00:01:31.320> shop

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
the railing fabricated at a metal shop

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.560 
the railing fabricated at a metal shop
one-inch<00:01:33.240> square<00:01:33.540> pipe<00:01:34.350> or<00:01:35.310> tube<00:01:35.610> whatever

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
one-inch square pipe or tube whatever

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.280 
one-inch square pipe or tube whatever
and<00:01:37.790> of<00:01:38.790> course<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.450> thought<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.110> would<00:01:40.259> be

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and of course I thought that would be

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140 
and of course I thought that would be
easy<00:01:40.650> considering<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.700> somebody

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
easy considering that somebody

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.710 
easy considering that somebody
professionally<00:01:42.750> does<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.560> stuff<00:01:43.860> but

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
professionally does this stuff but

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.850 
professionally does this stuff but
evidently<00:01:45.720> they<00:01:46.320> don't<00:01:46.500> know<00:01:46.590> how<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.740> make

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
evidently they don't know how to make

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.950 
evidently they don't know how to make
around<00:01:47.159> Sarco<00:01:47.640> calls<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.420> some<00:01:48.750> flat

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
around Sarco calls there are some flat

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.639 
around Sarco calls there are some flat
spots<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.500> there<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:50.670> especially<00:01:51.000> where

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
spots in there like especially where

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.910 
spots in there like especially where
these<00:01:52.649> two<00:01:52.860> pieces<00:01:53.119> join<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.329> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
these two pieces join in so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.090 
these two pieces join in so
it's<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.310> flat<00:01:56.490> spot<00:01:57.170> but<00:01:58.170> it'll<00:01:58.620> work

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it's a flat spot but it'll work

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.280 
it's a flat spot but it'll work
I<00:01:59.130> hope<00:01:59.960> it's<00:02:00.960> about<00:02:01.110> 20<00:02:01.620> feet<00:02:01.650> low<00:02:03.140> there's<00:02:04.140> my

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
I hope it's about 20 feet low there's my

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.669 
I hope it's about 20 feet low there's my
bridge<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> got<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> make<00:02:08.119> standout<00:02:09.679> make

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
bridge so you got a make standout make

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.610 
bridge so you got a make standout make
steps<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:11.670> ramp<00:02:11.880> for<00:02:12.870> wheelchair

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
steps and a ramp for wheelchair

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.320 
steps and a ramp for wheelchair
accessible<00:02:14.070> people<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.760> got<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.000> build<00:02:15.180> up

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
accessible people so I got to build up

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.480 
accessible people so I got to build up
the<00:02:15.510> handrails<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:16.950> going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.220> paint<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
the handrails so going to paint the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.530 
the handrails so going to paint the
floor<00:02:19.010> attach<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.340> black<00:02:20.700> box<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
floor attach the black box to the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.960 
floor attach the black box to the
railing<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:22.860> I'll<00:02:22.980> do<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.280> once<00:02:23.640> I

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
railing of it but I'll do that once I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.940 
railing of it but I'll do that once I
get<00:02:24.240> this<00:02:24.510> thing<00:02:24.780> moved<00:02:25.320> in<00:02:25.470> its<00:02:25.590> proper

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
get this thing moved in its proper

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.930 
get this thing moved in its proper
location<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:27.560> that's<00:02:28.560> another<00:02:28.800> pains<00:02:29.610> but

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
location and that's another pains but

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.250 
location and that's another pains but
because<00:02:31.160> where<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.280> sits<00:02:32.520> at<00:02:32.670> right<00:02:32.850> now<00:02:33.260> it's

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
because where it sits at right now it's

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.479 
because where it sits at right now it's
not<00:02:34.470> where<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:34.800> going<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.010> stay

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
not where it's going to stay

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.550 
not where it's going to stay
which<00:02:35.700> means<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.150> got<00:02:36.480> disassembled<00:02:37.410> this

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
which means I got disassembled this

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.600 
which means I got disassembled this
whole<00:02:37.739> thing<00:02:37.980> by<00:02:38.190> myself

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
whole thing by myself

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.840 
whole thing by myself
and<00:02:40.040> relocate<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.310> where<00:02:41.550> I'm<00:02:41.610> going<00:02:41.670> to

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
and relocate it to where I'm going to

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.900 
and relocate it to where I'm going to
put<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.480> black<00:02:42.690> light<00:02:42.959> room<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.370> house

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
put the black light room so house

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.699 
put the black light room so house
actually<00:02:45.330> hoping<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.660> put<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.230> thing<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.620> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
actually hoping to put this thing in the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.800 
actually hoping to put this thing in the
middle<00:02:46.890> or<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.670> whole<00:02:47.820> maze<00:02:48.060> but<00:02:48.480> now<00:02:48.660> it

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
middle or the whole maze but now it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.140 
middle or the whole maze but now it
doesn't<00:02:48.959> look<00:02:49.110> like<00:02:49.230> I'm<00:02:49.500> going<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.709> do<00:02:49.800> that

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
doesn't look like I'm going to do that

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.610 
doesn't look like I'm going to do that
and<00:02:51.150> put<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.540> outside<00:02:51.660> because<00:02:52.320> I<00:02:52.530> have

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
and put it to the outside because I have

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.330 
and put it to the outside because I have
to<00:02:52.680> paint<00:02:52.860> up<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.130> me<00:02:53.250> wall<00:02:53.489> panels<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:55.340> fix

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
to paint up to me wall panels to fix

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.660 
to paint up to me wall panels to fix
this<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:57.709> next<00:02:58.709> year<00:02:58.920> he'll<00:02:59.130> be<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.400> middle

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
this so next year he'll be in the middle

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.289 
this so next year he'll be in the middle
of<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.480> whole<00:03:01.049> maze<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:02.250> that'll<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.060> better

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
of the whole maze so that'll be better

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.539 
of the whole maze so that'll be better
but<00:03:04.260> anyway<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.709> little<00:03:05.070> bit<00:03:05.250> more<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.489> the

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
but anyway a little bit more of the

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:15.800 
but anyway a little bit more of the
tunnel<00:03:07.970> used<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:10.459> treadmill<00:03:11.459> for

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.890 

can't<00:03:16.680> see<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:16.950> down<00:03:17.460> there<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.120> treadmill

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
can't see it down there is the treadmill

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.310 
can't see it down there is the treadmill
the<00:03:19.170> drive<00:03:20.070> gear<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.640> actually<00:03:21.150> up<00:03:21.810> against

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
the drive gear is actually up against

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.080 
the drive gear is actually up against
the<00:03:22.730> metal<00:03:23.730> PO<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:26.040> polishes<00:03:26.520> kind

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
the metal PO and so that polishes kind

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.990 
the metal PO and so that polishes kind
of<00:03:27.210> resting<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.990> little<00:03:28.020> bit<00:03:28.350> on<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.880> they<00:03:29.880> use

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
of resting a little bit on it they use

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.190 
of resting a little bit on it they use
put<00:03:33.000> over<00:03:33.240> inch<00:03:34.940> tool<00:03:35.940> box<00:03:36.150> pulley<00:03:36.960> wheels

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
put over inch tool box pulley wheels

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.650 
put over inch tool box pulley wheels
whatever<00:03:37.800> you<00:03:37.890> want<00:03:38.010> out<00:03:38.130> on<00:03:38.460> there<00:03:39.270> so<00:03:39.480> their

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
whatever you want out on there so their

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.210 
whatever you want out on there so their
ball<00:03:39.840> bearing<00:03:40.880> so<00:03:41.880> their<00:03:42.030> work<00:03:42.210> pretty<00:03:42.450> well

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
ball bearing so their work pretty well

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.050 
ball bearing so their work pretty well
so<00:03:44.220> they<00:03:44.340> didn't<00:03:44.550> know<00:03:44.610> how<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:44.820> thing's

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
so they didn't know how this thing's

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.060 
so they didn't know how this thing's
going<00:03:45.240> to<00:03:45.330> turn<00:03:45.510> out<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:45.960> made<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.590> base<00:03:46.740> of<00:03:46.980> it

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
going to turn out I made the base of it

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.210 
going to turn out I made the base of it
out<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.220> wood<00:03:47.990> it<00:03:48.990> turns<00:03:49.290> out<00:03:49.410> our<00:03:49.440> out<00:03:49.770> next

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
out of wood it turns out our out next

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.170 
out of wood it turns out our out next
year<00:03:50.400> best<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:51.510> some<00:03:51.630> steel<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.940> make<00:03:53.940> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
year best and some steel and make the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.340 
year best and some steel and make the
whole<00:03:54.360> bottom<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:55.050> it

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
whole bottom of it

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.210 
whole bottom of it
steel<00:03:56.240> so<00:03:57.240> right<00:03:57.990> there<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.680> main

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
steel so right there is the main

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.370 

here<00:04:27.780> we<00:04:27.900> go<00:04:28.400> there's<00:04:29.400> it's<00:04:29.580> not<00:04:30.020> fully<00:04:31.020> dark

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
here we go there's it's not fully dark

yet still going to put on some in panels
on<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:36.770> hopefully<00:04:37.770> it'll<00:04:38.660> turn<00:04:39.660> out<00:04:39.720> all<00:04:39.900> right

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
on it hopefully it'll turn out all right

on it hopefully it'll turn out all right
see<00:04:41.430> if<00:04:41.460> I<00:04:41.580> can<00:04:41.730> walk<00:04:41.910> through<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.300> thing

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
see if I can walk through this thing

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.360 
see if I can walk through this thing
without<00:04:42.780> following<00:04:43.350> over<00:04:43.500> because<00:04:43.889> this<00:04:44.160> is

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
without following over because this is

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.280 
without following over because this is

the first time that I've turned it on
after<00:04:46.830> I've<00:04:47.120> painted<00:04:48.120> it

you<00:05:07.810> gotta<00:05:07.960> figure<00:05:08.140> out<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.410> best<00:05:08.590> way

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
you gotta figure out the best way

you gotta figure out the best way
walkthrough<00:05:11.350> so<00:05:11.770> not<00:05:12.280> this<00:05:13.060> way<00:05:13.330> oh<00:05:13.570> yeah<00:05:13.870> that

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
walkthrough so not this way oh yeah that

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.490 
walkthrough so not this way oh yeah that
lady's<00:05:14.440> better<00:05:15.300> so<00:05:16.300> I<00:05:16.390> guess<00:05:16.690> walking<00:05:17.380> this

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
lady's better so I guess walking this

got the roller blade wheels kind of
keeping<00:05:50.230> it<00:05:50.350> right<00:05:50.950> down<00:05:51.220> there<00:05:54.210> when<00:05:55.210> touches

a<00:05:56.200> wheel<00:05:56.410> need<00:05:56.890> to<00:05:56.980> be<00:05:57.100> adjusted<00:05:57.580> a<00:05:57.640> little<00:05:57.850> bit

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
a wheel need to be adjusted a little bit

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.750 
a wheel need to be adjusted a little bit
because<00:05:59.650> I<00:05:59.830> have<00:05:59.860> cut<00:06:00.280> on<00:06:00.400> this<00:06:00.580> thing

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
because I have cut on this thing

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.370 
because I have cut on this thing
numerous<00:06:01.180> times<00:06:02.370> this<00:06:03.370> isn't<00:06:03.760> the<00:06:03.880> final

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
numerous times this isn't the final

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.020 
numerous times this isn't the final
outcome<00:06:05.380> yet<00:06:05.670> still<00:06:06.670> a<00:06:06.730> couple<00:06:06.880> of

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
outcome yet still a couple of

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.760 
outcome yet still a couple of
modifications<00:06:07.240> I'll<00:06:07.750> do<00:06:07.930> to<00:06:08.110> one<00:06:08.440> side<00:06:08.470> move

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
modifications I'll do to one side move

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:19.110 
modifications I'll do to one side move
it<00:06:11.610> that's<00:06:12.610> it<00:06:13.000> once<00:06:13.840> the<00:06:15.600> spinning<00:06:16.600> tunnel

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.460 

as<00:06:20.120> you<00:06:20.300> can<00:06:20.360> see<00:06:20.539> it<00:06:20.630> does<00:06:20.810> slow<00:06:21.020> down<00:06:21.050> every

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
as you can see it does slow down every

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.719 
as you can see it does slow down every
now<00:06:21.620> and<00:06:21.830> then<00:06:21.919> I<00:06:23.740> may<00:06:24.740> place<00:06:25.130> the<00:06:25.250> drive<00:06:25.490> gear

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
now and then I may place the drive gear

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.189 
now and then I may place the drive gear
on<00:06:25.940> it<00:06:25.970> next<00:06:26.419> year<00:06:26.599> with<00:06:26.690> a<00:06:26.750> different<00:06:27.020> type<00:06:27.169> of

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
on it next year with a different type of

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.520 
on it next year with a different type of
motor<00:06:27.530> but<00:06:28.310> at<00:06:29.240> the<00:06:29.389> start<00:06:29.599> considering<00:06:30.289> the

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
motor but at the start considering the

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.050 
motor but at the start considering the
first<00:06:30.650> time<00:06:30.860> I<00:06:30.889> ever<00:06:31.009> built<00:06:31.639> one<00:06:31.910> of<00:06:31.940> these

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
first time I ever built one of these

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.330 
first time I ever built one of these
things<00:06:32.389> and<00:06:32.720> I'm<00:06:33.199> tired<00:06:33.530> of<00:06:33.680> fooling<00:06:33.800> with<00:06:34.130> it

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340

and<00:06:46.509> have<00:06:47.509> to<00:06:47.599> prop<00:06:47.810> up<00:06:47.840> the<00:06:47.990> ladder<00:06:48.289> up

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:48.979 
and have to prop up the ladder up

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:51.040 
and have to prop up the ladder up
against<00:06:49.460> it<00:06:49.610> try<00:06:49.819> to<00:06:49.880> balance<00:06:50.330> it<00:06:50.660> is<00:06:50.780> and

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050
