00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.180
 Well, we are going to transform this 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.099
 makeup that underlies us a bit 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.690
 channel and we will transform it into one 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.099
 more for you to see how it happens from a 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.139
 look more natural or something more elaborate 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.490
 so I just do not roll up I leave with 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.490
 the video and with super 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.740
 for this look in my eyes I'm going to 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.350
 use the palette of dolce and gabbana 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.940
 ramblas that is said limited and we are going to 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.700
 start with a loose hair brush 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.590
 applying a little bit of white shadow on 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.020
 the area below the eyebrow to provide 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.970
 a little bit of light and I want a texture 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.710
 uniform let's also apply the 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.030
 shade more orange from the palette at 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.950
 length of the whole eyelid with a brush 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.590
 also let directly blurred 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.590
 in this case it is new fiber and kris 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.120
 forgiveness of the inhabitant and we are going to blur 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.320
 always very good all kinds of cuts that 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.180
 they can keep us with the skewer 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.770
 etc 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.760
 then apply a little bit of 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.089
 the same shadow on the lower eyelid 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.230
 to create a grocery store effect 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.879
 We also strengthen the form of the account 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.739
 very gently just squeezing the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.409
 brush but to get this effect 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.909
 once again we go back to clean 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.530
 all the possible cuts that we have 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.850
 could be with the help of the brochita 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.610
 it's sweet the wire though personally 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.860
 I love it for this 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.420
 are erased magically both in the part 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.420
 of the upper eyelid as in the lower eyelid 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.760
 next with the mac bag 217 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.340
 I'm going to reinforce the whole center a little bit 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.870
 from the mobile eyelid to smooth past 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.460
 using the entire side of the brush 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.790
 and in the interior papo we will use the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.790
 tip 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.300
 again we clean so everything is 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.290
 totally clean in the eye this always 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.510
 It is very important when creating 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.000
 any smoked let's apply now 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.580
 the darkest shadow of the palette with the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.350
 same 217 of mac on both sides of the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.760
 mobile eyelid that is in the part 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.290
 outside in the inner part 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.400
 leaving a free space just in the part 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.440
 central 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.060
 we go carefully without hardly squeezing 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.040
 new so everything is perfectly 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.340
 integrated is the makeup trick in 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.340
 the eye 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.880
 we will also use the same 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.770
 ratio that is toward the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.319
 end of the eye with a skewer as 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.849
 flat in this case the 239 and we're going to 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.680
 Apply the center of the eyelid both in 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.330
 the superior as the inferior a little 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.530
 of the shade more pink than on the palette 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.660
 that I love because it gives a shine 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.970
 precious let's work it with a lot 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.440
 careful also not to create hard 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.800
 lines of separation between the shadow 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.570
 dark and the most clarita 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.040
 and if there remains a precious light effect that 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.870
 I love it and it gives a touch 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.980
 different to the armed the same is what 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.890
 we are doing in the lower eyelid 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.080
 with the 239 they also always choose the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.030
 little touches so as not to hurt the eye 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.200
 again let's reinforce a little bit a 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.580
 Once we have everything completed 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.320
 we can go deciding if we want 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.640
 increase the intensity of the shadows in 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.070
 this case I'm putting a little bit more 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.960
 of which was more orange by all 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.160
 eyelid from the basin towards 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.430
 up to create a shadow of 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.490
 transition and a much more marked assembly 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.690
 After the elegant and diffused time we have 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.610
 this same also in the ship of 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.550
 inferior always to create harmony 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.710
 between the upper and lower eyelids 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.740
 we take a little bit of the shadow more 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.240
 dark and we place more emphasis on the area 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.680
 of the account but also with this type 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.270
 of loose hair brush that is going to 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.610
 leave the entire finish very transparent and 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.830
 uniform let's also put a 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.230
 little gel eyeliner in black tone 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.840
 so that it is of a duration throughout 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.300
 of the water line both lower and 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.450
 superior a little in the area of ​​the 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.980
 top of the uader line we are going to 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.440
 mark the final part of the eye that is going 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.930
 to serve as a guide to me as I 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.580
 like is always to do the continuation 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.500
 of the water line and it comes out like 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.380
 stop to our eyelid crease 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.780
 we jump for the upper papacy the line 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.680
 to reinforce it and mark the eye well with 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.000
 the same ultra paint brooch eyeliner 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.140
 little by little throughout all the 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.140
 upper lashes 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.200
 once we have the eye of the marking what 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.210
 what we are going to do is with a shadow 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.240
 black and a beveled brush we are going to 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.190
 blur a little bit of the eyeliner towards 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.840
 the inside of the mobile eyelid to create 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.210
 a color degraded effect of the most 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.450
 dark and more intense that is the eyeliner 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.810
 until a little bit more clearly towards the 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.810
 Upper eyelid 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.870
 although much more elegant 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.450
 then let's do the same 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.980
 but on the lower eyelid flush with the 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.290
 tabs to create this effect of the 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.790
 trainer is very nice there is 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.440
 do it to subtle taps for not 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.600
 stain virtually nothing the area of ​​the 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.390
 very careful 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.210
 and of fernando also the outside 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:44.380
 in which it joins with the lower eyelid 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.380
 that totally comes together 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.050
 next what we are going to do is 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.880
 put a little bit of mascara 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.110
 in this case I already had a little look 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.060
 previous that we had done for the day 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.080
 so just reinforce it so much in 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.080
 the upper lashes as inferior 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.300
 let's mark a little eyebrow in this 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.009
 what I do is use a tone 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.930
 slightly darker than in the video 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.130
 previously I was carrying the product and 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.470
 now we are using the most tone 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.180
 home 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.680
 let's eliminate a bit the excess 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.480
 and hair that is brought from possible 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.160
 daylight and let's put the lipstick 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.380
 cross wise that has a watermelon tone 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.970
 precious you could have left the look 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.710
 smoked simply with the natural lip 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.360
 if so you like it but good too 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.580
 I wanted to mark a little more the plane 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.920
 this tone is a kind of red 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.450
 watermelon raspberry I already tell you that I 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.850
 love to mix it with one eye 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.740
 quality we will now correct the areas 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.270
 of the successions or areas in which 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.120
 we need more coverage for what 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.680
 I'm going to mix two tones of the pronoun ar 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.120
 reconciled topic 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.460
 in this case I apply it with a brush of 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.680
 natural hair also quite long 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.360
 hair for directly uniform already 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.870
 directly the blur as you can 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.420
 see while it covers us left us a 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.830
 Perfect skin finish effect 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.300
 let's apply a little rouge 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.620
 to reinforce the one we already had 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.970
 we are going through a day look one of 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.370
 night and I'm using the tone 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.229
 Facebook 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.060
 of interest and sirens that I like 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.950
 very much 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.139
 also cooks great with the tone of the 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.879
 shadows and lips 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.740
 today we are going to apply an illuminator a 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:12.020
 little bit more powerful since it is for 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.689
 a more sugary look and we're going to apply the 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.180
 Cinesta process it from Charlotte Tilbury 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:19.189
 in the areas of light that we want 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.499
 highlight as above the cheekbones the 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:25.639
 you are a little bit more for nobody like that 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:26.900
 as in the interior of the lacrimal 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.370
 part of the eye cream to give a 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.680
 point of light right in the center of the 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.169
 look and also in the cupid arch 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.930
 on top of our upper lip for 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:39.999
 that reflects the light there well here you can 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.999
 see the result of what you have finished 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.000
 and nothing else I hope you liked the 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.670
 video and you put it into practice of measures 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.880
 and nothing else that is easy to spend the day 1 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:56.070
 it has been spectacular there is a chasm 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.090
 I'm basically a living dead but 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.560
 good 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.050
 the important thing is to leave new for the 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.250
 collection model to the make-up artist and 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.370
 as I always say subscribe to my channel 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:07.440
 up down for I like that said 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.940
 above and share it with actions 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.560
 people in the always these steps of 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.800
 utility and nothing else we see in the 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.270
 next video a little kiss 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.270
 then you can
