00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.510 
them or send them gifts also at the top
we<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.660> some<00:00:39.989> powers<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:40.950> use<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
we have some powers that we can use and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.110 
we have some powers that we can use and
these<00:00:42.180> levels<00:00:42.660> unlike<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.770> previous

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
these levels unlike the previous

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.760 
these levels unlike the previous
iterations<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.510> Angry<00:00:45.809> Bird<00:00:45.989> series<00:00:46.379> are

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
iterations of the Angry Bird series are

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.850 
iterations of the Angry Bird series are
more<00:00:47.160> zoomed<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.670> than<00:00:48.270> before<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.680> have

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
more zoomed in than before so we have

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.900 
more zoomed in than before so we have
the<00:00:50.010> classical<00:00:50.550> blowup<00:00:50.940> board<00:00:52.520> that<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.699> do<00:00:53.879> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the classical blowup board that can do a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.760 
the classical blowup board that can do a
ton<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.149> damage<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.960> probably<00:00:55.170> achieve<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
ton of damage and I probably achieve the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.400 
ton of damage and I probably achieve the
high<00:00:55.890> score<00:00:56.219> by<00:00:56.600> defeating<00:00:57.600> all<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> pigs<00:00:58.109> at

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
high score by defeating all the pigs at

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.439 
high score by defeating all the pigs at
first<00:00:58.710> shot

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the gameplay is the same you shoot a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.880 
the gameplay is the same you shoot a
bird<00:01:05.339> from<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.760> slingshot<00:01:06.119> use<00:01:06.960> some<00:01:07.170> power<00:01:07.409> but

from<00:02:39.350> what<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.590> know<00:02:39.830> this<00:02:40.130> one<00:02:40.370> speeds<00:02:40.790> up<00:02:41.000> the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
from what I know this one speeds up the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.540 
from what I know this one speeds up the
bird<00:02:41.570> that<00:02:41.840> you're<00:02:41.990> throwing<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.620> then<00:02:43.460> we

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
bird that you're throwing and then we

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.150 
bird that you're throwing and then we
got<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:43.850> one<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:45.170> I'm<00:02:45.350> not<00:02:45.470> quite<00:02:45.680> sure<00:02:45.770> what

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
got this one but I'm not quite sure what

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.430 
got this one but I'm not quite sure what
it<00:02:46.310> does<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:47.420> let's<00:02:47.630> see<00:02:49.810> once<00:02:50.810> again<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:51.230> speed

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
it does so let's see once again a speed

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.530 
it does so let's see once again a speed
boost<00:02:51.680> or<00:02:51.920> something<00:02:51.950> close<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.300> these

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
boost or something close to it so these

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.210 
boost or something close to it so these
are<00:02:53.720> pretty<00:02:53.900> much<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.290> powers<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:55.040> can

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.790 
them using
as<00:04:15.340> little<00:04:16.180> birds<00:04:16.420> as<00:04:16.660> possible<00:04:17.140> as<00:04:17.500> few<00:04:17.770> words

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
as possible and maybe some power-ups to

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.440 
as possible and maybe some power-ups to
really<00:04:20.980> diminish<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.670> number<00:04:21.970> of<00:04:22.060> birds<00:04:22.300> that

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
really diminish the number of birds that

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.470 
really diminish the number of birds that
you<00:04:22.630> can<00:04:22.810> use<00:04:23.640> this<00:04:24.640> is<00:04:24.790> one<00:04:24.940> of<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.150> harder

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
you can use this is one of the harder

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.220 
you can use this is one of the harder
levels<00:04:27.780> where<00:04:28.780> power-ups<00:04:29.260> may<00:04:29.440> come<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.740> handy

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
levels where power-ups may come in handy

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:39.180 
levels where power-ups may come in handy
so<00:04:32.230> let's<00:04:32.470> try<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.710> use<00:04:32.920> this<00:04:33.130> one<00:04:38.040> as<00:04:39.040> you<00:04:39.070> can

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
so let's try to use this one as you can

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.920 
so let's try to use this one as you can
see<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.610> birds<00:04:39.850> will<00:04:40.090> become<00:04:40.450> became<00:04:40.870> a

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
see the birds will become became a

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:50.400 
see the birds will become became a
little<00:04:41.290> bigger<00:04:41.640> and<00:04:42.640> one<00:04:43.630> let's<00:04:43.870> try<00:04:49.350> with<00:04:50.350> a

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
little bigger and one let's try with a

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.040 
little bigger and one let's try with a
bit<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.680> luck<00:04:50.920> the<00:04:51.400> pigs<00:04:51.640> will<00:04:51.790> be<00:04:51.940> gone<00:04:52.150> and

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
bit of luck the pigs will be gone and

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.220 
bit of luck the pigs will be gone and
the<00:04:53.560> level<00:04:53.800> will<00:04:53.920> be<00:04:53.950> completed<00:04:57.930> it's<00:04:58.930> a<00:04:59.020> cool

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
the level will be completed it's a cool

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.690 
the level will be completed it's a cool
thing<00:04:59.380> that<00:04:59.620> when<00:04:59.830> you're<00:05:00.010> seconds<00:05:00.490> away<00:05:00.580> from

thing that when you're seconds away from

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.790 
thing that when you're seconds away from
losing<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.300> level<00:05:01.600> there<00:05:02.230> is<00:05:02.260> an<00:05:02.410> option<00:05:02.770> that

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
losing the level there is an option that

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.290 
losing the level there is an option that
allows<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.370> activate<00:05:03.670> the<00:05:03.790> wingman<00:05:04.090> I'll
