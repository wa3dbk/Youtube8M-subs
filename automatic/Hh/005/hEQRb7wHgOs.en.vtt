the puck and control it I learned last

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.509 
the puck and control it I learned last
year<00:00:44.850> about<00:00:45.629> how<00:00:46.049> to<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.379> mentally<00:00:46.949> tough<00:00:46.979> and

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
year about how to be mentally tough and

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.869 
year about how to be mentally tough and
I<00:00:48.059> learned<00:00:48.449> a<00:00:48.870> lot<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.530> workouts<00:00:49.979> from<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
I learned a lot of workouts from the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.000 
I learned a lot of workouts from the
trainer<00:00:51.180> my<00:00:51.720> greatest<00:00:51.989> experience<00:00:52.769> in<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
trainer my greatest experience in the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.700 
trainer my greatest experience in the
CCM<00:00:53.430> camp<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:54.299> probably<00:00:54.900> the<00:00:55.019> bungee<00:00:55.350> cords

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
CCM camp was probably the bungee cords

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
CCM camp was probably the bungee cords
because<00:00:56.040> it<00:00:56.460> teaches<00:00:56.820> me<00:00:56.970> to<00:00:57.119> bend<00:00:57.390> my<00:00:57.540> legs

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
because it teaches me to bend my legs

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.890 
because it teaches me to bend my legs
and<00:00:58.199> push<00:00:59.040> forward<00:00:59.369> I<00:00:59.699> expect<00:01:00.330> this<00:01:00.510> year<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
and push forward I expect this year to

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.399 
and push forward I expect this year to
be<00:01:01.019> as<00:01:01.170> awesome<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:02.339> last<00:01:02.610> year<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.390> expect<00:01:04.199> it

think<00:01:45.750> being<00:01:46.740> treated<00:01:47.010> as<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> pro<00:01:47.520> player

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
think being treated as a pro player

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.560 
think being treated as a pro player
makes<00:01:48.570> us<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:49.770> ready<00:01:50.010> for<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.330> make<00:01:51.540> it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
makes us get ready for when we make it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.710 
makes us get ready for when we make it
to<00:01:51.720> pros<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.680> kind<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.909> how<00:01:54.659> to

to pros so that we kind of know how to
act<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.979> myself<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.550> ten<00:01:56.760> years<00:01:56.909> hopefully

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510
