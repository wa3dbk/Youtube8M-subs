up this curve to the level I feel happy
about<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.520> think<00:01:18.479> maybe<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.680> one<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> bit

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
about I think maybe this one with a bit

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.429 
about I think maybe this one with a bit
too<00:01:21.240> long<00:01:21.420> up<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.810> pull<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.320> down<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> bit<00:01:24.439> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
too long up so pull it down a bit and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.050 
too long up so pull it down a bit and
okay<00:01:26.960> then<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.650> course<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.310> doesn't<00:01:29.579> look<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
okay then of course it doesn't look so

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.210 
okay then of course it doesn't look so
well<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.360> we<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.840> invert<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.740> layer<00:01:31.770> mask

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
well so we have to invert the layer mask

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.719 
well so we have to invert the layer mask
to<00:01:32.430> make<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.970> all<00:01:33.530> normal<00:01:34.530> control<00:01:35.220> or<00:01:35.400> command

to make it all normal control or command

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.069 
to make it all normal control or command
I<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.900> inverted<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.530> layer<00:01:37.680> mask<00:01:39.079> now

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
I and we inverted the layer mask now

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.920 
I and we inverted the layer mask now

this<00:02:15.430> don't<00:02:15.700> brighten<00:02:16.150> up<00:02:16.270> all<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.750> eyes

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
this don't brighten up all of the eyes

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.410 
this don't brighten up all of the eyes
because<00:02:17.710> it<00:02:17.830> doesn't<00:02:18.160> look<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.430> well<00:02:18.640> brighten

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
because it doesn't look so well brighten

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.420 
because it doesn't look so well brighten
up<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.850> area<00:02:22.240> which<00:02:22.720> going<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:23.170> make<00:02:23.440> this

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
up the area which going to make this

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.750 
up the area which going to make this
eyes<00:02:24.760> look<00:02:25.660> really<00:02:25.990> amazing<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.710> it<00:02:27.340> will<00:02:27.580> be

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
eyes look really amazing so it will be

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.030 
eyes look really amazing so it will be
around<00:02:27.850> here<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:32.290> can<00:02:32.470> even<00:02:32.650> use<00:02:34.320> lower<00:02:35.320> flow

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
around here you can even use lower flow

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.540 
around here you can even use lower flow
and<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:38.170> cannot<00:02:38.440> get<00:02:38.740> too<00:02:39.040> high<00:02:39.280> cause

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
and we cannot get too high cause

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.440 
and we cannot get too high cause
actually<00:02:40.090> we<00:02:40.390> have<00:02:41.580> curves<00:02:42.580> which<00:02:42.940> actually

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
actually we have curves which actually

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.660 
actually we have curves which actually
block<00:02:44.080> our<00:02:44.320> level<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.800> not<00:02:44.920> go<00:02:45.070> too<00:02:45.130> far<00:02:45.460> and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
block our level to not go too far and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.300 
block our level to not go too far and
right<00:02:46.210> now<00:02:46.360> I'm<00:02:46.570> going<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.990> that<00:02:47.170> second<00:02:48.160> eye

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
right now I'm going to that second eye

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.080 
right now I'm going to that second eye
and<00:02:48.660> just<00:02:49.660> going<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:50.020> do<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.740> same<00:02:51.090> somewhere

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
and just going to do the same somewhere

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.170 
and just going to do the same somewhere
over<00:02:52.360> here<00:02:55.920> remember<00:02:56.920> just<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.700> use<00:02:57.850> soft

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
over here remember just to use soft

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.140 
over here remember just to use soft
brush<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:59.020> not<00:02:59.890> make<00:03:00.190> this<00:03:00.400> look<00:03:00.610> fake

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
brush to not make this look fake

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.920 
brush to not make this look fake
so<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:02.020> soft<00:03:02.230> brush<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.710> really<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:04.330> main

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
so the soft brush is really the main

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.900 
so the soft brush is really the main
thing<00:03:05.230> about<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:05.770> we<00:03:06.040> have<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.370> be<00:03:06.490> careful

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
thing about this we have to be careful

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.030 
thing about this we have to be careful
with<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:08.230> okay<00:03:08.740> it's<00:03:09.400> done<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:11.040> it

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
with it and okay it's done and it

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.430 
with it and okay it's done and it
already<00:03:12.280> looked<00:03:12.760> amazing<00:03:13.330> but<00:03:13.480> I'm<00:03:14.080> going<00:03:14.350> to

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
already looked amazing but I'm going to

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.290 
already looked amazing but I'm going to
show<00:03:14.710> you<00:03:14.770> something<00:03:15.130> optional<00:03:15.490> we're<00:03:16.030> going

to make this eyes looks really awesome
I'm<00:03:19.690> going<00:03:20.020> to<00:03:20.170> create<00:03:20.410> another<00:03:20.710> curve<00:03:21.370> layer

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
I'm going to create another curve layer

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.370 
I'm going to create another curve layer
and<00:03:23.790> this<00:03:24.790> time<00:03:25.060> I'm<00:03:25.360> going<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.840> pull<00:03:26.170> this

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
and this time I'm going to pull this

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.320 
and this time I'm going to pull this
layer<00:03:26.590> down<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.590> okay<00:03:29.920> something<00:03:30.790> like<00:03:30.820> this<00:03:31.120> I

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
layer down so okay something like this I

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.000 
layer down so okay something like this I
don't<00:03:31.390> want<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:32.020> make<00:03:32.140> this<00:03:32.320> too<00:03:32.500> strong<00:03:32.800> now

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
don't want to make this too strong now

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.790 
don't want to make this too strong now
and<00:03:33.460> once<00:03:34.210> again<00:03:34.540> I'm<00:03:34.780> going<00:03:35.020> to<00:03:35.290> invert<00:03:35.740> layer

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
and once again I'm going to invert layer

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.640 
and once again I'm going to invert layer
mask<00:03:36.250> control<00:03:36.700> command<00:03:37.240> I<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.540> invert<00:03:38.470> this

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
mask control command I to invert this

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.150 
mask control command I to invert this
and<00:03:39.040> let's<00:03:39.670> zoom<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.990> what<00:03:41.710> I<00:03:41.740> want<00:03:42.010> to

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
right now I'm going to put these two

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.880 
right now I'm going to put these two
pair<00:04:22.390> layers<00:04:22.630> into<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.110> group<00:04:23.290> ctrl<00:04:23.710> or

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
pair layers into the group ctrl or

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.879 
pair layers into the group ctrl or
command<00:04:23.950> G<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.880> have<00:04:25.330> a<00:04:25.360> look<00:04:25.570> at<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.840> result

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
command G and have a look at the result

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.159 
command G and have a look at the result
to<00:04:27.039> say<00:04:27.219> it<00:04:27.610> looks<00:04:27.879> very<00:04:28.060> impressive<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.990> was

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
to say it looks very impressive and was

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.920 
to say it looks very impressive and was
just<00:04:29.590> few<00:04:29.889> step<00:04:30.189> technique<00:04:30.550> but<00:04:31.389> what<00:04:31.599> if<00:04:31.780> you

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
just few step technique but what if you

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.499 
just few step technique but what if you
want<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.289> change<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.800> eye<00:04:32.830> color<00:04:33.240> well<00:04:34.240> there

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
want to change the eye color well there

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.499 
want to change the eye color well there
is<00:04:34.629> a<00:04:34.659> very<00:04:35.159> simple<00:04:36.159> method<00:04:36.939> for<00:04:36.969> it

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
is a very simple method for it

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.200 
is a very simple method for it
I<00:04:37.770> usually<00:04:38.770> don't<00:04:39.159> change<00:04:39.249> the<00:04:39.669> eye<00:04:39.729> color<00:04:39.759> so

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
I usually don't change the eye color so

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.909 
I usually don't change the eye color so
much<00:04:40.419> because<00:04:40.659> I<00:04:40.779> prefer<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.319> keep<00:04:41.439> natural

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
much because I prefer to keep natural

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.149 
much because I prefer to keep natural
but<00:04:42.490> curves<00:04:42.789> contains<00:04:43.439> the<00:04:44.439> possibilities<00:04:45.129> of

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
but curves contains the possibilities of

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.089 
but curves contains the possibilities of
the<00:04:46.150> main<00:04:46.330> colors<00:04:46.810> you<00:04:47.050> can<00:04:47.259> work<00:04:47.740> with<00:04:47.979> your

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
the main colors you can work with your

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
somewhere around here very very softly

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.809 
somewhere around here very very softly
remember<00:05:18.360> not<00:05:19.360> made<00:05:19.629> this<00:05:19.810> too<00:05:20.050> strong<00:05:20.379> I<00:05:20.819> feel

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
remember not made this too strong I feel

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.769 
remember not made this too strong I feel
it's<00:05:22.150> already<00:05:22.479> too<00:05:22.719> strong<00:05:23.050> but<00:05:24.389> it's<00:05:25.389> really

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:25.779 
it's already too strong but it's really

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:30.839 
it's already too strong but it's really
difficult<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:27.449> make<00:05:28.449> glower<00:05:29.039> I'm<00:05:30.039> going<00:05:30.699> to

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
difficult to make glower I'm going to

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.999 
difficult to make glower I'm going to
start<00:05:31.120> from<00:05:31.270> this<00:05:31.509> set<00:05:31.810> just<00:05:32.409> a<00:05:32.560> little<00:05:32.860> bit

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
start from this set just a little bit

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.329 
start from this set just a little bit
okay<00:05:33.430> so<00:05:33.610> I<00:05:34.419> think<00:05:34.509> it's<00:05:34.779> not<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.710> looks<00:05:35.979> really

00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:36.339 
okay so I think it's not it looks really

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.329 
okay so I think it's not it looks really
really<00:05:36.550> amazing<00:05:37.060> we<00:05:37.779> change<00:05:38.139> the<00:05:38.409> eye<00:05:38.710> color<00:05:38.919> a

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:39.339 
really amazing we change the eye color a

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.969 
really amazing we change the eye color a
little<00:05:39.759> bit<00:05:39.909> and<00:05:40.210> they<00:05:40.569> look<00:05:40.810> super<00:05:41.110> strong<00:05:41.710> so

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
little bit and they look super strong so

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.459 
little bit and they look super strong so
that's<00:05:42.219> the<00:05:42.370> optional<00:05:42.849> you<00:05:43.449> want<00:05:43.659> to<00:05:43.839> you<00:05:44.229> can

that's the optional you want to you can

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.189 
that's the optional you want to you can
decide<00:05:44.860> which<00:05:45.669> colors<00:05:46.509> you<00:05:46.539> want<00:05:46.870> which
