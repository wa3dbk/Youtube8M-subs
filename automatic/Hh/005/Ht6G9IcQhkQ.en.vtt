so<00:02:15.480> scores<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.260> zero<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:16.950> let's<00:02:17.129> try<00:02:17.280> round

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
so scores one zero so let's try round

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:24.140 
so scores one zero so let's try round
two<00:02:20.000> hope<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.239> fifth<00:02:21.629> pull<00:02:22.170> off<00:02:22.940> their<00:02:23.940> dog

two hope the fifth pull off their dog
circling<00:02:24.569> right<00:02:24.690> out<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.860> acting<00:02:33.260> talking

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
circling right out it's acting talking

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.990 
circling right out it's acting talking
glass<00:02:36.090> hacking<00:02:36.709> slowly<00:02:37.709> moving<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.519> then<00:02:38.700> it

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
glass hacking slowly moving and then it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.809 
glass hacking slowly moving and then it
will<00:02:39.209> attack<00:02:39.920> soon<00:02:40.920> Big<00:02:41.190> Bang<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.489> gotta<00:02:41.670> go

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
will attack soon Big Bang is gotta go

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.399 
will attack soon Big Bang is gotta go
into<00:02:42.030> RF<00:02:42.390> melon<00:02:42.750> which<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.049> when<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.260> loses

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
into RF melon which is when it loses

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:49.670 
into RF melon which is when it loses
most<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.040> its<00:02:44.190> um<00:02:45.829> its<00:02:47.510> rotation<00:02:48.510> most<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.530> its

most of its um its rotation most of its

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.970 
most of its um its rotation most of its
fate<00:02:49.859> power<00:02:53.599> so<00:02:54.599> it's<00:02:55.260> still<00:02:55.500> circling<00:02:55.829> around

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
fate power so it's still circling around

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.619 
fate power so it's still circling around
so<00:02:56.280> less<00:02:56.400> who's<00:02:56.609> gonna<00:02:56.760> attack<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.700> even<00:03:00.299> now

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
so less who's gonna attack and even now

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:13.020
