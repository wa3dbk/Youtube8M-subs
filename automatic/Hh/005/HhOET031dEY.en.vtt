 folder date or there in the original date folder 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.429

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.239
 more other stuff or I'm here files 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.170
 here is all about giving a 

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:08.869
 control to be copied here in 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.680
 I 'm not going to go to the main square 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.120
 do this because I already have ready to 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.120
 tradition is installed 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.180
 Now let's install it as it does to play. 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.820
 with the control that the game does not come 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:36.390
 enabled here to play with 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:39.070
 jahic will have this file here is it 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.530
 is in this folder until these three 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.730
 aac cola files in the possession of the game 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.130
 again 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.520
 I'll paste because I already have this old 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.990
 and only then talking's there already will 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.220
 be enabled for you to play in the 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.990
 control 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.600
 so much so that when you start the game it goes 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.970
 have here the command settings 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.340
 if it works out you have your chip 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:08.610
 when he is here there are input controls 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.610
 1 will work for you to play 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.880
 Now to install the error and the telcos 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.580
 this is what comes with the game but you 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.900
 have to replace a file that time 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.690
 What are you going to do? 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:25.250
 character the game back to the menu 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:29.390
 main and this has this file 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:35.510
 here you will replace it in the folder 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:40.730
 date said that it should be can sin date 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.920
 says that you should get put here not 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.360
 I'll do it because I already have it. 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.459
 then everything is fine the game is 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.760

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.840
