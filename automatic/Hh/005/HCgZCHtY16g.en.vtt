00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
want the lift to go so let's say we're

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.040 
want the lift to go so let's say we're
going<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> zoom<00:00:54.059> out<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.510> look<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.899> from

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
going to zoom out and look at it from

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.520 
going to zoom out and look at it from

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the back it's going to look like this

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.080 
the back it's going to look like this
and<00:00:59.129> then<00:01:00.199> put<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.440> wall<00:01:02.190> there<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.820> then<00:01:02.940> as

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
and then put the wall there and then as

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.679 
and then put the wall there and then as
you<00:01:03.120> go<00:01:03.589> fit<00:01:04.589> piece<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.519> behind<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
you go fit piece down behind it like the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.080 
you go fit piece down behind it like the
wall<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:07.020> top<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:08.580> try<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.760> keep<00:01:08.939> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
wall on top of it just try to keep it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.690 
wall on top of it just try to keep it
lined<00:01:09.270> up<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.500> goes<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.790> you<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:11.970> reset

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
lined up and as it goes up you can reset

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.380 
lined up and as it goes up you can reset
and<00:01:15.049> basically<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.439> walls<00:01:16.939> go<00:01:17.939> back<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and basically have the walls go back and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.690 
and basically have the walls go back and
forth<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.750> top<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> each<00:01:19.200> other<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.580> when<00:01:20.580> this

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
forth the top of each other so when this

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.679 
forth the top of each other so when this
when<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.360> wall<00:01:21.630> gets<00:01:21.869> off<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.950> screen<00:01:23.689> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
when this wall gets off the screen you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.390 
when this wall gets off the screen you
put<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.020> back<00:01:25.140> underneath<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.130> rearrange

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
put it back underneath you can rearrange

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.300 
put it back underneath you can rearrange
it<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.150> did<00:01:27.530> or<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:28.920> keep<00:01:29.100> it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
it like I did or you can just keep it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640 
it like I did or you can just keep it
all<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> solid<00:01:30.150> color<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
all like a solid color I like the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.050 
all like a solid color I like the
different<00:01:31.979> patterns<00:01:32.340> because<00:01:32.670> i<00:01:32.729> think<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
different patterns because i think that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.840 
different patterns because i think that
they<00:01:33.180> gave<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.570> illusion<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.990> movement<00:01:34.200> more

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
they gave the illusion of movement more

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.350 
they gave the illusion of movement more
so<00:01:35.850> there<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:37.369> monday<00:01:38.369> our<00:01:38.790> sunday
