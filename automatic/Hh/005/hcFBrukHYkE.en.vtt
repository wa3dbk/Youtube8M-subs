in<00:05:50.810> being<00:05:51.380> ignorant<00:05:51.880> do<00:05:52.880> we<00:05:53.030> think<00:05:53.240> that

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
in being ignorant do we think that

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.810 
in being ignorant do we think that
McCain<00:05:54.260> heard<00:05:54.530> about<00:05:54.770> this<00:05:55.040> or<00:05:55.310> seller<00:05:55.580> that's

McCain heard about this or seller that's

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.490 
McCain heard about this or seller that's
where<00:05:55.970> he<00:05:56.030> went<00:05:56.120> I<00:05:56.390> could<00:05:56.810> have<00:05:56.900> had<00:05:57.050> a<00:05:57.080> correct

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
where he went I could have had a correct

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.710 
where he went I could have had a correct
answer<00:05:57.710> here<00:05:57.920> it<00:05:58.580> could<00:05:58.940> that<00:05:59.090> possibly<00:05:59.300> have

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
answer here it could that possibly have

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.470 
answer here it could that possibly have
influenced<00:06:00.230> how<00:06:00.560> this<00:06:00.770> changed<00:06:01.220> suddenly

well<00:06:02.480> I<00:06:02.510> I<00:06:02.810> do<00:06:03.080> think<00:06:03.620> that<00:06:03.890> that<00:06:04.370> Obama's

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
well I I do think that that Obama's

was some sort of knockout punch but from

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.110 
was some sort of knockout punch but from

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 
the Obama campaign's

the Obama campaign's
view<00:07:08.650> you<00:07:09.650> know<00:07:09.800> it<00:07:09.979> seems<00:07:10.490> that<00:07:10.970> maybe<00:07:11.510> he's

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
view you know it seems that maybe he's

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.219

got<00:07:12.050> some<00:07:12.440> traction<00:07:12.770> now<00:07:13.250> in<00:07:13.750> trying<00:07:14.750> to<00:07:14.900> turn

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:15.229 
got some traction now in trying to turn

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:18.790 
got some traction now in trying to turn
this<00:07:15.800> turn<00:07:16.669> it<00:07:16.820> around<00:07:16.940> and<00:07:17.419> make<00:07:17.800> the

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 
this turn it around and make the

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.640 
this turn it around and make the

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.650 
campaign about John McCain to the extent

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.550 
campaign about John McCain to the extent
that<00:07:21.919> it<00:07:22.639> ought<00:07:22.820> to<00:07:22.850> be<00:07:22.970> and<00:07:23.449> you<00:07:24.350> know<00:07:24.470> it

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
that it ought to be and you know it

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.960 
that it ought to be and you know it
ought<00:07:24.680> to<00:07:24.710> be<00:07:24.830> about<00:07:24.979> both<00:07:25.310> of<00:07:25.340> them<00:07:25.669> but<00:07:25.790> so

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:25.970 
ought to be about both of them but so

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.719 
ought to be about both of them but so
far<00:07:26.120> it's<00:07:26.270> been<00:07:26.389> about<00:07:26.600> Obama<00:07:27.020> I<00:07:27.860> think<00:07:28.550> this

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:28.729 
far it's been about Obama I think this

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:30.430 
far it's been about Obama I think this
helps<00:07:28.940> make<00:07:29.270> it<00:07:29.449> more<00:07:29.660> about<00:07:29.870> John<00:07:30.110> McCain

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440
