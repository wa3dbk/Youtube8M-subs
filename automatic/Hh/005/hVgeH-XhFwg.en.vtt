phone so it could change it to one end
or<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:47.860> other<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:48.940> worked<00:01:49.330> for<00:01:49.660> me<00:01:49.870> to<00:01:50.080> change

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
or the other it worked for me to change

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
or the other it worked for me to change
it<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:51.160> two<00:01:51.400> point<00:01:51.730> four<00:01:52.060> one<00:01:52.360> two<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:53.680> but

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
it to two point four one two so but

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.800 
it to two point four one two so but
you'll<00:01:54.580> just<00:01:54.730> go<00:01:54.880> ahead<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.360> go<00:01:55.480> in<00:01:55.630> and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
you'll just go ahead and go in and

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.780 
you'll just go ahead and go in and
change<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.230> there<00:01:56.440> and<00:01:56.620> that<00:01:57.190> will<00:01:57.340> stop<00:01:57.580> your
