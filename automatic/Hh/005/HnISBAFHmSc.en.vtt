00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 we can say a lot of things from 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.040
 philippe muller but if he takes over 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.759
 essential elements so philippe muller 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.059
 was one of the youngest if not the most 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.580
 young 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.410
 in any case at the time professor at the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.230
 about the paris music super 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.910
 and he has more following andre navarra 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.410
 in any case we consider that philippe 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.840
 muller today is school 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.330
 French difference she is recognized 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.990
 around the world for all 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.810
 his qualities 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.009
 in fact if we simply take if we 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.140
 simply take the cellists 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.850
 French and when we look and they 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.280
 have studied madore 99.999 % of cases they 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.739
 were students of philippe muller so 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.440
 this also explains that millar annoys 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.809
 halluin a very decisive role in my 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.149
 life of young musicians cellist 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.059
 and learning I met enough 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.789
 young I started with him in class 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.539
 particular to meudon in his house of 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.609
 the avenue of the castle 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.660
 here I have a lot of memories 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.460
 I had probably I think of 12 13 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.790
 years when I took my first 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.920
 lessons 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.260
 I remember dancers crossed with 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.659
 INSEE slides on Saturday walking tour 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.580
 of the castle goals that went up and two 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.950
 floors and it was said to take the lesson at 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.090
 top floor with them so that was 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.250
 the beginning and then then I worked 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.729
 five years with him at the cnsm de paris 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.080
 so I'm doing the normal cycle and the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.020
 third who at the time was called 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.600
 still 3rd cycle so all add up or 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.700
 and I think I worked a clip 7 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.330
 7 or 8 years old I always had a lot 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.450
 of 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.850
 admiration recognition too 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.250
 of affection for for philippe muller and 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.200
 also for his family that I know 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.540
 well and with whom with his children 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.670
 support with his wife simone who has us 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.050
 left a short while ago we spent 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.640
 a lot of time without any of what 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.260
 sum the parties in the united states together 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.290
 and it's true that I feel very close 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.090
 from very close to him and I had since 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.360
 a few years the idea of going people 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.610
 must have spoken to his wife 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.570
 to make a concert organized a concert 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.710
 not a damage because philippe 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.690
 simply ends his career as a 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.360
 paris to professor but he continues 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.000
 So he continues to united states 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.600
 just a concert for that for him 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.840
 say thank you 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.670
 that was the goal and I 'm really 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.500
 very happy that their classes of 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.390
 Paris Chamber and they were 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.520
 disorganized be by our side for this 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.410
 for this tight tale for m philippe is 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.540
 So here it is I was a little 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.250
 the initiator of the project but it's his 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.770
 concert it's his program it's him 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.830
 who chose violence and skis 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.560
 surrounding him is a lot of pieces of 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.870
 duets and trios and then we have an idea 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.239
 also very original philippe who has 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.489
 wished that we all play together on 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.709
 scene we will all be in front of the orchestrated 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.500
 rococo variations stop version 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.080
 original and foot version game 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.270
 infrequently and each statement list goes 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.770
 so have a movie variation started 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.470
 in the theme must open the ball 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.760
 and then we'll all be chained 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.650
 marry surer find themselves on the last 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.450
 phocean sickness variation this is a 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.570
 wonderful project and I look forward 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.660
 we're all here to celebrate all 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.030
 together we will finish with a little one 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.940

 you singing the birds of the run 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.990
 So here is proven in saddle only melody 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.700
 a little everyone knows that kazan 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.459
 his reach throughout his life for 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.459
 defend very important causes 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.590
 m 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.380
