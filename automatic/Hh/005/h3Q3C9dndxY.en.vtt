what<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.960> gonna<00:01:46.079> mean<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.860> not

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
what this is gonna mean is it's not

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.539 
what this is gonna mean is it's not
gonna<00:01:47.189> let<00:01:47.430> me<00:01:47.610> install<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:49.250> snapshot<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
gonna let me install the snapshot the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.859 
gonna let me install the snapshot the
right<00:01:50.729> way<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:50.970> we're<00:01:51.360> gonna<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.689> go

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
right way so we're gonna have to go

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.389 
right way so we're gonna have to go
ahead<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.229> delete<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.649> entire<00:01:52.740> bin<00:01:53.189> folder

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
ahead and delete the entire bin folder

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.999 
ahead and delete the entire bin folder
so<00:01:54.360> again<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.930> why<00:01:55.049> we<00:01:55.229> made<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> backup<00:01:55.860> so

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
so again this is why we made a backup so

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.100 
so again this is why we made a backup so
in<00:01:56.130> case<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.490> doesn't<00:01:56.670> work<00:01:56.880> we're<00:01:57.360> gonna<00:01:57.479> go

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
in case this doesn't work we're gonna go

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870 
in case this doesn't work we're gonna go
ahead<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.380> restore<00:01:58.500> from<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> backup<00:01:59.130> just

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
ahead and restore from the backup just

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.050 
ahead and restore from the backup just
delete<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> bin<00:02:00.420> folder<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:02.399> know<00:02:02.490> that

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
delete the bin folder and I know that

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.319 
delete the bin folder and I know that
these<00:02:03.390> are<00:02:03.450> not<00:02:04.579> from<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.790> regular<00:02:06.090> minecraft

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
these are not from the regular minecraft

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.550 
these are not from the regular minecraft
so<00:02:06.630> I'm<00:02:06.689> gonna<00:02:06.840> go<00:02:06.990> ahead<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.200> delete<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560

so I'm gonna go ahead and delete that
and<00:02:07.799> I'm<00:02:08.099> going<00:02:08.250> delete<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.209> mods<00:02:09.509> folder

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
and I'm going delete the mods folder

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.589 
and I'm going delete the mods folder
because<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.170> don't<00:02:10.349> need<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> mods<00:02:10.739> either

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
because we don't need the mods either

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.670 
because we don't need the mods either
nobody<00:02:12.599> needs<00:02:12.780> mods

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
nobody needs mods

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.380 
nobody needs mods
be<00:02:13.829> a<00:02:13.859> modder<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.700> then<00:02:14.819> we're<00:02:14.969> gonna<00:02:15.030> go<00:02:15.269> ahead

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
be a modder so then we're gonna go ahead

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.780

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
and start up our Minecraft and it should

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.280 
and start up our Minecraft and it should
regenerate<00:02:18.329> all<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.659> snow<00:02:18.870> I'll<00:02:19.019> get<00:02:19.170> you

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
guys when I'm back alright I am back and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.080 
guys when I'm back alright I am back and
as<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.769> can<00:02:22.920> see<00:02:23.099> it's<00:02:23.250> recreated<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.969> bin

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
as you can see it's recreated the bin

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.910 
as you can see it's recreated the bin
folder<00:02:24.299> so<00:02:25.109> now<00:02:25.200> we<00:02:25.260> go<00:02:25.469> in<00:02:25.590> here<00:02:25.799> and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
folder so now we go in here and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.250 
folder so now we go in here and
everything's<00:02:26.250> done<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:27.450> don't<00:02:27.569> have<00:02:27.719> to<00:02:28.140> do

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
everything's done you don't have to do

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.750 
everything's done you don't have to do
this<00:02:28.379> step<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:28.859> it's<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.340> kind<00:02:29.579> of<00:02:29.609> like<00:02:29.730> a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
this step but it's just kind of like a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.459 
this step but it's just kind of like a
safety<00:02:30.030> net<00:02:30.299> in<00:02:30.480> case<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.870> doesn't<00:02:31.049> work<00:02:31.200> I

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
safety net in case it doesn't work I

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:32.690 
safety net in case it doesn't work I
would<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.739> recommend<00:02:31.889> doing<00:02:32.189> it<00:02:32.370> anyway<00:02:32.609> it

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
would just recommend doing it anyway it

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.729 
would just recommend doing it anyway it
takes<00:02:32.819> like<00:02:33.030> 2<00:02:33.180> seconds<00:02:33.569> so<00:02:33.719> just<00:02:34.200> go<00:02:34.590> ahead

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
takes like 2 seconds so just go ahead

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.379 
takes like 2 seconds so just go ahead
and<00:02:34.889> go<00:02:34.980> into<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.310> bin<00:02:35.430> folder<00:02:35.609> and<00:02:35.939> here<00:02:36.299> you

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
and go into the bin folder and here you

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.899 
and go into the bin folder and here you
see<00:02:36.599> minecraft.jar<00:02:37.319> this<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.400> what<00:02:38.549> contains

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
in and we'll just do create a new world

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.099 
in and we'll just do create a new world
you<00:03:10.829> can<00:03:11.010> see<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.489> we<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:11.969> has<00:03:12.269> updated<00:03:12.569> and

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
you can see that we it has updated and

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.309 
you can see that we it has updated and
again<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.280> doesn't<00:03:14.340> really<00:03:14.849> make<00:03:15.209> sense<00:03:15.780> for

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
again this doesn't really make sense for

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.930 
again this doesn't really make sense for
a<00:03:16.379> server<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:16.980> if<00:03:17.069> you're<00:03:17.219> going<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.579> be<00:03:17.699> doing

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
a server so if you're going to be doing

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.099 
a server so if you're going to be doing
a<00:03:18.120> server<00:03:18.329> I<00:03:18.419> would<00:03:18.659> totally<00:03:18.959> recommend

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
a server I would totally recommend

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.559 
a server I would totally recommend
staying<00:03:19.769> on<00:03:20.040> what<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.459> officially<00:03:21.150> at<00:03:21.540> least

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
staying on what is officially at least

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.500 
staying on what is officially at least
what<00:03:22.349> are<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.560> least<00:03:22.859> but<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.150> wonder<00:03:24.479> you

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
what are the least but if you wonder you

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.729 
what are the least but if you wonder you
you<00:03:24.720> can<00:03:24.870> go<00:03:24.989> ahead<00:03:25.109> and<00:03:25.199> install<00:03:25.379> this<00:03:25.560> on<00:03:25.709> a

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
you can go ahead and install this on a

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.920 
you can go ahead and install this on a
server<00:03:26.069> how<00:03:26.699> you<00:03:26.760> do<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.299> will<00:03:27.659> just

I'm gonna be using this for a while if I

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.439 
I'm gonna be using this for a while if I
can<00:04:02.129> figure<00:04:02.310> out<00:04:02.430> how<00:04:02.609> to<00:04:02.669> implement<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.269> in<00:04:03.389> my

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
can figure out how to implement it in my

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.149 
can figure out how to implement it in my
other<00:04:03.569> videos<00:04:03.959> but<00:04:04.139> it<00:04:04.500> took<00:04:04.620> me<00:04:04.769> some<00:04:04.949> time<00:04:04.979> to

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
other videos but it took me some time to

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.920 
other videos but it took me some time to
make<00:04:05.430> but<00:04:05.609> I<00:04:05.639> think<00:04:05.849> it<00:04:05.939> looks<00:04:05.970> pretty<00:04:06.540> darn

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
make but I think it looks pretty darn

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.309 
make but I think it looks pretty darn
good

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
good

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.979 
good
