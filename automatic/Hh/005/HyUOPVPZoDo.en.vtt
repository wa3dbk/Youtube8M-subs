this<00:00:00.420> is<00:00:00.719> lesson<00:00:01.110> 2<00:00:01.500> of<00:00:01.530> drawing<00:00:02.429> the

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
this is lesson 2 of drawing the

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.130 
this is lesson 2 of drawing the
Lamborghini<00:00:03.240> Aventador<00:00:03.620> and<00:00:04.850> I<00:00:05.850> have<00:00:06.480> started

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
Lamborghini Aventador and I have started

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.080 
Lamborghini Aventador and I have started
I<00:00:07.529> actually<00:00:07.890> did<00:00:08.220> quite<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.490> bit<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.730> work<00:00:08.849> on

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
I actually did quite a bit of work on

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.650 
I actually did quite a bit of work on
that<00:00:09.330> body<00:00:10.429> what<00:00:11.429> I'm<00:00:11.550> trying<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.030> do<00:00:12.179> now<00:00:12.420> is

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
that body what I'm trying to do now is

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.799 
that body what I'm trying to do now is
define<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.530> areas<00:00:14.519> where<00:00:14.820> two<00:00:15.150> planes<00:00:15.509> meet

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
define the areas where two planes meet

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.460 
define the areas where two planes meet
one<00:00:16.020> another<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:17.090> as<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.240> see<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.810> have<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.170> lot

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
one another and as you see I have a lot

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.700 
one another and as you see I have a lot
of<00:00:20.240> shadowing<00:00:21.240> underneath<00:00:21.990> overhanging

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
of shadowing underneath overhanging

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.040 
of shadowing underneath overhanging
areas<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:26.150> this<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.570> actually

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
areas like here and this this actually

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.640 
areas like here and this this actually
is<00:00:28.550> under<00:00:29.550> hang<00:00:29.789> under<00:00:30.599> Hum<00:00:30.779> from<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.380> so

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
is under hang under Hum from here so

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.209 
is under hang under Hum from here so
it's<00:00:31.830> darker<00:00:32.489> as<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.149> see<00:00:33.570> there<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.160> this<00:00:35.160> is

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
it's darker as you see there and this is

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.130 
it's darker as you see there and this is
the<00:00:35.370> flat<00:00:35.760> plane<00:00:36.090> up<00:00:36.270> here<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:36.719> below<00:00:37.020> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the flat plane up here but below it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.290 
the flat plane up here but below it
there's<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> heavy<00:00:37.710> shadow<00:00:38.149> fairly<00:00:39.149> heavy

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
there's a heavy shadow fairly heavy

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.350 
there's a heavy shadow fairly heavy
shadow<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.430> I<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.640> darkened<00:00:42.030> up<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
shadow there and I have darkened up the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.330 
shadow there and I have darkened up the
windshield<00:00:42.629> considerably<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.739> haven't<00:00:44.190> done

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
windshield considerably I haven't done

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.220 
windshield considerably I haven't done
the<00:00:44.520> winter<00:00:44.789> wipers<00:00:45.239> yet<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.600> left<00:00:45.989> those

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the winter wipers yet I just left those

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.170 
the winter wipers yet I just left those
white<00:00:46.770> which<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.190> course<00:00:47.219> they<00:00:47.700> never<00:00:47.879> would

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
white which of course they never would

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.779 
white which of course they never would
be<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:49.410> haven't<00:00:49.800> done<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> side<00:00:50.250> window<00:00:50.579> yet

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
be and haven't done the side window yet

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.180 
be and haven't done the side window yet
but<00:00:51.059> I'm<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:52.020> trying<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> define<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
but I'm just trying to define the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.590 
but I'm just trying to define the
changes<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.420> light<00:00:54.840> between<00:00:55.910> this<00:00:56.910> part<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
changes in light between this part and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.139 
changes in light between this part and
the<00:00:58.199> outer<00:00:58.440> part<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> fender<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.910> we're

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the outer part of the fender and we're

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.520 
the outer part of the fender and we're
gonna<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> similar<00:01:01.170> kind<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> thing

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
gonna have the similar kind of thing

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.250 
gonna have the similar kind of thing
here<00:01:01.859> too<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.940> very<00:01:03.030> light<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
here too it's very light here in the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.190 
here too it's very light here in the
photograph<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.119> darker<00:01:06.119> all<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.750> way<00:01:06.840> across

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
photograph but darker all the way across

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.719 
photograph but darker all the way across
here<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:08.990> varying<00:01:09.990> shades<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.770> darkness

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
here and then varying shades of darkness

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.270 
here and then varying shades of darkness
here<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.560> there's<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> lot<00:01:14.250> of

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
here so there's going to be a lot of

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.270 
here so there's going to be a lot of
work<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:16.040> probably<00:01:17.040> hopefully

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
work to do to this I probably hopefully

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.039 
work to do to this I probably hopefully
I'll<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.939> done<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.240> about<00:01:18.330> six<00:01:18.780> lessons

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
I'll get it done in about six lessons

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.350 
I'll get it done in about six lessons
but<00:01:19.560> we'll<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:21.030> where<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.299> leads

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
but we'll have to see where this leads

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.429 
but we'll have to see where this leads
us<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.320> there<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:23.030> with<00:01:24.030> all<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.450> planes<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
us but there is with all the planes and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.649 
us but there is with all the planes and
different<00:01:26.400> angles<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
different angles on this and the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.780 
different angles on this and the
difference<00:01:27.840> some<00:01:28.320> light<00:01:28.530> values<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.610> going

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
difference some light values it's going

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.030 
difference some light values it's going
to<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:30.229> it's<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> take<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> little<00:01:31.829> while

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
to be it's going to take a little while

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.620 
to be it's going to take a little while
to<00:01:32.100> do<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.880> haven't<00:01:33.090> even<00:01:33.150> touched<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
to do and I haven't even touched the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.679 
to do and I haven't even touched the
wheels<00:01:33.810> yet<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.200> course<00:01:34.409> either<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.040> they're

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
wheels yet of course either and they're

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.210 
wheels yet of course either and they're
they're<00:01:36.689> fairly<00:01:36.990> complicated<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.860> their<00:01:38.070> own

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
they're fairly complicated on their own

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.330 
they're fairly complicated on their own
so<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:40.259> it'd<00:01:40.439> look<00:01:40.530> great<00:01:40.680> once<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.189> gets

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
so I think it'd look great once it gets

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.520 
so I think it'd look great once it gets
done<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.570> there's<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.869> lot<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.140> work<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.380> do

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
done but but there's a lot of work to do

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.149 
done but but there's a lot of work to do
to<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.829> yet<00:01:44.509> anyway<00:01:45.509> that's<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.960> I'm<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to it yet anyway that's it I'm going to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.539 
to it yet anyway that's it I'm going to
go<00:01:47.340> ahead<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.740> do<00:01:49.740> some<00:01:49.979> more<00:01:50.130> work<00:01:50.250> today

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
go ahead and and do some more work today

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.760 
go ahead and and do some more work today
and<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.509> will<00:01:51.659> post<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:54.390> then<00:01:55.110> we'll<00:01:55.320> get

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and I will post this and then we'll get

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.399 
and I will post this and then we'll get
going<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.310> doing<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> next<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.540> hope<00:01:58.200> to
