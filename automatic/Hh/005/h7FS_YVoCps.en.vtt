00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.809
 Hello everyone, today we will be with you 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.420
 cook stuffed pepper here it is 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.980
 pepper and let me tell you what we 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.800
 still need at all I want to say 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.769
 that I won't tell you the exact proportions 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.869
 because the amount and size of pepper y 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.880
 all different so you just look 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.850
 by eye how much do you need here 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.160
 for example me on such a hill is 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.120
 weighty need 1 carrot and 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.309
 2 eggs of barely grated cheese 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.629
 Well, look here it is on a platter 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.300
 a hill such mince stuffing and so and pretty 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.829
 still impressive but again, see 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.260
 quantity by 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.340
 the amount of what you will have to look for 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.800
 the number of peppers further from us 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.559
 tomato paste mayonnaise is such a suburb 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.270
 always buy salt and some water 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.680
 and so let's start by the way yes we cook 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.830
 we are in the slow cooker today 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.000
 let's start freeing the peppers from 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.000
 here are these knife 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.430
 Well, that is, here 's a hat like this 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.740
 about with bones all that's left 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:32.020
 also take out so we too 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.330
 doing the most with the rest of the peppers 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.289
 that is, here it is this bottom 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.149
 we remove and so peppers us are ready two 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.159
 things went to the department 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.490
 it's not some were not very inspired not 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.909
 brought therefore remains here one two three 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:54.310
 4 5 six 7 8 stuff just further 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:58.479
 grate carrot and so that's what 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:02.350
 we succeeded then yes and there still 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.289
 within a whole bunch of general well here see 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.090
 just a little bit 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:11.799
 so now we take mince 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.160
 I do not even know which one is better to specify 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:20.970
 Here we add so many carrots 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.970
 don't be scared 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.769
 add break up two eggs there and 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:45.370
 add cheese there as fighters here 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.750
 salt, in principle, need not very much 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.340
 quite literally just a little bit so 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.370
 salty cheese is my usual way 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.170
 Russian is just here sprinkle with salt and 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.170
 all and begin to mix 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.940
 so mixed now add here 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.359
 a bit of mayonnaise q quite a bit 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:16.630
 here at all may not be there I know 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:18.660
 so here are 2 tablespoons all again 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.660
 mix 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.220
 it turns out such here 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:32.099
 mince that is see here and carrots and 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:35.430
 cheese and stuffing itself right now let's 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:40.470
 on our our peppers we take each 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:44.870
 stuff and stuff it with stuffing stuff 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.870
 more that is tamp there straight 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.300
 one is good that I did not tell you 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.610
 proportions because I still have a bunch 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.819
 stuffing left but it does not matter because 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.030
 I don't like pepper in the frame 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.220
 min stuffed things all sorts to him I 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.050
 Iâ€™m just making burgers by the way 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.630
 from here this mash are obtained 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.250
 very very cool at the expense of cheese and 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.620
 carrots are actually just 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.989
 try divinely here 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.930
 so now we do what we do now 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.910
 it is laying in the slow cooker so 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.580
 I am here on the side there is free 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.919
 place and i put for myself in veronica 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.919
 cauliflower Well basically honik 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.660
 Of course it's good if these peppers are all 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.180
 one will close but that 's not just me 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.389
 last ones that are in the garden 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:46.139
 more unfortunately there is no but just such 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.990
 I wanted something from something 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:53.220
 cook from growing on 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:05:00.000
 garden and so we all practically the 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:03.450
 now take water tomato paste or 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.950
 tomato paste well I put a spoon 2 3 shaku 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.990
 In general, I really like when the juice is so 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.160
 let's say with tomato paste but let's 2 with 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.419
 half set and stir 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.520
 if you have some water then 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.190
 crush and here I just smeared and could and 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:28.400
 fasting so that it was not such a cake 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:32.960
 thats all now we close the lid and 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:36.200
 fill these here our peppers 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.200
 the resulting solution 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.290
 in my experience it is necessary that the pepper is not 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:00.940
 was completely in the water and stayed alone 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:04.780
 one third without water 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:11.160
 that's enough so now everything is closing 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.160
 cover and set the menu button 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.280
 push the fire and well, basically an hour I 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.870
 I think enough to press start all 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.510
 meet you in an hour here they are 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.820
 peaches 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.289
 so take out and that's what we get 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.760
 eventually 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:41.140
 Here are such beautiful peppers with soft 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:45.510
