00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
pushing you to to keep diving then once

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.350 
pushing you to to keep diving then once
you're<00:03:25.280> in<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.460> water<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:25.880> everything<00:03:26.240> is

super<00:03:28.580> excited<00:03:29.000> about<00:03:29.210> what<00:03:29.570> you<00:03:29.690> just<00:03:29.870> did

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.940 

you<00:03:39.150> know<00:03:39.240> fairly<00:03:39.450> good<00:03:39.810> when<00:03:39.960> I<00:03:39.990> took<00:03:40.230> off<00:03:40.410> I

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
you know fairly good when I took off I

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.470 
you know fairly good when I took off I
felt<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.700> was<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.030> right<00:03:42.180> speed

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
felt that it was like the right speed

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.290 
felt that it was like the right speed
and<00:03:42.920> as<00:03:43.920> soon<00:03:44.070> as<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.280> turned<00:03:44.490> around<00:03:44.610> it's<00:03:45.090> kind

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
and as soon as I turned around it's kind

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.490 
and as soon as I turned around it's kind
of<00:03:45.330> hard<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.540> see<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.870> water<00:03:46.050> because<00:03:46.260> the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
of hard to see the water because the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.930 
of hard to see the water because the
water<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.860> still<00:03:47.010> really<00:03:47.280> dark<00:03:47.460> and<00:03:47.730> like

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
water is still really dark and like

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.360

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
green but now as I was coming down just

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.820 
green but now as I was coming down just
managed<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.270> stand<00:03:51.480> up<00:03:51.630> good<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.050> fun<00:03:52.410> that's

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
managed to stand up good and fun that's

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.270 
managed to stand up good and fun that's
what<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.010> like

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.490

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
you know before the jelly just fully

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.570 
you know before the jelly just fully
focus<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.320> then<00:04:01.440> right<00:04:01.620> after<00:04:01.740> you<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:02.310> very

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580
