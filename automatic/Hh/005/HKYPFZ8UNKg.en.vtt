in the middle now you may have to do
this<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.220> two<00:01:11.310> batches<00:01:12.200> depending<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
this in two batches depending on the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.270 
this in two batches depending on the
size<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.860> your<00:01:13.920> blender<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.900> know<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:17.630> yeah

try to slice it or just all kinds of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.179 
try to slice it or just all kinds of
methods<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.840> actually<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.590> fastest

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
methods this is actually the fastest

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.899 
methods this is actually the fastest
I've<00:01:35.850> run<00:01:36.119> across<00:01:36.320> we<00:01:37.320> put<00:01:38.280> water<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
I've run across we put water in the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.580 
I've run across we put water in the
blender<00:01:41.570> pop<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.750> top<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.409> you'll<00:01:43.560> have

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
blender pop the top on now you'll have

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.850 
blender pop the top on now you'll have
to<00:01:43.740> excuse<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> noise

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:00.090 

once<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:51.040> guess<00:01:58.230> my<00:01:59.230> fault<00:01:59.470> i<00:01:59.590> packed<00:01:59.800> about

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
once I guess my fault i packed about

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:09.510 
once I guess my fault i packed about
little<00:02:00.490> too<00:02:00.640> tight<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:07.770> think<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.979> piece<00:02:09.369> of

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
little too tight I think the piece of

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.480 
little too tight I think the piece of
too<00:02:09.640> big<00:02:11.520> well<00:02:12.520> we're<00:02:13.180> going
