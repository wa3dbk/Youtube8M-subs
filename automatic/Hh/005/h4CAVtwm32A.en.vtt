00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.660
 Hi guys I'm not a professional myself 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:12.170
 us this is the team Meet you get some cornerstones he should 11 Moss himself 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.279
 our smallest variant would only reach 9 90 euros per year sets the 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.929
 Violence continues 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.130
 without us 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.039
 she has the first video 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.349
 So they are so that Pfizer lay around but the design of helmet hit 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.960
 however, nationwide Fernuni are wondering who and what really 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.769
 Perform and with all and threaten to mouth everything must be afraid 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.699
 But first what does it look like 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:39.830
 permissible 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.380
 because she's goodbye, of course, will have to look a bit more march like that 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.920
 could 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.800
 very very small so 11 Kolmer 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.830
 six numbers 6 9 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.980
 do with several stitches 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.780
 has the big hand but is not really Patzke it really really small 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.450
 and how much and have it 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.450
 Small and light with a little over a kilogram 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.490
 Pröll you can put it back in your pocket and 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.170
 Percent by the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.090
 Size should be through the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.990
 so it does not matter much, so you can do it somehow 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.160
 between laptop 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.050
 when I think of COPD 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.180
 Ziegler just a dash 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.570
 so that is 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.659
 Thanks so much that one almost manages to do it with his finger 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.710
 and 10 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.920
 now the marum is still struggling 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.840
 sure it gets thicker backwards 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.290
 then you have to go right and shoot back side here we have 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.770
 the lock something looks like so well with a MacBooks is completely i antenna 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.180
 in there Frisk w-lan 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.700
 and 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.520
 yes, sat the counter 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.870
 a bit thicker than the US Detmold 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.510
 Mixing the keyword must Bitburg and music Rossmann what does that have 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.050
 So we have here 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.200
 now Coolmax helpers should be grateful 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.820
 then we have a USB 2 0 0 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.130
 and boys the one headphone 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.210
 So the cooks connect suitcases or his car 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.080
 remain behind on allegations, according to speaker unfit data protection 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:12.809
 fan page 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.299
 and also connections and still - Biel continued 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.659
 and a mimi 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:18.869
 this gets 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:22.529
 Percent above market expectations to support Eurex 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.200
 back against 10 20 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.800
 unit4 next to the little things 27 inches I do not imagine that 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.499
 before 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.319
 We can still do the test video 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.029
 if I have mine 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:36.969
 one 22 inches 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.219
 I know about connecting 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.909
 and that's quite impressive 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.709
 Gutsche so the outer so I see ick wunderhübsch Bigben processed 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.739
 So nothing worked here nothing complained here 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.609
 you shake that you can knock on the table but I will do it 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.339
 it's really conscious that feels 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:57.779
 and therefore for the 98th 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:02.149
 had a through-going schedule over that of the new MacBooks as well 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.850
 and thus 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.679
 we lack 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:09.039
 also the Schumann percent rather heavy breathing because we have so small here 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.830
 League continues 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.630
 screw 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.900
 and to make the special screwdriver for me 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.579
 that it's not that easy 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.040
 then you have to then buy how to buy or the mobile neck so 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.759
 "Then we have to look 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.889
 honestly, there could not be much in it here either 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.139
 You can not buy a hard drive, but it was up to the company 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.179
 Lawmakers should have Apple 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.849
 Hach like a Rambo way screwed on their notebook 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:37.249
 but what you change 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:42.039
 There are also manufacturers of the 1 56 Gigabyte offers casting with 64 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:43.169
 it 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.349
 so nice 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.449
 who to thing 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:49.349
 o'neals percent you can me the complex the concert on the stage 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.129
 occurs 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.189
 Ohnemus that one can not change even if the heirs sent here 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.069
 by Wolf is the order with Apple order accordingly 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.379
 costs a bit more 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.540
 the city of Olsberg 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.009
 is vibration has to consider what you want to do 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.599
 and now that's up again 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.330
 to make it easier in Zenon 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.730
 there can open with a finger so obviously believes that 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.439
 Cool because in the community Metelen 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.229
 that does not work on the water by itself 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.519
 something is on and 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.080
 what is the way up so the big keyboard stands out 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.800
 and that will happen from time to time and if it is possible 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.199
 which has exactly the same size as the keyboard like Bluetooth keyboard or 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.930
 Dispatchers Rome 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.840
 yes, everything will fit here as well 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.550
 aligned in the same size 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.550
 in addition, the f-keys raised this smaller one 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:43.879
 Unknowingly St and also the current from scarce 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:48.689
 is out of the housing on this trend almost immigrated family far right 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:49.890
 and the jackpot Nis 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.210
 Besides 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.110
 Some banks need only if their external drive then rolls 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.620
 or made about this 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.510
 that's hard to weigh or so that could be the lips then 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.520
 FOTA in another Mac costs 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.040
 "This is our third car is not only clearly in what model 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.279
 no means he has a lighted keyboard 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:14.279
 maybe for reasons of space maybe in the technical data 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.430
 who knows that already shows a bit shrunken and in the 16 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.420
 been given to the new format 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.930
 as the screen is synonymous exposing to new 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.850
 the wrong thing is still comparable to the whole mobook 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.930
 even pretty big and very comfortable to use yet 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.110
 to let 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.849
 So we get a little something that stands out. We do not have a black one 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.099
 Ford and Women narrow the way 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.279
 Although a funny picture installed but 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.809
 This Glossy Display Grossanlass that is not 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:46.680
 Jan and plastic 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.499
 Layer 4 2 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:50.289
 Away with the pane in front of it 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.869
 And while this also reflects in Seefeld, here he is too 

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:55.979
 queried and coup too 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.889
 and around 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.440
 but it's not as bad as the glass for example I'm always that 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:02.270
 these are likely 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.789
 completeness 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.210
 we are strengthening ourselves through the display of life 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.189
 the excess baggage is misplaced 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:09.680
 because this is about 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.879
 Sinsheim 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.169
 Heike Wessels clarifies who my very high resolution 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.050
 Community for resolutions as on a 13 of MacBook Pro 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.379
 that then makes itself quite good in the following way and indeed you can 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:23.730
 then the windows 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.550
 properly used as the sun Rome 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.759
 everything will be smaller Rob Dobson bigger 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.070
 little better eyes the roar or something 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.020
 Peters 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.509
 by tapping 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:40.289
 so the panel itself is not quite the same quality 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.270
 Intoxicating for me so the colors are a bit washed out 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.220
 be crisper 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.219
 and also down here on the edge and up on the edge zap so far cloud formation so 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:51.899
 yes not so bombastic illuminates 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:55.739
 but for that the concert is simply again to offer on the one hand product 

00:06:55.739 --> 00:06:56.550
 that has 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.949
 impressive 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:00.020
 and 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.409
 that's why it's really optimal and so easy and so portable 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.789
 from the processing ago by the design ago 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:07.999
 for me 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:11.119
 the highest score you can give so better you can not do it 

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:12.159
 do 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:14.330
 20 harvest them 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.309
 also for the price only 9 90 euros 

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:21.300
 is not that expensive considering what for example Sun Project Booklet costs 

00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:23.369
 with the same capacity 

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:24.599
 you go here already 

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:26.909
 also say proper 

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:30.909
 So that's how it was 

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:34.349
 and so the second is stuck with 10 from March 

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:38.159
 not just look now is linked and Nikita on it and 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:42.039
 complex next video and you see them in the next video countdown to us 

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:43.889
 you always dress anyway 

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:47.910
 So people took care of landlord in today's such of Jens Marx Wohnens 

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:52.610
 Last Crusade r that are thumbs up for the Burgdorfer they can do why 

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.729
 we can do many beautiful things whatever you want 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:56.150
