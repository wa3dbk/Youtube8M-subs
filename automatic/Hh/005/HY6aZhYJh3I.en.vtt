time that I put in a window on a fresh

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.860 
time that I put in a window on a fresh
file<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.109> wasn't<00:00:31.769> able<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.189> save<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:33.030> window

type<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.500> fresh<00:00:35.660> models<00:00:36.660> when<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.930> open<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
type in fresh models when I open the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.590 
type in fresh models when I open the
next<00:00:37.590> time<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> was<00:00:39.120> going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> show

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
next time so what I was going to show

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.450 
next time so what I was going to show
today<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.500> how<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.710> actually<00:00:41.010> solve

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
today was just how we actually solve

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
today was just how we actually solve
that<00:00:41.700> situation<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.750> let's<00:00:43.020> assume<00:00:43.379> we're

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
that situation so let's assume we're

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.779 
that situation so let's assume we're
going<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> put<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.930> new<00:00:45.930> window<00:00:46.110> type<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.579> we

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.900 

three<00:01:56.990> meters<00:01:57.170> okay<00:02:00.430> so<00:02:01.430> what<00:02:01.610> we're<00:02:01.760> going<00:02:01.850> to

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
three meters okay so what we're going to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.690 
three meters okay so what we're going to

and correction we're going to make it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.630 
and correction we're going to make it
then<00:02:10.610> we'll<00:02:10.820> make<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.000> four<00:02:11.360> legs<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:13.010> we'll

then we'll make it four legs and we'll

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.150 
then we'll make it four legs and we'll
make<00:02:13.850> them<00:02:15.490> of<00:02:17.470> individual<00:02:18.470> size<00:02:18.710> so<00:02:19.010> we

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
make them of individual size so we

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.450 
make them of individual size so we
unclick<00:02:19.940> vehicle<00:02:20.420> widths<00:02:20.830> we'll<00:02:21.830> make<00:02:22.010> that

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
unclick vehicle widths we'll make that

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.860 
unclick vehicle widths we'll make that
one<00:02:24.160> say<00:02:25.160> 15%<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:27.140> leave<00:02:27.560> for<00:02:28.390> 15<00:02:29.390> percent<00:02:29.570> of

one say 15% and leave for 15 percent of
the<00:02:29.960> width<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:32.330> should<00:02:32.660> leave<00:02:32.960> us<00:02:32.990> with

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
the width and that should leave us with

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.630 
the width and that should leave us with
35<00:02:35.000> percent<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:36.170> each<00:02:36.320> one<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.220> other<00:02:37.340> two

up<00:02:51.709> with<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.980> sliding<00:02:52.670> door<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:53.209> has<00:02:53.870> two<00:02:54.260> side

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
up with a sliding door that has two side

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.660 
up with a sliding door that has two side
lights<00:02:55.070> on<00:02:55.430> either<00:02:55.580> side<00:02:56.050> finish<00:02:57.400> okay<00:02:58.400> and

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
lights on either side finish okay and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.350 
lights on either side finish okay and
we'll<00:02:58.820> call<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.240> sliding<00:02:59.750> new<00:03:00.340> okay<00:03:01.340> so<00:03:02.060> what

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
we'll call it a sliding new okay so what

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.020 
we'll call it a sliding new okay so what
I'm<00:03:02.480> going<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.810> do<00:03:03.050> is<00:03:03.680> put<00:03:04.070> that<00:03:04.100> window<00:03:04.850> in

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
I'm going to do is put that window in

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.020 
I'm going to do is put that window in
left<00:03:05.840> click<00:03:06.140> on<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.440> window<00:03:06.769> icon<00:03:07.030> select

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
left click on the window icon select

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.699 
left click on the window icon select
sliding<00:03:08.510> new<00:03:08.890> we<00:03:09.890> want<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.190> height<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.790> be<00:03:11.709> the

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
sliding new we want the height to be the

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.820 
sliding new we want the height to be the
elevation<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.550> be<00:03:13.700> zero

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.880 

okay<00:03:19.730> so<00:03:20.730> we<00:03:21.120> can<00:03:21.270> see<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.690> window<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.770> the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
okay so we can see that window and the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.420 
okay so we can see that window and the
model<00:03:23.190> view<00:03:23.400> there<00:03:24.920> which<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.070> all<00:03:26.220> well<00:03:26.400> and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
model view there which is all well and

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.460 
model view there which is all well and
good<00:03:26.580> but<00:03:26.910> if<00:03:27.060> we<00:03:27.240> make<00:03:27.630> up<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:28.080> fresh<00:03:30.140> job<00:03:31.140> for

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
good but if we make up a fresh job for

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.650 
good but if we make up a fresh job for
somebody<00:03:31.830> what<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.280> was<00:03:32.490> finding<00:03:32.790> was<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.270> I

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
somebody what I was finding was that I

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.740 
somebody what I was finding was that I
had<00:03:33.900> no<00:03:33.930> way<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.880> saying<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.090> window<00:03:36.330> types<00:03:36.570> I

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
had no way of saying that window types I

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.360 
had no way of saying that window types I
was<00:03:36.900> fabricating<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.620> windows<00:03:37.920> over<00:03:38.280> and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
was fabricating the windows over and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.160 
was fabricating the windows over and
over<00:03:38.580> again

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
over again

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.000 
over again
our<00:03:40.170> solution<00:03:40.800> is<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.930> -<00:03:42.930> two<00:03:43.380> solutions<00:03:43.890> are

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
our solution is this - two solutions are

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.220 
our solution is this - two solutions are
actually<00:03:44.100> offered<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.640> me<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.420> first<00:03:45.630> one<00:03:45.990> is

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
actually offered to me the first one is

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.230 
actually offered to me the first one is
if<00:03:46.890> we<00:03:47.130> go<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.640> file<00:03:48.140> save<00:03:49.140> as<00:03:49.380> template

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
if we go to the file save as template

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.350 
if we go to the file save as template
tab<00:03:51.530> we<00:03:52.530> can<00:03:52.560> then<00:03:52.920> save<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.520> entire<00:03:53.970> model

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
tab we can then save that entire model

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.170 
tab we can then save that entire model
with<00:03:55.110> its<00:03:55.140> window<00:03:55.709> types<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.370> door<00:03:56.550> types<00:03:56.850> and

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
with its window types and door types and

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.580 
with its window types and door types and
slab<00:03:57.450> types<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:57.930> are<00:03:58.110> sharing<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.560> same

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
slab types that are sharing the same

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.420 
slab types that are sharing the same
approach<00:03:59.160> under<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.740> separate<00:04:01.740> template

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
approach under a separate template

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.750 
approach under a separate template
window<00:04:02.640> so<00:04:03.570> every<00:04:04.020> time<00:04:04.200> we<00:04:04.410> open<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:05.130> job

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
window so every time we open a job

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.110 
window so every time we open a job
people<00:04:06.090> come<00:04:06.510> back<00:04:07.490> with<00:04:08.490> that<00:04:08.640> model<00:04:09.000> in

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
people come back with that model in

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.050 
people come back with that model in
place<00:04:09.270> now<00:04:09.959> that's<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.770> good<00:04:11.220> approach<00:04:11.340> but<00:04:12.030> I

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
place now that's a good approach but I

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.730 
place now that's a good approach but I
actually<00:04:12.270> thought<00:04:12.690> this<00:04:12.959> was<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.290> better<00:04:13.470> one

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
actually thought this was the better one

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.949 
actually thought this was the better one
because<00:04:14.959> it<00:04:15.959> would<00:04:16.230> it<00:04:16.470> allowed<00:04:16.799> us<00:04:16.830> to<00:04:17.040> have<00:04:17.370> a

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
because it would it allowed us to have a

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.150 
because it would it allowed us to have a
the<00:04:18.959> base<00:04:19.140> styles<00:04:19.650> in<00:04:19.739> place<00:04:19.980> without

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
the base styles in place without

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.520 
the base styles in place without
actually<00:04:20.730> having<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:21.090> model<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.510> build<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.930> model

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
actually having a model to build a model

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.140 
actually having a model to build a model
placed<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.220> modeling<00:04:23.610> space<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.030> begin

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
placed on the modeling space to begin

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.440 
placed on the modeling space to begin
with<00:04:24.450> if<00:04:24.660> we<00:04:24.810> go<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.350> visual<00:04:25.590> arcs<00:04:26.190> tab<00:04:26.520> and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
with if we go to the visual arcs tab and

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.870 
with if we go to the visual arcs tab and
go<00:04:27.750> down<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.260> styles<00:04:29.900> export

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.920 

correction<00:04:34.880> when<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.180> fall<00:04:35.390> I<00:04:35.660> stand

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
correction when you fall I stand

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.520 
correction when you fall I stand
corrected

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.580 

so<00:04:39.530> we<00:04:39.740> gonna<00:04:39.890> browse<00:04:40.990> we're<00:04:41.990> going<00:04:42.260> to<00:04:42.380> call

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
so we gonna browse we're going to call

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:51.820 
so we gonna browse we're going to call
it<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:44.360> test

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.719 

okay<00:04:52.430> it'll<00:04:52.789> be<00:04:52.909> meters<00:04:53.330> click<00:04:54.110> Next<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:55.370> asked

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
okay it'll be meters click Next it asked

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.730 
okay it'll be meters click Next it asked
us<00:04:55.819> what<00:04:56.060> are<00:04:56.210> elements<00:04:56.659> we<00:04:56.780> wish<00:04:56.960> to<00:04:57.139> save<00:04:57.379> so

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
us what are elements we wish to save so

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.140 
us what are elements we wish to save so
in<00:04:57.800> this<00:04:57.919> case<00:04:58.250> we're<00:04:58.610> only<00:04:58.789> going<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.090> be

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
in this case we're only going to be

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.149 
in this case we're only going to be
saving<00:04:59.680> the<00:05:00.970> window<00:05:01.970> or<00:05:02.270> window<00:05:02.870> styles<00:05:03.440> and

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
saving the window or window styles and

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.920 
saving the window or window styles and
we<00:05:04.280> will<00:05:04.430> export<00:05:04.879> that<00:05:06.430> ok<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:07.879> here<00:05:08.629> we'll<00:05:08.780> go

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
we will export that ok and here we'll go

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.420 
we will export that ok and here we'll go
and<00:05:09.139> we'll<00:05:09.229> put<00:05:09.379> it<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.740> test<00:05:09.770> I'm<00:05:10.250> going

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
and we'll put it to the test I'm going

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.430 
and we'll put it to the test I'm going
to<00:05:10.550> open<00:05:10.699> a<00:05:10.970> new<00:05:11.319> template<00:05:12.319> save<00:05:13.009> to<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.610> No

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
to open a new template save to that No

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.480 
to open a new template save to that No
ok<00:05:15.440> we're<00:05:15.650> just<00:05:15.680> going<00:05:15.979> to<00:05:16.009> click<00:05:16.220> large

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
ok we're just going to click large

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.589 
ok we're just going to click large
objects<00:05:16.970> meters<00:05:19.360> ok

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
objects meters ok

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:25.270 
objects meters ok
there's<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:21.050> fresh<00:05:21.440> file<00:05:21.800> open<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:24.009> I'll<00:05:25.009> just

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
there's a fresh file open and I'll just

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.670 
there's a fresh file open and I'll just
quickly<00:05:25.729> build<00:05:26.150> a<00:05:26.449> wall<00:05:27.020> just<00:05:27.319> by<00:05:27.469> way<00:05:27.650> of

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680

for me and hopefully itself for other
people<00:06:48.380> on<00:06:48.530> how<00:06:49.190> we<00:06:49.250> save<00:06:49.850> those<00:06:50.840> various

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
people on how we save those various

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.010 
people on how we save those various
window<00:06:52.160> types<00:06:52.460> that<00:06:52.729> we<00:06:52.880> create<00:06:53.270> on<00:06:53.450> one<00:06:53.660> model

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
window types that we create on one model

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.760 
window types that we create on one model
so<00:06:54.830> they<00:06:55.010> can<00:06:55.190> be<00:06:55.370> reused<00:06:55.970> in<00:06:57.669> subsequent<00:06:58.669> jobs

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
so they can be reused in subsequent jobs

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.900 
so they can be reused in subsequent jobs
sounded<00:07:00.770> like<00:07:00.890> a<00:07:00.950> simple<00:07:01.340> one<00:07:01.460> but<00:07:01.640> that<00:07:01.729> had

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
sounded like a simple one but that had

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.350 
sounded like a simple one but that had
me<00:07:02.030> stumped<00:07:02.390> for<00:07:02.450> a<00:07:02.630> day<00:07:03.020> or<00:07:03.169> so<00:07:03.970> hope<00:07:04.970> this<00:07:05.000> is

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 
me stumped for a day or so hope this is

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.430 
me stumped for a day or so hope this is
