00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.970 
video was talking about a new zombie AI
being<00:02:43.910> smarter<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.660> taking<00:02:45.350> away<00:02:45.560> from<00:02:45.620> the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
being smarter and taking away from the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.310 
being smarter and taking away from the
originality<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:47.030> being<00:02:47.630> able<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.960> train

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
originality of being able to train

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.880 
originality of being able to train
however<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:50.080> clarified<00:02:51.080> with<00:02:51.350> this<00:02:51.620> leak

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
zombies will still be able to be trained

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.450 
zombies will still be able to be trained
the<00:03:02.600> team<00:03:02.900> are<00:03:03.110> deciding<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:03.800> bringing<00:03:04.190> new

classic zombies experience for example

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.250 
classic zombies experience for example
the<00:03:12.440> new<00:03:12.650> AI<00:03:12.980> zombies<00:03:13.910> could<00:03:14.450> climb<00:03:14.750> out<00:03:15.080> of<00:03:15.110> a

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
the new AI zombies could climb out of a

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.790 
the new AI zombies could climb out of a
window<00:03:15.470> fall<00:03:16.070> over<00:03:16.490> and<00:03:16.520> roll<00:03:17.000> as<00:03:17.270> opposed<00:03:18.140> to

just climbing over the ledge as well as

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.070 
just climbing over the ledge as well as
the<00:03:22.040> zombie<00:03:22.430> could<00:03:22.610> now<00:03:22.820> also<00:03:23.150> be<00:03:23.540> lurking

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
the zombie could now also be lurking

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.400 
the zombie could now also be lurking
when<00:03:24.710> you<00:03:25.040> open<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.520> new<00:03:25.550> door<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> new<00:03:27.110> area

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
when you open a new door to a new area

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.550 
when you open a new door to a new area
of<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.740> map<00:03:27.920> for<00:03:28.340> example<00:03:28.850> remember<00:03:29.660> the

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
of the map for example remember the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.310 
of the map for example remember the
zombies<00:03:31.040> still<00:03:31.340> have<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.880> conscious<00:03:32.810> brain

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
zombies still have a conscious brain

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.000 
zombies still have a conscious brain
almost<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:34.730> they<00:03:35.330> could<00:03:35.540> just<00:03:35.570> be<00:03:36.170> essentially

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
almost so they could just be essentially

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.890 
almost so they could just be essentially

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
I cannot stress this enough although the

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.490 
I cannot stress this enough although the

more of kind of realistic features that

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.270 
more of kind of realistic features that
a<00:03:56.060> zombie<00:03:56.330> would<00:03:56.690> do<00:03:56.900> in<00:03:57.080> real<00:03:57.260> life<00:03:57.560> as<00:03:57.830> an<00:03:58.070> if

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
a zombie would do in real life as an if

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.640 
a zombie would do in real life as an if
he<00:03:58.940> was<00:03:59.120> stopped<00:03:59.420> by<00:03:59.630> something<00:03:59.930> he<00:04:00.470> would

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
he was stopped by something he would

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.070 
he was stopped by something he would
fall<00:04:00.920> over<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.340> tumble<00:04:01.880> roll<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:02.750> then<00:04:02.900> get

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
fall over and tumble roll and then get

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.410 
fall over and tumble roll and then get
back<00:04:03.260> up<00:04:03.530> or<00:04:03.709> jumping<00:04:04.670> over<00:04:04.970> something

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
back up or jumping over something

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.270 
back up or jumping over something
falling<00:04:05.720> over<00:04:06.230> so<00:04:06.709> it's<00:04:06.860> more<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.250> the

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
falling over so it's more of the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.730

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
visual effect as the gameplay but that's

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.600
