00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi friends today I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.480
 the updating of pure habitats and 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.080
 legendary dragon city from 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.179
 July 25, 2013 the habitat 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.089
 pure and this legend have changed from 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.150
 appearance but also cost to 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.910
 can buy it from generation or 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.220
 production of gold and capacity for 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.580
 put or place dragons 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.240
 first I 'm going to talk about the altar 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.400
 pure 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.070
 now all the pure dragons 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.780
 they will share the same habitat 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.330
 they will have special characteristics 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.550
 elements as before I had but all 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.100
 the dragons will have the same habitat 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.070
 with the same design but they can place 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.470
 from now on two pure dragons with 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.900
 a single habitat before and only you can 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.900
 place a pure habitat in addition 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.840
 to produce 80,000 gold before only 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.650
 produced 50,000 so it increases in a 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.890
 30 thousand the generation of gold and also if 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.130
 you have enhancers or crystals 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.750
 will be able to boost the production of gold 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.700
 any pure aragon as long as 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.340
 have the crystals that exist for 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.560
 each one of those elements what 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.030
 has also changed is the cost to 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.980
 acquire pure habitat 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.040
 before it only cost two and a half million 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.350
 Gold now bets 30 million 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.160
 hours so it has become a 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.900
 habitat a bit expensive but if you do not 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.940
 they have money to buy a habitat 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.190
 pure but they have a pure dragon that 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.710
 they want to place at the moment they can 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.900
 place that pure dragon in any 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.690
 habitat of your element for example if 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.030
 your 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.950
 they have a pure earth dragon and not 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.340
 they have dark habitat what can they 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.320
 placing common ground in a habitat is not 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.390
 know how long you can do this 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.550
 but for the moment that can be done 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.290
 If they do not have the cabin, remember that 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.890
 they can place any pure dragon 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.460
 in a view as as inhabited that what 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.340
 normal if they have a pure ice dragon what 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.630
 can be placed in the other habitat of 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.270
 what I'm going to talk about is the habitat 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.640
 housing and habitat legend has 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.590
 changed also the appearance continues 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.510
 maintaining the characteristic that 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.850
 you can only place a dragon by 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.950
 each habitat but changing the 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.950
 generation gold production before 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.410
 produced 750 thousand euros now it's just going to 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.600
 produce 300 thousand gold and also its 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.730
 price has also changed before this 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.430
 habitat could be purchased for 150 thousand 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.600
 euros and now you will have to 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.520
 buying 40 million gold 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.100
 and also there has been a change of level 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.450
 to be able to acquire it before you could 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.400
 acquire being a level 24 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.200
 in the game now they will have to upload 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.610
 up to level 38 for the time of 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.520
 buy this 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.640
 this vital 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.960
 but let's be meta 2 2 new dragons 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.900
 ones the dragon and oviedo three thrones but 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.790
 it has removed a dragon legend that 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.280
 legendary that was before that the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.580
 dragon wind good ease of 25 already 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.770
 they can not get it 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.160
 and as I told you, the only thing that 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.160
 do is 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.530
 many hours to buy these 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.780
 habitats good after having said 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.080
 this we are going to brabo the cycle and how 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.080
 said 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:31.349
 the legendary habitat has changed 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.400
 completely to what it was before and also 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.940
 his generation of today before produced 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.220
 750,000 gold 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.340
 now only produce 30,000 gold 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.080
 if you have a wind dragon you do not know 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.090
 worry because they will not be removed or 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.310
 will disappear they will be able to continue 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.730
 keeping it until you decide 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.590
 sell it this for news that I've 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.340
 read on the scary page for the 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.440
 go ahead and tell you that 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.890
 this dragon will remain for all 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.989
 players who have obtained before the 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.590
 update but if they sell them anymore 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:11.019
 they can re-opt to obtain the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.019
 another habitat as I said is the habitat 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.970
 pure all dragons know all 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.100
 the living quarters have become 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.370
 they no longer maintain those 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.530
 characteristics of by elements but 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.870
 all have become equal but what 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.030
 good thing about this is that now you 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.580
 they can place up to two pure dragons 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.250
 in the same habitat for example me here 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.090
 in this pure habitat I have where 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.949
 pure metal trees and as I told you 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.289
 before if you have enhancers or 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:44.830
 crystals can enhance the generation 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:48.430
 gold putting crystals 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.460
 around those dragons for example 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:56.230
 I have here the metal dragons and 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:58.570
 near them I have these 43 this 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.810
 crystal enhancers and likewise 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.820
 I also have 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.820
 a fire and al with 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.180
 with an electric dragon and around him 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.660
 I have electric crystals that what 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.520
 they do is empower this is the generation 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.990
 of gold so they can give me or lobÃ³n 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.070
 quickly for example he 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.070
 and pure electric general 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.670
 an amount 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.860
 level 10 but more 180 more for having the 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.080
 crystals near them as it already directs 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.180
 if you have a pure dragon and not 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.539
 they get this 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.340
 money to buy the cabin since 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:43.249
 it's too expensive they can put that 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:46.399
 pure dragon in a common habitat 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:48.630
 for example I will right now to make 

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:51.990
 a test I'm going to move to this 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.250
 the forests in drago a sea cured and I'm going 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.110
 to place 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.820
 inhabited with children that is a life of 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.950
 element 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.370
 of the most element 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.230
 and it can be put with or placed there without 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.050
 problems so if you do not have 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.090
 money to be able to buy this one 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.130
 cabin can go by while 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.710
 placing this ensures bonus and cigars 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.780
 have common graffiti does not matter if 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.050
 are 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.420
 I can put here in this in this 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.950
 habitat itself because this habitable in 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.010
 that can house any dragon 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.410
 of the sea element and how I have the dragon 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.009
 purest I can put here as 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.199
 be inhabited 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:37.749
 the one that will house four dragons the 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.460
 element wrong as I told you if you do not 

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:42.129
 reach gold to buy a habitat 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.699
 pure can place their pure dragons 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:47.110
 in common habitats their 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:49.360
 elements 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.130

 thank you very much
