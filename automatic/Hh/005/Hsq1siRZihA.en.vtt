00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.279
 today we are here to do another thing for 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.610
 that the boys and encourage the selection 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:13.180
 and we are going to make some paintings for 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.970
 the body that are 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.510
 they are not aggressive and that boys can 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.250
 painted clean themselves easy and good 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.880
 I came up with this idea so that 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.100
 make me look the first one is done 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.830
 I made a box with a capful of 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:36.500
 of milk or juice and then use it 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.900
 as a pot for them to keep their 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.730
 painting that do not need much 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.730
 because as it is for the skin it is little 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.570
 what gets good in the box 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.520
 simple is a cap of these so of the 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.880
 tetrabrik that I cut it after 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.910
 grab another piece of tetrabrik for 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.400
 put it down and then with tape 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.640
 to mask without a pen that I 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.090
 hooked with this tape we hit everything 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.380
 around a strip of tape and this goes 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.380
 to make that we have the box 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.720
 closed and that we do not miss the 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.900
 painting 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.050
 so when we finish it there are 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.810
 that we put everything around the tape and we 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:31.649
 it will stay like this outstanding 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.299
 well little boat good for boys 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.149
 they will like it because it was going to be 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.840
 little one and they will keep it type 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:42.570
 pinturitas and well after I put a 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.140
 colored cardboard according to the color of 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.580
 paint that we do this obviously me 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.140
 I'm doing it in Argentina then 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.729
 Well obviously we are doing it to 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.720
 celestial and white but can be of the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.240
 colors that you want and the the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.399
 creampie or the painting I was trying 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.759
 several because actually there was first 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.700
 read one that was with oil or with a 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.740
 medium fat I tried it with oil and the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.580
 true that it was quite complicated 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.470
 do it then it occurred to me to try 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.170
 with hair gel 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.420
 a fixative gel of those used for 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.020
 that the hair is with a wet effect 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.930
 you evaluate by cornstarch style or 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.880
 corn starch after it got 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.820
 vegetable dye I in this case had 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.560
 of these that are thick that are a 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.320
 cream but they can also be the liquid 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.060
 and so that the kids like it 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.780
 I put a little more glitter you put 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.670
 a little bit of free white and blue for 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.480
 reinforce the colors 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.550
 the painting is left I do not know if it gets to 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.710
 notice because this is the white one but 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.610
 it remains very easy to 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.610
 to use 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.640
 the white one is not the most 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.330
 covers but good because it's really 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.890
 white like cornstarch but now 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.120
 then I show them with blue as 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.920
 it looks pretty good, I show you 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.200
 because it is very easy to do it and this 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.080
 can do with the guys taking advantage 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.150
 holidays also for that for 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.040
 make drawings in the body that 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.440
 they know that this also comes out easy is a 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:33.200
 pinturita that comes out cleans easy I put 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.629
 gel I will put first coloring 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.739
 I mean, I'm going to try that first 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:43.250
 it happens that the dye is dyed if I take out 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.520
 a little bit of coloring is better 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.480
 there's the color, come on, let's go 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.670
 remain of the color I did not put too much 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.890
 because this is blue is blue dye and 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.070
 I do not want it to be blue but 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.959
 it is white that is celestial pardon 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.790
 so now we put corn in the 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.180
 requirement that what I put on gel is 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.180
 more or less a teaspoon of these of 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.260
 coffee and puts more in the same amount of 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.049
 cornstarch 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.970
 more or less this you are seeing it to 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.010
 As they mix, tell the 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.769
 guys that help them too 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.090
 can help with this that is very 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.090
 very funny piola 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.990
 and that this also entertains them 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.290
 while they do it they do it and then they 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.890
 they paint all together they do all the 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.620
 process is good that the boys do 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.700
 a whole process that they see from since 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.300
 it started what puts a little more than 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:47.600
 gel because I really put him more 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.280
 little bit more cornstarch but it's not going 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.810
 realizing because he sees that he is not running 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.970
 then when when you see that one no longer 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.720
 you can mix it more you have to add it 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.440
 a little gel 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.380
 and there now it will look good now 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.760
 when we mix all this cornstarch 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.820
 I'm just going to put a little bit of 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.940
 free or whatever they want to say 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.600
 glimpses that kids love 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:16.640
 what boy does not like a painting that 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.640
 be with glitter 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.470
 we mix it 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.200
 we mix everything we can and 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.120
 then we will place it in our 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.150
 little box we made 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.650
 this is the white one this is the other little box 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.740
 which is empty 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.600
 in this empty box once I have 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.970
 well mixed this so they do not remain 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.280
 lumps or anything that happened to me 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.240
 when I did with him with the oil 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.840
 there were lumps 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:54.580
 well then now here I fill my pot 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:57.669
 with my super homemade paint think that 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:02.199
 this is not allergic because it's nothing 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:05.260
 more than cornstarch and hair gel 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.210
 and there is vegetable and washing dye 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:13.249
 also with water and soap with water and 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:15.829
 Soap is already done and paints like this 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:20.149
 then there for example we can 

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:22.670
 make our little flag to encourage 

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:24.650
 our party 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.760
 Well, I hope it serves you and that the 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.760
 entertain the boys
