00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450 

I<00:00:02.659> had<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.689> big<00:00:03.929> problem<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.680> it<00:00:04.799> noticed<00:00:05.250> it

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
I had a big problem and it noticed it

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.140 
I had a big problem and it noticed it
specifically<00:00:06.150> last<00:00:06.480> year<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.259> have<00:00:07.560> three

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
specifically last year I have three

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.240 
specifically last year I have three
different<00:00:09.150> levels<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:10.080> learners<00:00:10.559> had<00:00:10.950> this

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
different levels of learners had this

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.190 
different levels of learners had this
group<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.670> really<00:00:11.969> high<00:00:12.240> achieving<00:00:12.630> students

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
group of really high achieving students

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.700 
group of really high achieving students
they<00:00:13.559> were<00:00:13.620> frustrated<00:00:14.460> because<00:00:15.440> they<00:00:16.440> could

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
they were frustrated because they could

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.550 
they were frustrated because they could
do<00:00:17.220> more<00:00:17.490> at<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> quicker<00:00:18.150> pace<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:19.080> then<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> had

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
do more at a quicker pace and then I had

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.710 
do more at a quicker pace and then I had
some<00:00:19.800> good<00:00:20.010> students<00:00:20.670> who<00:00:20.880> still<00:00:21.330> needed<00:00:21.570> more

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
some good students who still needed more

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.550 
some good students who still needed more
time<00:00:21.930> with<00:00:22.109> material<00:00:25.609> so<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:27.410> decided<00:00:28.410> that

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
time with material so I I decided that

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.040 
time with material so I I decided that
the<00:00:28.710> flipped<00:00:28.980> videos<00:00:29.910> would<00:00:30.179> let<00:00:30.420> some<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.929> my

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the flipped videos would let some of my

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.900 
the flipped videos would let some of my
students<00:00:31.529> move<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.369> progress<00:00:32.640> at<00:00:32.850> a

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
students move on and progress at a

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.549 
students move on and progress at a
quicker<00:00:33.120> pace<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.660> they<00:00:33.750> didn't<00:00:34.050> need<00:00:34.320> me<00:00:34.530> on

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
quicker pace and they didn't need me on

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.190 
quicker pace and they didn't need me on
top<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.190> them<00:00:35.399> teaching<00:00:36.210> them<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.690> lecturing

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
top of them teaching them and lecturing

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.410 
top of them teaching them and lecturing
at<00:00:37.320> them<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.980> reason<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.550> think<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.030> works<00:00:39.239> so

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
at them the reason I think this works so

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.720 
at them the reason I think this works so
well<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.110> because<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.680> lets<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
well is it because it lets you the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.819 
well is it because it lets you the
students<00:00:42.180> who<00:00:42.270> work<00:00:42.480> at<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> fast<00:00:42.989> pace<00:00:43.110> work<00:00:43.649> at

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
students who work at a fast pace work at

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.010 
students who work at a fast pace work at
a<00:00:43.860> fast<00:00:44.129> pace<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:45.120> lets<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> students<00:00:45.899> who

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
a fast pace and it lets the students who

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.410 
a fast pace and it lets the students who
don't<00:00:46.230> work<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> fast<00:00:47.010> pace<00:00:47.100> they<00:00:47.730> can<00:00:48.000> go<00:00:48.270> at

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
don't work at a fast pace they can go at

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.690 
don't work at a fast pace they can go at
their<00:00:48.600> own<00:00:48.629> pace<00:00:49.020> um<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:50.010> kind<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.370> learn<00:00:50.520> at

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
their own pace um we kind of learn at

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.450 
their own pace um we kind of learn at
like<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.940> slower<00:00:51.210> pace<00:00:51.539> instead<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.379> having<00:00:53.010> one

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
like a slower pace instead of having one

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.430 
like a slower pace instead of having one
big<00:00:53.489> group<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.570> getting<00:00:54.750> confused

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
big group and kind of getting confused

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.819 
big group and kind of getting confused
you<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.399> learn<00:00:56.610> instead<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.870> having<00:00:58.680> her

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
