I'm Steve Carano with ask a real expert
something<00:00:03.720> XD<00:00:04.589> asked<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.279> question<00:00:05.670> about

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
something XD asked this question about

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.240 
something XD asked this question about
cortisol<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.960> lot<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.140> guys<00:00:07.350> have<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:08.189> I

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
cortisol and a lot of guys have and I

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.350 
cortisol and a lot of guys have and I
think<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.460> may<00:00:08.580> have<00:00:08.639> even<00:00:08.820> done<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.030> video<00:00:09.179> on

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
think I may have even done a video on

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.350 
think I may have even done a video on
this<00:00:09.630> he<00:00:10.349> says<00:00:10.590> Steve<00:00:10.860> how<00:00:11.550> long<00:00:11.880> should<00:00:12.240> I

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
this he says Steve how long should I

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.839 
this he says Steve how long should I
spend<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> gym<00:00:12.990> before<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.130> have<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.580> worry

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
spend in the gym before I have to worry

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.120 
spend in the gym before I have to worry
about<00:00:15.030> cortisol<00:00:15.750> being<00:00:16.020> released<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.619> making

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
about cortisol being released and making

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.820 
about cortisol being released and making
my<00:00:17.250> muscles<00:00:17.640> smaller<00:00:18.260> well<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.320> think<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.680> is

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
my muscles smaller well I think this is

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.439 
my muscles smaller well I think this is
one<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:19.980> those<00:00:20.130> things<00:00:20.369> that's<00:00:20.609> blown<00:00:21.119> way<00:00:21.420> out

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
one of those things that's blown way out

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.300 
one of those things that's blown way out
of<00:00:21.600> proportion<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.439> when<00:00:22.980> they<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.189> nothing

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
of proportion and when they have nothing

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.640 
of proportion and when they have nothing
to<00:00:23.519> write<00:00:23.730> about<00:00:23.789> muscle<00:00:24.510> magazines<00:00:24.990> they<00:00:25.439> put

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
to write about muscle magazines they put

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.980 
to write about muscle magazines they put
in<00:00:25.769> junk<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.539> you<00:00:27.539> got<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.779> remember

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
in junk like this you got to remember

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.330 
in junk like this you got to remember
your<00:00:28.680> muscles<00:00:29.250> need<00:00:30.090> stress<00:00:30.800> that's<00:00:31.800> why<00:00:32.130> they

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
your muscles need stress that's why they

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.940 
your muscles need stress that's why they
grow<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.200> if<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.260> think<00:00:34.320> about<00:00:34.680> all<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> time

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
grow and if you think about all the time

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.760 
grow and if you think about all the time
you<00:00:35.250> spend<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.670> gym<00:00:36.079> with<00:00:37.079> your<00:00:37.290> muscles

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you spend in the gym with your muscles

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.030 
you spend in the gym with your muscles
under<00:00:38.280> stress<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:40.020> not<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.200> long<00:00:40.649> I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
under stress it's really not that long I

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.270 
under stress it's really not that long I
mean<00:00:41.730> maybe<00:00:42.390> during<00:00:42.719> an<00:00:42.899> hour<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.649> working<00:00:44.100> out

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
mean maybe during an hour of working out

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.190 
mean maybe during an hour of working out
if<00:00:44.579> you're<00:00:44.760> serious<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.780> might<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
if you're serious you might have the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.069 
if you're serious you might have the
weight<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.800> your<00:00:46.860> hands<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.969> you're<00:00:48.870> lifting

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
weight in your hands that you're lifting

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.750 
weight in your hands that you're lifting
it<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:50.100> intensity<00:00:50.870> for<00:00:51.870> maybe<00:00:52.079> 10<00:00:53.070> or<00:00:53.100> 15

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it with intensity for maybe 10 or 15

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.779 
it with intensity for maybe 10 or 15
minutes<00:00:53.870> maybe<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.620> only<00:00:55.860> one<00:00:56.219> third<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
minutes maybe so only one third of the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.549 
minutes maybe so only one third of the
time<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.539> you're<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> gym<00:00:58.199> you're

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
time that you're in the gym you're

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.619 
time that you're in the gym you're
actually<00:00:58.770> lifting<00:00:59.430> because<00:01:00.149> remember<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
actually lifting because remember you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.840 
actually lifting because remember you
pick<00:01:00.809> up<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.020> weight<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.350> lift<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.890> 10<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
pick up a weight you lift it for 10 to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.479 
pick up a weight you lift it for 10 to
15<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.420> 20<00:01:03.719> seconds<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.010> rest<00:01:05.220> two

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
15 to 20 seconds and then you rest two

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.570 
15 to 20 seconds and then you rest two
or<00:01:05.610> three<00:01:05.820> minutes<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.960> that's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:08.070> pretty<00:01:08.369> good

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
or three minutes so that's a pretty good

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.950 
or three minutes so that's a pretty good
ratio<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.240> stress<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.170> rest<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.600> this

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
ratio of stress to rest so I think this

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.010 
ratio of stress to rest so I think this
is<00:01:13.020> blown<00:01:13.740> way<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.430> proportion<00:01:14.630> if<00:01:15.630> your

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
is blown way out of proportion if your

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.859 
is blown way out of proportion if your
workout<00:01:16.560> requires<00:01:17.310> an<00:01:17.610> hour<00:01:17.759> an<00:01:18.180> hour<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.450> 15

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
workout requires an hour an hour and 15

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.719 
workout requires an hour an hour and 15
minutes<00:01:19.049> or<00:01:19.380> an<00:01:19.470> hour<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.740> half<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
minutes or an hour and a half for you to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.490 
minutes or an hour and a half for you to
get<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.360> train<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:21.900> intensity

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
get it in and train with intensity

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.850 
get it in and train with intensity
that's<00:01:23.220> what<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.729> because<00:01:24.659> remember<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
that's what you do because remember the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.490 
that's what you do because remember the
longer<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.310> wait<00:01:26.430> between<00:01:27.000> sets<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.290> more

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
longer you wait between sets the more

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.039 
longer you wait between sets the more
creatine<00:01:29.070> phosphate<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.909> ATP<00:01:30.180> are<00:01:30.509> recreated

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
creatine phosphate and ATP are recreated

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.499 
creatine phosphate and ATP are recreated
in<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> muscle<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.700> again<00:01:33.000> when<00:01:33.150> guys<00:01:33.329> are

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
in the muscle so again when guys are

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.640 
in the muscle so again when guys are
talking<00:01:33.750> about<00:01:33.840> man<00:01:34.110> i<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.530> through

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
talking about man i get to get through

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.499 
talking about man i get to get through
this<00:01:34.740> workout<00:01:35.159> i<00:01:35.400> got<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> speed<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.329> I'm

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
this workout i got to speed it up I'm

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.480 
this workout i got to speed it up I'm
losing<00:01:36.750> my<00:01:36.869> pump<00:01:37.140> hey<00:01:37.799> that's<00:01:37.979> preventing

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
losing my pump hey that's preventing

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.780 
losing my pump hey that's preventing
them<00:01:38.640> from<00:01:38.670> training<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:40.079> their<00:01:40.229> maximum<00:01:40.790> so

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
them from training to their maximum so

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.160 
them from training to their maximum so

makes a huge difference with regards to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.789 
makes a huge difference with regards to
cortisol<00:01:56.670> again<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.259> blown<00:01:58.530> way

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
cortisol again I think it's blown way

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.980 
cortisol again I think it's blown way
out<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.950> proportion<00:01:59.009> as<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.909> pertains<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.800 
out of proportion as it pertains to
weightlifting<00:02:01.520> because<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.700> stress<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.360> just

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
weightlifting because the stress is just

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.620 
weightlifting because the stress is just
not<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.229> long<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.700> present<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.299> long

I<00:02:44.629> think<00:02:44.989> it's<00:02:45.110> way<00:02:45.260> overrated<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:46.069> I<00:02:46.400> want<00:02:46.579> to

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
I think it's way overrated and I want to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.030 
I think it's way overrated and I want to
tell<00:02:46.849> anybody<00:02:47.120> or<00:02:47.540> scare<00:02:47.840> anybody<00:02:48.110> into

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
tell anybody or scare anybody into

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.530 
tell anybody or scare anybody into
having<00:02:49.340> them<00:02:49.489> do<00:02:49.670> something<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.180> prevents

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
having them do something that prevents

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.839 
having them do something that prevents
them<00:02:50.750> from<00:02:50.780> training<00:02:51.290> hard<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.920> majority<00:02:52.670> of

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
them from training hard a majority of

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.280 
them from training hard a majority of
people<00:02:53.090> don't<00:02:53.239> train<00:02:53.450> hard<00:02:53.750> enough<00:02:53.989> as<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.140> is

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
people don't train hard enough as it is

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.710
