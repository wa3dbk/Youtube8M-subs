00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
seven inch touch screen display so it's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.969 
seven inch touch screen display so it's
completely<00:01:07.979> interactive<00:01:08.750> also<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.740> back

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
completely interactive also at the back

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.780 
completely interactive also at the back
is<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:12.210> cable<00:01:12.900> connection<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.610> what

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
is the cable connection and this is what

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.760 
is the cable connection and this is what
I<00:01:14.820> showed<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.299> earlier<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.320> cable

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I showed you earlier this is the cable

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.920 
I showed you earlier this is the cable
connection<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.369> will<00:01:17.549> go<00:01:17.759> from<00:01:18.450> this

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
connection that will go from this

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.789 
connection that will go from this
external<00:01:19.470> unit<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.600> controller<00:01:22.470> board

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
external unit to the controller board

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.580 
external unit to the controller board
which<00:01:23.340> gets<00:01:23.970> installed<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> expansion

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
which gets installed in the expansion

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.300 
which gets installed in the expansion
slot<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.759> back<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:28.020> case<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
slot at the back of the case and this

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.450 
slot at the back of the case and this
external<00:01:29.790> display<00:01:30.420> has<00:01:30.930> rubber<00:01:31.770> feet<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
external display has rubber feet on the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.789 
external display has rubber feet on the
bottom<00:01:32.970> now<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.600> fan<00:01:33.869> controller<00:01:34.380> really

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
bottom now this fan controller really

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.550 
bottom now this fan controller really
has<00:01:35.189> some<00:01:35.430> nice<00:01:35.700> specs<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:37.079> adjust<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
has some nice specs you can adjust the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.920 
has some nice specs you can adjust the
fan<00:01:37.890> voltage<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.520> thus<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.939> fan<00:01:39.240> speed<00:01:39.659> from

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
fan voltage and thus the fan speed from

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.560 
fan voltage and thus the fan speed from
3.7<00:01:40.710> volts<00:01:40.740> all<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.520> way<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.759> 12<00:01:42.030> volts<00:01:42.420> you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
3.7 volts all the way to 12 volts you

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.240 
3.7 volts all the way to 12 volts you
can<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> maximum<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.710> five<00:01:43.920> fans

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
can have a maximum of five fans

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370 
can have a maximum of five fans
installed<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.450> maximum<00:01:45.810> watts<00:01:46.229> per

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
installed but the maximum watts per

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.460 
installed but the maximum watts per
channel<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.920> Tim<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.479> up<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.899> five

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470

or your desk or really anywhere that you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.380 
or your desk or really anywhere that you
want<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:08.099> external<00:02:08.729> display<00:02:08.970> gets

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
want it and the external display gets

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.930 
want it and the external display gets
connected<00:02:09.899> into<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.430> controller<00:02:11.430> board<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
connected into the controller board and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.190 
connected into the controller board and
then<00:02:12.450> everything<00:02:12.930> else

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
then everything else

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.960 
then everything else
gets<00:02:13.319> connected<00:02:13.770> into<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.670> for

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
gets connected into that like for

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.199 
gets connected into that like for
example<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.870> fans<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.650> well<00:02:17.250> as<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.670> thermal

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
example the fans as well as the thermal

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.570 
example the fans as well as the thermal
probes<00:02:18.599> which<00:02:19.200> get<00:02:19.379> connected<00:02:19.620> onto<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
probes which get connected onto the

again this is a five point two seven
inch<00:02:34.860> touchscreen<00:02:35.370> display<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.410> not

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
inch touchscreen display so this is not

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.070 
inch touchscreen display so this is not
controlled<00:02:38.099> by<00:02:38.280> software<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:39.299> rather<00:02:39.540> by

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
controlled by software but rather by

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.770 
controlled by software but rather by
touch<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.650> it's<00:02:41.069> very<00:02:41.459> interactive<00:02:41.849> as<00:02:42.569> you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
touch and it's very interactive as you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.809 
touch and it's very interactive as you
can<00:02:42.930> see<00:02:43.110> there's<00:02:43.530> lots<00:02:43.799> of<00:02:44.040> information<00:02:44.190> in

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
can see there's lots of information in

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.210 
can see there's lots of information in
this<00:02:45.180> screen<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:46.019> for<00:02:46.319> example<00:02:46.410> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
this screen like for example the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.319 
this screen like for example the

temperature of each thermal probe and I

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.819 
temperature of each thermal probe and I
do<00:02:51.390> not<00:02:51.720> have<00:02:51.959> these<00:02:52.079> attached<00:02:52.440> right<00:02:52.650> now<00:02:52.769> to

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
do not have these attached right now to

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.589 
do not have these attached right now to
any<00:02:53.069> hardware<00:02:53.430> components<00:02:54.060> because<00:02:54.269> it's<00:02:54.450> on

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
any hardware components because it's on

the video review table but if you did
you'd<00:02:56.970> see<00:02:57.329> you<00:02:57.750> know<00:02:57.870> different

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
you'd see you know different

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.809 
you'd see you know different
temperatures<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.739> temperature<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.489> the
