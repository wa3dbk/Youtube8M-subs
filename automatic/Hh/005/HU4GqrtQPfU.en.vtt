like<00:01:39.780> three<00:01:40.409> more<00:01:42.590> thresholds<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.880> think<00:01:47.880> I

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
like three more thresholds so I think I

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.710 
like three more thresholds so I think I
can<00:01:48.359> get<00:01:49.049> away<00:01:49.079> with<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:50.299> so

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
don't so I'm going to probably put a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.250 
don't so I'm going to probably put a
design<00:03:15.940> somewhere<00:03:16.630> in<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.780> middle<00:03:17.019> of<00:03:17.110> that

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
design somewhere in the middle of that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.259 
design somewhere in the middle of that
or<00:03:17.830> on<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.160> sides<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.730> then<00:03:18.820> stick<00:03:19.030> those<00:03:19.180> in

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
or on the sides and then stick those in

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.699 
or on the sides and then stick those in
the<00:03:19.330> middle<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:19.750> I'll<00:03:19.840> have<00:03:19.989> some<00:03:20.260> tile<00:03:20.500> in

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
them in here I haven't made my mind up

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.810 
them in here I haven't made my mind up
yet<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:26.110> just<00:03:26.290> stick<00:03:26.650> some<00:03:26.920> gray<00:03:27.250> tile<00:03:27.519> in

landing I'll show you how to build those

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.810 
landing I'll show you how to build those
but<00:03:38.230> knowing<00:03:38.739> all<00:03:38.860> this<00:03:39.100> looks<00:03:39.310> really<00:03:39.549> good

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
but knowing all this looks really good

and this thing is really classy it's
actually<00:03:42.489> turned<00:03:42.670> out<00:03:42.820> better<00:03:43.030> than<00:03:43.180> I

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
actually turned out better than I

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.199 
actually turned out better than I
thought<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:45.250> floor<00:03:45.489> system<00:03:45.910> would<00:03:46.030> be<00:03:46.120> the

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
thought the floor system would be the

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.820 
thought the floor system would be the
same<00:03:46.480> I'm<00:03:47.110> gonna<00:03:47.830> hope<00:03:48.070> that<00:03:48.220> I<00:03:48.310> have<00:03:48.519> enough

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830

hoping I do if not then I'll think of

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.730 
hoping I do if not then I'll think of
something<00:04:02.050> to<00:04:02.110> hide<00:04:02.260> them

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
just like the fact I can make tons of

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.030 
just like the fact I can make tons of
these<00:04:13.390> windows<00:04:13.750> now<00:04:13.960> I<00:04:14.260> didn't<00:04:14.710> have<00:04:14.830> enough

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
these windows now I didn't have enough

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.340 
these windows now I didn't have enough
these<00:04:15.190> white<00:04:15.690> jumper<00:04:16.690> plates<00:04:16.930> so<00:04:17.109> I<00:04:17.140> start

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
these white jumper plates so I start

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.870 
these white jumper plates so I start
using<00:04:17.470> tan<00:04:17.799> appearance<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.430> looks<00:04:18.579> okay

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
using tan appearance so it looks okay

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.660 
using tan appearance so it looks okay
I'm<00:04:19.150> not<00:04:19.299> kind<00:04:19.480> of<00:04:19.570> complaining<00:04:19.930> about<00:04:20.019> it<00:04:23.670> so

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670
