that<00:02:53.600> off<00:02:53.750> you're<00:02:54.590> gonna<00:02:54.680> want<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:54.950> remove<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
that off you're gonna want to remove the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.100 
that off you're gonna want to remove the
SATA<00:02:56.799> SATA<00:02:57.799> on<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.250> power<00:02:58.459> pop<00:02:59.420> those<00:02:59.630> off<00:02:59.750> and

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
SATA SATA on the power pop those off and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.870 
SATA SATA on the power pop those off and
then<00:03:00.519> this<00:03:01.519> screw<00:03:01.790> right<00:03:01.970> here<00:03:03.640> let's<00:03:04.640> screw

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
then this screw right here let's screw

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.069 
then this screw right here let's screw
right<00:03:05.060> there<00:03:05.350> -<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:08.000> one<00:03:08.239> right<00:03:08.420> here

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
right there - this one right here

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:18.069 
right there - this one right here
three<00:03:10.120> one<00:03:11.120> four<00:03:14.170> those<00:03:15.170> screws<00:03:16.570> or<00:03:17.570> these

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
three one four those screws or these

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.550 
three one four those screws or these
ones<00:03:18.410> that<00:03:18.739> were<00:03:19.070> in<00:03:19.130> there<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:21.320> first

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
ones that were in there and the first

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.770 
ones that were in there and the first
ones<00:03:21.829> I<00:03:22.010> didn't<00:03:22.250> show<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.459> but<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:23.209> don't<00:03:23.660> think

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
ones I didn't show you but I don't think

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.250 
ones I didn't show you but I don't think
it<00:03:23.989> really<00:03:24.079> matters<00:03:25.510> so<00:03:26.510> once<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:26.840> pull<00:03:27.079> those

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
it really matters so once you pull those

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.300 
it really matters so once you pull those
out<00:03:27.640> this<00:03:28.640> thing<00:03:29.470> easily<00:03:30.470> slides<00:03:31.070> out<00:03:31.280> from

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
out this thing easily slides out from

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.120 
out this thing easily slides out from
the<00:03:31.640> inside<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:32.720> inside<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.650> know<00:03:33.769> there

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
the inside it's inside you know there

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.770 
the inside it's inside you know there
that<00:03:34.610> was<00:03:34.820> supposed<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.060> go<00:03:35.209> that<00:03:35.360> way<00:03:35.420> and

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
that was supposed to go that way and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.759 
that was supposed to go that way and
then<00:03:35.959> you<00:03:36.049> pull<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.320> out<00:03:36.530> okay

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.210 

so<00:03:44.599> you<00:03:45.599> can<00:03:45.780> as<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.080> can<00:03:46.230> see<00:03:46.409> the<00:03:46.620> SST<00:03:47.190> is

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
so you can as you can see the SST is

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.899 
so you can as you can see the SST is
already<00:03:47.670> installed<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.239> already<00:03:48.720> installed<00:03:49.500> it

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
already installed I already installed it

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:55.630 
already installed I already installed it
but<00:03:50.909> this<00:03:51.269> hard<00:03:51.989> drive<00:03:52.230> was<00:03:52.530> inside<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:53.750> and

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
but this hard drive was inside there and

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.640 
but this hard drive was inside there and
the<00:03:56.640> SATA<00:03:56.940> connectors<00:03:57.840> there<00:03:59.299> has<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.329> little

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
the SATA connectors there has a little

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.229 
the SATA connectors there has a little
sticker<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:02.040> keep<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.400> in<00:04:02.489> place<00:04:02.700> keep<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.150> from

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
sticker to keep it in place keep it from

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.930 
sticker to keep it in place keep it from
wiggling<00:04:06.470> you<00:04:07.470> just<00:04:07.680> peel<00:04:07.890> them<00:04:08.069> back<00:04:08.340> you

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
wiggling you just peel them back you

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.880 
wiggling you just peel them back you
basically<00:04:09.329> just<00:04:09.480> pull<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:09.810> out<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.560> this

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
basically just pull that out this this

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.460 
basically just pull that out this this
thing<00:04:11.129> pulls<00:04:11.430> out<00:04:11.670> its<00:04:11.879> its<00:04:12.090> own<00:04:12.209> little<00:04:12.540> piece

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:23.210 

the<00:04:16.470> hard<00:04:16.650> drive<00:04:16.889> was<00:04:17.190> easily<00:04:20.389> removable<00:04:22.220> two

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
the hard drive was easily removable two

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.860 
the hard drive was easily removable two
screws<00:04:23.520> on<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.760> side<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.300> can<00:04:24.419> see<00:04:24.630> where<00:04:24.780> the

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
screws on the side you can see where the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.659 
screws on the side you can see where the
black<00:04:25.199> grommets<00:04:25.650> are<00:04:25.800> where<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.130> screws<00:04:26.430> line

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
black grommets are where the screws line

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.939 
black grommets are where the screws line
up<00:04:26.880> when<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.120> drops<00:04:27.389> all<00:04:27.600> the<00:04:27.690> way<00:04:27.810> in<00:04:28.020> it's<00:04:28.860> the

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
up when it drops all the way in it's the

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.450 
up when it drops all the way in it's the
same<00:04:29.160> for<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.460> other<00:04:29.580> side

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
same for the other side

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.870 
same for the other side
okay<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:34.410> nice<00:04:34.560> thing<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:35.010> don't<00:04:35.220> need<00:04:35.520> a

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
okay the nice thing is you don't need a

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.900 
okay the nice thing is you don't need a
separate<00:04:36.449> bracket<00:04:36.960> for<00:04:37.260> an<00:04:37.380> SSD<00:04:38.930> this<00:04:39.930> SSD

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
separate bracket for an SSD this SSD

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.560 
separate bracket for an SSD this SSD
already<00:04:41.910> had<00:04:42.800> I'm<00:04:43.800> sorry<00:04:44.100> -<00:04:44.280> yeah<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:45.300> caddy

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
already had I'm sorry - yeah the caddy

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
and the hard drive caddy already had

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.680 
and the hard drive caddy already had
screws<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:49.830> holes<00:04:50.240> holes<00:04:51.240> already<00:04:51.570> drilled

out<00:04:52.050> for<00:04:52.349> the<00:04:52.500> SSD<00:04:53.840> so<00:04:54.840> easily<00:04:55.080> just<00:04:55.229> screwed

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
out for the SSD so easily just screwed

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.000 
out for the SSD so easily just screwed
in<00:04:55.680> there

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
in there

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.040 
in there
the<00:04:56.729> SATA<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.330> power<00:04:57.510> just<00:04:57.840> plugged

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
the SATA and the power just plugged

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:05.480 
the SATA and the power just plugged
right<00:04:58.289> in<00:05:00.979> now<00:05:01.979> you<00:05:02.039> can<00:05:03.139> go<00:05:04.139> ahead<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.370> put<00:05:05.370> it

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
right in now you can go ahead and put it

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:15.770 
right in now you can go ahead and put it
back<00:05:05.610> in<00:05:07.880> so<00:05:08.880> this<00:05:09.060> can<00:05:09.300> slide<00:05:09.810> back<00:05:10.199> in<00:05:14.780> like

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
back in so this can slide back in like

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.589 
back in so this can slide back in like
that<00:05:18.199> and<00:05:19.199> these<00:05:20.190> are<00:05:20.370> perfectly<00:05:20.789> lined<00:05:21.030> up<00:05:21.330> to

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
that and these are perfectly lined up to

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.230 
that and these are perfectly lined up to
go<00:05:21.960> back<00:05:22.169> in<00:05:22.380> I'm<00:05:23.160> gonna<00:05:23.310> screw<00:05:23.639> these<00:05:23.880> four

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
go back in I'm gonna screw these four

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.490 
go back in I'm gonna screw these four
back<00:05:24.510> in<00:05:25.910> put<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.030> case<00:05:27.210> back<00:05:27.690> on<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.349> back

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
back in put the case back on the back

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.230 
back in put the case back on the back
plate<00:05:28.949> back<00:05:29.760> on<00:05:29.970> and<00:05:31.130> then<00:05:32.130> this<00:05:32.370> remember<00:05:33.150> you

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
plate back on and then this remember you

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.670 
plate back on and then this remember you
have<00:05:33.419> to<00:05:33.570> remove<00:05:33.870> this<00:05:36.260> otherwise<00:05:37.260> the<00:05:37.530> back

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
have to remove this otherwise the back

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.170 
have to remove this otherwise the back
plate<00:05:38.010> will<00:05:38.220> not<00:05:38.370> come<00:05:38.610> off

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
plate will not come off

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.219 
plate will not come off
because<00:05:40.490> they<00:05:41.490> kind<00:05:41.669> of<00:05:41.789> hold<00:05:41.970> it<00:05:42.180> in<00:05:42.330> so<00:05:42.630> you

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
because they kind of hold it in so you

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.200 
because they kind of hold it in so you
might<00:05:43.410> break<00:05:43.979> something<00:05:44.039> if<00:05:44.490> you<00:05:44.639> pry<00:05:45.150> too

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
might break something if you pry too

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.420 
might break something if you pry too
hard<00:05:45.630> just<00:05:46.289> never<00:05:46.500> pry<00:05:46.800> too<00:05:46.860> hard<00:05:47.190> if<00:05:47.310> you're

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
hard just never pry too hard if you're

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.430 
hard just never pry too hard if you're
having<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.789> do<00:05:47.910> something<00:05:48.270> too<00:05:48.449> hard<00:05:48.719> you

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
having to do something too hard you
