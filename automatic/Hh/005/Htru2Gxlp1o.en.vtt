00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.420
 they get to the press conference after the DS game of the Augsburger Panther 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.209
 against the Hannover Scorpions 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.350
 Final score 5 to 3 for the Augsburger Panther with me 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.350
 the two coaches for Hannover 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.480
 is being covered with the game 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.159
 because 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.499
 difficult games today for us the North Pole 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.349
 according to Spohr Motorsport percent 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.040
 very well fought only 60 minutes 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.150
 our team has to 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
 Fact is we have to give everything visited cars 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.140
 He was not enough there 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.840
 AC fault 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.840
 against Troicki Kunz 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.620
 Zorc punished 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.620
 and otherwise it's something to worry about 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.670
 finally, join us 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.579
 Elemica Voss 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.080
 He enters after the game against referees 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.080
 Michael in Brussels 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.080
 just wanted to decide 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.840
 it sounds like the country estimates 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.540
 to play the scepter 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.540
 The zookeeper looks after the points all round 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.710
 knew it would be a tough game 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.730
 Percent of the league's best defensive team 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.500
 and Svenja Lechner 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.690
 popular people 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.870
 Percent I think finally have the honor 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.750
 Patience shown over 60 minutes 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.980
 Names also have 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.230
 Minute to the GDR 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.740
 Goals shot poste 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.210
 with us as often as the session 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.170
 Gescher Uh dapd 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.170
 and percent of the forest blessed crucially 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.760
 Bouwman have the three points 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.410
 we knew magic shows 4 3 was 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.170
 hears the Hanoverians 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.020
 many many games this season 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.020
 have won in the last tenant again or out of the opponents 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.630
 kanders 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.740
 it turns us on it happened against the Hannoveraner 2 was 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.309
 that's why more 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:09.919
 I tried 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.999
 play the bell as often as possible over the walking one 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.569
 after that Madrid are not binding nature 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.229
 the three points 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.019
 he describes vividly 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.979
 McLaren is dead 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.979
 There are questions from colleagues in the press 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.639
 Notes Tel 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.739
 Question if there is still something to decide decided to say 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.519
 the boards mostly on over the elements 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.229
 It's all very difficult about the referees 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:00.349
 almost in every game 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.799
 to recognize 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.679
 He is himself led on the sidelines 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:08.609
 will or not sa 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.589
 on both sides so that's yes 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.599
 sometimes 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:15.839
 which mostly 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.779
 that is not recognizable 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.839
 TUI the most about the offside decision 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:24.149
 even before that the only decision 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:26.289
 then that comes to it 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.289
 Cock we have not had a game I think the last 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.049
 determines 15 games 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.049
 where a Lenin laid 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.649
 ZweibrÃ¼cken guided had the mouth picture form 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.299
 at random 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.489
 now the 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.309
 Places five and six games 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.769
 Referees do not have to sleep punts marked tenths of a second 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.199
 has seen 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.199
 too much 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.139
 the two hits 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.979
 but I'm not afraid untapped so this euro has changed completely 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:06.569
 correctly 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.569
 Microsoft's new 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.340
 Herrischried most important policies 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.879
 Colin Davis hurt 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.449
 His first line is not that bad 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.680
 Cowens thought he did 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.659
 Last shoulder on a shoulder injury 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.009
 on Tuesday in Duisburg where he has so far 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.819
 maybe 4 to 8 percent 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.110
 immediately locked are a feeling as if you 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.110
 We assumed that he will not play this season 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.450
 since Kosovo told me today that percent is not that bad 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.020
 alone strong bleeding in plus 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.020
 and his pod 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.349
 to tear up the next days Carinthia 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.199
 more important is 40 40 but next week Friday 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.409
 plays or not Roche was still there 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.300
 at least until after the break 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.319
 injured 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.199
 I think so too 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.199
 Steege RBB has said 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
 Protection spent the cuts 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:42.249
 the question remains 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.400
 the flagship argues 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.810
 then thank the two coaches and Singapore 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.949
 a good way home 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.729
 how are you then 38 against the Iserlohn Roosters next Sunday? 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:55.699
 Fegan and solutions
