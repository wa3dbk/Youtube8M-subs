00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
story scary it just adds cheesiness to a

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.820 
story scary it just adds cheesiness to a
story<00:06:24.240> and<00:06:24.450> ain't<00:06:24.840> cheesiness<00:06:25.260> to<00:06:25.500> a<00:06:25.530> story

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
story and ain't cheesiness to a story

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.120 
story and ain't cheesiness to a story
just<00:06:26.070> makes<00:06:26.250> a<00:06:26.310> story<00:06:26.490> worse<00:06:26.910> I<00:06:27.300> mean<00:06:28.050> with<00:06:28.920> all

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
just makes a story worse I mean with all

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.740 
just makes a story worse I mean with all
this<00:06:29.370> blood<00:06:29.760> that<00:06:29.790> was<00:06:30.030> added<00:06:30.330> towards<00:06:30.630> the

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
this blood that was added towards the

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.270 
this blood that was added towards the
end<00:06:30.900> it<00:06:31.080> makes<00:06:31.320> me<00:06:31.500> wonder<00:06:31.770> what<00:06:32.040> the<00:06:32.160> whole

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
end it makes me wonder what the whole

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.860 
end it makes me wonder what the whole
point<00:06:32.460> of<00:06:32.550> having<00:06:32.670> good<00:06:32.940> beginning<00:06:33.270> was<00:06:33.540> for

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
point of having good beginning was for

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.720 
point of having good beginning was for
because<00:06:34.650> half<00:06:34.830> if<00:06:34.950> having<00:06:35.250> a<00:06:35.310> good<00:06:35.460> beginning

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.730 
because half if having a good beginning

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.150 
because half if having a good beginning
it<00:06:35.940> builds<00:06:36.300> pipe<00:06:36.780> and<00:06:37.110> then<00:06:37.620> when<00:06:37.740> you<00:06:37.830> destroy

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
it builds pipe and then when you destroy

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.710 
it builds pipe and then when you destroy
a<00:06:38.190> lot<00:06:38.400> height<00:06:38.580> with<00:06:38.760> just<00:06:38.940> random<00:06:39.360> amounts<00:06:39.630> of

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
a lot height with just random amounts of
