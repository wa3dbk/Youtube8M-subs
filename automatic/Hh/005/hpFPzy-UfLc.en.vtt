00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
it would be you know we have the same

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.429 
it would be you know we have the same
wheels<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.450> our<00:01:30.630> competitors<00:01:30.899> we<00:01:31.229> had<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
wheels as our competitors we had the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.990 
wheels as our competitors we had the
same<00:01:31.649> frame<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:31.979> our<00:01:32.219> competitors<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.759> had<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
same frame as our competitors we had the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.520 
same frame as our competitors we had the
same<00:01:33.240> high-low<00:01:33.689> system<00:01:33.869> as<00:01:34.170> our<00:01:34.289> competitors

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
same high-low system as our competitors

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.410 
same high-low system as our competitors
everything<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.490> virtually<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> same<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.329> we

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
everything was virtually the same so we

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.999 
everything was virtually the same so we
wanted<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.810> an<00:01:36.929> answer<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.679> started

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
wanted to have an answer we started

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.230 
wanted to have an answer we started
messing<00:01:38.189> around<00:01:38.399> with<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> bunch<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:38.969> different

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
messing around with a bunch of different

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.389 
messing around with a bunch of different
things<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.570> actually<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:40.979> tested<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
things and actually I you know tested a

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:42.950 
things and actually I you know tested a
bunch<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.670> things<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.179> had<00:01:42.299> three<00:01:42.539> 100

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
bunch of things on that we had three 100

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.789 
bunch of things on that we had three 100
millimeter<00:01:43.320> wheels

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
millimeter wheels

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.679 
millimeter wheels
we<00:01:44.219> had<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> big<00:01:44.579> 90<00:01:44.850> millimeter<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> back

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
we had a big 90 millimeter on the back

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.969 
we had a big 90 millimeter on the back
none<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.990> these<00:01:46.079> things<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.560> kind<00:01:46.859> of

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
none of these things really kind of

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.919 
none of these things really kind of
worked<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.369> us<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:47.609> that<00:01:47.789> well<00:01:47.999> until<00:01:48.719> we

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
worked for us all that well until we

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:50.539 
worked for us all that well until we
kind<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.170> stumbled<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.039> frame<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
kind of stumbled on on this frame and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.459 
kind of stumbled on on this frame and
what<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.179> really<00:01:51.570> enjoy<00:01:51.899> about<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.439> I

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
what we really enjoy about this and I

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
you're gonna get a bigger speed out of a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.599 
you're gonna get a bigger speed out of a
bigger<00:02:01.020> wheel<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.439> mean<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.920> kind<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.280> what

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
bigger wheel I mean that is kind of what

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:03.709 
bigger wheel I mean that is kind of what
you're<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.909> get<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.359> that's<00:02:03.539> a

pads<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.679> floor<00:02:07.859> if<00:02:07.950> you've<00:02:08.069> got<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> an<00:02:08.550> 80

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
pads on the floor if you've got a an 80

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.130 
pads on the floor if you've got a an 80
millimeter<00:02:09.330> wheel<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> front<00:02:09.990> when

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
millimeter wheel on the front when

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.750 
millimeter wheel on the front when
you're<00:02:10.259> starting<00:02:10.649> off<00:02:10.800> say<00:02:11.069> you're<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.730> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you're starting off say you're going to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.790 
you're starting off say you're going to
have<00:02:11.819> more<00:02:12.090> urethane<00:02:12.630> contacting<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.560> floor

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
have more urethane contacting the floor

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470 
have more urethane contacting the floor
which<00:02:14.010> gives<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> bigger<00:02:14.670> area<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.240> push

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
which gives you a bigger area to push

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.199 
which gives you a bigger area to push
off<00:02:15.690> you'll<00:02:16.650> have<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.800> better<00:02:17.040> push<00:02:17.400> now<00:02:17.610> also

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
off you'll have a better push now also

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.819 
off you'll have a better push now also
it's<00:02:18.719> kind<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:19.019> not<00:02:19.200> knowing<00:02:19.379> is<00:02:19.620> when<00:02:19.769> you

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
it's kind of not knowing is when you

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.670 
it's kind of not knowing is when you
have<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.519> much<00:02:20.760> urethane<00:02:21.269> between<00:02:21.659> the<00:02:22.379> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
have this much urethane between the the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.920 
have this much urethane between the the
wheel<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.310> mean<00:02:23.760> between<00:02:23.969> the<00:02:24.239> hub<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
wheel I mean between the hub and the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.569 
wheel I mean between the hub and the
floor<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.560> urethane<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.040> going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.340> bend

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
floor that urethane is going to bend

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.880 
floor that urethane is going to bend
more<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.060> kick<00:02:27.299> back<00:02:27.510> more<00:02:27.840> okay<00:02:28.379> so<00:02:28.709> that's

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
more and kick back more okay so that's

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.380 
more and kick back more okay so that's
going<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.099> give<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> kick<00:02:29.730> off<00:02:29.939> your<00:02:29.969> push

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
going to give you a kick off your push

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.690 
going to give you a kick off your push
more<00:02:30.780> than<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.019> 72<00:02:31.469> minute<00:02:31.739> millimeter<00:02:32.489> will

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
more than a 72 minute millimeter will

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.390 
more than a 72 minute millimeter will
and<00:02:32.969> also<00:02:33.719> on<00:02:33.900> your<00:02:34.019> turning<00:02:34.530> if<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.370> a

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
and also on your turning if you have a

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.699 
and also on your turning if you have a
you<00:02:35.700> know<00:02:35.790> 72<00:02:36.269> or<00:02:36.299> 76<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.049> even<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.439> front

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
you know 72 or 76 is even on the front

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.649 
you know 72 or 76 is even on the front
the<00:02:38.189> 80s<00:02:38.609> are<00:02:38.700> going<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:38.879> have<00:02:39.000> more<00:02:39.180> urethane

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
the 80s are going to have more urethane

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.750 
the 80s are going to have more urethane
to<00:02:39.780> hold<00:02:40.019> on<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.409> that<00:02:40.530> edge<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.099> Bend<00:02:41.430> and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
to hold on to that edge and Bend and

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.879 
to hold on to that edge and Bend and
push<00:02:42.030> off<00:02:42.299> longer<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.260> you're<00:02:43.409> gonna<00:02:43.530> hold

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
push off longer so you're gonna hold

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.890 
push off longer so you're gonna hold
turns<00:02:44.250> longer<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.090> won't<00:02:45.299> slip<00:02:45.569> out<00:02:45.750> of

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
turns longer and you won't slip out of

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.509 
turns longer and you won't slip out of
those<00:02:45.989> turns<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.680> can<00:02:46.799> cut<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.189> a<00:02:47.310> little

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
those turns so you can cut just a little

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.830 
those turns so you can cut just a little
bit<00:02:47.609> harder<00:02:47.879> it<00:02:47.939> really<00:02:48.120> cut<00:02:48.389> a<00:02:48.420> little<00:02:48.719> bit

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
bit harder it really cut a little bit

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.210 
bit harder it really cut a little bit
harder<00:02:49.170> you're<00:02:49.319> gonna<00:02:49.409> hold<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.859> turn<00:02:50.189> a

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
harder you're gonna hold that turn a

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.339 
harder you're gonna hold that turn a
little<00:02:50.400> bit<00:02:50.609> longer<00:02:50.849> so<00:02:51.180> you're<00:02:52.019> going<00:02:52.139> to<00:02:52.200> get

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
little bit longer so you're going to get

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.020 
little bit longer so you're going to get
better<00:02:52.650> grip<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.189> basically<00:02:53.549> you're<00:02:53.970> gonna

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
better grip is basically you're gonna

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.420 
better grip is basically you're gonna
have<00:02:54.209> bigger<00:02:54.419> contact<00:02:55.019> patch<00:02:55.260> bigger<00:02:56.040> grip

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
have bigger contact patch bigger grip

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.030 
have bigger contact patch bigger grip
and<00:02:56.669> of<00:02:56.760> course<00:02:56.939> bigger<00:02:57.209> speed<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.439> kind

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
and of course bigger speed and and kind

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.470 
and of course bigger speed and and kind
of<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.189> last<00:02:59.400> thing<00:02:59.609> if<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.879> could<00:03:00.030> hit<00:03:00.150> up<00:03:00.299> on

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
of the last thing if I could hit up on

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.199 
of the last thing if I could hit up on
there<00:03:00.689> is<00:03:00.930> well<00:03:01.560> all<00:03:02.189> we<00:03:02.430> did<00:03:02.639> on<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:02.909> frame

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
there is well all we did on this frame

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.459 
there is well all we did on this frame
if<00:03:03.329> you<00:03:03.419> had<00:03:03.629> this<00:03:03.810> boot

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
if you had this boot

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.940 
if you had this boot
we<00:03:04.799> took<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.159> 72<00:03:05.700> s<00:03:05.760> off<00:03:06.000> we<00:03:06.689> put<00:03:06.719> a<00:03:07.079> TS<00:03:07.409> on<00:03:07.650> and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
we took the 72 s off we put a TS on and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.699 
we took the 72 s off we put a TS on and
we<00:03:08.400> recessed<00:03:08.909> him<00:03:09.030> in<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.239> outsole<00:03:09.599> so<00:03:09.840> we<00:03:10.530> did

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
we recessed him in the outsole so we did

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.470 
we recessed him in the outsole so we did
not<00:03:10.829> change<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:11.400> pitch<00:03:11.609> of<00:03:11.639> the<00:03:11.879> boot<00:03:12.060> at<00:03:12.269> all

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
not change the pitch of the boot at all

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.809 
not change the pitch of the boot at all
we<00:03:13.349> did<00:03:13.500> not<00:03:13.620> change<00:03:13.919> the<00:03:14.069> distance<00:03:14.549> from<00:03:14.639> the

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
we did not change the distance from the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.050 
we did not change the distance from the
floor<00:03:15.060> at<00:03:15.239> all<00:03:15.299> so<00:03:15.870> you're<00:03:15.989> not<00:03:16.109> feeling<00:03:16.409> like

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
floor at all so you're not feeling like

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.490 
floor at all so you're not feeling like
it's<00:03:18.060> it's<00:03:18.299> gonna<00:03:18.419> have<00:03:18.659> the<00:03:18.780> same<00:03:19.019> feeling<00:03:19.409> as

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
it's it's gonna have the same feeling as

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.080 
it's it's gonna have the same feeling as
you<00:03:19.650> would<00:03:19.769> on<00:03:19.829> another<00:03:20.129> skate<00:03:20.430> exactly<00:03:21.000> it's

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
you would on another skate exactly it's

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.460 
you would on another skate exactly it's
like<00:03:21.120> you're<00:03:21.329> at<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.569> pitch<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.199> boot<00:03:22.319> is

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470

like you're at the pitch of the boot is
the<00:03:22.590> same<00:03:22.799> that's<00:03:22.979> what's<00:03:23.190> going<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.370> give<00:03:23.549> you

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
our boots fit we think a majority of

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.010 
our boots fit we think a majority of
people<00:04:40.060> because<00:04:40.300> they<00:04:40.449> are<00:04:40.569> a<00:04:40.599> little<00:04:40.840> bit<00:04:40.960> of

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
people because they are a little bit of

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.779 
people because they are a little bit of
a<00:04:41.080> wider<00:04:41.259> fit<00:04:41.620> but<00:04:42.190> we<00:04:42.220> think<00:04:42.460> people<00:04:42.580> are

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
a wider fit but we think people are

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.550 
a wider fit but we think people are
wearing<00:04:43.150> more<00:04:43.270> flip-flops<00:04:43.780> more<00:04:44.169> running

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
wearing more flip-flops more running

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.420 
wearing more flip-flops more running
shoes<00:04:44.770> they're<00:04:44.979> not<00:04:45.099> wearing<00:04:45.310> those

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
shoes they're not wearing those

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.400 
shoes they're not wearing those
constrained<00:04:45.970> boots<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.690> you<00:04:46.900> know<00:04:47.020> so<00:04:47.199> you're

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
constrained boots and you know so you're

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.680 
constrained boots and you know so you're
used<00:04:48.009> to<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.250> little<00:04:48.370> bit<00:04:48.550> more<00:04:48.699> comfort<00:04:49.090> okay

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
used to a little bit more comfort okay

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.879 
used to a little bit more comfort okay
and<00:04:49.810> that's<00:04:49.930> why<00:04:50.020> we<00:04:50.139> make<00:04:50.259> them<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.470> little<00:04:50.650> bit

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
and that's why we make them a little bit

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.339 
and that's why we make them a little bit
wider<00:04:51.009> than<00:04:51.340> normal<00:04:51.599> and<00:04:52.599> that's<00:04:52.960> but<00:04:53.259> if

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
wider than normal and that's but if
