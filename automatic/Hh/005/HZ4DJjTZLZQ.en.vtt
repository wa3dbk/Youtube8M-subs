this<00:00:21.710> is<00:00:21.890> one<00:00:22.280> of<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:22.490> pieces<00:00:22.700> of<00:00:22.910> equipment

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
this is one of the pieces of equipment

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.940 
this is one of the pieces of equipment
that<00:00:23.420> we<00:00:23.510> use<00:00:23.540> very<00:00:23.720> commonly<00:00:24.260> here<00:00:24.590> at<00:00:24.770> the

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
that we use very commonly here at the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.850 
that we use very commonly here at the
hospital<00:00:25.490> it's<00:00:26.420> an<00:00:26.690> ultrasound<00:00:27.260> machine<00:00:27.590> and

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
hospital it's an ultrasound machine and

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.950 
hospital it's an ultrasound machine and
we<00:00:28.130> mainly<00:00:28.370> use<00:00:28.520> it<00:00:28.880> to<00:00:29.120> look<00:00:29.210> at<00:00:29.360> soft<00:00:29.600> tissue

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
we mainly use it to look at soft tissue

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.080 
we mainly use it to look at soft tissue
structures<00:00:31.240> it's<00:00:32.830> it's<00:00:33.830> kind<00:00:34.280> of<00:00:34.310> you<00:00:34.520> know<00:00:34.550> we

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
structures it's it's kind of you know we

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.729 
structures it's it's kind of you know we
can<00:00:35.270> use<00:00:35.420> it<00:00:35.570> for<00:00:35.690> either<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:35.989> thorax<00:00:36.500> the

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
can use it for either the thorax the

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.620 
can use it for either the thorax the
abdomen<00:00:37.100> or<00:00:37.400> looking<00:00:37.760> at<00:00:37.880> the<00:00:37.940> limbs<00:00:38.270> and

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
abdomen or looking at the limbs and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.910 
abdomen or looking at the limbs and
longer<00:00:39.020> horse<00:00:40.900> and<00:00:41.900> so<00:00:42.200> in<00:00:42.350> this<00:00:42.440> house<00:00:42.650> we're

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
longer horse and so in this house we're

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.130 
longer horse and so in this house we're
just<00:00:43.130> all<00:00:43.280> sounding<00:00:43.850> their<00:00:44.150> tendon<00:00:44.660> sheath<00:00:44.900> on

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
just all sounding their tendon sheath on

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.229 
just all sounding their tendon sheath on
their<00:00:46.090> hind<00:00:47.090> limb<00:00:48.070> we<00:00:49.070> know<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.580> horse<00:00:49.760> horses

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
their hind limb we know the horse horses

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.730 
their hind limb we know the horse horses
come<00:00:50.420> in<00:00:50.510> with<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.660> lameness<00:00:50.930> we<00:00:51.440> put<00:00:51.650> some

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
come in with a lameness we put some

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.710 
come in with a lameness we put some
local<00:00:52.010> anesthetic<00:00:52.580> into<00:00:52.880> the<00:00:53.240> tendon<00:00:53.570> sheath

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
local anesthetic into the tendon sheath

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.990 
local anesthetic into the tendon sheath
itself<00:00:54.200> and<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:55.100> horse<00:00:55.220> then<00:00:55.430> became<00:00:55.640> sound

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
itself and the horse then became sound

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.430 
itself and the horse then became sound
so<00:00:56.300> we<00:00:56.420> know<00:00:56.630> that<00:00:56.810> the<00:00:56.900> source<00:00:57.110> of<00:00:57.230> lameness

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
so we know that the source of lameness

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.270 
so we know that the source of lameness
is<00:00:57.800> within<00:00:58.040> and<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.510> tendon<00:00:59.510> sheath<00:01:00.100> so<00:01:01.100> the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
is within and the tendon sheath so the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.800 
is within and the tendon sheath so the
ultrasound<00:01:01.730> is<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.970> really<00:01:02.180> nice<00:01:02.329> imaging

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
ultrasound is a really nice imaging

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.190 
ultrasound is a really nice imaging
modality<00:01:03.290> for<00:01:03.320> looking<00:01:04.160> at<00:01:04.369> soft<00:01:04.729> tissue

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.200 
modality for looking at soft tissue

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.230 
modality for looking at soft tissue
injuries<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.800> with<00:01:06.950> ultrasound<00:01:07.400> you<00:01:07.910> can<00:01:08.090> look

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
injuries so with ultrasound you can look

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.840 
injuries so with ultrasound you can look
at<00:01:08.390> soft<00:01:08.600> tissue<00:01:08.950> structures<00:01:09.950> or<00:01:10.190> tendons<00:01:10.670> in

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
at soft tissue structures or tendons in

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.310 
at soft tissue structures or tendons in
particular<00:01:11.360> it's<00:01:11.540> extremely<00:01:12.020> good<00:01:12.170> for

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
particular it's extremely good for

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.070 
particular it's extremely good for
imaging<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.060> what<00:01:14.060> you<00:01:14.180> see<00:01:14.360> when<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.600> tendon

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
imaging and what you see when a tendon

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.320 
imaging and what you see when a tendon
normal<00:01:15.770> tendon<00:01:16.130> should<00:01:16.310> be<00:01:16.430> reasonably<00:01:17.000> white

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
normal tendon should be reasonably white

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.660 
normal tendon should be reasonably white
and<00:01:17.690> appearance<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.440> when<00:01:19.190> there<00:01:19.310> are<00:01:19.399> holes

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
and appearance and when there are holes

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.240 
and appearance and when there are holes
or<00:01:20.000> tears<00:01:20.270> or<00:01:20.630> damage<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:20.990> that<00:01:21.200> tendon<00:01:21.770> you

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
or tears or damage to that tendon you

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.910 
or tears or damage to that tendon you
will<00:01:22.399> see<00:01:22.550> black<00:01:22.850> areas<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:24.500> as<00:01:24.590> we<00:01:24.740> run

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
will see black areas so and as we run

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.040 
will see black areas so and as we run
down<00:01:25.160> this<00:01:25.460> level<00:01:25.940> we<00:01:26.119> can<00:01:26.300> see<00:01:26.539> at<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.869> bottom

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
down this level we can see at the bottom

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.559 
down this level we can see at the bottom
of<00:01:27.319> the<00:01:27.440> screen<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:27.950> there's<00:01:28.759> two<00:01:28.970> white<00:01:29.270> on

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
of the screen and there's two white on

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.480 
of the screen and there's two white on
the<00:01:29.630> sort<00:01:29.960> of<00:01:29.990> v-shaped<00:01:30.619> structures<00:01:31.369> are

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
the sort of v-shaped structures are

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.130 
the sort of v-shaped structures are
guess<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.000> that's<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.390> back<00:01:32.569> of<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.840> fetlock

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
guess so that's the back of the fetlock

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.499 
guess so that's the back of the fetlock
joint<00:01:33.350> itself<00:01:33.880> yeah<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:35.209> Horace

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
joint itself yeah on this Horace

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.240 
joint itself yeah on this Horace
although<00:01:35.780> we're<00:01:35.899> not<00:01:36.050> seeing<00:01:36.229> any<00:01:36.380> damage<00:01:36.860> to

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
although we're not seeing any damage to

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.510 
although we're not seeing any damage to
the<00:01:37.429> actual<00:01:37.729> Tenzin's<00:01:38.360> themselves<00:01:39.369> there<00:01:40.369> is

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
the actual Tenzin's themselves there is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.990 
the actual Tenzin's themselves there is
some<00:01:40.819> thickening<00:01:41.319> off<00:01:42.319> that<00:01:42.709> ligament<00:01:43.069> which

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
some thickening off that ligament which

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.570 
some thickening off that ligament which
may<00:01:44.720> be<00:01:45.050> just<00:01:45.350> secondary<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.190> fact<00:01:46.280> that

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
may be just secondary to the fact that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.980 
may be just secondary to the fact that
he<00:01:46.670> does<00:01:46.940> have<00:01:47.149> some<00:01:47.330> inflammation<00:01:47.600> within

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
he does have some inflammation within

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.420 
he does have some inflammation within
his<00:01:48.259> sheath

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
his sheath

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.850 
his sheath
we<00:01:51.430> just<00:01:51.670> use<00:01:51.850> them<00:01:52.090> for<00:01:52.479> each<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:52.860> individual

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
we just use them for each and individual

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.180 
we just use them for each and individual
part<00:01:54.159> of<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.610> horse's<00:01:55.299> body<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:55.930> we<00:01:56.799> use<00:01:56.979> the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
part of the horse's body and we use the

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.630 
part of the horse's body and we use the
straight<00:01:57.760> probe<00:01:58.119> for<00:01:58.600> tendons<00:01:59.640> which

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
straight probe for tendons which

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.430 
straight probe for tendons which
normally<00:02:01.330> run<00:02:01.509> down<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.869> back<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.350> the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
normally run down the back of the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.830 
normally run down the back of the
horse's<00:02:02.830> leg<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.820> from<00:02:04.060> there<00:02:04.270> we<00:02:04.479> can<00:02:04.509> have<00:02:04.810> a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
horse's leg and from there we can have a

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.510 
horse's leg and from there we can have a
look<00:02:05.049> at<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.259> structure<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.979> tendon<00:02:06.340> and

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
look at the structure of the tendon and

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.580 
look at the structure of the tendon and
to<00:02:07.060> see<00:02:07.210> if<00:02:07.270> there's<00:02:07.420> any<00:02:07.570> damage<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.380> for

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
to see if there's any damage so for

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.790 
to see if there's any damage so for
example<00:02:08.649> here<00:02:09.069> and<00:02:09.489> this<00:02:10.270> is<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:11.530> will<00:02:11.680> be

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
example here and this is this will be

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.330 
example here and this is this will be
the<00:02:11.920> bone<00:02:12.880> here<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.720> then<00:02:14.220> overlying<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
the bone here and then overlying the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.949 
the bone here and then overlying the
bone<00:02:15.610> you've<00:02:15.790> just<00:02:16.000> got<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.300> tendons<00:02:16.750> and

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
bone you've just got the tendons and

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.370 
bone you've just got the tendons and
then<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.410> is<00:02:17.560> skin<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.480> one<00:02:19.720> tendon

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
then this is skin and this is one tendon

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.920 
then this is skin and this is one tendon
structure<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.069> is<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.430> another<00:02:22.239> tendon<00:02:22.750> so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
structure this is the another tendon so

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.020 
structure this is the another tendon so
this<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.200> our<00:02:23.320> top<00:02:23.950> two<00:02:24.370> attendants<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
this is our top two attendants to the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.150 
this is our top two attendants to the
superficial<00:02:25.600> tendon<00:02:26.019> this<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.739> deeper

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
superficial tendon this is a deeper

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.300 
superficial tendon this is a deeper
tendon<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:28.480> can<00:02:28.600> see<00:02:28.780> here<00:02:29.050> we<00:02:29.200> have<00:02:29.440> the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
tendon and you can see here we have the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.090 
tendon and you can see here we have the
left<00:02:30.550> 4<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.209> rightful<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.140> we<00:02:32.830> can<00:02:32.980> make

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
left 4 and the rightful and we can make

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.820 
left 4 and the rightful and we can make
a<00:02:33.130> direct<00:02:33.580> comparison<00:02:34.090> at<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.660> same<00:02:34.870> link<00:02:35.140> to

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
a direct comparison at the same link to

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.270 
a direct comparison at the same link to
compare<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:37.330> for<00:02:37.510> example<00:02:37.600> here<00:02:38.319> this<00:02:38.800> tendon

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
compare so for example here this tendon

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.210 
compare so for example here this tendon
area<00:02:39.819> is<00:02:40.030> larger<00:02:40.840> than<00:02:40.959> this<00:02:41.110> tendon<00:02:41.560> area<00:02:41.860> and

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
area is larger than this tendon area and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.100 
area is larger than this tendon area and
the<00:02:42.670> horse<00:02:42.880> was<00:02:43.060> lame<00:02:43.239> in<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.510> leg<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:43.989> we

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
the horse was lame in this leg so we

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.750 
the horse was lame in this leg so we
could<00:02:44.260> conclude<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:45.040> there<00:02:45.190> was<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.370> strain

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
could conclude that there was a strain

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.390 
could conclude that there was a strain
injury<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.840> tendon<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.620> then<00:02:48.069> we<00:02:48.220> can

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
injury to that tendon and then we can

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.250 
injury to that tendon and then we can
treat<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.819> as<00:02:49.060> necessary<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:49.930> now<00:02:50.050> we<00:02:50.110> are

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
treat it as necessary so now we are

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.259 
treat it as necessary so now we are
scanning<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.830> abdomen<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:51.940> allows<00:02:52.239> us

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
scanning the abdomen and this allows us

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.910 
scanning the abdomen and this allows us
to<00:02:52.569> see<00:02:52.750> kind<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.230> mean<00:02:53.440> whether<00:02:53.769> the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
to see kind of mean whether the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.120 
to see kind of mean whether the
intestines<00:02:54.370> are<00:02:54.750> moving<00:02:55.750> whether<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.920> motor

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
intestines are moving whether the motor

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.069 
intestines are moving whether the motor
or<00:02:57.459> not<00:02:57.579> and<00:02:57.880> there's<00:02:58.120> any<00:02:58.239> free<00:02:58.510> fluid<00:02:58.780> within

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
or not and there's any free fluid within

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.520 
or not and there's any free fluid within
the<00:02:59.290> abdomen<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:01.090> just<00:03:01.269> kind<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.510> helps<00:03:02.290> us

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
the abdomen and it just kind of helps us

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.690 
the abdomen and it just kind of helps us
give<00:03:02.680> us<00:03:02.769> an<00:03:02.860> idea<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.160> what<00:03:03.400> might<00:03:03.579> be

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
give us an idea of what might be

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.009 
give us an idea of what might be
happening<00:03:03.820> inside<00:03:04.269> because<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:04.900> the

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
happening inside because in the

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.780 
happening inside because in the
abdominal<00:03:05.200> discomfort<00:03:05.650> this<00:03:06.400> horse<00:03:06.640> is

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
abdominal discomfort this horse is

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.610 
abdominal discomfort this horse is
currently<00:03:07.090> experiencing

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.680 

whenever<00:03:12.620> we<00:03:12.800> have<00:03:13.010> our<00:03:13.700> abdominal<00:03:14.210> pain

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
whenever we have our abdominal pain

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.560 
whenever we have our abdominal pain
cases<00:03:15.350> that<00:03:15.560> are<00:03:15.710> colic<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.880> just<00:03:17.330> one<00:03:17.420> that

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
cases that are colic and just one that

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.320 
cases that are colic and just one that
we've<00:03:17.690> we've<00:03:18.080> seen<00:03:18.290> earlier<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.580> we<00:03:20.060> can

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
we've we've seen earlier and we can

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.930 
we've we've seen earlier and we can
ultrasound<00:03:21.020> the<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.680> abdomen<00:03:22.040> we<00:03:22.670> can<00:03:22.820> look

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
ultrasound the the abdomen we can look

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.790 
ultrasound the the abdomen we can look
at<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.180> intestines<00:03:23.810> we<00:03:24.080> can<00:03:24.230> see<00:03:24.410> if<00:03:24.620> the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
at the intestines we can see if the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.500 
at the intestines we can see if the
intestines<00:03:25.250> are<00:03:25.400> moving<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.300> are<00:03:26.390> they

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
intestines are moving so are they

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.270 
intestines are moving so are they
contracting<00:03:27.110> normally<00:03:27.500> all<00:03:27.890> right<00:03:28.160> they

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
contracting normally all right they

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.550 
contracting normally all right they
distended<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.210> if<00:03:29.570> they're<00:03:29.810> distended<00:03:30.350> then

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
distended and if they're distended then

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.470 
distended and if they're distended then
that's<00:03:30.800> normally<00:03:31.250> an<00:03:31.580> indication<00:03:32.090> for<00:03:32.420> the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
that's normally an indication for the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.940 
that's normally an indication for the
horse<00:03:32.660> needs<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.080> go<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.260> surgery<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:34.730> have<00:03:34.910> an
