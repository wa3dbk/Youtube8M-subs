00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.330
 in Europe tolerance has limits and 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.139
 after the attack on the editors 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.870
 Charly Ebdo in Paris the European Union embraced 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.359
 anti Icelandic sentiment screaming crowd 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.400
 makes no distinction between moderate and 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.270
 radical muslims for 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.060
 protesters 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.099
 they are all facing one of us 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 the most famous synagogues of Germany 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.730
 she is guarded by the police who can be here 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.130
 see around the clock 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.410
 however, other denominations have such luxury 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.870
 unavailable unfortunately on mosques 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.480
 Muslims are attacking more and more now almost 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.879
 draws graffiti every week 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.840
 swastika write Russian slogan and 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.430
 and even throw a molotov cocktail 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.379
 the situation is so tense that women 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.719
 wearing hijabs instead of public 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.879
 Transport advised to use 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.309
 cars in mosques that have become 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.019
 the main target of detractors are people 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.659
 now we are especially vigilant 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.450
 because earlier 2011 is the twelfth year 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.299
 our mosque has attacked as many as four 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.420
 times in sweden where the situation was and without 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:21.689
 addition tense new year 2015 has begun 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.820
 from the next arson of a mosque in France 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.710
 Muslim community leaders say that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.689
 over the past two months an attack on 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.560
 Muslims were more than the whole 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.990
 last year 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.850
 cruelty attack in europe 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.250
 different but the cause of hate 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.409
 everywhere alone many in germany do not consider 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.829
 Turkish Arabs or other Muslims part 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.110
 this country will be released for xenophobia 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.950
 created ideal conditions and policies 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.030
 know about this xenophobia and racism and 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.649
 there is no place for extremism in this country 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.299
 the finished question is how power 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.969
 going to fight it 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.969
