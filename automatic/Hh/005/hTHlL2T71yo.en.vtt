00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
situation because I knew he'd already

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.820 
situation because I knew he'd already
done<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.360> couple<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.659> times<00:01:21.869> they<00:01:22.020> said<00:01:22.200> when

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
he did it yet their times were you mad

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.570 
he did it yet their times were you mad
then<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> she<00:01:25.860> said<00:01:26.040> yeah<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.460> I'll<00:01:26.549> be

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
then and she said yeah but I'll be

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.539 
then and she said yeah but I'll be
really<00:01:26.939> mad<00:01:27.330> now<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:29.159> thing<00:01:29.340> about

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
really mad now and the thing about

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.120 
really mad now and the thing about
what's<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.060> stake<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.960> has<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.500> at<00:01:31.710> stake

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
what's at stake is it has to be at stake

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.920 
what's at stake is it has to be at stake
for<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.700> person<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.090> you're<00:01:33.299> speaking<00:01:33.450> to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
for the person that you're speaking to

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.170 
for the person that you're speaking to
and<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.619> think<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.220> could<00:01:35.430> see<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.820> her<00:01:35.909> son

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and I think we could see that her son

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.240 
and I think we could see that her son
has<00:01:36.390> already<00:01:36.570> done<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> cost-benefit<00:01:37.710> analysis

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
has already done a cost-benefit analysis

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.450 
has already done a cost-benefit analysis

would get his attention and again I'm
trying<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.980> be<00:02:24.130> careful<00:02:24.760> because<00:02:25.120> I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
trying to be careful because I

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.000 
trying to be careful because I
understand<00:02:25.600> she's<00:02:25.750> upset<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.170> said<00:02:26.350> I'm

understand she's upset and I said I'm
sure<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.550> would<00:02:27.790> get<00:02:28.030> his<00:02:28.180> attention

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
sure it would get his attention

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.170 
sure it would get his attention

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
power because of course what's at stake

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.120 
power because of course what's at stake
needs<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.570> be<00:02:34.690> something<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.350> have<00:02:35.620> control

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130

this<00:03:07.450> with<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.870> is<00:03:08.050> there<00:03:08.710> anything<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.310> need

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
this with you is there anything you need

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.960 
this with you is there anything you need
to<00:03:09.520> say<00:03:09.670> so<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.540> think<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:11.050> last<00:03:11.260> part<00:03:11.790> came<00:03:12.790> out

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
to say so I think the last part came out

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.580 
to say so I think the last part came out
a<00:03:13.000> little<00:03:13.180> sharp<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.930> think<00:03:14.170> she<00:03:14.290> may<00:03:14.410> have<00:03:14.500> been

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
a little sharp I think she may have been

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.130 
a little sharp I think she may have been
a<00:03:14.620> bit<00:03:14.800> pinched<00:03:15.130> by<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.340> end<00:03:15.610> but<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:16.600> can<00:03:16.840> see

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
a bit pinched by the end but you can see

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.060 
a bit pinched by the end but you can see
how<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.730> name<00:03:19.090> what's<00:03:19.600> at<00:03:19.780> stake<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.380> we<00:03:20.920> can

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
how you name what's at stake and we can

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.710 
how you name what's at stake and we can
certainly<00:03:21.250> do<00:03:21.490> that<00:03:21.640> in<00:03:21.790> workplace<00:03:22.180> context

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
certainly do that in workplace context

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.600 
certainly do that in workplace context
