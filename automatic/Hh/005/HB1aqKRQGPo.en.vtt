 Knowledge is very easy and very simple 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.630
 the only requirement is that in our 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.120
 phone in this case the engine or motorbike 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.430
 that we must have a data plan already 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.230
 that is what we are going to share to 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.410
 through that data plan share to 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.359
 through the mobile's Wi-Fi the data to 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.150
 other devices either phones 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.460

 can leave questions comments 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 suggestions then as we said 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.579
 first of all we must have a plan 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.230
 of activated data ie we should not 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.530
 be connected to a web a wifi network 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.870
 and have our data activated by hand 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.000
 in this case the data is activated and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.770
 the data is already activated and 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.120
 having data simply because 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.290
 we start here by the option of 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.750
 configuration let's go here where it says more 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.200
 then here where it says more we click 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.970
 here the said area networking and wireless 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.310
 and already being here only enough 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.440
 first if the first time they do it 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.260
 enter here where it says configure the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.380
 wifi zone and here you put a 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.439
 name your network 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.990
 then select security level on 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.649
 level of security has to be the wpa2 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.750
 as dry as the other side is very 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.759
 unsafe then enter here a 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.159
 password you can select 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.670
 any password and ready 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.729
 they give ready to save and only lack is for 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.500
 Last activate the portable wifi zone with 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.170
 just one click here and that way 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.619
 any other device is going to be able 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.479
 enter your phone and you must to 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.840
 can do it and navigate through its 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.539
 phone should search the network then by 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.819
 example let's see if exactly 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.009
 there is use this other phone that 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:10.289
 I have here by my side not to see the 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.629
 wilde country options of this phone 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.010
 in this case I'm connected to the network myself 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.860
 I did not go 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.799
 but I'm going to give you here in search for 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.290
 look for other networks then he should 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:27.180
 find the network that we just created 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:30.180
 that is called by the caste there are 10 32 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.299
 which corresponds to the motor or motorcycle 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.579
 people would just give you click here 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.010
 give you the password and connect and ready 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.440
 would be connected through the other the 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.879
