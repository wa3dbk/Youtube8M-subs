about<00:00:15.089> our<00:00:15.599> new<00:00:15.960> pro<00:00:16.260> core<00:00:16.470> system<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
about our new pro core system it's the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.880 
about our new pro core system it's the
very<00:00:18.359> innovative<00:00:18.690> first<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.380> its<00:00:19.500> kind<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
very innovative first of its kind in the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.460 
very innovative first of its kind in the
bicycle<00:00:20.400> industry<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.439> it's

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
bicycle industry and what it is is it's

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.070 
bicycle industry and what it is is it's
essentially<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> dual<00:00:23.760> chamber<00:00:24.150> system<00:00:24.720> for

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
essentially a dual chamber system for

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.580 
essentially a dual chamber system for
your<00:00:25.369> mountain<00:00:26.369> bike<00:00:26.400> tires<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.410> what<00:00:28.410> this

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
your mountain bike tires and what this

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.910 
your mountain bike tires and what this
does<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:29.310> essentially<00:00:30.060> allow<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.380> run<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
does is essentially allow you to run a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.709 
does is essentially allow you to run a
very<00:00:32.219> low<00:00:32.489> pressure<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> outer<00:00:33.239> chamber

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
very low pressure in the outer chamber

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.530 
very low pressure in the outer chamber
and<00:00:34.020> not<00:00:34.920> worry<00:00:35.190> about<00:00:35.280> burping<00:00:35.730> snake<00:00:36.300> biting

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
and not worry about burping snake biting

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.180 
and not worry about burping snake biting
and<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:37.170> those<00:00:37.350> things<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.710> we've<00:00:37.920> had<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and all those things that we've had to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.580 
and all those things that we've had to
deal<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> past<00:00:39.170> when<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.260> comes<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
deal with in the past when it comes to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.500 
deal with in the past when it comes to
low<00:00:40.710> pressures<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> inner<00:00:42.090> chamber

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
low pressures and then the inner chamber

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.680 
low pressures and then the inner chamber
it's<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.719> very<00:00:42.930> high<00:00:43.200> pressure<00:00:44.270> chamber<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.480> so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
it's a very high pressure chamber and so

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.840 
it's a very high pressure chamber and so
that<00:00:45.870> alleviates<00:00:46.469> any<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.100> those<00:00:47.250> rocks<00:00:47.399> from

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
that alleviates any of those rocks from

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.069 
that alleviates any of those rocks from
going<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> way<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.539> your<00:00:48.719> rim<00:00:48.899> and

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
going all the way to your rim and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.229 
going all the way to your rim and
causing<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> burping<00:00:49.890> issues<00:00:50.460> or<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.910> snake

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
causing the burping issues or the snake

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.680 
causing the burping issues or the snake
bite<00:00:51.420> issues<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:51.989> had<00:00:52.140> previously<00:00:53.690> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
bite issues that we had previously the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.049 
bite issues that we had previously the
very<00:00:55.079> unique<00:00:55.469> part<00:00:55.770> about<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.399> two<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.879> we've

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
very unique part about the two is we've

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.200 
very unique part about the two is we've
developed<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:58.160> two-way<00:00:59.160> valve<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
developed a two-way valve so it's a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.729 
developed a two-way valve so it's a
single<00:01:00.359> valve<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.989> you'll<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.260> able<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.530> fill

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
single valve that you'll be able to fill

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.189 
single valve that you'll be able to fill
both<00:01:01.980> chambers<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.629> technology

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
both chambers so with this technology

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.100 
both chambers so with this technology
you<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.159> use<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.519> same<00:01:06.150> standard<00:01:06.689> rims<00:01:06.900> that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you can use your same standard rims that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.350 
you can use your same standard rims that
you<00:01:07.229> always<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.939> there's<00:01:08.939> no<00:01:09.090> extra

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
you always have there's no extra

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.500 
you always have there's no extra
drilling<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:09.869> anything<00:01:10.229> beyond<00:01:10.970> simply<00:01:11.970> using

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
drilling or anything beyond simply using

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.780 
drilling or anything beyond simply using
this<00:01:12.630> new<00:01:12.869> system<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.189> minimum<00:01:14.520> design

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
this new system the one minimum design

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.440 
this new system the one minimum design
requirement<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.380> 23<00:01:17.310> millimeter<00:01:17.759> internal

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
requirement is a 23 millimeter internal

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.410 
requirement is a 23 millimeter internal
section<00:01:19.140> width<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:19.680> rim<00:01:19.890> or<00:01:20.159> wider<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
section width on your rim or wider to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
section width on your rim or wider to
use<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> system<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.229> because<00:01:22.560> there<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
use the system just because there is

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.910 
use the system just because there is
some<00:01:23.009> added<00:01:23.310> materials<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.320> okay<00:01:25.320> with

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
some added materials in there okay with

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.830 
some added materials in there okay with
this<00:01:26.040> new<00:01:26.250> valve<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.600> blue

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
this new valve you can see this blue

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.140 
this new valve you can see this blue
section<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.549> essentially<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.820> when<00:01:30.000> it's

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
section here essentially so when it's

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
section here essentially so when it's
screwed<00:01:30.390> all<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> way<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.049> you're<00:01:31.619> filling<00:01:31.979> up

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
screwed all the way in you're filling up

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.640 
screwed all the way in you're filling up
the<00:01:32.280> inner<00:01:32.460> tube<00:01:32.960> all<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.409> do<00:01:34.530> is

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the inner tube all you have to do is

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.160 
the inner tube all you have to do is
simply<00:01:35.040> unscrew<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.180> valve<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:37.020> its

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
simply unscrew this valve to its

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.760 
simply unscrew this valve to its
stopping<00:01:37.470> point<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.329> it<00:01:39.329> then<00:01:40.020> allows<00:01:40.229> air<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
stopping point and it then allows air to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.429 
stopping point and it then allows air to
escape<00:01:41.100> through<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.700> secondary<00:01:42.439> release

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
escape through the secondary release

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.859 
escape through the secondary release
here<00:01:43.740> through<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> air<00:01:44.700> guide<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.270> out<00:01:45.509> into

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
here through the air guide and out into

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.110 
here through the air guide and out into
the<00:01:45.960> outer<00:01:45.990> chamber

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.140 

so<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.230> system<00:01:50.710> itself<00:01:51.070> is<00:01:51.340> originally<00:01:51.880> going

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
so the system itself is originally going

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.400 
so the system itself is originally going
to<00:01:52.890> come<00:01:53.890> out<00:01:54.040> as<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.910> set<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.540> one<00:01:56.020> for<00:01:56.050> both

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
to come out as a set so one for both

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.520 
to come out as a set so one for both
tires<00:01:57.000> or<00:01:58.000> one<00:01:58.480> for<00:01:58.630> each<00:01:58.720> wheel<00:01:58.960> excuse<00:01:59.380> me

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
tires or one for each wheel excuse me

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.670 
tires or one for each wheel excuse me
and<00:01:59.910> it<00:02:00.910> will<00:02:01.180> come<00:02:01.360> with<00:02:01.660> two<00:02:02.260> of<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.530> inner

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
and it will come with two of the inner

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.470 
and it will come with two of the inner
tires<00:02:02.980> two<00:02:03.550> of<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.820> inner<00:02:03.940> tubes<00:02:04.210> with<00:02:04.450> a

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
tires two of the inner tubes with a

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.980 
tires two of the inner tubes with a
