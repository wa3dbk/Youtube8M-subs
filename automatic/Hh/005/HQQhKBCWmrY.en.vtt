I'm a big fan of linebackers that look

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.880 
I'm a big fan of linebackers that look
to<00:01:45.299> hit<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.659> play<00:01:45.869> aggressive<00:01:46.320> vs<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> run

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
to hit that play aggressive vs the run

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.370 
to hit that play aggressive vs the run
and<00:01:47.100> no<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:47.610> does<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.789> better<00:01:47.939> than<00:01:48.180> pyramid

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.539 

looking<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> defensive<00:01:55.979> line<00:01:56.039> I<00:01:56.220> like

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
looking at the defensive line I like

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.609 
looking at the defensive line I like
Terry<00:01:56.909> Williams<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.630> East<00:01:57.869> Carolina<00:01:58.320> he's

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
Terry Williams out of East Carolina he's

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.310 
Terry Williams out of East Carolina he's
six<00:01:58.860> feet<00:01:59.119> 344<00:02:00.119> he's<00:02:00.570> listed<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> nose

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
six feet 344 he's listed as a nose

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.600 
six feet 344 he's listed as a nose
tackle<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.860> think<00:02:02.070> he<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.280> play<00:02:02.399> anywhere

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
tackle but I think he can play anywhere

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.490 
tackle but I think he can play anywhere
along<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.539> defense<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> friend<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.380> be

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
along that defense a friend to be

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.559 
along that defense a friend to be
