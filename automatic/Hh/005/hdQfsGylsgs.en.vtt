 flushes 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.690
 let's talk all about rumors 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:18.960
 how to choose how to apply how 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.300
 achieve that effect glow with 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.730
 jennifer aniston jennifer lopez 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.520
 they see them as the cheeks so full of 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.880
 life and let's see how to combine 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.609
 different shades to achieve a 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.859
 radiant skin so go for your 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:39.859
 Notebook by your pen write down and then 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.859
 let's start 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.280
 the makeup is for me an expression 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.620
 artistic where I can capture all my 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.070
 passion a game of princesses that never 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.070
 ends 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.640
 let's start working with the 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:04.149
 flushes and it is very important to understand 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.250
 that if we want it to last longer during 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.200
 all day we have to use a technique 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.659
 special because if we are nothing more than 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.119
 the morning putting on and putting on 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.759
 putting us and then we bring the cheeks 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.220
 there are reds not going is not going to last longer 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.119
 we 're going to look bad the right way 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.250
 to do it is using the first although 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.380
 we have used before the base of 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.090
 We have to use makeup before the 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.640
 blush and so we do not have to touch up what 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.590
 so much neither are we going to exaggerate then 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.039
 we put a little bit and I'm going to apply 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.860
 exactly where I'm going to apply the 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.630
 blush and this can be extended with your 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.810
 fingers so that the truth nothing more 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.270
 apply what is necessary we give you about 3 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.850
 seconds and we start with the application 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.940
 of the flush we are going to propose two 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.429
 tonalities one side his cheek in rosita 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.560
 and the other one in peach so that you 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.289
 choose what they like best 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.010
 here we have our rosita if you 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.210
 do not 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.190
 this is clear and this is darker what 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.800
 happens if I only apply the dark 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.110
 we return to the same thing we create a 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.840
 nuance and it will not work for us 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.620
 let's create the lighting and the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.420
 depth in the same color range 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.470
 let's ask our model to 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.930
 smile and here if you notice we are 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.090
 touching the chubby of his cheek without 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.340
 But the blush we will apply a 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.370
 little more here because when she is 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.950
 normal your cheek is going to fall exactly 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.680
 in the cheekbone and if I start here is 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.000
 very low the application start with the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.730
 lighter hue in small circles 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.660
 ascending and in this way I'm going to take 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:56.950
 a sponge immediately and remove 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:01.140
 now we take this blush again and very 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:05.010
 little amount of pink stronger 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.890
 nothing else here with the same crime what 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.290
 we began to capture and take to the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.560
 desired address 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.090
 now let's create the famous effect be 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.330
 I'm going to take an effect on Rosita 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:25.740
 clear and I'll explain it again 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:28.820
 to give that grow on your cheek what 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.989
 we blur care with the quantities 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:36.870
 Now I'm going to use a little amount 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:41.190
 applying on the bridge of his nose very 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.160
 little amount in the forehead and in the 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.160
 chin and it's enough now we're going 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.959
 to go to the hue in peach so that 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.709
 you see the difference of 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.790
 effects I'm going to take the clarito the 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.430
 clarito 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.850
 goes up starting the canvas of the 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.820
 make up the darkest hue of 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.040
 peach a little above the 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.700
 chubby smile 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.049
 we take our sponge and we do this 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:16.590
 removing excess pigment and 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:21.329
 finally what we do is take a 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:24.090
 effect if now in golden brown always 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.680
 shake a little because the excess of 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.350
 pigment can ruin our 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.350
 work and with great delicacy we are going to 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.130
 apply a little on his cheek and we go back 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:38.639
 to extend that product another trick is 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.070
 that we are going to use the first gold that is 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.740
 You can also use below the base to 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.340
 see us more tan but we 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.380
 we're going to use to focus the glow on 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.320
 where we want it now there's no need 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.169
 exaggerating please it's very important that 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.870
 we do not believe that more product 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.030
 apply will be better a little 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.900
 the forehead and a little and the vegetable and 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.440
 back to do it in small 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.800
 little touches and so here we have a side in 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.880
 golden peach and another side in pink and 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.030
 Can be done 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.640
 gold color in golden stronger good there 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.920
 many ranges and we can change many 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.980
