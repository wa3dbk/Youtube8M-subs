00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.040
 we go 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.480
 Olympia where the illusion lives 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.480
 Y 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.300
 and although 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.919
 city 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.329
 and nobody 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.510
 no no 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.510
 in its kind 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.990
 I chose 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.990
 efe 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.950
 but 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.330
 after a threat like that 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.060
 I think any call of player 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.500
 duty would think twice about going back to 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.340
 to play 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.350
 but not in my case because you know 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.330
 We ended up beating the ending 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.100
 gringo espalier as always as 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.500
 should do when they start to load 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.360
 stick like they did in this lobby not 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.580
 typical lobby that I think everyone has 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.740
 touched in which you get yourself they begin 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.350
 what do you want and start and we're going 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.630
 to win and not to leave but that 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.790
 stay and after all it ends 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.560
 winning again and they can go you then 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.720
 they are going to say that you raised them champion and 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.420
 they saw follows but good to flirt the 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.060
 joke of this video is that in which 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.390
 these bars are not playing there 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.900
 a game before this one because we 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.060
 they won a domination in turbine no 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.620
 they made triple nature and all that you 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.540
 you can then at the end of the month chase 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.750
 Well, they already earn me because they were a 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.700
 couple and complete and I was alone with the 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.650
 that had touched me in the team were 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.239
 a few high levels low levels like 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.360
 that it looked like the thing but in the end 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.370
 ending we end up winning as they 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.590
 I say with the faith of camouflage w 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.590
 diamond that the diamond camouflage 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.800
 and twice as many as required for 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.140
 you but good when you simply 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.790
 It was a small little gameplay 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.950
 It made me laugh a lot and I wanted to share it 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.500
 with you and I hope you have done them 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.070
 laugh you also go or I say goodbye 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.070
 Enjoy it 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.930
 at the door
