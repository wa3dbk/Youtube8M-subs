00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.170
 our occasion endurance test is full of 240 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.280
 svensson 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.469
 has since become a familiar appearance 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.160
 it is nice to use the counter that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.080
 is already over the 380,000 km high time 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.840
 so for an okesion double test yes that 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.970
 of course they ca n't be anything else 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.070
 more competitive than a 900 saab 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.800
 because they are actually both it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.330
 The Volvo 240 is the car that started so 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.670
 in the seventies and into the years 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.439
 90 has been produced by well we have 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.290
 nicely found with first class car 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.829
 service in bunnik and task that may be best 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.829
 borrow a day 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.690
 look that is a currently asians 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.739
 young people in our 240 he has 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.750
 120,000 kilometers less on the clock 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.339
 although I also understand that finds 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.559
 Swedish car circle just a recommendation 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.030
 is when your car has walked a lot to 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.350
 the most attractive 906 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.879
 natural turbos but start there 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.620
 Today we don't meet what it loses 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.030
 wish to go in advance 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.159
 this has the regular 2 liters 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.100
 sixteen valve under the hood with 128 hp 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.360
 and costs below 2250 euros 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.070
 and so you immediately have a different difference 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.600
 with turbos because if you get the 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.600
 that one visit is quite pm 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.899
 ride in a classic saab 900 well how 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.579
 I arrive at such a wash at this station now 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.469
 of course used a while and yes it 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.610
 first thing that strikes me is the seats 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.720
 be a lot flatter 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.240
 interior with each other around you 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.430
 what immediately stands out is that this car anyway 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.710
 a piece of stones directly forwards 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.300
 yes you involve yourself much more in it 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.950
 to drive 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.740
 after the engine so compared to 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.060
 svensson gives you an additional 12 horsepower 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.120
 the song may be crazy but you can feel it 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.220
 well you pull things through in speed then 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.150
 We get what they really back 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.150
 to the tastier to the gas 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.840
 and it is so beautiful about this 900 car 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.120
 is the mechanic boom so i just 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.720
 nice sound mind 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.890
 no when the drive arrives 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.890
 they go to the 900 then 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.960
 yes and as a person to make this car feel too high 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.150
 on the goat in an extraordinary 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.400
 comfortable fortune 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.959
 well cornering is not his hobby but 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.310
 it goes even better 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.549
 speed bumps and not there 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.549
 off 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.310
 l think with you such a big car yes 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.870
 that may sound like we are just helping 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.090
 today it is really great 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.769
 she does not want to spend hours because 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.080
 in every speed range right up to the engine 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.090
 the same thing always goes quietly 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.700
 become rights 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.440
 yes for their mileage 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.540
 is the engine very healthy we have 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.319
 to go on the dynamometer before seemed quite 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.610
 she 116 hp 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.140
 and after that entire trip to the North Cape 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.700
 had to wear but only a half 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.870
 liter of oil 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.640
 and it was 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.690
 on your brain don't have to worry about alone 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.730
 you must not forget to occasionally 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.319
 think because under one team or get 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.940
 not 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.830
 yes, despite its size, it is really big 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.040
 nimble car we of extremely short 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.040
 turning circle 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.780
 and he is there by contemporary standards 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.800
 awfully narrow so a pocket 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.040
 parking is 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.840
 had it well enough room though you have to 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.069
 you poked in backwards 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.540
 do not forget to look good back 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.040
 because before you know it a solution 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.630
 lamppost 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.230
 because the over to not really awful 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.230
 big behind 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.750
 well maybe its about 15 20 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.860
 have long been the popular cars of Sweden 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.120
 the biggest technical difference 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.750
 that he volvo rear wheel drive 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.930
 has 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.250
 and the saab front wheel drive yes always 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.500
 their cars are too full of photos we are then 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.210
 world famous and there is a pack with it 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.620
 space in but with the stubborn sa 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.330
 they thought they didn't need something like that 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.340
 had that 900 which has a huge 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.990
 got behind flap and also one 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.090
 luggage space that you are allowed 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.959
 recommended they quite a point 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.790
 And then of course there is it 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.239
 different appearance but those volvo's 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.430
 everything 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.810
 rectangular and functional while being me 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.190
 sleep and car with a very special one 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.570
 have put down the line 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.830
 well and i think there is no one that 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.810
 not a clear preference for one 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.490
 of those two has the standard there 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.020
 complaints of around 900 what so too 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.980
 the transmission shoots inside 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.410
 not eternal life 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.240
 especially for different and there is 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.010
 still the roof heaven in the 900 on 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.630
 a good moment always hangs 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.490
 so an expensive repair you have with this one 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.440
 that already neatly solved 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.330
 yes and then there is the rust and 900 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.920
 euros more than a volvo so look 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.650
 good to buy when a car times 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.970
 good inside out and you got scared 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.830
 are for the component supply or 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.030
 do all the hassle at saab 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.530
 with that are not afraid of because 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.290
 that they mustache for years to come 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.730
 the youngest 42 who are also 20 again 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.260
 year old who is at that age 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.400
 rust always an issue 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.520
 nevertheless there is a part here in that regard 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.990
 better rated than a saab 900 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.820
 surely this car lu especially 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.740
 the wheel arch edges and the wheel arches 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.690
 are notorious but that we are not such 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.180
 burden of up sitting there with us cauliflower 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.310
 sorry and there is a hole in the 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.440
 cooking beam and disadvantage compared to 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.510
 900 is this one full of timing belts 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.110
 has to be replaced regularly 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.820
 to become 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.590
 and the pile has chain and it is like that 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.960
 good as maintenance free 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.340
 but despite that, the 42 still stands 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.600
 known as one of the best products 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.600
 who has made full of ever
