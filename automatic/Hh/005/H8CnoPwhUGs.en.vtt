00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.520
 and 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.650
 hello how are you like gustavo we are here 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.020
 in easy code and we continue with 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.119
 our tutorial of juniti before seeing 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.240
 the types of forces I want us to do 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.220
 fast a utility ending they will see 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.910
 why are we doing it but good 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.340
 this is going to be basic materials that is 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.710
 a good material a material and 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.430
 we had mentioned a little but in itself 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.640
 a material is what he says to 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.699
 our object with what characteristics 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.739
 they are going to deliver so much color 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.360
 transparency and those things by the 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.790
 At that moment, the only thing we had done was 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.650
 change the material of our cube and 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.390
 well we were doing that so 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.390
 our cube was not confused with the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.610
 but this time we are going to create 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.339
 our own materials we're going 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.260
 here to the project section we do 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.770
 a folder that is 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:13.570
 warm materials 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.549
 and here we create a material on 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:21.850
 first material because I do not know if they want 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:23.619
 let it be a color let's put it red 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.719
 and good this is our material it 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.270
 they fix here tell us male color color 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.829
 main and it's blank what we're going 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.369
 to do now it's going to be nothing else you can 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:36.189
 put a red color ok 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:42.390
 that's fine and now we 're going to go to 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:42.390
 cube as we see here in section d 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.479
 get rid of the materials that 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.009
 they are entering and we are using 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.659
 expressly this material that is white 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.700
 so we're just going to drag 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.500
 Our red material carry our 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.330
 cube is going to be red this is a way 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.539
 very simple to change the color of 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.850
 certain primitive objects themselves 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.520
 more complex models carry materials 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.759
 Well, more complexes generally there 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.069
 what they call the texturized but 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.810
 well for the moment so let's leave 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.660
 our material we will disable 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.989
 I like the motion script because 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.280
 remember that this script is going to 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.459
 rewrite the color of our material 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.500
 then we give him play and then he looks red 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.810
 if you want we also do the same for 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.630
 the plan we can not put a color then 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.630
 gray I do not know we create a material 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.430
 king or do you believe 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.310
 and we select here 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.310
 so a color like this is this 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.290
 and we look like the plane here 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.599
 materials to the country sections 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.879
 and this is ready, it will allow us to have a 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.730
 difference between us both objects 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.650
 and well that 's all for now 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.019
 materials is nothing more very basic to 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.400
 that we can distinguish our objects 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.959
 and the memory of gustavo leave me your 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.909
 doubt your comments here or on twitter 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.709
 and now yes in the next chapter 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.709
 let's see the types of forces
