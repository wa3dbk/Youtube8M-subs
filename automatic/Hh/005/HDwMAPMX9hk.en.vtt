00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.389
 hello to everyone here in sg 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.309
 I have a new meeting for 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.080
 minecraft is about the three capi mode 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.000
 I've been asked by many 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.280
 that here you have this very quick review 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.980
 with this mode we are going to be able to cut the 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.080
 all the trees at once 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.200
 that is, if we start cutting down the 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.760
 tree let's catch from here down already 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.830
 you are going to see that we are going to cut down the tree 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.170
 whole will fall all blocks 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.020
 wood as well as the sapiens and we could 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.850
 also give apples is worth in this case 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.980
 you have seen that he moved it from below 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.170
 but if we take it from the middle or 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.790
 from this block we will cut down from 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.680
 here from this block that I am 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.950
 doing up is worth and I would leave 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.440
 the two blocks below are going to see very 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.870
 While it has dropped all you see is happening 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.820
 very fast and it will be very useful for 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.670
 all those people who are not 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.680
 like to be chopping all the blocks of 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.410
 one in one is worth as I will visará I am using 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.210
 an ax but if we use the hand it's not going to 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.420
 to work is to say that we are going to 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.810
 have to fell 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.060
 with the h veis here we have used it with the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.320
 hand and we just dropped a block in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.320
 change if we use the ax 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.880
 very well you have already seen that it gives us everything 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.230
 as you can see this is the mod 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.150
 The truth is that I have told you that it is 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.940
 very simple but it is very useful for everything 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.220
 that to all those people who do not 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.540
 like to cut down this way his way is worth it 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.280
 that I will quickly explain to you now 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.350
 How to install if you have any questions 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.500
 you comment to me and nothing I hope that I have 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.510
 liked so far to install 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.630
 the monte capi héitor we are going to need 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.050
 Forge and also this other file that is 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.550
 the bsp that that cut is worth the kernel well 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.320
 that as I did a tutorial how 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.060
 install forge I leave the link here 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.920
 top left and also in the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.690
 description of the video once what 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.600
 we have installed we are going to go here to 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.270
 start let's write app percentage 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.190
 data percentage we're going to go to the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.500
 minecraft point folder here to the 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.560
 folder mods and inside this folder 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.410
 mods let's select both the bsp 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.760
 here cord as the tree capi file 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.500
 this editor that would let 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.510
 select the two and we will copy them 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.920
 it would already installed mode 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.920
 so let's run minecraft 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.390
 let's select the profile where 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.390
 let's have forge and we will give to play 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.970
 very well without the player creating new world 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.970
 creative create 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.010
 very well the world has already been loaded 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:50.310
 I'm going to take an ax first by 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.220
 example where are you is from here and I 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.000

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.659

 tree 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.610
 very well as you can see, all the 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.800
 wood 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.770
 so we can say that we have the 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.540
 properly installed mode is worth very 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.550
