00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.090 
what you do is you put a Lumina m--
on<00:01:39.479> there<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.259> got<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.500> make<00:01:40.650> sure<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.950> it's

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
on there you got to make sure that it's

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.060 
on there you got to make sure that it's
big<00:01:41.310> enough<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> that's<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.350> larger

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
big enough so that's actually larger

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.980 
big enough so that's actually larger
than<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.430> circle<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.720> drew<00:01:45.960> on

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
than the circle that you just drew on

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.800 
than the circle that you just drew on
the<00:01:46.439> other<00:01:46.590> side<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:48.180> what<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.630> is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the other side and then what you do is

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.560 
the other side and then what you do is
you<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:48.930> cut<00:01:49.560> out<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.759> circle<00:01:51.149> now<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
you just cut out the the circle now you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.170 
you just cut out the the circle now you
can<00:01:51.720> use<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> an<00:01:52.560> x-acto<00:01:52.950> knife<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> box

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
can use a an x-acto knife or like a box

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.959 
can use a an x-acto knife or like a box

zip ties through that and what you do
with<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> zip<00:02:10.950> ties<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:12.300> bend<00:02:12.840> them

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
with the zip ties is you bend them

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.310 
with the zip ties is you bend them
a<00:02:13.470> little<00:02:13.860> bit<00:02:14.070> you'll<00:02:14.640> see<00:02:14.730> why<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.960> second

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
a little bit you'll see why in a second

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.920 
a little bit you'll see why in a second
and<00:02:16.470> then<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.070> put<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.970> zip<00:02:18.180> throught<00:02:18.540> zip

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
and then you put the zip throught zip

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.140 
and then you put the zip throught zip
ties<00:02:19.140> through<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.710> holes<00:02:19.950> with<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.640> bends

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
ties through the holes with the bends

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.530 
ties through the holes with the bends
facing<00:02:21.570> outwards<00:02:22.640> this<00:02:23.640> will<00:02:23.880> be<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.300> front

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
facing outwards this will be the front

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.770 
facing outwards this will be the front
view<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.730> then<00:02:26.730> what<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.090> want<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.330> do<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.630> you

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
view and then what you want to do is you

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.990 
view and then what you want to do is you
want<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.320> cut<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.770> slits<00:02:29.190> into<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.730> bowl

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
want to cut the slits into the bowl

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.760 
want to cut the slits into the bowl
every<00:02:30.450> 90<00:02:30.750> degrees<00:02:31.050> also

every 90 degrees also

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.860 
every 90 degrees also
now<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.190> slits<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.210> just<00:02:33.570> big<00:02:33.810> enough

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
now the slits have to be just big enough

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.590 
now the slits have to be just big enough
for<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.350> zip<00:02:34.530> ties<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.770> fit<00:02:35.430> through

ring into place what you might need to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.810 
ring into place what you might need to
do<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.320> you<00:02:43.380> might<00:02:43.530> need<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.800> insert<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.310> small

do is you might need to insert a small
flathead<00:02:45.360> screwdriver<00:02:46.200> into<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.710> slits<00:02:47.070> to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
flathead screwdriver into the slits to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.610 
flathead screwdriver into the slits to
make<00:02:47.370> them<00:02:47.520> just<00:02:47.700> big<00:02:47.880> enough<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.360> can<00:02:48.660> put

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
make them just big enough so you can put

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.740 
make them just big enough so you can put
the<00:02:49.740> zip<00:02:49.950> ties<00:02:50.160> through<00:02:50.550> but<00:02:51.090> again<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.570> most

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
the zip ties through but again the most

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.300 
the zip ties through but again the most
important<00:02:52.260> thing<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.500> make<00:02:52.740> sure<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:53.190> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
important thing is make sure that the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.990 
important thing is make sure that the
zip<00:02:53.550> ties<00:02:53.780> are<00:02:54.780> held<00:02:55.140> in<00:02:55.320> place<00:02:55.610> firmly<00:02:56.610> by<00:02:56.940> the

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
zip ties are held in place firmly by the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.990 
zip ties are held in place firmly by the
friction<00:02:57.510> from<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.870> bowl<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:59.010> bowl<00:02:59.190> set<00:02:59.760> up

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
friction from the bowl the bowl set up

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.380 
friction from the bowl the bowl set up

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
with the on the flash this is the like a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.210 
with the on the flash this is the like a
three-quarter<00:03:03.960> view<00:03:04.320> or<00:03:04.620> whatever<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.070> want

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
three-quarter view or whatever you want

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.070 
three-quarter view or whatever you want
to<00:03:05.310> call<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.670> here's<00:03:05.940> pretty<00:03:06.420> much<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.810> same

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
to call that here's pretty much the same

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.310 
to call that here's pretty much the same
view<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.070> in<00:03:08.520> this<00:03:08.760> one<00:03:08.910> here<00:03:09.090> we've<00:03:09.240> got<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.630> an

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
view and in this one here we've got a an

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.220 
view and in this one here we've got a an
omni<00:03:11.190> bounce<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.120> flash<00:03:12.390> sort<00:03:13.170> of

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
omni bounce on the flash sort of

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.750 
omni bounce on the flash sort of
diffuses<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.680> light<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.950> little<00:03:14.040> bit<00:03:14.370> more<00:03:14.580> and

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
diffuses the light a little bit more and

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.750 
diffuses the light a little bit more and
gives<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.060> softer<00:03:15.510> light<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.100> here<00:03:17.100> is<00:03:17.280> the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
gives it a softer light and here is the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.160 
gives it a softer light and here is the
front<00:03:18.120> view<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.860> finally<00:03:19.940> here<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.170> front

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
front view and finally here is the front

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.470 
front view and finally here is the front
view<00:03:22.459> just<00:03:23.459> illuminate<00:03:23.970> with<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.209> flash

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
view just illuminate with the flash

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.900 
view just illuminate with the flash
going<00:03:24.900> off<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.980> it's<00:03:26.100> pretty<00:03:26.250> simple<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.730> make

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
going off so it's pretty simple to make

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.330 
going off so it's pretty simple to make
your<00:03:27.090> own<00:03:27.209> beauty<00:03:27.630> dish<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.410> I'm<00:03:29.070> still

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
your own beauty dish and I'm still
