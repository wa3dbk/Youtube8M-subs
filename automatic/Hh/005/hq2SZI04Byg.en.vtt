so<00:00:03.810> I've<00:00:03.899> got<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.080> newer<00:00:04.440> panasonic<00:00:05.430> plasma<00:00:05.460> TV

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
so I've got a newer panasonic plasma TV

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.110 
so I've got a newer panasonic plasma TV
here<00:00:06.690> I've<00:00:06.810> got<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.080> back<00:00:07.259> off<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.529> it<00:00:07.710> already

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
here I've got the back off of it already

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.160 
here I've got the back off of it already
which<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.210> could<00:00:09.389> demonstrate<00:00:09.540> what<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:09.990> was

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
which I could demonstrate what it was

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.259 
which I could demonstrate what it was
doing<00:00:10.290> but<00:00:10.559> it's<00:00:10.679> making<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.280> buzzing<00:00:12.240> sound

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
doing but it's making a buzzing sound

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.460 
doing but it's making a buzzing sound
and<00:00:13.880> it's<00:00:14.880> an<00:00:15.030> abnormal<00:00:15.179> buzzing<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:15.990> come<00:00:16.199> it

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
and it's an abnormal buzzing to come it

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.529 
and it's an abnormal buzzing to come it
changed<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.890> with<00:00:16.980> picture<00:00:17.310> brightness<00:00:17.539> I've

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
changed it with picture brightness I've

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.840 
changed it with picture brightness I've
had<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> few<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.080> these<00:00:19.260> doing<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.220> just

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
had a few of these doing it and just

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.519 
had a few of these doing it and just
it's<00:00:21.330> going<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.539> be<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> real<00:00:21.840> quick<00:00:22.020> video<00:00:22.380> only

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
it's going to be a real quick video only

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.640 
it's going to be a real quick video only
a<00:00:22.619> couple<00:00:22.800> minutes<00:00:22.949> long<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:25.050> problem<00:00:25.470> is

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
a couple minutes long the problem is

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.050 
a couple minutes long the problem is
that<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> original<00:00:26.430> screws<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
that the original screws that the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.290 
that the original screws that the
factory<00:00:27.449> used<00:00:27.810> did<00:00:28.410> not<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:29.070> washers<00:00:29.970> on

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
factory used did not have washers on

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.700 
factory used did not have washers on
them<00:00:32.120> so<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> problem<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.899> caused<00:00:34.320> by

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
them so the problem here is caused by

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.979 
them so the problem here is caused by
these<00:00:35.160> screws<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.760> they<00:00:35.910> originally<00:00:36.420> used

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
these screws that they originally used

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.340 
these screws that they originally used
did<00:00:37.829> not<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.399> any<00:00:38.820> kind<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.239> lock<00:00:39.570> washer<00:00:39.840> on

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
did not have any kind of lock washer on

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.650 
did not have any kind of lock washer on
them

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
them

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.160 
them
the<00:00:42.660> replacement<00:00:43.320> screws<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.899> type<00:00:45.899> with

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the replacement screws are the type with

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.690 
the replacement screws are the type with
lock<00:00:46.410> washers<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.100> provide<00:00:47.309> constant

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
lock washers to provide constant

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.670 
lock washers to provide constant
pressure<00:00:48.390> on<00:00:48.629> these<00:00:48.899> little<00:00:49.140> circuit<00:00:49.500> pads

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
pressure on these little circuit pads

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.869 
pressure on these little circuit pads
which<00:00:49.920> they<00:00:50.129> use<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> ground<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.960> these<00:00:52.320> sets

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
which they use as a ground on these sets

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.549 
which they use as a ground on these sets
so<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.480> want<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.750> make<00:00:54.899> sure<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.440> get

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
so you want to make sure that you get

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.549 
so you want to make sure that you get
the<00:00:55.680> ones<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> washers<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.410> you<00:00:58.410> want

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the ones with the washers and you want

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.990 
the ones with the washers and you want
to<00:00:58.620> watch<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.190> length<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> screw

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
to watch out for the length of the screw

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.900 
to watch out for the length of the screw
particularly<00:01:00.829> that<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.859> does<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.309> go<00:01:02.579> too<00:01:02.640> far

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
particularly that it does not go too far

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.260 
particularly that it does not go too far
into<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.170> set<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.710> needs<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.369> only<00:01:06.060> about

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
into the set it needs to be only about

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
into the set it needs to be only about
three<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:06.960> four<00:01:07.320> millimeters<00:01:07.920> long<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.890> of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
three or four millimeters long and of

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.420 
three or four millimeters long and of
course<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.439> if<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:14.040> don't<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
course if you if you don't have the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.800 
course if you if you don't have the
right<00:01:14.580> screws<00:01:14.909> with<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.090> lock<00:01:15.299> washers<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
right screws with the lock washers you

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.240 
right screws with the lock washers you
always<00:01:16.020> could<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.380> tighten<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> existing

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
always could just tighten the existing

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.830 
always could just tighten the existing
screws<00:01:17.640> down<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.180> probably<00:01:18.360> will<00:01:18.600> work

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
screws down but they probably will work

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.890 
screws down but they probably will work
their<00:01:19.080> way<00:01:19.229> loose<00:01:19.470> again<00:01:20.450> one<00:01:21.450> thing<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.810> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
their way loose again one thing that you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
their way loose again one thing that you
do<00:01:22.049> not<00:01:22.170> want<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.830> over<00:01:23.250> tighten<00:01:23.610> these

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
do not want to do is over tighten these

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.480 
do not want to do is over tighten these
screws<00:01:24.140> I<00:01:25.140> don't<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
screws I don't know if you can get a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.990 
screws I don't know if you can get a
good<00:01:26.700> view<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:28.100> but<00:01:29.100> that's<00:01:29.670> all

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
good view of this or not but that's all

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.730 
good view of this or not but that's all
the<00:01:30.240> thread<00:01:30.509> there<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> circuit

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the thread there is for the circuit

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.190 
the thread there is for the circuit
board<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.549> screws<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.240> screw<00:01:33.390> into<00:01:35.060> and

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
board and the screws to screw into and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.990 
board and the screws to screw into and
right<00:01:37.200> beyond<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:38.130> bump<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
right beyond this little bump is the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.710 
right beyond this little bump is the
back<00:01:39.299> glass<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:41.460> plasma<00:01:42.000> panel<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.659> you

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
back glass of the plasma panel so you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.060 
back glass of the plasma panel so you
don't<00:01:42.960> want<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.200> put<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.530> there<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.920> too

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
don't want to put one in there it's too

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.350 
don't want to put one in there it's too
terribly<00:01:44.399> long<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:45.000> want<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.210> over

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
terribly long you don't want to over

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.580 
terribly long you don't want to over
tighten<00:01:45.390> them<00:01:45.720> because<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.140> strip<00:01:46.409> this

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
tighten them because if you strip this

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.819 
tighten them because if you strip this
out<00:01:47.329> there's<00:01:48.329> no<00:01:48.770> repairing<00:01:50.479> other<00:01:51.479> than<00:01:51.829> you

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
out there's no repairing other than you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.209 
out there's no repairing other than you
could<00:01:52.979> shim<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.369> up<00:01:53.490> somehow<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.420> far<00:01:54.659> as

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
could shim it up somehow but as far as

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.679 
could shim it up somehow but as far as
you<00:01:56.219> can't<00:01:56.460> use<00:01:57.060> something<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
you can't use something like a

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.270 
you can't use something like a
helicoidal<00:01:58.229> or<00:01:58.469> something<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
helicoidal or something like that to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.450 
helicoidal or something like that to
repair<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.729> so<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.869> give<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.259> this

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460

real quick little video on the newer

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.869 
real quick little video on the newer
2011<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.610> 2012<00:02:06.979> panasonic<00:02:07.979> plasma<00:02:08.009> TVs<00:02:08.670> that

2011 and 2012 panasonic plasma TVs that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.860 
2011 and 2012 panasonic plasma TVs that
have<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.239> buzz<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.720> changes<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.709> brightness

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.390 

if<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.989> can<00:02:16.140> find<00:02:16.319> an<00:02:16.500> appropriate<00:02:16.800> supplier

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
if you can find an appropriate supplier

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.589 
if you can find an appropriate supplier
you<00:02:17.730> could<00:02:18.030> always<00:02:18.300> just<00:02:18.660> order<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:20.599> number

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
you could always just order this number

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.740 
you could always just order this number
and<00:02:21.840> you'll<00:02:22.019> get<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.349> original<00:02:23.750> replacements

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
and you'll get the original replacements

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.970 
and you'll get the original replacements
that<00:02:24.930> way<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:27.150> just<00:02:27.180> want<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.629> replace

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
that way and you just want to replace

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.229 
that way and you just want to replace
the<00:02:28.980> ones<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.640> scan<00:02:29.970> boards<00:02:31.880> this<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.120> an

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
the ones in the scan boards this is an

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.600 
the ones in the scan boards this is an
SN<00:02:33.690> board<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.709> particular<00:02:35.190> model<00:02:35.580> but

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
SN board on this particular model but

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.479 
SN board on this particular model but
some<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.090> them<00:02:36.209> have<00:02:36.239> SC<00:02:37.200> boards

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
some of them have SC boards

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.030 
some of them have SC boards
it's<00:02:38.880> an<00:02:39.060> SN<00:02:39.480> when<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.870> has<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.260> buffers<00:02:40.739> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
it's an SN when it has the buffers and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.509 
it's an SN when it has the buffers and
the<00:02:41.099> SC<00:02:42.090> board<00:02:42.239> combined<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.989> one<00:02:43.260> board<00:02:43.769> so

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
the SC board combined is one board so

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.759 
the SC board combined is one board so
it's<00:02:44.700> primarily<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.239> SN<00:02:45.750> board<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.470> then

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
it's primarily the SN board and then

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.020 
it's primarily the SN board and then
over<00:02:47.069> here<00:02:47.099> on<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.610> side<00:02:47.670> it's<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.480> SS<00:02:49.410> board

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
over here on this side it's the SS board

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.460 
over here on this side it's the SS board
so<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.299> want<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.569> replace<00:02:51.900> all<00:02:52.230> those

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
so you just want to replace all those

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.229 
so you just want to replace all those
screws<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.670> will<00:02:53.790> get<00:02:53.910> rid<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:54.090> that

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
screws and that will get rid of that

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.949 
screws and that will get rid of that
buzz<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.459> this<00:02:56.459> is<00:02:56.640> primarily<00:02:57.060> applicable<00:02:57.720> on

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
buzz and this is primarily applicable on

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.180 
buzz and this is primarily applicable on
the<00:02:58.829> 2011<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.670> 2012<00:03:00.319> models<00:03:01.319> this<00:03:01.920> one

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
the 2011 and 2012 models this one

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.720 
the 2011 and 2012 models this one
particularly<00:03:02.610> was<00:03:02.910> made<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.799> 2011<00:03:04.799> September

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
particularly was made in 2011 September

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.120 
particularly was made in 2011 September
