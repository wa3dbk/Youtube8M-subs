00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
I wanted to do a video here of the

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.120 
I wanted to do a video here of the
Plasti<00:00:05.370> Dip<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:06.359> lot<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.350> people<00:00:07.649> use<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:07.980> for

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
Plasti Dip a lot of people use it for

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.470 
Plasti Dip a lot of people use it for
the<00:00:08.189> wheels<00:00:08.429> these<00:00:08.730> are<00:00:08.970> for<00:00:09.120> their<00:00:09.210> grills

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
the wheels these are for their grills

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.330 
the wheels these are for their grills
they<00:00:09.900> use<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.260> for<00:00:10.530> pretty<00:00:10.830> much<00:00:10.950> anything

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
they use it for pretty much anything

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.180 
they use it for pretty much anything
nowadays<00:00:11.670> because<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:12.630> easy<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.320> work<00:00:13.530> with

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
nowadays because it's easy to work with

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.290 
nowadays because it's easy to work with
and<00:00:15.170> generally<00:00:16.170> easy<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.500> remove<00:00:17.029> unless<00:00:18.029> you

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and generally easy to remove unless you

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.560 
and generally easy to remove unless you
don't<00:00:18.480> put<00:00:18.720> enough<00:00:18.990> layers<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.570> these

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
don't put enough layers on so these

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.019 
don't put enough layers on so these
wheels<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.140> did<00:00:22.350> about<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.310> year<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.699> half<00:00:23.820> ago

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
wheels I did about a year and a half ago

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.420 
wheels I did about a year and a half ago
they<00:00:24.449> had<00:00:24.600> all<00:00:24.689> held<00:00:25.080> up<00:00:25.199> very<00:00:25.260> well<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:26.400> I

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
they had all held up very well but I

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.750 
they had all held up very well but I
sold<00:00:27.119> my<00:00:27.359> 350z<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> am<00:00:29.220> selling<00:00:29.640> these

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
sold my 350z and so I am selling these

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.069 
sold my 350z and so I am selling these
wheels<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:32.130> thing<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.570> if<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.870> don't

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
wheels the thing is is that if you don't

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.350 
wheels the thing is is that if you don't
put<00:00:34.320> enough<00:00:34.350> coats<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.280> gets<00:00:35.640> very<00:00:35.700> very

put enough coats on it gets very very

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.000 
put enough coats on it gets very very
hard<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.809> pull<00:00:36.989> off<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.350> comes<00:00:37.559> off<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.950> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
hard to pull off it comes off in a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
hard to pull off it comes off in a
million<00:00:38.309> little<00:00:38.430> pieces<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:40.079> on

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
million little pieces as you can see on

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.950 
million little pieces as you can see on
that<00:00:40.320> tail<00:00:40.559> below<00:00:41.480> I've<00:00:42.480> got<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> wheel

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
that tail below I've got the wheel

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.930 
that tail below I've got the wheel
propped<00:00:43.320> up<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> trash<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.760> just

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
propped up on a trash can so I can just

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.990 
propped up on a trash can so I can just
throw<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.329> stuff<00:00:45.570> down<00:00:46.219> the<00:00:47.219> outer<00:00:47.399> coating<00:00:47.789> I

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
throw the stuff down the outer coating I

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.110 
throw the stuff down the outer coating I
put<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> thicker<00:00:49.140> coat<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.969> can

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
put a thicker coat on and so as you can

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.279 
put a thicker coat on and so as you can
see<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.750> easier<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:53.309> pull<00:00:53.879> off<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.840> once<00:00:55.110> I

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
see it's easier to pull off but once I

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.270 
see it's easier to pull off but once I
get<00:00:55.469> into<00:00:55.739> crevices<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:58.280> it'll

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
get into crevices like this it'll

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.520 
get into crevices like this it'll
definitely<00:00:59.640> break<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:00.570> I'll<00:01:01.050> need<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
definitely break and then I'll need to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.450 
definitely break and then I'll need to
use<00:01:01.980> something<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.489> get<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.809> um<00:01:04.460> what

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
use something to get it all but um what

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.820 
use something to get it all but um what
I've<00:01:05.610> been<00:01:05.790> using<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.510> well<00:01:06.960> what<00:01:07.619> I've<00:01:07.740> been

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
I've been using is well what I've been

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.000 
I've been using is well what I've been
doing<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.780> first<00:01:09.780> I'll<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.500> ahead<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.799> peel

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
doing is first I'll go ahead and peel

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.010 
doing is first I'll go ahead and peel
off<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> large<00:01:12.150> portions<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:12.900> is

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
off what I can a large portions which is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.750 
off what I can a large portions which is
pretty<00:01:13.260> much<00:01:13.380> anything<00:01:13.650> around<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.250> outer

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
pretty much anything around this outer

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.630 
pretty much anything around this outer
edge<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.950> some<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.130> stuff<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
edge here some of the stuff in the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.429 
edge here some of the stuff in the
center<00:01:17.939> will<00:01:18.060> come<00:01:18.270> off<00:01:18.479> unless<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.990> has<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> ton

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
center will come off unless it has a ton

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.840 
center will come off unless it has a ton
of<00:01:19.470> brake<00:01:19.740> dust<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.610> kind<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
of brake dust on it then it kind of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.170 
of brake dust on it then it kind of
melts<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> wheel<00:01:22.670> but<00:01:23.670> I've<00:01:23.970> been

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
melts to the to the wheel but I've been

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.149 
melts to the to the wheel but I've been
using<00:01:24.619> this<00:01:25.619> goo<00:01:26.369> gun<00:01:26.630> spray<00:01:27.630> gel<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
using this goo gun spray gel and I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.399 
using this goo gun spray gel and I
checked<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.850> their<00:01:30.030> website<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.720> they<00:01:31.200> say

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
checked on their website and they say

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.859 
checked on their website and they say
that<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.799> safe<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.250> paint<00:01:32.640> I've<00:01:33.180> used<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.750> on

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
that it is safe on paint I've used it on

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.929 
that it is safe on paint I've used it on
all<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.229> these<00:01:34.619> wheels<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.189> far<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.820> can

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
all of these wheels so far as you can

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.910 
all of these wheels so far as you can
see<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> was<00:01:36.270> able<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.720> everything<00:01:37.110> off<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
see I was able to get everything off of

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.929 
see I was able to get everything off of
them<00:01:38.460> they<00:01:39.030> look<00:01:39.680> pretty<00:01:40.680> good<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.909> fact

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
them they look pretty good and in fact

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.969 
them they look pretty good and in fact
this<00:01:42.420> stuff<00:01:42.720> protected<00:01:43.290> these<00:01:43.380> wheels<00:01:43.680> better

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
this stuff protected these wheels better

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.850 
this stuff protected these wheels better
than<00:01:44.220> anything<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:45.090> could<00:01:45.540> ever<00:01:45.630> think<00:01:45.990> would

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.569 
idea here so you can see I'm pulling
this<00:01:59.670> off<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.780> breaking<00:02:01.020> away

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
this off and it's just breaking away

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.609 
this off and it's just breaking away
it's<00:02:02.579> not<00:02:02.790> coming<00:02:03.210> off<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:03.899> piece<00:02:03.930> doesn't

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it's not coming off in one piece doesn't

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.429 
it's not coming off in one piece doesn't
matter<00:02:04.890> how<00:02:05.070> slow<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.689> try<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.960> pull<00:02:07.290> it

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
matter how slow that I try to pull it

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.800 
matter how slow that I try to pull it
and<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.729> because<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> didn't<00:02:09.479> put<00:02:09.569> enough

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
and that is because I didn't put enough

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.449 
and that is because I didn't put enough
fruits<00:02:10.050> on<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.590> I'm<00:02:10.649> sure<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.190> there's<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
fruits on and I'm sure that there's a

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.040 
fruits on and I'm sure that there's a
lot<00:02:11.760> of

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
lot of

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.930 
lot of
people<00:02:12.410> out<00:02:12.500> there<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.460> have<00:02:13.580> done<00:02:13.610> the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
people out there that have done the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.360 
people out there that have done the
exact<00:02:14.360> same<00:02:14.390> thing<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.290> think<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.770> recommended

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
exact same thing I think the recommended

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.960 
exact same thing I think the recommended
amount<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.760> coding<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.920> for<00:02:18.920> four<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.760> five

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
amount of coding is for four to five

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.880 
amount of coding is for four to five
coats<00:02:20.390> or<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:23.080> court<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.200> come<00:02:24.380> off<00:02:24.590> right

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
coats or it to court to come off right

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.090 
coats or it to court to come off right
so<00:02:25.730> I'm<00:02:26.720> going<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.900> go<00:02:27.080> ahead<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.740> show<00:02:28.040> you

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
so I'm going to go ahead and show you

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.440 
so I'm going to go ahead and show you
exactly<00:02:29.080> what<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.290> GU<00:02:30.590> GaN<00:02:30.830> stuff<00:02:31.280> does<00:02:31.760> or

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.470 

that<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:36.020> basically<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:36.890> melts<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.400> melts<00:02:38.360> it

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
that it basically just melts it melts it

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.450 
that it basically just melts it melts it
away<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.960> I'll<00:02:39.170> do<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.380> little<00:02:39.680> little

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
away and I'll do a little little

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.040 
away and I'll do a little little
sections<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.510> guys<00:02:41.690> can<00:02:41.990> see<00:02:42.320> it<00:02:44.050> okay

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
sections that you guys can see it okay

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.480 
sections that you guys can see it okay
I'm<00:02:45.410> just<00:02:45.560> going<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.860> get<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:45.980> out<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.430> the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
I'm just going to get that out of the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:55.390 
I'm just going to get that out of the
way<00:02:46.640> here<00:02:49.180> okay<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:52.510> we've<00:02:53.510> got<00:02:53.540> our<00:02:54.190> goo<00:02:55.190> gone

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
way here okay so we've got our goo gone

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.540 
way here okay so we've got our goo gone
and<00:02:56.330> I'm<00:02:56.480> just<00:02:56.690> going<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.870> spray<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.710> little<00:02:58.430> bit

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
and I'm just going to spray a little bit

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.200 
and I'm just going to spray a little bit
right<00:02:58.910> here<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.400> want<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.640> do<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.790> whole<00:03:02.000> lot

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
right here and I want to do a whole lot

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.850 
right here and I want to do a whole lot
on<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:02.570> because<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.080> front<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.470> these<00:03:03.560> do

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
on this because the front of these do

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.160 
on this because the front of these do
come<00:03:03.890> off<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.610> in<00:03:04.760> one<00:03:05.390> piece<00:03:05.630> it's<00:03:05.870> really

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
come off and in one piece it's really

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.960 
come off and in one piece it's really
the<00:03:06.350> back<00:03:06.740> and<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.070> corners<00:03:07.460> that<00:03:07.490> I<00:03:07.730> have<00:03:07.820> to

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
the back and the corners that I have to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.100 
the back and the corners that I have to
worry<00:03:08.150> about<00:03:08.440> okay<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:10.780> spray<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.810> little<00:03:11.960> bit

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
worry about okay so spray a little bit

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.310 
worry about okay so spray a little bit
on<00:03:12.290> there<00:03:13.240> make<00:03:14.240> sure<00:03:14.270> it<00:03:14.510> doesn't<00:03:14.660> drip

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
on there make sure it doesn't drip

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.729 
on there make sure it doesn't drip
everywhere<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:16.070> so<00:03:17.030> I'll<00:03:17.720> just<00:03:17.870> let<00:03:18.050> that<00:03:18.260> sit

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
everywhere and so I'll just let that sit

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.290 
everywhere and so I'll just let that sit
like<00:03:19.010> that<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.489> can<00:03:19.610> see<00:03:19.790> where<00:03:19.940> it's<00:03:20.060> kind<00:03:20.239> of

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
like that you can see where it's kind of

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.530 
like that you can see where it's kind of
glassy<00:03:21.310> I'll<00:03:22.310> let<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.610> sit<00:03:22.820> like<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.000> for<00:03:23.480> a

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
glassy I'll let it sit like that for a

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.930 
glassy I'll let it sit like that for a
couple<00:03:23.870> of<00:03:23.930> minutes<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.310> got<00:03:25.489> some<00:03:25.700> over

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
couple of minutes and I got some over

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.080 
couple of minutes and I got some over
here<00:03:25.970> too

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
here too

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.240 
here too
so<00:03:29.090> you'll<00:03:29.660> just<00:03:29.690> let<00:03:30.050> it<00:03:30.200> sit<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.830> what<00:03:31.010> it'll

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
so you'll just let it sit and what it'll

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.020 
so you'll just let it sit and what it'll
do<00:03:31.520> is<00:03:31.550> if<00:03:32.300> you<00:03:32.450> let<00:03:32.660> it<00:03:32.690> sit<00:03:32.870> long<00:03:33.620> enough<00:03:34.030> just

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
do is if you let it sit long enough just

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.550 
do is if you let it sit long enough just
a<00:03:35.150> couple<00:03:35.360> of<00:03:35.540> minutes<00:03:35.690> you<00:03:36.140> just<00:03:36.350> want<00:03:36.530> to

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
a couple of minutes you just want to

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.970 
a couple of minutes you just want to
light<00:03:36.770> coating<00:03:37.130> of<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.489> on<00:03:37.610> there<00:03:37.850> unless<00:03:38.420> it's

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
light coating of it on there unless it's

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.840 
light coating of it on there unless it's
something<00:03:39.980> you're<00:03:40.130> really<00:03:40.280> having<00:03:40.700> trouble

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
something you're really having trouble

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.449 
something you're really having trouble
with<00:03:41.410> so<00:03:42.410> let<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.709> sit<00:03:42.890> for<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:43.070> couple<00:03:43.130> minutes

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
with so let it sit for a couple minutes

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.330 
with so let it sit for a couple minutes
and<00:03:43.850> it'll<00:03:44.300> do<00:03:44.660> its<00:03:44.840> magic<00:03:45.080> and<00:03:45.560> then<00:03:45.980> we'll<00:03:46.190> be

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
and it'll do its magic and then we'll be

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.280 
and it'll do its magic and then we'll be
able<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.640> just<00:03:46.910> go<00:03:47.030> ahead<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.300> and<00:03:47.900> pull<00:03:48.170> it

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
able to just go ahead and and pull it

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.729 
able to just go ahead and and pull it
right<00:03:48.470> off<00:03:49.450> but<00:03:50.450> like<00:03:50.570> I<00:03:50.750> said<00:03:50.810> it<00:03:51.110> melts<00:03:51.500> and

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
right off but like I said it melts and

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.420 
right off but like I said it melts and
I've<00:03:52.700> gone<00:03:53.030> through<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.480> number<00:03:53.600> of<00:03:53.900> rags

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
I've gone through a number of rags

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.550 
I've gone through a number of rags
here's<00:03:55.430> one<00:03:55.820> that<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.270> just<00:03:56.660> started<00:03:56.900> with<00:03:57.290> and

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
here's one that I just started with and

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.610 
here's one that I just started with and
look<00:03:58.250> how<00:03:58.400> dirty<00:03:58.700> they<00:03:58.940> get<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.360> I've<00:04:00.350> got<00:04:00.590> a

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
look how dirty they get and I've got a

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.949 
look how dirty they get and I've got a
ton<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.040> these<00:04:01.280> things<00:04:01.610> I've<00:04:02.000> gone<00:04:02.270> through<00:04:02.690> I

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
ton of these things I've gone through I

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.380 
ton of these things I've gone through I
don't<00:04:03.320> know<00:04:03.560> how<00:04:03.770> many<00:04:03.830> probably<00:04:04.640> eight<00:04:04.910> rags

wheels that I've already done mm-hmm so

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.410 
wheels that I've already done mm-hmm so
anyway<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.310> reason<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:13.880> want<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.209> rag

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
is number one you don't want to get this

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.830 
is number one you don't want to get this
stuff<00:04:16.549> all<00:04:16.730> over<00:04:16.760> your<00:04:17.120> skin<00:04:17.480> I'm<00:04:17.600> sure<00:04:17.930> but

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
stuff all over your skin I'm sure but

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.800 
stuff all over your skin I'm sure but
let<00:04:20.840> me

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
let me

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:33.800 
let me
you<00:04:22.290> know<00:04:22.410> rag<00:04:22.620> here<00:04:23.070> alright<00:04:23.880> so<00:04:30.380> okay<00:04:32.810> there

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
you know rag here alright so okay there

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.800 
you know rag here alright so okay there
it<00:04:33.990> is<00:04:34.760> see<00:04:35.760> how<00:04:35.850> it's<00:04:36.000> starting<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.360> peel<00:04:36.600> off

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
it is see how it's starting to peel off

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.159 
it is see how it's starting to peel off
and<00:04:37.110> it<00:04:38.040> really<00:04:38.490> softens<00:04:38.820> it<00:04:39.240> up<00:04:39.360> really<00:04:40.020> well

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
and it really softens it up really well

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.460 
and it really softens it up really well
and<00:04:40.530> again<00:04:41.160> this<00:04:41.490> works<00:04:41.730> best<00:04:42.240> for<00:04:42.450> edges<00:04:43.260> and

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
and again this works best for edges and

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.740 
and again this works best for edges and
corners<00:04:43.950> but<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.760> gets<00:04:45.000> it<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.330> where<00:04:45.480> you<00:04:45.600> can

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
corners but it gets it to where you can

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.440 
corners but it gets it to where you can
just<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:46.230> mean<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:47.040> softens<00:04:47.700> it<00:04:47.820> up<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:48.210> much

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
just I mean it softens it up so much

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.810 
just I mean it softens it up so much
even<00:04:48.840> if<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:49.050> wanted<00:04:49.320> to<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:50.010> fall<00:04:50.340> off<00:04:50.550> now

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
even if you wanted to you fall off now

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.940 
even if you wanted to you fall off now
you<00:04:51.180> notice<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.750> whenever<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.290> sprayed<00:04:52.680> it<00:04:52.830> on

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
you notice that whenever I sprayed it on

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.760 
you notice that whenever I sprayed it on
I<00:04:53.250> wiped<00:04:53.669> it<00:04:53.850> down<00:04:53.910> and<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:55.050> reason<00:04:55.440> for<00:04:55.470> that

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
I wiped it down and the reason for that

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.220 
I wiped it down and the reason for that
is<00:04:56.130> is<00:04:56.310> because<00:04:56.490> if<00:04:56.820> you<00:04:56.970> leave<00:04:57.240> a<00:04:57.300> shuttle<00:04:58.080> of

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
is is because if you leave a shuttle of

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.500 
is is because if you leave a shuttle of
it<00:04:58.350> on<00:04:58.560> there<00:04:58.950> it's<00:04:59.490> going<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.790> melt<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:00.330> an

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
it on there it's going to melt it an

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.630 
it on there it's going to melt it an
insistence<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:01.350> makes<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:01.740> huge<00:05:02.010> mess<00:05:02.280> and<00:05:02.340> then

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
insistence it makes a huge mess and then

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.430 
insistence it makes a huge mess and then
you<00:05:02.760> got<00:05:02.910> to<00:05:03.000> spray<00:05:03.270> more<00:05:03.510> goo<00:05:03.870> gone<00:05:04.080> on<00:05:04.320> the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
you got to spray more goo gone on the

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.470 
you got to spray more goo gone on the
wheel<00:05:04.620> just<00:05:05.220> to<00:05:05.340> clean<00:05:05.580> off<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:05.790> melted

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
wheel just to clean off the melted

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.390 
wheel just to clean off the melted
portion<00:05:06.930> that<00:05:07.080> got<00:05:07.230> on<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.500> wheel<00:05:07.650> none<00:05:08.250> of

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
portion that got on the wheel none of

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.250

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
you can see and you know for edges like

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.610 
you can see and you know for edges like
like<00:06:17.250> this<00:06:17.520> that<00:06:17.820> came<00:06:18.030> off<00:06:18.240> pretty<00:06:18.570> clean<00:06:18.930> I

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
like this that came off pretty clean I

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.159 
like this that came off pretty clean I
usually<00:06:20.430> it<00:06:21.030> wasn't<00:06:21.510> coming<00:06:21.750> off<00:06:21.930> the<00:06:22.110> screen

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
usually it wasn't coming off the screen

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.860 
usually it wasn't coming off the screen
like<00:06:22.890> this<00:06:23.160> look<00:06:23.370> piece<00:06:23.580> back<00:06:23.880> here<00:06:23.910> get<00:06:24.510> stuck

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
like this look piece back here get stuck

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.110 
like this look piece back here get stuck
and<00:06:25.140> what<00:06:25.860> I<00:06:25.919> would<00:06:26.010> have<00:06:26.220> to<00:06:26.280> do<00:06:26.640> is<00:06:26.850> use<00:06:27.090> some

and what I would have to do is use some

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.330 
and what I would have to do is use some
needle<00:06:27.720> nose<00:06:27.900> pliers<00:06:28.289> that<00:06:28.470> are<00:06:28.770> wrapped<00:06:29.039> in

needle nose pliers that are wrapped in
electrical<00:06:29.760> tape<00:06:30.240> and<00:06:30.510> then<00:06:31.080> I'll<00:06:31.229> wrap

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
electrical tape and then I'll wrap

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.120 
electrical tape and then I'll wrap
the<00:06:33.430> head<00:06:34.180> of<00:06:34.360> the<00:06:34.540> screwdriver<00:06:35.410> or<00:06:35.740> I'm<00:06:35.890> sorry

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
the head of the screwdriver or I'm sorry

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.760 
the head of the screwdriver or I'm sorry
screw<00:06:36.430> Chuck<00:06:36.580> the<00:06:37.560> pliers

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
screw Chuck the pliers

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.280 
screw Chuck the pliers
in<00:06:38.980> the<00:06:39.520> towel<00:06:39.790> one<00:06:40.450> coating<00:06:40.900> in<00:06:40.990> the<00:06:41.080> towel

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
in the towel one coating in the towel

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.440 
in the towel one coating in the towel
and<00:06:41.590> then<00:06:42.040> I'll<00:06:42.160> just<00:06:42.370> rub<00:06:42.700> it<00:06:42.730> up<00:06:42.970> against

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
and then I'll just rub it up against

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.300 
and then I'll just rub it up against
this<00:06:43.630> that<00:06:44.020> way<00:06:44.200> I<00:06:44.440> have<00:06:44.620> the<00:06:44.680> electrical<00:06:45.100> tape

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
this that way I have the electrical tape

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.430 
this that way I have the electrical tape
on<00:06:45.550> there<00:06:45.730> in<00:06:45.820> case<00:06:45.970> the<00:06:46.120> pokes<00:06:46.390> through<00:06:46.720> and

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
on there in case the pokes through and

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.400 
on there in case the pokes through and
so<00:06:47.590> that<00:06:47.740> it<00:06:47.830> doesn't<00:06:48.130> scratch<00:06:48.840> but<00:06:49.840> that's<00:06:50.140> my

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
so that it doesn't scratch but that's my

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.410 
so that it doesn't scratch but that's my
method<00:06:50.650> and<00:06:51.010> then<00:06:51.130> I<00:06:51.160> would<00:06:51.400> just<00:06:51.430> have<00:06:52.120> the

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
method and then I would just have the

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.210 
method and then I would just have the
towel<00:06:52.660> covering<00:06:53.020> it<00:06:53.350> and<00:06:53.470> rub<00:06:53.680> it<00:06:53.800> back<00:06:53.980> and

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
towel covering it and rub it back and

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.740 
towel covering it and rub it back and
forth<00:06:54.460> after<00:06:54.820> I've<00:06:54.940> sprayed<00:06:55.240> the<00:06:55.360> glue<00:06:55.480> gun<00:06:55.690> on

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
forth after I've sprayed the glue gun on

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.610 
forth after I've sprayed the glue gun on
it<00:06:56.130> so<00:06:57.390> that's<00:06:58.390> the<00:06:58.600> video<00:06:58.900> if<00:06:59.140> you<00:06:59.230> have<00:06:59.440> any

questions let me know because this stuff

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.600 
questions let me know because this stuff
can<00:07:02.050> really<00:07:02.080> be<00:07:02.470> a<00:07:02.500> pain<00:07:02.740> to<00:07:02.800> get<00:07:03.040> off<00:07:03.190> and

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
can really be a pain to get off and

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.730 
can really be a pain to get off and
there<00:07:04.330> are<00:07:04.450> tricks<00:07:04.840> here

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
there are tricks here

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.890 
there are tricks here
the<00:07:06.130> other<00:07:06.340> trick<00:07:06.760> which<00:07:07.390> is<00:07:07.570> what<00:07:07.720> I<00:07:07.750> was

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
the other trick which is what I was

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.570 
the other trick which is what I was
going<00:07:08.230> to<00:07:08.260> try<00:07:08.590> because<00:07:08.890> I<00:07:09.040> have<00:07:09.310> a<00:07:09.340> couple

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580 
going to try because I have a couple

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.060 
going to try because I have a couple
extra<00:07:10.060> cans<00:07:10.270> of<00:07:10.420> plastidip<00:07:10.930> the<00:07:11.560> other<00:07:11.680> trick

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 
extra cans of plastidip the other trick

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.420 
extra cans of plastidip the other trick
is<00:07:12.940> to<00:07:13.540> spray<00:07:13.960> more<00:07:14.170> plastic<00:07:14.710> tip<00:07:14.860> on<00:07:15.040> because

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430 
is to spray more plastic tip on because

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.630 
is to spray more plastic tip on because
it<00:07:15.580> will<00:07:15.760> bond<00:07:16.060> to<00:07:16.710> the<00:07:17.710> previous<00:07:18.220> coating

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.640 
it will bond to the previous coating

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.730 
it will bond to the previous coating
even<00:07:19.180> it<00:07:19.330> doesn't<00:07:19.630> matter<00:07:19.900> how<00:07:20.020> old<00:07:20.080> it<00:07:20.410> is<00:07:20.530> and

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740 
even it doesn't matter how old it is and

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.890 
even it doesn't matter how old it is and
I<00:07:21.130> know<00:07:21.190> that<00:07:21.460> because<00:07:21.700> I've<00:07:22.090> put<00:07:22.330> multiple

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:22.900 
I know that because I've put multiple

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.440 
I know that because I've put multiple
coating<00:07:23.410> on<00:07:23.620> these<00:07:24.100> wheels<00:07:24.340> just<00:07:24.640> as<00:07:24.790> a<00:07:24.820> just

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.450 
coating on these wheels just as a just

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.460 
coating on these wheels just as a just
for<00:07:25.630> touch<00:07:25.870> up<00:07:26.080> over<00:07:26.470> the<00:07:26.950> past<00:07:27.220> year<00:07:27.580> and<00:07:28.470> it

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470 
for touch up over the past year and it

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.740 
for touch up over the past year and it
always<00:07:29.680> stuck<00:07:30.070> on<00:07:30.400> and<00:07:30.640> blended<00:07:31.000> in<00:07:31.120> fine<00:07:31.360> so

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:31.750 
always stuck on and blended in fine so

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.570 
always stuck on and blended in fine so
that's<00:07:32.290> the<00:07:32.560> other<00:07:32.680> way<00:07:32.800> to<00:07:32.920> do<00:07:33.220> it<00:07:33.370> if<00:07:33.460> you

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:33.580 
that's the other way to do it if you

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.920 
that's the other way to do it if you
have<00:07:33.730> some<00:07:33.760> extra<00:07:34.210> Plasti<00:07:34.720> Dip

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
have some extra Plasti Dip

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.850 
have some extra Plasti Dip
you<00:07:35.200> can<00:07:35.580> spray<00:07:36.580> those<00:07:36.820> those<00:07:37.150> corners<00:07:37.860> wait

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:38.860 
you can spray those those corners wait

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.850 
you can spray those those corners wait
for<00:07:39.100> it<00:07:39.160> to<00:07:39.280> dry<00:07:39.490> and<00:07:39.520> then<00:07:39.790> pull<00:07:40.060> it<00:07:40.240> off<00:07:40.390> and

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 
for it to dry and then pull it off and

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.690 
for it to dry and then pull it off and
you<00:07:41.860> should<00:07:42.070> be<00:07:42.190> able<00:07:42.250> to<00:07:42.370> get<00:07:42.460> a<00:07:42.520> better

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:42.700 
you should be able to get a better

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.910 
you should be able to get a better
handle<00:07:43.060> on<00:07:43.180> it<00:07:43.330> it<00:07:43.390> won't<00:07:43.510> break<00:07:43.750> apart<00:07:44.140> but<00:07:44.680> um

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:44.920 
handle on it it won't break apart but um

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.570 
handle on it it won't break apart but um
