tutorial<00:00:04.870> on<00:00:05.080> CPU<00:00:05.830> scheduling<00:00:06.100> in<00:00:06.490> this

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.180 
tutorial on CPU scheduling in this

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.810 
tutorial on CPU scheduling in this
tutorial<00:00:07.469> we<00:00:08.469> will<00:00:08.500> be<00:00:08.799> learning<00:00:09.009> the<00:00:09.219> concept

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
tutorial we will be learning the concept

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.159 
tutorial we will be learning the concept
of<00:00:10.030> NP<00:00:10.660> sjf<00:00:11.230> NP<00:00:11.920> is<00:00:12.099> non-preemptive

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:13.169 
of NP sjf NP is non-preemptive

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.560 
of NP sjf NP is non-preemptive
basically<00:00:14.169> SJ<00:00:15.040> f<00:00:15.160> stands<00:00:15.519> for<00:00:15.639> shortest<00:00:16.360> job

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
basically SJ f stands for shortest job

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.380 
basically SJ f stands for shortest job
first<00:00:17.110> and<00:00:17.440> this<00:00:18.100> algorithm<00:00:18.460> has<00:00:18.970> two

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
first and this algorithm has two

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.050 
first and this algorithm has two
versions<00:00:19.740> here<00:00:20.740> we<00:00:20.980> will<00:00:21.160> discussing<00:00:21.580> one<00:00:22.030> of

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
versions here we will discussing one of

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.210 
versions here we will discussing one of
the<00:00:22.300> versions<00:00:22.480> which<00:00:22.960> is<00:00:23.220> non-preemptive

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
the versions which is non-preemptive

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.500 
the versions which is non-preemptive
shortest<00:00:24.970> job<00:00:25.060> first

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
shortest job first

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.900 
shortest job first
now<00:00:28.510> the<00:00:29.500> non-preemptive<00:00:30.250> version<00:00:30.790> of

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
now the non-preemptive version of

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.779 
now the non-preemptive version of
shortest<00:00:31.540> off<00:00:31.810> first<00:00:32.169> is<00:00:32.589> also<00:00:33.250> called<00:00:33.519> as<00:00:33.730> the

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
shortest off first is also called as the

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.400 
shortest off first is also called as the
shortest<00:00:34.719> process<00:00:35.289> next<00:00:36.480> now<00:00:37.480> here<00:00:37.899> the

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
shortest process next now here the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.759 
shortest process next now here the
criteria<00:00:38.980> is<00:00:39.280> birth<00:00:39.879> time<00:00:40.149> that<00:00:40.749> is<00:00:40.989> execution

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
criteria is birth time that is execution

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.130 
criteria is birth time that is execution
time<00:00:42.010> so<00:00:42.730> what<00:00:42.969> here<00:00:43.210> we<00:00:43.420> have<00:00:43.510> to<00:00:43.660> do<00:00:43.780> is<00:00:43.929> that

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
time so what here we have to do is that

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.250 
time so what here we have to do is that
we<00:00:44.800> have<00:00:44.829> to<00:00:45.100> select<00:00:45.339> the<00:00:45.579> process<00:00:45.969> with<00:00:46.839> least

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
we have to select the process with least

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.700 
we have to select the process with least
birth<00:00:48.010> time<00:00:48.429> value<00:00:48.969> that<00:00:49.719> is<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.289> process

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
birth time value that is the process

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.040 
birth time value that is the process
which<00:00:50.980> has<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.429> least<00:00:51.969> worst<00:00:52.269> time<00:00:52.510> value<00:00:52.870> is

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
which has the least worst time value is

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.009 
which has the least worst time value is
selected<00:00:53.559> for<00:00:54.069> execution<00:00:54.819> and<00:00:54.969> in<00:00:55.539> this<00:00:55.719> way

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
selected for execution and in this way

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.649

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
let us look at the Gantt chart

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.600 
let us look at the Gantt chart
now<00:02:01.470> at<00:02:01.740> zero<00:02:02.700> at<00:02:02.850> time<00:02:03.590> process<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.460> is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
now at zero at time process one that is

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.290 
now at zero at time process one that is
p1<00:02:06.000> arrives<00:02:06.800> therefore<00:02:07.800> we<00:02:08.310> will<00:02:08.460> schedule<00:02:08.700> p1

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
p1 arrives therefore we will schedule p1

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.410 
p1 arrives therefore we will schedule p1
and<00:02:09.450> complete<00:02:10.140> its<00:02:10.410> execution<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.850> now<00:02:11.970> P<00:02:12.240> one

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
and complete its execution so now P one

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.680 
and complete its execution so now P one
is<00:02:12.540> completed<00:02:13.460> entirely<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.850> now<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.510> has

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
is completed entirely and now it has

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.530 
is completed entirely and now it has
zero<00:02:16.020> units<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.500> time<00:02:16.710> left

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
zero units of time left

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.440 
zero units of time left
next<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:19.110> see<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.470> till<00:02:19.800> time<00:02:20.070> unit<00:02:20.460> 3<00:02:20.700> two

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
next we see that till time unit 3 two

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.690 
next we see that till time unit 3 two
more<00:02:21.480> process<00:02:22.110> arrived<00:02:22.470> at<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.770> system<00:02:23.160> with

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
more process arrived at the system with

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.130 
more process arrived at the system with
value<00:02:24.560> for<00:02:25.560> n<00:02:25.800> 2<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.880> by<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.150> algorithm<00:02:27.900> we

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
value for n 2 so by this algorithm we

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.110 
value for n 2 so by this algorithm we
have<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.530> select<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.950> process<00:02:29.520> with<00:02:29.790> least

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
have to select the process with least

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.480 
have to select the process with least
worst<00:02:30.420> time<00:02:30.660> value<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:32.130> will<00:02:32.310> select

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
worst time value so we will select

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.370 
worst time value so we will select
process<00:02:32.850> 3<00:02:33.270> for<00:02:33.510> execution

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
process 3 for execution

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.040 
process 3 for execution
that<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.040> why<00:02:35.250> process<00:02:35.970> 3<00:02:36.210> is<00:02:36.390> selected<00:02:36.840> and

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
that is why process 3 is selected and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.360 
that is why process 3 is selected and
its<00:02:37.200> execution<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:38.010> completed<00:02:39.110> after<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.370> we

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
its execution is completed after this we

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.780 
its execution is completed after this we
will<00:02:41.400> see<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:42.060> till<00:02:42.840> time<00:02:43.320> unit<00:02:43.650> 5<00:02:43.890> one<00:02:44.550> more

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
will see that till time unit 5 one more

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.540 
will see that till time unit 5 one more
process<00:02:45.000> arrives<00:02:45.540> at<00:02:45.810> time<00:02:46.110> minute<00:02:46.350> 4<00:02:46.620> with<00:02:47.520> a

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
process arrives at time minute 4 with a

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.880 
process arrives at time minute 4 with a
worse<00:02:47.880> time<00:02:47.910> value<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.630> 1<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.260> again<00:02:49.470> by<00:02:49.830> this

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
worse time value of 1 so again by this

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.100 
worse time value of 1 so again by this
algorithm<00:02:50.550> we<00:02:51.120> will<00:02:51.300> select<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.750> process

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
algorithm we will select the process

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.620 
algorithm we will select the process
with<00:02:52.590> these<00:02:52.890> births<00:02:53.160> time<00:02:53.400> value<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.270> among

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
with these births time value so among

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.510 
with these births time value so among
these<00:02:54.990> two<00:02:55.290> process<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:55.980> process<00:02:56.340> P<00:02:56.490> 2

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
these two process that is process P 2

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.020 
these two process that is process P 2
and<00:02:56.790> P<00:02:56.880> 4<00:02:57.210> P<00:02:57.420> 4<00:02:58.260> has<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.010> least<00:02:59.250> births<00:02:59.790> time

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
and P 4 P 4 has the least births time

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.530 
and P 4 P 4 has the least births time
value<00:03:00.390> therefore<00:03:00.960> P<00:03:01.350> 4<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.740> selected<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:03.390> is

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
value therefore P 4 is selected it is

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.500 
value therefore P 4 is selected it is
selected<00:03:03.960> and<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.560> executed<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.700> now<00:03:06.209> it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
selected and it is executed so now it

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.860 
selected and it is executed so now it
has<00:03:06.540> 0<00:03:06.930> units<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.320> time<00:03:07.530> left

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
has 0 units of time left

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.070 
has 0 units of time left
similarly<00:03:09.870> till<00:03:10.650> 6<00:03:10.950> unit<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.340> time<00:03:11.550> again

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
similarly till 6 unit of time again

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.140 
similarly till 6 unit of time again
pre-process<00:03:13.080> p<00:03:13.290> 5<00:03:13.500> arrives<00:03:13.860> with<00:03:14.610> births<00:03:14.880> time

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
pre-process p 5 arrives with births time

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.680 
pre-process p 5 arrives with births time
value<00:03:15.810> s<00:03:15.959> 2<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.530> now<00:03:16.650> between<00:03:17.040> 5<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.580> 2<00:03:17.880> we<00:03:18.540> can

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
value s 2 so now between 5 and 2 we can

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.520 
value s 2 so now between 5 and 2 we can
see<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:19.080> process<00:03:19.470> p<00:03:19.709> 5<00:03:20.040> has<00:03:20.670> burst<00:03:21.120> time

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
see that process p 5 has burst time

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.740 
see that process p 5 has burst time
these<00:03:22.530> births<00:03:22.830> time<00:03:23.070> value<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:24.150> 2<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.540> less

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
these births time value this 2 is less

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.780 
these births time value this 2 is less
than<00:03:24.959> 4<00:03:25.200> therefore<00:03:25.500> P<00:03:25.800> 5<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.190> scheduled<00:03:26.580> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
than 4 therefore P 5 is scheduled and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.330 
than 4 therefore P 5 is scheduled and
its<00:03:27.270> execution<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:28.080> completed<00:03:28.970> now<00:03:30.680> till<00:03:31.680> time

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
its execution is completed now till time

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.760 
its execution is completed now till time
unit<00:03:32.670> 8<00:03:32.910> we<00:03:33.330> will<00:03:33.480> see<00:03:33.720> we<00:03:34.230> can<00:03:34.380> see<00:03:34.560> that

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
unit 8 we will see we can see that

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.420 
unit 8 we will see we can see that
process<00:03:35.130> P<00:03:35.370> 6<00:03:35.610> arrives<00:03:35.910> now<00:03:37.130> we<00:03:38.130> have<00:03:38.280> to

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
process P 6 arrives now we have to

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.250 
process P 6 arrives now we have to
reduce<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.910> process<00:03:39.300> with<00:03:39.570> least<00:03:39.900> births

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
reduce the process with least births

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.350 
reduce the process with least births
time<00:03:40.500> value<00:03:40.860> therefore<00:03:41.400> we<00:03:41.820> will<00:03:42.000> shade<00:03:42.239> with

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
time value therefore we will shade with

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.310 
time value therefore we will shade with
P<00:03:42.660> 6<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.160> complete<00:03:44.160> its<00:03:44.459> execution<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.959> now<00:03:46.080> P

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
P 6 and complete its execution so now P

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.600 
P 6 and complete its execution so now P
6<00:03:46.560> completes<00:03:47.190> its<00:03:47.550> execution<00:03:48.590> similarly<00:03:49.590> P<00:03:50.400> 2

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
6 completes its execution similarly P 2

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.350 
6 completes its execution similarly P 2
completes<00:03:51.510> its<00:03:51.750> execution<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:52.650> now<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.640> has<00:03:53.790> 0

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
completes its execution and now it has 0

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.650 
completes its execution and now it has 0
units<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:54.870> time<00:03:55.440> available<00:03:56.090> so<00:03:57.090> we<00:03:57.239> can<00:03:57.420> say

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
units of time available so we can say

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.160 
units of time available so we can say
that<00:03:58.340> since<00:03:59.340> Gantt<00:03:59.820> chart<00:04:00.090> has<00:04:00.330> this<00:04:00.540> value<00:04:00.750> 30

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
that since Gantt chart has this value 30

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.710 
that since Gantt chart has this value 30
90<00:04:01.620> last<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.070> Sigma<00:04:02.550> B<00:04:02.670> T<00:04:02.820> is<00:04:02.970> equal<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.390> 13

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
90 last and Sigma B T is equal to 13

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.500 
90 last and Sigma B T is equal to 13
therefore<00:04:04.620> all<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:05.370> process<00:04:05.760> are<00:04:05.910> completed

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
therefore all the process are completed

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.880 
therefore all the process are completed
and<00:04:06.720> our<00:04:06.989> Gantt<00:04:07.260> chart<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.680> right

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
and our Gantt chart is right

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.000 
and our Gantt chart is right
just<00:04:09.890> now<00:04:10.610> he<00:04:10.670> will<00:04:11.030> find<00:04:11.510> out<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:12.380> value<00:04:12.920> of

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
just now he will find out the value of

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.160 
just now he will find out the value of
alpha<00:04:13.220> alpha<00:04:13.580> stands<00:04:14.240> for<00:04:14.420> shadow<00:04:14.810> length

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
alpha alpha stands for shadow length

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.120 
alpha alpha stands for shadow length
shadow<00:04:16.040> length<00:04:16.370> is<00:04:16.579> equal<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:18.040> maximum<00:04:19.040> of

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
shadow length is equal to maximum of

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.330 
shadow length is equal to maximum of
completion<00:04:19.760> time<00:04:20.030> -<00:04:20.900> minimum<00:04:21.560> of<00:04:21.739> arrival

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
completion time - minimum of arrival

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.030 
completion time - minimum of arrival
time<00:04:22.550> here<00:04:23.360> maximum<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:24.110> completion<00:04:24.680> time<00:04:24.860> is

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
time here maximum of completion time is

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.640 
time here maximum of completion time is
equal<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.370> 13<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.060> arrival<00:04:27.020> time<00:04:27.230> minimum

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
equal to 13 and arrival time minimum

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.860 
equal to 13 and arrival time minimum
arrival<00:04:28.070> time<00:04:28.280> value<00:04:29.000> is<00:04:29.180> equal<00:04:29.480> to<00:04:29.510> 0

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
arrival time value is equal to 0

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.860 
arrival time value is equal to 0
therefore<00:04:30.260> 13<00:04:30.800> minus<00:04:31.130> 0<00:04:31.340> is<00:04:31.490> equal<00:04:31.730> to<00:04:31.760> 13<00:04:32.210> so

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
therefore 13 minus 0 is equal to 13 so

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.560 
therefore 13 minus 0 is equal to 13 so
13<00:04:33.350> is<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.680> value<00:04:33.980> of<00:04:34.010> alpha<00:04:34.370> or<00:04:34.700> here<00:04:35.330> the

13 is the value of alpha or here the

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.980 
13 is the value of alpha or here the

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
shadow length is 13 let us look at the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.080 
shadow length is 13 let us look at the
next<00:04:39.140> question

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
next question

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.730 
next question
here<00:04:41.090> again<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.630> first<00:04:41.900> column<00:04:42.230> denotes<00:04:42.410> the

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
here again the first column denotes the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.470 
here again the first column denotes the
process<00:04:43.130> number<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.669> second<00:04:44.030> column<00:04:44.180> denotes

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
process number the second column denotes

denotes the burst time or execution time

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.810 
denotes the burst time or execution time
again<00:04:50.960> we<00:04:51.080> will<00:04:51.230> find<00:04:51.260> out<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:52.070> Sigma<00:04:52.340> Beauty

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
again we will find out the Sigma Beauty

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.100 
again we will find out the Sigma Beauty
value<00:04:54.040> let<00:04:55.040> us<00:04:55.070> look<00:04:55.310> at<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.610> Gantt<00:04:55.820> chart

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
value let us look at the Gantt chart

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.550 
value let us look at the Gantt chart
firstly<00:04:57.250> we<00:04:58.250> can<00:04:58.430> see<00:04:58.640> that<00:04:59.320> first<00:05:00.320> the

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
firstly we can see that first the

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.180 
firstly we can see that first the
process<00:05:01.040> arrived<00:05:01.490> at<00:05:02.030> time<00:05:02.480> unit<00:05:02.870> 2<00:05:03.110> at<00:05:03.410> time

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
process arrived at time unit 2 at time

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.000 
process arrived at time unit 2 at time
unit<00:05:04.490> 0<00:05:04.850> or<00:05:05.090> 1<00:05:05.360> none<00:05:06.020> of<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.350> process<00:05:06.800> is

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
unit 0 or 1 none of the process is

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.960 
unit 0 or 1 none of the process is
available<00:05:07.820> with<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.120> system<00:05:08.540> so<00:05:08.890> therefore

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
available with the system so therefore

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.200 
available with the system so therefore
between<00:05:10.970> time<00:05:11.630> unit<00:05:11.960> 0<00:05:11.990> and<00:05:12.500> 2<00:05:12.710> CPU<00:05:13.640> is<00:05:13.820> idle

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
between time unit 0 and 2 CPU is idle

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.060 
between time unit 0 and 2 CPU is idle
that<00:05:14.450> is<00:05:14.660> CPU<00:05:15.020> does<00:05:15.200> not<00:05:15.350> do<00:05:15.470> any<00:05:15.650> useful<00:05:15.830> work

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
that is CPU does not do any useful work

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.360 
that is CPU does not do any useful work
therefore<00:05:16.669> we<00:05:17.479> have<00:05:17.630> shaded<00:05:17.900> this<00:05:18.290> box<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:19.160> let

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
therefore we have shaded this box to let

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.060 
therefore we have shaded this box to let
us<00:05:19.490> indicate<00:05:19.790> that<00:05:20.540> here<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.140> CPU<00:05:21.530> is<00:05:21.710> idle

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
us indicate that here the CPU is idle

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.600 
us indicate that here the CPU is idle
and<00:05:22.250> it<00:05:23.030> doesn't<00:05:23.419> do<00:05:23.510> any<00:05:23.690> useful<00:05:24.110> work<00:05:24.610> after

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
and it doesn't do any useful work after

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.880 
and it doesn't do any useful work after
second<00:05:26.000> unit<00:05:26.210> of<00:05:26.240> time<00:05:26.630> it<00:05:27.020> has<00:05:27.080> to<00:05:27.440> select<00:05:27.800> a

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
second unit of time it has to select a

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.390 
second unit of time it has to select a
process<00:05:28.310> between<00:05:28.520> process<00:05:29.300> P<00:05:29.479> 3<00:05:29.510> and<00:05:29.720> P<00:05:29.930> 6<00:05:30.530> by

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
process between process P 3 and P 6 by

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.190 
process between process P 3 and P 6 by
this<00:05:31.640> algorithm<00:05:32.150> we<00:05:32.360> have<00:05:32.450> to<00:05:32.630> select<00:05:32.960> the

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
this algorithm we have to select the

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.650 
this algorithm we have to select the
process<00:05:33.440> with<00:05:33.919> least<00:05:34.490> burst<00:05:35.000> time<00:05:35.300> value

process with least burst time value

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.440 
process with least burst time value
which<00:05:35.900> is<00:05:36.080> process<00:05:36.500> 6<00:05:36.830> therefore<00:05:37.820> P<00:05:38.060> 6<00:05:38.300> is

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
which is process 6 therefore P 6 is

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.250 
which is process 6 therefore P 6 is
selected<00:05:39.020> and<00:05:39.169> its<00:05:39.650> execution<00:05:40.040> is<00:05:40.490> completed

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
selected and its execution is completed

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.950 
selected and its execution is completed
till<00:05:42.260> time<00:05:42.530> minute<00:05:42.860> 6<00:05:43.130> 3<00:05:44.060> more<00:05:44.270> process<00:05:44.690> arrive

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
till time minute 6 3 more process arrive

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.860 
till time minute 6 3 more process arrive
at<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.260> system<00:05:45.620> so<00:05:46.100> now<00:05:46.280> we<00:05:46.340> have<00:05:46.729> for<00:05:47.419> process

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
at the system so now we have for process

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.690 
at the system so now we have for process
in<00:05:48.020> the<00:05:48.169> system<00:05:48.530> remaining<00:05:48.950> for<00:05:49.130> execution

non-preemptive shortage off first we

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.560 
non-preemptive shortage off first we
have<00:05:57.530> to<00:05:57.710> select<00:05:57.890> the<00:05:58.250> process<00:05:58.700> with<00:05:59.030> least

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
have to select the process with least

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.400 
have to select the process with least
burst<00:05:59.930> time<00:06:00.200> value<00:06:00.620> which<00:06:01.400> is<00:06:01.550> process<00:06:01.970> p1<00:06:02.410> so

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
burst time value which is process p1 so

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.600 
burst time value which is process p1 so
we<00:06:03.770> select<00:06:04.370> process<00:06:04.550> p1<00:06:04.910> for<00:06:05.260> execution<00:06:06.260> and

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
complete its execution now one thing to

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.960 
complete its execution now one thing to
be<00:06:56.060> noted<00:06:56.599> here<00:06:57.020> is<00:06:57.169> that<00:06:57.349> here<00:06:58.039> the<00:06:58.280> Gantt

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
be noted here is that here the Gantt

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.930 
be noted here is that here the Gantt
chart<00:06:59.240> has<00:06:59.360> maximum<00:06:59.870> values<00:07:00.200> 23<00:07:00.770> and<00:07:00.979> Sigma<00:07:01.640> B

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
chart has maximum values 23 and Sigma B

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.020 
chart has maximum values 23 and Sigma B
T<00:07:02.120> is<00:07:02.330> equal<00:07:02.870> to<00:07:02.900> 21<00:07:03.530> the<00:07:04.190> difference<00:07:04.700> is

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030 
T is equal to 21 the difference is

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.839 
T is equal to 21 the difference is
simply<00:07:05.450> because<00:07:05.960> of<00:07:06.140> this<00:07:06.470> box<00:07:06.710> that<00:07:07.039> is<00:07:07.220> 2

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:07.849 
simply because of this box that is 2

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:10.420 
simply because of this box that is 2
units<00:07:08.210> of<00:07:08.360> idle<00:07:08.750> time<00:07:08.780> since<00:07:09.530> process<00:07:10.039> arrived

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
units of idle time since process arrived

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.570 
units of idle time since process arrived
at<00:07:10.550> this<00:07:10.760> system<00:07:11.240> at<00:07:11.450> second<00:07:12.289> unit<00:07:12.620> therefore

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
at this system at second unit therefore

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.460 
at this system at second unit therefore
there<00:07:13.849> is<00:07:13.940> a<00:07:13.970> difference<00:07:14.419> of<00:07:14.599> 2<00:07:14.870> units<00:07:15.020> between

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
there is a difference of 2 units between

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.770 
there is a difference of 2 units between
Sigma<00:07:16.070> V<00:07:16.220> T<00:07:16.370> and<00:07:16.490> maximum<00:07:16.940> value<00:07:17.210> of<00:07:17.240> gameshark

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.780 
Sigma V T and maximum value of gameshark

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.070 
Sigma V T and maximum value of gameshark
so<00:07:18.440> this<00:07:18.650> idle<00:07:19.460> time<00:07:19.700> plus<00:07:20.150> Sigma<00:07:20.570> V<00:07:20.720> T<00:07:20.900> is

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
so this idle time plus Sigma V T is

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.860 
so this idle time plus Sigma V T is
equal<00:07:21.530> to<00:07:21.650> maximum<00:07:22.220> value<00:07:22.520> of<00:07:22.550> gran<00:07:22.880> chart<00:07:23.180> so

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.870 
equal to maximum value of gran chart so

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.980 
equal to maximum value of gran chart so
now<00:07:24.320> we<00:07:24.380> can<00:07:24.680> say<00:07:24.919> that<00:07:25.099> all<00:07:26.060> the<00:07:26.479> process<00:07:26.840> have

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.990 
now we can say that all the process have

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.110 
now we can say that all the process have
been<00:07:27.020> executed<00:07:27.590> and<00:07:28.099> this<00:07:28.520> Gantt<00:07:28.760> chart<00:07:29.000> is

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 
been executed and this Gantt chart is

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.270 
been executed and this Gantt chart is
correct<00:07:29.450> again<00:07:30.349> we<00:07:30.500> will<00:07:30.650> calculate<00:07:30.830> the

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 
correct again we will calculate the

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.980 
correct again we will calculate the
schedule<00:07:31.610> length<00:07:31.820> which<00:07:32.450> is<00:07:32.479> equal<00:07:32.659> to

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:32.990 
schedule length which is equal to

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.230 
schedule length which is equal to
maximum<00:07:33.860> completion<00:07:34.400> time<00:07:34.610> which<00:07:34.849> is<00:07:34.970> equal

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 
maximum completion time which is equal

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.219 
maximum completion time which is equal
to<00:07:35.390> 23<00:07:35.840> -<00:07:36.940> minimum<00:07:37.940> arrival<00:07:38.510> time<00:07:38.720> which<00:07:38.930> is

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:39.229 
to 23 - minimum arrival time which is

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:42.880 
to 23 - minimum arrival time which is
equal<00:07:39.560> to<00:07:39.590> 2<00:07:39.919> here<00:07:40.669> it<00:07:41.479> is<00:07:41.659> not<00:07:41.870> 0<00:07:42.229> as<00:07:42.380> the

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:42.890 
equal to 2 here it is not 0 as the

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.149 
equal to 2 here it is not 0 as the
minimum<00:07:43.159> arrival<00:07:43.729> time<00:07:43.970> is<00:07:44.180> 2<00:07:44.450> so<00:07:45.229> 23<00:07:45.740> minus<00:07:46.010> 2

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:46.159 
minimum arrival time is 2 so 23 minus 2

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:48.610 
minimum arrival time is 2 so 23 minus 2
is<00:07:46.340> equal<00:07:46.580> to<00:07:46.610> 21<00:07:47.210> is<00:07:47.360> the<00:07:47.990> scheduled<00:07:48.380> length

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:48.620 
is equal to 21 is the scheduled length

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.820 
is equal to 21 is the scheduled length
