00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
rookie it was good you know to have some

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.540 
rookie it was good you know to have some
ups<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.210> downs<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.220> anything

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
ups and downs and it really anything

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.920 
ups and downs and it really anything
that<00:01:53.729> could<00:01:54.000> potentially<00:01:54.149> happen<00:01:54.660> in<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that could potentially happen in the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.260 
that could potentially happen in the
future<00:01:55.050> you<00:01:55.320> want<00:01:55.410> to<00:01:55.560> happen<00:01:55.789> early<00:01:56.789> and<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.240> I

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
future you want to happen early and so I

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.100 
future you want to happen early and so I
think<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.660> a<00:01:57.720> good<00:01:57.810> learning<00:01:57.869> experience
