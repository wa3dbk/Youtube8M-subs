00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.689
 Hello have been welcomed 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.489
 financially Hamburg at the company tidier for Volkswagen 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:21.650
 second representation 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.600
 and today we will be installing a mechanical quite soft and quarter 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.599
 be made up for 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.189
 second place 1 of theft statistics of the German 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.280
 in addition to an electronic immobilizer the offensive go 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.320
 the vehicles available 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.850
 the noon altitude immobilizer certainly one 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.400
 Further 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 the vehicle 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.020
 Here we have a little more open if he beckons 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.820
 the construction is grown a crucial vehicle 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.400
 her friend Jana Pruss screws 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.080
 functional consequences Assen 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.710
 «We have learned 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.870
 can press on the panel 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.430
 tore through death 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 designed for the city 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.670
 to insert on the vehicle 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.899
 For the two final rounds at the booth about Karstadt with simple 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.610
 again debut 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.210
 it is possible 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.210
 how can individual countries want to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.080
 When installing many trim parts in the footwell must be laborious 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.010
 be reduced 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.080
 the lock will then request with the Schalke I noticed 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.300
 For additional security use here Appel screws 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.640
 so receipts for the race 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.920
 Bad Vilbel lives in position 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.780
 same reported 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.450
 the Tyrolean are ready 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.840
 and 2 is determined a short form is no longer possible 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.170
 the lock cylinder installed 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.860
 who installed the game 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.140
 so far had with the clothes 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.460
 to 7 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.919
 a difficult one always 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.429
 Arrangement screws are the one 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.039
 very challenging 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.179
 has made common 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:16.779
 to work 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:18.559
 Hamburg ruled 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:19.999
 you can see that during installation 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:21.159
 in question 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.319
 because Série Noire somebody thought 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.049
 Why 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.519
 but I would need wednesday now 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.509
 Maranello 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:30.969
 the current 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.939
 also comes for the table 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.089
 Kaufbeuren has 2010 off 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.990
 but also 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.990
 to accept that 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:40.929
 "The mirror" 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.109
 Photo Wichert is a blog only makes 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.669
 the Lokschuppen and what they have done so far for experience with the product 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:48.320
 because until now 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.729
 makes quite positive experiences with products 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.729
 the customers are satisfied 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:56.869
 make positive experiences 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.139
 that's it that's over and that 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.229
 and that sure too 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:04.289
 how long does the installation take? 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.499
 this is done depending on models about two to three hours 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.139
 you can call the controller a sheer 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.389
 I want to break into a ski run 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.339
 because the test system is attached to extensive shift linkage whose 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:19.429
 State different comes 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:22.979
 dismantle the fairing case and of course that will have to be done here then 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.509
 also from the technical staff 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.589
 should be installed 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:30.389
 Torsten California 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.179
 and recently the train driver appeared 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.019
 what moved you to that and 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.019
 how does it work? 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.349
 just on board 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.349
 Now that the practical test for Tomorrow is not working 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.789
 a few kilometers after the impressive as it is 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.000
 yes wonderful but no differences everything works fine 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.740
 In the end, you feel a little bit like the car 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.020
 It enjoys itself unobserved on the parking lots 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.020
 Let's hope that this little symbol for a bit more security 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.099
 Regarding the t5 theft statistics will be available in the future
