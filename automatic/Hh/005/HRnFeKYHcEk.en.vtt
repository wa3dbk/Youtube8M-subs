00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.689
 Good day to all in one of the past 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.419
 I told the video what is definitely 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.100
 and showed how to use it now 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.680
 I will show how without nodes to 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.690
 make your own main 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.360
 The advantage of self-made is definitely in 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.269
 tom we can make this size 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.370
 which we need for making without 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.420
 knots ki we need round pliers 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.050
 pliers 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.420
 and wire cutters as well as stainless elastic 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.280
 the wire for that is very good 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.370
 fits 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.320
 wire for orthodontic appliances 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.649
 diameter of 0 8 millimeters is wire 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.080
 used in dentistry 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.240
 proceed to manufacture first here 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.350
 there are two options 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.979
 wire length can be cut 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.590
 right away 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.490
 but it is possible but without nodes q straight on the uterus and 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.369
 trim at the end I will use first 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:23.200
 option so as not hank did not interfere cut 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:26.619
 Immediately take somewhere centimeters 5 6 then 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.659
 There is a length of this wire depends on 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.220
 the size we need without key nodes that is 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.770
 accordingly, the more bezuglovka we 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.070
 want to make the longer should be 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.500
 here is this wire 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.040
 Now we take round pliers and bend one 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.040
 end of wire 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.490
 here we should have such a hook 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.460
 then insert this hook again 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.610
 round nose pliers and bend back only 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.610
 the side 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.800
 here 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.480
 now our task is this one 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.670
 hook 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:18.590
 bend a little like tilt for 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:26.870
 this we take thin pliers 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:29.750
 and that's it, well, let's wait here. 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:40.850
 got a little hook this long 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:42.760
 here is this inversion so we will bite it off 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.720
 so here 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:54.269
 all this we got this one 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:57.640
 front part now from this hook 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:01.000
 retreat somewhere a centimeter and do here 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:08.519
 such a loop again, we take 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:11.370
 round nose pliers here fix and this end 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:21.329
 raise up 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:26.349
 wrap around and drop down here 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:27.150
 slightly raised after which we 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.569
 remains 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:38.470
 trim the excess end and more accurately bite off 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:44.819
 need to leave somewhere 12 millimeters here 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:50.099
 so without knots to our ready here 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.099
 see here in the picture 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:04:00.450
 It seems now we will check it on 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.450
 performance let's take a piece of cord 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.000
 and try to wind it on without knots 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.700
 everything 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.700
 everything works everything keeps 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.720
