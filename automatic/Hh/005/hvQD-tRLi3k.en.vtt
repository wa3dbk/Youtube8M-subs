00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.040
 you have prepared exercises for us yes 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.270
 I thought a little something 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.260
 and will show you what you can do 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.180
 because actually in such a beautiful 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.570
 poledance studio do it all 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.570
 OK 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.400
 Once outside with your arm and reach for it 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.940
 at head height the left arm is rich in 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.960
 herbeck and try ours now 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.960
 to get children 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.120
 the list 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:16.630
 that means we work in the studio yes 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.560
 spinning post that means I thank that 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.560
 means we do follow 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:03:02.459
 yes not just a drop and then 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.459
 available 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.750
 they reach for the snake with wine 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.880
 all fingers have to go behind the city 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.500
 that's not exactly where we start 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.720
 now press against our hostel 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.720
 and then bring our poco 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.430
 music 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.580
 as clear it was definitely 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.139
 more exhausting than we thought 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.090
 already shows a few exercises and that is 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.220
 so standard that are the first so the 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.470
 basic things I say so and so on 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:58.919
 Can you build what you directly in the 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:00.930
 first hour is doing here or so 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:07.229
 Probetraining does not come in now 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:09.030
 ask the last exercise I found then 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.490
 also extremely hard so that with the 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.419
 I'm going to say it over there 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:19.289
 we make the deal 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:21.599
 You can put your girls around my girls 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.400
 can go to polenz now and then but 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.840
 I tell you it will kickbox more 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.120
 trains as polenz so that ever 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:33.000
 clearly is yes ok yes I would say 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:36.770
 I may go to polenzy 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.770
 would say bye that would be better
