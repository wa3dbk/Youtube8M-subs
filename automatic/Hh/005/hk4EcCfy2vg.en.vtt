00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
kind of skip and miss you know able to

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.040 
kind of skip and miss you know able to
do<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> while<00:00:27.060> then<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:27.689> gets

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
do it for a while then it just gets

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.919 
do it for a while then it just gets
worse<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.380> worse<00:00:28.470> maybe<00:00:29.269> this<00:00:30.269> car<00:00:30.480> analogous

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
worse and worse maybe this car analogous

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.450 
worse and worse maybe this car analogous
it<00:00:31.170> won't<00:00:31.380> even<00:00:31.529> run<00:00:31.619> down<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> road<00:00:31.949> hardly

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
it won't even run down the road hardly

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.080 
it won't even run down the road hardly
so<00:00:33.020> first<00:00:34.020> thing<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.649> go<00:00:34.770> your

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
so first thing you do is you go your

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.090 
so first thing you do is you go your
autozone<00:00:36.090> or<00:00:36.440> O'Reilly's<00:00:37.440> whatever<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.950> grab

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
autozone or O'Reilly's whatever and grab

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.650 
autozone or O'Reilly's whatever and grab
yourself<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.550> spark<00:00:38.879> tester<00:00:39.239> which<00:00:39.390> looks<00:00:39.600> like

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
yourself a spark tester which looks like

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.410 
yourself a spark tester which looks like
this<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.379> running<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.800> number<00:00:41.100> four<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.700> as

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
this it's running on number four and as

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.569 
this it's running on number four and as
you<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.629> see<00:00:42.809> there<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.140> no<00:00:43.379> spark<00:00:43.829> now<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> zero

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
you can see there is no spark now a zero

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.260 
you can see there is no spark now a zero
spark<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:46.460> up<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.700> next<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:48.030> we're<00:00:48.149> going

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
spark so up going next here we're going

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.720 
spark so up going next here we're going
to<00:00:48.329> show<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.780> show<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:50.180> cylinder<00:00:51.180> number<00:00:52.730> number

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
to show a show a cylinder number number

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.189 
to show a show a cylinder number number
one<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> believe<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.460> I<00:00:56.690> just<00:00:57.690> could<00:00:57.809> not<00:00:57.930> get

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
one I believe and I just could not get

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.799 
one I believe and I just could not get
it<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.379> crank<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.390> because<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.510> basically

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it to crank and because it's basically

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.029 
it to crank and because it's basically
running<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.050> two<00:01:01.260> cylinders<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> was

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
running on two cylinders but I was

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.229 
running on two cylinders but I was
trying<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.250> show<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:02.640> spark<00:01:02.940> coming

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
trying to show a little spark coming

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.729 
trying to show a little spark coming
from<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.510> normal<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.470> wouldn't<00:01:04.650> work

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
from the normal one but it wouldn't work

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.340 
from the normal one but it wouldn't work
so<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.390> want<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.540> place<00:01:06.750> there<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.140> your

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
so what you want to place there is your

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.410 
so what you want to place there is your
ignition<00:01:07.650> coil<00:01:08.070> which<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.640> right<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:08.880> which

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
ignition coil which is right there which

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.130 
ignition coil which is right there which
is<00:01:09.570> where<00:01:09.780> all<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:11.270> spark<00:01:12.270> plug<00:01:12.479> wires<00:01:12.720> plug

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
is where all your spark plug wires plug

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.550 
is where all your spark plug wires plug
into<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.299> there's<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.450> four<00:01:15.720> four<00:01:16.259> screws

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
into and there's just four four screws

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.160 
into and there's just four four screws
that<00:01:16.590> holds<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.159> unplug<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.970> from<00:01:18.170> unplug

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that holds it in unplug it from unplug

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.270 
that holds it in unplug it from unplug
it<00:01:19.290> from<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> car<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.270> there's<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.330> new<00:01:21.570> one

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
it from the car and there's a new one

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.499 
it from the car and there's a new one
recommend<00:01:23.280> buying<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.670> offline<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.360> much

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
recommend buying it offline it's much

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.210 
recommend buying it offline it's much
cheaper<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> autozone<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.040> other

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
cheaper don't go to autozone or other

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.819 
cheaper don't go to autozone or other
places<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.409> basically<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.590> want

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
places like that basically you just want

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.219 
places like that basically you just want
to<00:01:28.860> hold<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.159> side-by-side<00:01:29.460> plug<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.570> wire<00:01:30.750> in

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
to hold it side-by-side plug one wire in

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.020 
to hold it side-by-side plug one wire in
at<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.650> time<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.250> don't<00:01:32.430> get<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.640> confused

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
at a time so you don't get it confused

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.660 
at a time so you don't get it confused
you<00:01:33.960> don't<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.320> type<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.770> or<00:01:35.009> take

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
you don't have to type in or take

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.399 
you don't have to type in or take
pictures<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.299> anything<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.930> it's

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
pictures or anything like that so it's

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.510 
pictures or anything like that so it's
nice<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.799> easy<00:01:40.130> Hey<00:01:41.159> oh<00:01:42.979> alright<00:01:43.979> once<00:01:44.430> you
