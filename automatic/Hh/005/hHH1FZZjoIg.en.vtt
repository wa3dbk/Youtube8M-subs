00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.769
 It's good, this video here is going to be fast and it 's 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.129
 only to show a knife that came

 I got it for me on Friday. 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.739
 treats an audience with a knife 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.559
 Scandinavian production in the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.290
 Finland by an acquaintance of mine 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.770
 youtube channel the channel name 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.360

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.909
 first name oslo 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.740
 so watching his videos I 'll even go 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.250
 put his channel link on 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.369
 discretion in this video he does few 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.860
 where they usually have the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.039
 pre ready blade and it makes the cable and 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.850
 Queen does a lot of artistic work. 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:35.159
 pretty 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.470
 so she did not resist the also chose the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.210
 model together with him is I who 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.479
 I chose the model that chose the shape of 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.390
 cable that I liked the most and we 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.789
 arriving in this model of little here the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.239
 A pause to replenish coffee. 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.970
 then continuing is he put this 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:55.709
 part here for hitching the flint and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.110
 he sent me a flint was chutaço 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:01.140
 A toast a surprise I did not imagine 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.119
 that I intend to make a sieve that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.879
 best fit here have to have that 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.399
 part of the thinner handle just to 

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:12.780
 do not mess up here on da 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.450
 very beautiful lard in leather 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.660
 it is very caprichou in the sheath 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.720
 traditional couplings he puts here 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.290
 so the bath she does not stay 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.390
 sambando in the waist for example 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.920
 but it has a freer movement 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.440
 so if you want to put it inside the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.930
 pocket you put if you wanted 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.540
 download it will not be troubling and 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.980
 end in practice showing the photo here to 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.630
 you 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.420
 that would be she nor carbon steel 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.590
 approximately eight centimeters 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.540
 blade 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.930
 this back here trash only 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.830
 to provide the fire with the 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.810
 flint this part he made in 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.360
 brass very welcomed looks only very 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.819
 beautiful and combined with actions 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.190
 microfilm he already sent the microfilm is 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.170
 a custom of putting the microphone in the 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.800
 blade is not something recent that he 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.830
 alone long time ago 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.709
 the great special touch to your knife would be 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.709
 the cable is only part and clear in beto 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.000
 birch wood and this part here more 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:27.930
 would be a way known as 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:32.370
 pronounced guven sells his writing 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.890
 it would be wn ge and if I'm not mistaken this is it 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.750
 a type of wood of African origin 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.720
 which have other regions of the world 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:44.630
 African origin and has this coloration 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:49.970
 then he treated this cable here 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.950
 a mixture of tar oil 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.230
 turpentine and another Chinese oil that 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.200
 he did not specify what it would be then 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.170
 this mixture ended up providing a 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.269
 very characteristic smell that this 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.220
 blade she had her own scent 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.799
 even though it will be difficult to find in 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.380
 another blade in the change the strong smell 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:14.250
 according to osmar um 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.459
 scent that resembles much used in 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.400
 ships of the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.710
 finland if you walk through the port region 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.330
 you smell and smell just because 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.220
 Is it used 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.340
 for the timber of ships precisely 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.860
 provided better protection 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.310
 in the wood so much to feel old 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.949
 sea ​​as the pressure of time so 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.229
 he thought treating this flag 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.330
 so it would be better to use here 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.000
 in Brazil where conditions are a bit 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.669
 more adverse say so 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.189
 I liked it so much, it got a color 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.240
 own also woke open ended 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.699
 changing 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.340
 by the fact that he has placed 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:05:00.930
 this mixture and it was very beautiful and 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:03.030
 put here 11 11 11 a hole for 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.710
 put a tie and hard wedge not yet 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.560
 I know if I'll score the goal 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.789
 I'll think about it, this is a lot of people. 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.500
 beautiful is he made a video about the 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:16.050
 creation of this knife the video of photos I 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.550
 I'll post the video link in the description 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.629
 of the video to communicate on his channel 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.819
 also accompany there is very beautiful 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:27.810
 another information that the photon passes 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:30.779
 for you it is the part of the blade if 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.490
 You see, look, it's just him and I do not know. 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.370
 if the video will be able to show but it is 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.469
 slightly inclined blade slightly 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.479
 down then it forms a 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:41.639
 belly that on the blade that 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.639
 providing a cutting ability 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.529
 greater in it for example if you use 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.589
 a surface with a knife so it goes 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.330
 cut precisely because of this slight 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:53.419
 Descend down you end up giving 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.919
 even greater mobility for her 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:58.650
 A knife that I'm going to use will not stay. 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.750
 only in the collection will not you see me 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.819
 sometimes using this little knife here 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.870
 never with support for flint 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.659
 It's very cool 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:10.129
 That's it, people turned on to watch. 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:10.129
 A big hug, see you later
