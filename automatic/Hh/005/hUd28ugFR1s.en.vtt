 the kitchen now I'm going to show you 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.130
 how to prepare a very very rich sauce 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.970
 avocado with tomato I 'll show you the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.420
 ingredients 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.410
 We're going to need two good bites 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.070
 mature make two faults 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.560
 2 tomatoes , diced I will 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.470
 I took the seeds so they do not contribute 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.600
 too much liquid 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.700
 We are going to need a soup spoon 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.590
 mayonnaise 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:00.970
 2 to 3 tablespoons of sour cream 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:04.540
 dehydrated onion lemon juice salt and 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.520
 pepper and we're also going to use three 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.840
 garlic cloves 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.159
 and fresh parsley 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.159
 let's start 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.680
 chopping the garlic 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.680
 not too small 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.500
 we are also going to chop the parsley 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.850
 yes 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.420
 once we have everything in pieces 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:01.390
 small we can 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.670
 explain it finite but also it 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.020
 can do in a small processor 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.020
 kitchen if you prefer 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.080
 to 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.010
 is ready 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:26.510
 we will leave it aside 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.530
 and let's start with the faults in a 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.530
 deep bowl 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.960
 I have already retired them expensive or with the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.960
 help from a spoon to take yes 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.710
 without evoked it is important that it is well 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.710
 mature because if not 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.710
 it is very difficult to manage 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.710
 let's throw him now 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.300
 a teaspoon of lemon juice 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.760
 this is very important because for 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.840
 avoid that the avocado turns black in 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.170
 contact with the air 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.129
 but also will bring a lot of flavor the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.720
 lemon and avocado is a combination and what 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.050
 let's go stepping with the help of a 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.220
 good fork once we have the 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.569
 miss well pisaditas mashed let's go 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.360
 to start adding others 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.360
 ingredients a spoonful of mayonnaise 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.700
 May may be light no problem 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.940
 very important acid cream with believe 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.940
 press 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.610
 ah 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.610
 let's add 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.740
 quite salt 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.319
 cool molina the taste theme 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.150
 let's also add garlic and 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.150
 parsley that we previously chopped 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.890
 the tomato 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.960
 Y 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.190
 and finally a touch of onion 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.810
 dehydrated 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.060
 in this case it is important that the 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.350
 Onion is not fresh because it would be 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:46.420
 too strong I prefer it 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.510
 powder for that particular recipe 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:53.020
 this is a very rich variation of the 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:56.520
 guacamole sauce and allows many 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.819
 variations with more garlic with less garlic 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.490
 picart or the thickest lawyer or more 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:06.690
 fine is really nice 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.690
 we mix everything well 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:14.989
 and our sauce is now ready now 

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:18.309
 I will show you how to present it and 

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:18.309
 how can they accompany them 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.610
 but now I'm going to show you a couple of 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.569
 ideas of how to serve our sauce 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.360
 avocado and tomato 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:30.509
 we can serve it with tortilla chips 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.509
 of corn 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.699
 we can also serve them with sticks 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.699
 carrot sticks 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.419
 or if you prefer with pieces of 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.139
 white bread toast or with crackers 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.139
 Salty cookies 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.690

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.690
