00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.470
 all big and heartfelt greetings 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.170
 sure most of you are aware 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.510
 that I have warm feelings for mineral 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.760
 cosmetics in particular to mineral 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.710
 the shadows, I know that many uncomfortable 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.870
 work with crumbly mineral 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.670
 shadows despite their advantages 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.640
 which consist of 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.739
 mineral shadows do not contain chemical 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.589
 substances talc mineral oils 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.079
 preservatives and dyes therefore 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.170
 safe and do not cause allergies 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.780
 protect from ultraviolet rays not 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.090
 clog pores allowing delicate eyelid skin 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.220
 breathe mineral shadows like the whole 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.000
 mineral makeup is not tested on 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.280
 of animals 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.990
 mineral shadows fall evenly 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.299
 which can layered 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.909
 and easy to shade due to lung and 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.740
 fine grinding for those who are not comfortable 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.520
 work with crumbly and mineral 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.619
 shadows but I want to have a way out we will give 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.259
 they are familiar with only 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.840
 extruded them without press and extra 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.390
 fixtures everything will be just fast and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.119
 qualitatively without any loss in 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.509
 properties of the shadows we need a jar 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.829
 where the shadows are stored alcohol 95 percent and 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.829
 mixing stick 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:47.850
 if you want to compress the shadows out 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.039
 bag probes you will need 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.469
 additionally refill and or jars 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.109
 from under mineral shadows and so we type 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:59.630
 in the pipette alcohol and pour so that 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:59.630
 fully liquid coated pigments 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.140
 do not be afraid that all the liquid is important 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.970
 stir the lumps and leave everything on 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.910
 night at room temperature 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.520
 to pigment and sat on the bottom of alcohol 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.890
 evaporate and leave your shadows completely 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:33.340
 pressed without using a press 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:35.140
 no dirt all neatly and quickly 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.430
 put the shade to dry next to 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.890
 heating appliances 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.709
 overly rapid evaporation of alcohol may 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.390
 lead to cracking shadows here 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.190
 such a simple trick for easy 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.240
 use in mineral shadows 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.240
 Have a good mood
