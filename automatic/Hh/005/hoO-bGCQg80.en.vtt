things<00:03:06.810> EA<00:03:07.019> probably<00:03:07.469> has<00:03:07.590> done<00:03:07.829> uh<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.669> is

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
things EA probably has done uh this is

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.490 
things EA probably has done uh this is
mainly<00:03:09.299> really<00:03:09.659> beneficial<00:03:10.019> because<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
mainly really beneficial because the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.080 
mainly really beneficial because the
fact<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:10.769> is<00:03:10.919> the<00:03:11.099> four-star<00:03:11.519> weak<00:03:11.700> foot<00:03:11.909> and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
fact that is the four-star weak foot and

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.789 
fact that is the four-star weak foot and
um<00:03:12.629> you<00:03:12.780> know<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.900> weak<00:03:13.139> foot<00:03:13.349> in<00:03:13.469> this<00:03:13.560> case

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
um you know the weak foot in this case

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:14.959 
um you know the weak foot in this case
would<00:03:13.950> be<00:03:13.980> his<00:03:14.189> left<00:03:14.430> foot<00:03:14.579> so<00:03:14.730> when<00:03:14.879> he's

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:14.969 
would be his left foot so when he's

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.209 
would be his left foot so when he's
