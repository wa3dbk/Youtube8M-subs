of abstraction they're kind enough to
say<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:18.210> like<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.660> talk<00:00:18.869> about<00:00:18.930> your

when you feel like it open the floor to
questions<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:29.250> as<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.489> mentioned<00:00:29.640> earlier<00:00:29.910> if

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
questions and as we mentioned earlier if

known as a place of abstraction and the

feel of your sketchbook club when I was

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.920 
feel of your sketchbook club when I was
a<00:01:25.890> student<00:01:26.160> was<00:01:26.520> very<00:01:26.790> definitely<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:27.690> known

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
a student was very definitely not known

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.920 
a student was very definitely not known
as<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.590> place<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.950> abstraction<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.690> is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
as a place of abstraction and so it is

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.130 
as a place of abstraction and so it is
delightful<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.830> wonderful<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.430> see<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:33.480> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
delightful and wonderful to see that a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.970 
delightful and wonderful to see that a
place<00:01:34.620> with<00:01:35.310> such<00:01:35.580> a<00:01:35.930> wonderful<00:01:36.930> history<00:01:37.260> and

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
place with such a wonderful history and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.760 
place with such a wonderful history and
a<00:01:38.100> wonderful<00:01:38.520> sense<00:01:39.050> of<00:01:40.050> purpose<00:01:42.410> has<00:01:43.410> begun

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
a wonderful sense of purpose has begun

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
a wonderful sense of purpose has begun
to<00:01:43.890> recognize<00:01:44.310> something<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.760> in<00:01:45.240> fact<00:01:45.600> has

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
to recognize something that in fact has

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.210 
to recognize something that in fact has
been<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.530> Philadelphia<00:01:47.010> for<00:01:47.040> a

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
been going on in Philadelphia for a

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.090 
been going on in Philadelphia for a
number<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.550> years<00:01:47.760> perhaps<00:01:48.330> not<00:01:48.660> as<00:01:48.900> as<00:01:49.620> much

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
number of years perhaps not as as much

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.880 
number of years perhaps not as as much
as<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:51.600> traditional<00:01:52.110> realism<00:01:52.800> and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.090 

working<00:01:56.890> from<00:01:57.039> nature<00:01:57.430> but<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.710> has<00:01:59.890> been

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
working from nature but it has been

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.889 
working from nature but it has been
going<00:02:00.250> on<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.759> so<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:03.250> is<00:02:03.700> for<00:02:04.539> me

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
going on and so it is for me

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.889 
going on and so it is for me

offers many many different approaches
and<00:02:17.500> uses<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.130> material<00:02:18.670> which<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.630> always

and uses of material which is always
exciting<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:22.630> terms<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:23.200> abstraction<00:02:23.650> and

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
exciting in terms of abstraction and

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.180 
exciting in terms of abstraction and
I'll<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.700> talk<00:02:24.940> about<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.269> briefly<00:02:25.950> from<00:02:26.950> my

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
I'll just talk about it briefly from my

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.300 
I'll just talk about it briefly from my
point<00:02:27.489> of<00:02:27.519> view<00:02:29.370> Don<00:02:30.370> gave<00:02:30.670> us<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.910> number<00:02:31.060> of

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
point of view Don gave us a number of

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.539 
point of view Don gave us a number of
things<00:02:34.349> to<00:02:35.349> read<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.829> it's<00:02:36.190> interesting

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
things to read and it's interesting

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.979 
things to read and it's interesting
because<00:02:37.440> we<00:02:38.440> are<00:02:38.620> products<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.160> our<00:02:39.280> own

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
because we are products of our own

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.339 
because we are products of our own
environment<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.110> time<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.870> description

any real knowledge of what the process

really is I mean this is for me all

really is I mean this is for me all
wrong<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:56.230> does<00:02:56.500> not<00:02:56.709> talk<00:02:57.310> about<00:02:57.640> what

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
wrong it does not talk about what

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.270 
wrong it does not talk about what
abstraction<00:02:58.510> really<00:02:58.720> is<00:02:58.870> nor<00:02:59.139> what<00:02:59.709> abstract

expressionism really is in many cases
most<00:03:04.420> people<00:03:04.780> think<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:05.049> abstraction<00:03:05.530> is

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
most people think that abstraction is

most people think that abstraction is

for me has never been a question of
making<00:03:11.829> up<00:03:12.150> because<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.269> can't<00:03:13.600> make

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
making up because you can't make

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.020 
making up because you can't make
anything<00:03:14.319> up<00:03:14.650> everything<00:03:15.549> that<00:03:15.700> we<00:03:15.790> do

everything that we think comes from our

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
change it around in a number of ways and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.050 
change it around in a number of ways and
apply<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.069> differently<00:03:27.370> I'll<00:03:27.850> give<00:03:27.970> an

apply it differently I'll give an

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.110 
apply it differently I'll give an

example you can take you can take for

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.910 
example you can take you can take for

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
example a texture that you normally

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.539 
example a texture that you normally
realize<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.160> understand<00:03:36.639> the<00:03:36.849> texture<00:03:37.329> of<00:03:38.549> a

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
realize and understand the texture of a

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.930 
realize and understand the texture of a
rock<00:03:39.790> or<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.930> wall<00:03:41.139> you<00:03:42.130> can<00:03:42.310> put<00:03:42.519> that<00:03:42.670> in<00:03:42.819> a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
rock or the wall you can put that in a

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.000 
rock or the wall you can put that in a
different<00:03:43.269> environment<00:03:43.359> within<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.380> context

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
different environment within the context

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.210 
different environment within the context
of<00:03:45.069> a<00:03:45.160> drawing<00:03:45.430> or<00:03:45.670> painting<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.329> it<00:03:46.720> becomes

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
of a drawing or painting and it becomes

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.250 
of a drawing or painting and it becomes
something<00:03:48.220> entirely<00:03:48.579> different<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:50.139> the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
something entirely different so that the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.009 
something entirely different so that the
environment<00:03:50.590> that<00:03:51.310> you<00:03:51.489> place<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.870> elements

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
environment that you place the elements

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.909 
environment that you place the elements
that<00:03:53.410> you<00:03:53.500> decide<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:53.859> use<00:03:55.319> begins<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.590> define

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
that you decide to use begins to define

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.550 
that you decide to use begins to define
their<00:03:57.430> purpose<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.239> so<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.200> difference<00:03:59.500> that

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
their purpose and so the difference that

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.160 
their purpose and so the difference that
I<00:03:59.709> see<00:03:59.980> in<00:04:00.069> abstraction<00:04:00.489> today<00:04:01.049> relative<00:04:02.049> to

I see in abstraction today relative to

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.699 
I see in abstraction today relative to
what<00:04:02.319> I<00:04:02.349> do<00:04:02.849> is<00:04:03.849> just<00:04:03.909> like

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
what I do is just like

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.740 
what I do is just like
in<00:04:06.709> figurative<00:04:07.640> work<00:04:07.879> I<00:04:09.790> must<00:04:10.790> decide<00:04:11.450> a

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
in figurative work I must decide a

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.170 
in figurative work I must decide a

that<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:14.360> decide<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.720> use<00:04:15.130> what<00:04:16.130> are<00:04:16.160> they<00:04:16.280> going

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
that I decide to use what are they going

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.140 
that I decide to use what are they going
to<00:04:16.609> do<00:04:17.200> what<00:04:18.200> do<00:04:18.350> I<00:04:18.410> want<00:04:18.769> them<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.040> do<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.910> if<00:04:20.030> I

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
to do what do I want them to do and if I

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.240 
to do what do I want them to do and if I
name<00:04:20.419> it

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
name it

that's when invention begins to happen
because<00:04:23.720> if<00:04:23.930> you<00:04:24.050> name<00:04:24.320> something<00:04:25.270> you<00:04:26.270> can

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
because if you name something you can

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.159 
because if you name something you can
then<00:04:26.690> find<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.350> way<00:04:27.729> of<00:04:28.780> reasoning<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:29.990> out

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
then find a way of reasoning that out

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.040 
then find a way of reasoning that out
but<00:04:30.680> you<00:04:30.710> have<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.100> name<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.520> want<00:04:31.940> this<00:04:32.330> to

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
but you have to name it I want this to

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.129 
but you have to name it I want this to
happen<00:04:33.229> I<00:04:33.530> want<00:04:33.770> that<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.370> happen<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.960> name<00:04:35.960> it

happen I want that to happen you name it

happen I want that to happen you name it
it<00:04:36.380> begins<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.830> happen

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
it begins to happen

the third thing for me is that

the third thing for me is that

Eakins<00:05:09.760> you<00:05:10.760> have<00:05:10.940> a<00:05:10.970> sense<00:05:11.330> of<00:05:11.539> the<00:05:11.660> alphabet

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
Eakins you have a sense of the alphabet

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.409 
Eakins you have a sense of the alphabet
that<00:05:12.169> they<00:05:12.410> decide<00:05:12.740> to<00:05:12.770> use<00:05:13.100> so<00:05:14.030> everyone

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
that they decide to use so everyone

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.440 
that they decide to use so everyone
begins<00:05:14.660> to<00:05:14.810> develop<00:05:15.139> an<00:05:15.229> alphabet<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:15.770> for<00:05:16.039> me

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
begins to develop an alphabet and for me

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.719 
begins to develop an alphabet and for me
it<00:05:17.450> seemed<00:05:17.870> reasonable<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:18.950> I've<00:05:19.520> always

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
it seemed reasonable and I've always

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.480 
it seemed reasonable and I've always
been<00:05:20.020> amazed<00:05:21.020> by<00:05:21.500> this<00:05:22.210> language<00:05:24.160> is<00:05:25.160> really

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
been amazed by this language is really

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.290 
been amazed by this language is really
important<00:05:26.120> out<00:05:26.900> of<00:05:27.070> an<00:05:28.070> alphabet<00:05:29.000> which<00:05:29.180> is

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
important out of an alphabet which is

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.860 
important out of an alphabet which is
basically<00:05:29.720> 26<00:05:30.229> letters<00:05:31.180> that<00:05:32.180> we<00:05:32.360> understand

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
basically 26 letters that we understand

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.940 
basically 26 letters that we understand
in<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:33.740> Western<00:05:34.039> world<00:05:34.990> 26<00:05:35.990> letters<00:05:36.169> you<00:05:36.770> can

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
in the Western world 26 letters you can

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.770 
in the Western world 26 letters you can
produce<00:05:37.130> an<00:05:37.400> infinite<00:05:37.610> number<00:05:38.120> of<00:05:38.180> words<00:05:39.280> why

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
produce an infinite number of words why

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.710 
produce an infinite number of words why
you<00:05:41.780> take<00:05:42.169> those<00:05:42.700> letters<00:05:43.700> and<00:05:44.150> you<00:05:44.240> combine

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
you take those letters and you combine

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.810 
you take those letters and you combine
them<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.260> recombine<00:05:46.039> them<00:05:46.310> and<00:05:46.520> they<00:05:46.610> produce

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
them and recombine them and they produce

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.860 
them and recombine them and they produce
different<00:05:47.030> words<00:05:47.630> each<00:05:47.900> time<00:05:49.539> now<00:05:50.539> one<00:05:50.720> of<00:05:50.750> the

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
different words each time now one of the

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.210 
different words each time now one of the
things<00:05:51.050> about<00:05:51.169> finding<00:05:51.650> your<00:05:51.770> own<00:05:51.800> alphabet

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
things about finding your own alphabet

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.400 
things about finding your own alphabet
relative<00:05:52.849> to<00:05:53.090> painting<00:05:53.630> or<00:05:53.780> in<00:05:54.080> this<00:05:54.200> case

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
relative to painting or in this case

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.469 
relative to painting or in this case
relative<00:05:54.860> to<00:05:54.950> abstraction<00:05:55.580> you<00:05:55.760> begin<00:05:56.389> to

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
relative to abstraction you begin to

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.589 
relative to abstraction you begin to
find<00:05:56.660> elements<00:05:57.169> that<00:05:57.320> you<00:05:58.010> decide<00:05:58.669> to<00:05:59.000> use<00:05:59.270> and

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
find elements that you decide to use and

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:01.900 
find elements that you decide to use and
that<00:05:59.630> work<00:06:00.410> for<00:06:00.710> you<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:01.039> you<00:06:01.190> can<00:06:01.400> use<00:06:01.610> them

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
that work for you and you can use them

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.230 
that work for you and you can use them
in<00:06:02.120> many<00:06:02.330> different<00:06:02.599> ways<00:06:02.840> and<00:06:04.090> because<00:06:05.090> you

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
in many different ways and because you

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.830 
in many different ways and because you
can<00:06:05.450> make<00:06:05.840> them<00:06:06.169> do<00:06:06.800> different<00:06:07.580> things<00:06:07.880> you

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
can make them do different things you

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.010 
can make them do different things you
produce<00:06:09.050> different<00:06:09.680> visual<00:06:10.360> words<00:06:11.360> and<00:06:11.810> the

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
produce different visual words and the

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.040 
produce different visual words and the
result<00:06:12.320> is<00:06:12.500> you<00:06:12.880> never<00:06:13.880> tire<00:06:14.270> of<00:06:14.300> those

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
result is you never tire of those

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.890 
result is you never tire of those
elements<00:06:15.710> because<00:06:16.159> they're<00:06:16.310> used

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
elements because they're used

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.990 
elements because they're used
in<00:06:17.230> a<00:06:17.320> different<00:06:17.620> way<00:06:17.740> would<00:06:18.610> you<00:06:18.639> ever<00:06:18.820> get

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
in a different way would you ever get

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.520 
in a different way would you ever get
tired<00:06:19.210> of<00:06:19.389> the<00:06:19.900> letter<00:06:20.080> A<00:06:20.460> only<00:06:21.460> if<00:06:21.550> you<00:06:21.699> did

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
tired of the letter A only if you did

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.060 
tired of the letter A only if you did
aaaa

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
aaaa

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.490 
aaaa
but<00:06:24.580> if<00:06:24.669> you<00:06:24.820> do<00:06:25.000> a<00:06:25.270> and<00:06:25.660> combine<00:06:26.290> it<00:06:26.320> with

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
but if you do a and combine it with

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.040 
but if you do a and combine it with
other<00:06:26.800> letters<00:06:27.220> you<00:06:28.120> begin<00:06:28.419> to<00:06:28.540> get<00:06:28.660> different

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
other letters you begin to get different

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.340 
other letters you begin to get different
sounds<00:06:29.440> and<00:06:29.860> a<00:06:29.889> result<00:06:30.220> of<00:06:30.340> that<00:06:30.430> is<00:06:30.729> in<00:06:31.000> fact

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
sounds and a result of that is in fact

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.320 
sounds and a result of that is in fact
invention<00:06:32.350> and<00:06:32.590> so<00:06:32.850> what<00:06:33.850> I<00:06:33.880> think<00:06:34.000> about

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
invention and so what I think about

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.420 
invention and so what I think about
abstraction<00:06:34.870> now<00:06:35.169> is<00:06:35.380> that<00:06:35.560> for<00:06:35.889> me<00:06:36.070> it's<00:06:36.340> a

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
abstraction now is that for me it's a

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.879 
abstraction now is that for me it's a
question<00:06:36.580> of<00:06:37.139> invention<00:06:38.139> and<00:06:38.320> the<00:06:38.470> process

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
question of invention and the process

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.180 
question of invention and the process
for<00:06:38.919> me<00:06:39.190> is<00:06:39.220> basically<00:06:39.639> this<00:06:40.470> if<00:06:41.470> you<00:06:41.860> think

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
for me is basically this if you think

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.879 
for me is basically this if you think
about<00:06:42.850> it<00:06:43.000> and<00:06:44.669> if<00:06:45.669> you<00:06:46.199> begin<00:06:47.199> to<00:06:47.260> wonder

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
about it and if you begin to wonder

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:53.370 
about it and if you begin to wonder
about<00:06:48.790> it<00:06:49.240> it<00:06:50.229> causes<00:06:50.889> a<00:06:51.190> search<00:06:51.990> you<00:06:52.990> ask<00:06:53.200> the

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
about it it causes a search you ask the

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.610 
about it it causes a search you ask the
question<00:06:54.780> question<00:06:55.780> produces<00:06:56.260> a<00:06:56.290> search

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
question question produces a search

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.020 
question question produces a search
search<00:06:57.990> produces<00:06:58.990> investigation

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
search produces investigation

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.110 
search produces investigation
investigation<00:07:01.590> produces<00:07:02.590> invention<00:07:03.490> an

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
investigation produces invention an

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.690 
investigation produces invention an
invention<00:07:04.510> produced<00:07:05.020> discovery<00:07:05.650> and<00:07:06.130> that

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:06.700 
invention produced discovery and that

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.310 
invention produced discovery and that
for<00:07:06.940> me<00:07:07.030> is<00:07:07.090> the<00:07:07.150> process<00:07:07.630> in<00:07:07.840> terms<00:07:07.990> of<00:07:08.200> what<00:07:08.289> I

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
for me is the process in terms of what I

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:18.519 
for me is the process in terms of what I
do<00:07:08.490> relative<00:07:09.490> to<00:07:09.520> abstraction

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:18.529 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:20.589
