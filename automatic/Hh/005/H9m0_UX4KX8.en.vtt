00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.700
 hello my name is mariam traorÃ© and me 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.580
 support 2015 I'm 22 years old and I'm 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.689
 student in tax law what made me 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.250
 pushed to introduce myself to this election 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.490
 it is to want to represent the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.199
 Mali 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.060
 it's a pride for me to be able to 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.060
 represent my country and there are of course 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.679
 to realize a dream since childhood 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.820
 I always wanted to be miss so 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.680
 this was the opportunity for me to 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.570
 to gain immense pride in this title 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.480
 we do not expect it's true 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.059
 it's a moment 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.410
 we dream of thousands of millions 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.720
 many times, but when it happens to us 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.100
 really it sounds surreal so a 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.489
 extreme joy is really a big 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.489
 pride 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.580
 in the face of criticism and all the same 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.080
 the committee met I stay pretty 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.000
 perplexed because mali remains a country 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.949
 laic so if we want to organize a 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.629
 election it should be possible for 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.590
 each of us especially as 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.990
 the open miss election she exists 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.940
 since 1972 and despite the situation 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.400
 political and economic of the country and that's 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.869
 pity we did not have to do 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.850
 facing his problems but I hope that 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.450
 thanks to my mandate thanks to my good 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.710
 conduct 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.750
 next year it will be easier 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.180
 to organize this election if a 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.009
 also points out that in Cote d'Ivoire 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.479
 the miss parade in swimsuit no 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.390
 but lyon does not create but as a 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.470
 certain respect for the country's culture and 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.180
 of religion 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.100
 so let us do this 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:41.619
 organization this election and we're not going 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:42.460
 disappoint you in relation to the controversy 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.849
 of costs the courses them it's a 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.039
 unjust and unjustified controversy I am 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:49.030
 before any Malian and the family is 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.570
 from koulikoro 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.220
 so I do not see how 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.590
 this end why this controversy 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.210
 exists but I do not lie to you and for 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.530
 I be elected first runner is miss 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.479
 mali france and by a failure but a 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.830
 success when we know that there is a 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.020
 hundred women candidates at the beginning of 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.400
 casting capron the 12 finalists and that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.380
 especially it happens second these moments 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.459
 of success more than a failure and this 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.080
 would be a lack of respect towards these 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.390
 people there to say that I failed to 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.410
 the election miss mali france 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.850
 the only thing that kept me from doing 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.050
 miss or rtm election when i was 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.670
 elected first runner-up miss mali france 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.110
 is that the election mister kahn has not 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.550
 been organized there is no election I 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.810
 can not introduce myself but this year 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.000
 to not forget that the candidate who 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.770
 came to represent France in 2015 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.830
 it was a first runner up is not the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.540
 lys so it's not at all compared to 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.540
 that I could not introduce myself in 2014 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.209
 it is true that I was really 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.770
 congratulated on this speech and that 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.090
 touch me as I say it's much more 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.800
 that a speech is a message of peace 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.450
 when we are 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.580
 and in a country that is at war I 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.720
 think every citizen wants us 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.000
 find peace in the country 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.560
 because we have to move forward and 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.760
 our children for our parents for us 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.590
 same is important that they have the 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.820
 peace have what is welded into this 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.990
 message he really came from the heart 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.220
 it was not necessarily to win 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.990
 it was really what I felt 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:07.590
 that I thought my present is what I 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:09.780
 still think as miss ortm 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.070
 2015 I will realize a caravan that 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.950
 will have in the regions of mali to 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.120
 against disadvantaged people 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.410
 it is true that the mission that was 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.450
 entrusted this year is a mission of 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.130
 peace and national reconciliation in 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.960
 the framework of this mission she brought 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.000
 my support to the people affected by 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.980
 this war to war widows to 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.150
 war orphans is really showing 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.260
 to the people I represent it's 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.120
 true it's easy to talk to 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.740
 through my TV but when we're on the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.410
 ground the message will pass over 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.580
 easily that behind a camera is 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.400
 true it is this caravan that we go 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.440
 lead in the launch will take place tomorrow 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.390
 with the show popstars including a 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.440
 spot that will be realized and I invite 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.020
 all partners and sponsors 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.470
 who are interested in this project to us 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.630

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.190
 come help us and this project is 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.660

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.270

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.950
 me the election miss world is too much 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.510
 short and miss election cedeao if they 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:13.360
 decide to organize it all 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.360
 simply the miss is already dead and had 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.910
 my next challenge is to become 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.670
 lawyer since it is in the continuity 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.490
 of my work studies and to have some 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.050
 children to start a family from me 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.150

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.830
 someone moment I do not know if these are 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.810
 dreams of desires as I win them 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.820
 in the previous interview 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:41.750
 these two to evolve in that sense of 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:43.310
 become a woman led to people 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.840
 who would like to introduce themselves I know that 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.580
 it's not easy - I have a lot of doubts 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.160
 before I start 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.630
 it 's coming if it's your jacket in 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.310
 velvet here it's not true bessan you 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.600
 do not deceive and that does not depend on 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.190
 almighty but if you do not try 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.990
 for sure, staying at home does not 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.730
 you'll never be elected miss that's for sure ok 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.230
 I trust you come to believe 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.140
 in itself for 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.280
 we will wait for this kind of title and I 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.680
 my journey it's true that I left 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.510
 their account I am one initiated 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.330
 I hesitated but there was a man who 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.890
 helped me a lot kodjo who called me 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.030
 all the time that reassures me and who we 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.010
 is to trust me precisely 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.910
 do not hesitate to throw me and 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.920
 finally it paid 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:24.440
 bleach gives the same advice yes we 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.880
 was waiting for the election 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.440
 koulikoro my fear was the fact that 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.840
 I came late that all 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.490
 candidates were already at the point where they 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.650
 had repeated for several days 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.280
 and that I will arrive the day before 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.810
 election 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.360
 would I be enough 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.530
 ready to win and after 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.440
 it's true I can not announce I know

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.160
 that's what worried me too 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.160
 finally it happened 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.360
 worse I thank them 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.879
