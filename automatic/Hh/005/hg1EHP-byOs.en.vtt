00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.760
 where we will learn how to create this type of cable that you are seeing on the screen 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.439
 I got a day as you want to call you 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.070

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.489
 as legend what I'm going to show you 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.559
 like this one after you see here I did it read 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.280
 I put him 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.990
 these cables around 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.950
 and it gives us a very nice effect 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.670
 well let's start 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.670
 being once our votes we still take file 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.210
 in new 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.159
 we will have a file and I saw it from 6 40 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.130
 4 80 with white background 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.390

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.070
 once ours being which has opened 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.770
 let's go to pen mint larra 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.790
 we click here and another click on another league 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.930
 we choose the tool 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.320
 convert anchor point 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.760
 we move a point up 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.980
 and the other equally 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.950
 staying something like this 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 but let's go to the tool we choose a black color 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.150
 let's see lamented pitcher 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
 we collect from an accomplice the round 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.320
 let's see lamented from pen 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.740
 we create a new layer 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.320
 we click on the trace let's see 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.890
 stroke path 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.050
 of chewing world we framed the simulate pressure box we were going in what 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.610
 we have something like that 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.910
 we stopped olarra lie 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.000
 layout selection 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 let's move another path a little higher 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.859
 we create a new layer 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:11.259
 we choose a white color 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:14.689
 we choose the tool of you being and we lower it 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.689
 a little bit the size 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.069
 now we are going to the tantrum of the pen we click on the path of interest 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.309
 or drawn cotoner 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.989
 we arrive in what we will have something like - tevez 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.199
 now we are going behind we click outside the plot 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.979
 we return to each step 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:48.169
 in the white color layer we go to filters 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.419
 blur 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.389
 blur worm anus 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.549
 and here we move him 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.549
 the sizes as you prefer 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.399
 I give an elbow a size of 4 points 0 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.919
 let's go north 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.689
 on the black twig 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.949
 press the control key 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.249
 We click on the layer to create a selection 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.919
 we go to the tool of form 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.679
 we create a new layer 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:34.029
 being clearly in shape 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:35.209
 we choose 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.689
 here is what is 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.309
 filling form 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:43.719
 we change here the size of 5 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.259
 and we start 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.009
 to create several lines 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:51.009
 just like I'm not doing 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:59.769
 we create several lines 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.569
 I'm doing it a little fast here because she knows we're told 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.900
 the time in the videos on youtube 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.979
 and it does not have or not much 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.979
 space to make them work 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.019
 with a perfection 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.559
 you with more patience can 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:22.559
 do his job 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:27.469
 so they are to your liking 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.309
 well I already had one time like this if we have something like that 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.509
 Let's go to the 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:34.819
 to the layer 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.740
 here to 2015 normal 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.740
 and we give him the luso bird 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.970
 Right click on the layer let's go fusion options 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.559
 the opposition demands the event 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.809
 we click on him elevate them 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.809
 here we change it on device down 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.629
 and depth we give and well 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.020
 and we will have 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.870
 here our cable 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.870
 simply already finishing we selected 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.430
 and we'll have our cable here as you can see 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:29.189
 here is the previous one and here is the one that I just made 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.509
