the<00:00:53.699> game<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:53.910> upgrade<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.020> have

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the game and upgrade and then we have

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.590 
the game and upgrade and then we have
got<00:00:55.410> some<00:00:55.590> win<00:00:55.829> streak<00:00:56.190> bonus<00:00:56.730> upgrades<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.480> we

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
got some win streak bonus upgrades so we

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.599 
got some win streak bonus upgrades so we
would<00:00:57.690> get<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.320> normal<00:00:58.649> upgrades<00:00:59.010> pull

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
would get the normal upgrades pull

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.180 
would get the normal upgrades pull
within<00:00:59.850> those<00:01:00.030> games<00:01:00.359> plus<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.440> extra<00:01:01.620> bonus

within those games plus the extra bonus

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.740 
within those games plus the extra bonus
upgrade<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.699> if<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:02.820> win<00:01:02.940> three<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.300> row<00:01:03.329> we

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
upgrade so if we win three in a row we

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.929 
upgrade so if we win three in a row we
get<00:01:03.870> five<00:01:04.110> upgrades<00:01:04.500> 500<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.100> 8<00:01:05.309> upgrades<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
get five upgrades 500 is 8 upgrades and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.719 
get five upgrades 500 is 8 upgrades and
10<00:01:06.420> arrow<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.380> five<00:01:07.890> bonus<00:01:08.220> upgrades<00:01:08.640> would

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
10 arrow is a five bonus upgrades would

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.060 
10 arrow is a five bonus upgrades would
be<00:01:08.909> 15<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.540> I'm<00:01:09.900> pretty<00:01:10.229> hopeful<00:01:10.680> they're

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
be 15 so I'm pretty hopeful they're

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.149 
be 15 so I'm pretty hopeful they're
probably<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.810> happen<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159

probably not going to happen but you
never<00:01:14.310> know<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.570> definitely<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.320> more

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
to rare bronze you get the idea I've

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.640 
to rare bronze you get the idea I've
done<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> before<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.820> fifa<00:01:30.570> 12<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:31.079> my<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
done it before on fifa 12 with my on the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.080 
done it before on fifa 12 with my on the
trot<00:01:31.860> series<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.700> gonna<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.030> very

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
trot series so it's gonna be very

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.370 
trot series so it's gonna be very
similar<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:33.869> instead<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.229> win

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
similar to that but instead of win

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.170 
similar to that but instead of win
streaks<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.610> goals<00:01:35.880> which<00:01:36.090> i

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
streaks it's going to be goals which i

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.700 
streaks it's going to be goals which i

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
think makes it a little bit more fun and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.370 
think makes it a little bit more fun and
a<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.340> bit<00:01:38.579> more<00:01:38.729> enjoyable<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.930> don't

a little bit more enjoyable now I don't

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.510

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
first opponent a pretty decent serious

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.310 
first opponent a pretty decent serious
team<00:01:53.070> also<00:01:53.310> with<00:01:53.729> big<00:01:53.939> wave<00:01:54.149> he<00:01:54.570> does<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:55.079> a

very shaky defense though and that is
going<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.280> cost<00:01:59.520> him<00:01:59.670> when<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.299> have

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
ahead it was actually a pretty nice

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.460 
ahead it was actually a pretty nice
finish<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.370> must<00:02:59.910> saying<00:03:00.300> because<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.230> had

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
finish I must saying because I had

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.550 
finish I must saying because I had
someone<00:03:01.709> sent<00:03:02.010> off<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.459> had<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.209> gigantic<00:03:04.080> hole

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
someone sent off I had a gigantic hole

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.830 
someone sent off I had a gigantic hole
in<00:03:05.100> my<00:03:05.670> defense<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.180> changed<00:03:06.420> things<00:03:06.660> up

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
in my defense so I changed things up

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.440 
in my defense so I changed things up
pushed<00:03:07.709> my<00:03:07.890> CDM<00:03:08.430> who<00:03:08.730> we<00:03:08.820> starve<00:03:09.090> on<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.270> pitch

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
pushed my CDM who we starve on the pitch

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.009 
pushed my CDM who we starve on the pitch
obviously<00:03:09.810> back<00:03:10.470> into<00:03:11.040> into<00:03:11.670> Center<00:03:11.970> bag<00:03:12.120> and

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
obviously back into into Center bag and

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.110 
obviously back into into Center bag and
that<00:03:13.140> worked<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.590> lot<00:03:14.130> better<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:14.820> do<00:03:14.970> get

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
that worked a lot better and we do get

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.360 
that worked a lot better and we do get
another<00:03:15.480> goal<00:03:15.750> which<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.470> another<00:03:17.100> upgrade

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
another goal which is another upgrade

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.170 
another goal which is another upgrade
currently<00:03:18.360> three<00:03:19.260> upgrades<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.580> make<00:03:20.820> which

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
currently three upgrades to make which

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.650 
currently three upgrades to make which
is<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.680> awesome<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.280> would<00:03:23.400> do<00:03:23.580> those<00:03:23.820> in<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
is so so awesome I would do those in the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.810 
is so so awesome I would do those in the
next<00:03:24.989> episode<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:25.920> had<00:03:26.280> nothing<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.640> do

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.789 
Wayne on an absolute tear gets his
hat-trick<00:03:35.340> ever<00:03:35.970> leave<00:03:36.209> which<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.080> X<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.709> I

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
hat-trick ever leave which is X and I

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.440 
hat-trick ever leave which is X and I
might<00:03:37.980> actually<00:03:38.040> be<00:03:38.220> his<00:03:38.610> fourth<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.120> repair

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
might actually be his fourth to repair

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.039 
might actually be his fourth to repair
I've<00:03:40.320> completely<00:03:40.980> lost<00:03:41.310> cabin<00:03:41.880> unless<00:03:42.420> it<00:03:42.630> is

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
I've completely lost cabin unless it is

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.070 
I've completely lost cabin unless it is
his<00:03:43.590> fourth<00:03:43.920> upgrade<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.880> think<00:03:45.299> this<00:03:45.870> is

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
his fourth upgrade and I think this is

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.350 
his fourth upgrade and I think this is
the<00:03:46.200> one<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.590> counted<00:03:47.070> as<00:03:47.250> an<00:03:47.670> assist<00:03:48.120> not

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
the one that counted as an assist not

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.810 
the one that counted as an assist not
the<00:03:48.480> first<00:03:48.750> one<00:03:48.989> if<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.620> notice<00:03:50.010> he<00:03:50.430> did<00:03:50.610> go<00:03:50.790> on

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
the first one if you notice he did go on

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.460 
the first one if you notice he did go on
a<00:03:50.910> bit<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.150> dribble<00:03:51.450> are<00:03:51.630> other<00:03:51.930> centerfold

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
a bit of a dribble are other centerfold

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.140 
a bit of a dribble are other centerfold
and<00:03:52.709> don't<00:03:53.130> think<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.370> can<00:03:53.610> assist<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:54.060> we

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
and don't think that can assist but we

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.270 
and don't think that can assist but we
do<00:03:54.239> get<00:03:54.360> another<00:03:54.630> upgrade<00:03:54.750> for<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.470> assist<00:03:56.040> as

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
do get another upgrade for the assist as

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.610 
do get another upgrade for the assist as
well<00:03:56.310> which<00:03:56.670> means<00:03:56.910> six<00:03:57.299> available<00:03:57.810> upgrades

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
well which means six available upgrades

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.180 
well which means six available upgrades
we're<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.640> first<00:04:00.330> win<00:04:00.959> streak<00:04:01.500> hi<00:04:01.830> when

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
we're on that first win streak hi when

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.440 
we're on that first win streak hi when
we<00:04:02.310> get<00:04:02.459> our<00:04:02.580> first<00:04:02.610> one<00:04:03.030> which<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:03.209> actually

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
we get our first one which is actually

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.000 
we get our first one which is actually
pretty<00:04:03.840> cool<00:04:04.080> I<00:04:04.140> wasn't<00:04:04.530> too<00:04:04.620> surprised

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
pretty cool I wasn't too surprised

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.580 
pretty cool I wasn't too surprised
because<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.370> opponent<00:04:05.760> had<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.590> reasonable

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
because the opponent had a reasonable

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.250 
because the opponent had a reasonable
team<00:04:07.799> but<00:04:08.100> like<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:08.880> said<00:04:08.940> give<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.720> like<00:04:10.019> if<00:04:10.170> you

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
per game do not worry it won't be just a

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.990 
per game do not worry it won't be just a
one<00:04:16.140> episode<00:04:16.709> thing<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:17.070> can<00:04:17.250> promise<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.820> that
