but<00:02:47.549> some<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.209> scenarios<00:02:48.360> like<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.780> saw<00:02:48.930> one

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
but some of the scenarios like I saw one

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.320 
but some of the scenarios like I saw one
scenario<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.920> bra<00:02:50.190> each<00:02:50.489> team<00:02:50.819> s<00:02:50.940> combined

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
scenario the bra each team s combined

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330 
scenario the bra each team s combined
for<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.599> total<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.959> nine<00:02:52.019> hundred<00:02:52.470> yards<00:02:52.860> that's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
for a total of nine hundred yards that's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.320 
for a total of nine hundred yards that's
probably<00:02:53.610> not<00:02:53.700> gonna<00:02:53.819> happen<00:02:53.910> with<00:02:54.209> the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
probably not gonna happen with the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.670 
probably not gonna happen with the
weather<00:02:54.510> conditions<00:02:55.079> in<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.319> really<00:02:55.560> good

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
weather conditions in a really good

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.220 
weather conditions in a really good
defense<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.099> Seattle<00:02:56.549> so<00:02:57.060> if<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.989> get<00:02:58.110> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
defense in Seattle so if you get the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.839 
defense in Seattle so if you get the
cars<00:02:58.410> like<00:02:58.560> total<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.950> nine<00:02:59.099> hundred<00:02:59.400> yards

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
cars like total of nine hundred yards

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.449 
cars like total of nine hundred yards
and<00:03:00.269> that's<00:03:00.599> more<00:03:00.930> than<00:03:01.110> likely<00:03:01.380> not<00:03:02.220> going<00:03:02.250> to

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
and that's more than likely not going to

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.309 
and that's more than likely not going to
happen<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.269> probably<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.079> get<00:03:04.230> the

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
happen so you probably not to get the

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.110 
happen so you probably not to get the
coin<00:03:04.530> up<00:03:04.680> for<00:03:04.829> that<00:03:04.950> one<00:03:05.069> so<00:03:05.670> what<00:03:05.880> do<00:03:05.970> we<00:03:06.030> need

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
coin up for that one so what do we need

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.759 
coin up for that one so what do we need
