00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello years, class today will be like the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.429
 brazil investing in the ballerina for you 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.250
 is making your birthday charming 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.740
 the guests and friends like all of you 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.900
 Are you asking me then I see today? 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.330
 Ok, so let's see the material that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:28.740
 we will use materials used are 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:30.240
 those here with the template I 've been past 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.550
 paper glue 7 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.540
 I'll start dialing from here until 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.750
 remembering that you can not do this 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.530
 process with a pen and no pencil to 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.110
 Mark 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:54.600
 let's take invisible risks using 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:57.750
 a barbecue stick will look like this 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.149
 Let's start marking all these gomes. 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.149
 have to be aligned 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:13.619
 This is going to be the bottom of our 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:16.320
 duty here with the cast last by 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.950
 paper and marked I'm going to start 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.950
 cut out 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.760
 and I'm cutting all those 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:32.220
 remembering that it has to be a 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.680
 very precise cut nor on top of the drawing 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:41.730
 With all of it already cut I'm going to start 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.730
 to always brown from the outside in 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.610
 I'll do it slowly and always from outside. 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.550
 inside 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.030
 remembering that this goal encourages me 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.820
 marry one on top of the other to make 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.630
 so the pleats of the little dress 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.690
 This is going to be the low 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.590
 brann dudu from the outside in 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.590
 in this sense 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:20.110
 Okay, and we'll continue here and out. 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.780
 inside 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:31.930
 and we have reached the final point here I go 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:36.269
 to make a crease the little dress in the 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.269
 low to result over the previous 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.120
 now using the template that will be 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.780
 top of the dress I'm going to paste 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.780
 right here 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.190
 the template will be available at the link below 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.730
 this video is just you click download on 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.340
 do yours 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.250
 here I am going to stick here in this 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.900
 top alone in the stuffed command so 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.900
 one that will fall 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.690
 OK 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:19.440
 using a tape still in effect 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:25.990
 I'll put it in this back 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:30.490
 and I'll start passing here and I'll cross 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.870
 only the media the size I want I 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:37.270
 I will cut 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:44.970
 Then I'll stick my stick on it and now 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:44.970
 I'll paste here and from here to here 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:58.120
 using the scissors I'm going to cut this 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:00.400
 here diagonally and here too 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.050
 You want to burn the tip is 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.660
 more red 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.890
 I will use more or less about three 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:14.470
 centimeters of the same tape and I'll cut 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:17.620
 here I'll use the same size 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:22.390
 to measure or something capable 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:28.330
 this will not be then invested here 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:33.900
 I cut and used the stick glue 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:36.910
 I'll paste in the middle unites the two parts 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:43.720
 and I will do the same with the other 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:49.920
 Sir, I'll pass some glue on 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.920
 stick over and paste to the sim here 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.770
 do the same thing with the other afternoon 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.880
 How will I try my little dress? 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.009
 I want it to be all just pink 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.669
 I 'll use a pint of 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:13.310
 white paint and I'll start painting 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:16.340
 a lot of polka dots doing so a 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.039
 pink polka dot dress 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.259
 You may be using it's toothpicks. 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.810
 chances for doing this same too 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:28.880
 technique or use another stamping 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:35.050
 that is your preference and so 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.050
 I will not continue voting here. 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.469
 ready 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.559

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:51.129
