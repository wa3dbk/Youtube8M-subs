less latency although I didn't detect
much<00:00:32.160> latency<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> Bluetooth<00:00:33.239> thing

much latency on the Bluetooth thing
we'll<00:00:33.570> check<00:00:33.719> out<00:00:33.840> its<00:00:34.380> game<00:00:34.559> performance<00:00:35.040> in

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
we'll check out its game performance in

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.680 
we'll check out its game performance in
a<00:00:35.219> few<00:00:35.370> minutes<00:00:35.640> now<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> exact<00:00:36.480> same

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
a few minutes now this is the exact same

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.780 
a few minutes now this is the exact same
game<00:00:36.930> controller<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.620> pack<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.160> with

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
game controller that they pack in with

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.760 
game controller that they pack in with
the<00:00:38.910> razor<00:00:39.180> Forge<00:00:39.660> TV<00:00:40.230> which<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.620> their

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the razor Forge TV which is their

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.860 
the razor Forge TV which is their
Android<00:00:41.280> TV<00:00:41.670> game<00:00:41.969> console<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.629> thought

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
Android TV game console that I thought

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.959 
Android TV game console that I thought
was<00:00:43.020> pretty<00:00:43.170> much<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.410> dud<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> controller

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
was pretty much a dud but the controller

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.430 
was pretty much a dud but the controller
actually<00:00:45.390> had<00:00:45.570> some<00:00:45.780> hope<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.200> we're<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.379> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
actually had some hope so we're going to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.930 
actually had some hope so we're going to
look<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.890> independently<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:47.820> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
look at this independently because you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
look at this independently because you
can<00:00:48.210> buy<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.379> standalone<00:00:49.950> product

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
can buy this as a standalone product

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.060 
can buy this as a standalone product
this<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.840> $79<00:00:51.840> though<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.350> very<00:00:52.590> expensive

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
this is $79 though so it very expensive

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.490 
this is $79 though so it very expensive
for<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> game<00:00:54.329> controller<00:00:54.750> especially<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
for a game controller especially on the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.139 
for a game controller especially on the
PC<00:00:55.829> side<00:00:56.039> when<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.430> get<00:00:56.489> an<00:00:56.640> Xbox<00:00:57.030> one

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
PC side when you can get an Xbox one

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.970 
PC side when you can get an Xbox one
controller<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.899> almost<00:00:58.079> half<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.440> price

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
controller for almost half that price

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 
controller for almost half that price
there<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.760> some<00:00:59.969> unique<00:01:00.210> features<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.719> this

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
there are some unique features to this

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.479 
there are some unique features to this
despite<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.500> fact<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.070> kind<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.219> looks

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
despite the fact that it kind of looks

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.189 
despite the fact that it kind of looks
like<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.699> normal<00:01:03.090> game<00:01:03.239> controller<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.809> that

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
like a normal game controller and that

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.020 
like a normal game controller and that
is<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> button<00:01:05.010> travel<00:01:05.580> you're<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
is the button travel you're going to

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.250 
is the button travel you're going to
love<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.240> are<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.689> hate<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.140> by

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
love it are you going to hate it so by

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.289 
love it are you going to hate it so by
travel<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> mean<00:01:07.860> how<00:01:07.979> far<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.520> button<00:01:09.119> gets

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
travel I mean how far a button gets

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.810 
travel I mean how far a button gets
pushed<00:01:09.570> down<00:01:09.830> before<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.920> registers<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
pushed down before it registers so the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.510 
pushed down before it registers so the
travel<00:01:12.150> time<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.110> main<00:01:13.770> buttons<00:01:14.159> here<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
travel time on the main buttons here the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.640 
travel time on the main buttons here the
action<00:01:14.820> buttons<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.720> very<00:01:16.049> very<00:01:16.290> small

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
action buttons are is very very small

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.499 
action buttons are is very very small
and<00:01:16.890> they've<00:01:17.189> got<00:01:17.369> mechanical<00:01:17.970> switches<00:01:18.240> on

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
and they've got mechanical switches on

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.789 
and they've got mechanical switches on
it<00:01:18.659> also<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.290> really<00:01:19.560> want<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
it also so if you really want to

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.010 
it also so if you really want to
rapid-fire<00:01:20.159> push<00:01:20.670> very<00:01:20.820> quickly<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.840> will

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
rapid-fire push very quickly this will

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.539 
rapid-fire push very quickly this will
lend<00:01:22.170> itself<00:01:22.439> very<00:01:22.710> well<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.490> if

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
lend itself very well to that but if

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.070 
lend itself very well to that but if
you're<00:01:23.670> accustomed<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.360> longer<00:01:24.720> travel

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
you're accustomed to the longer travel

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.450 
you're accustomed to the longer travel
times<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.530> might<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:25.920> an<00:01:26.189> Xbox

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
times you might see on an Xbox

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.520 
times you might see on an Xbox

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
controller with buttons are a little bit

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.319 
controller with buttons are a little bit
squishy<00:01:28.829> or<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.189> may<00:01:29.310> not<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.909> because

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
squishy or you may not like this because

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
squishy or you may not like this because
this<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.780> very<00:01:31.740> very<00:01:32.009> much<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.159> hairpin

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
this really is very very much a hairpin

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.890 
this really is very very much a hairpin
kind<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.909> trigger<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.720> it's

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
kind of trigger on it and it's

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.600 
kind of trigger on it and it's
mechanical<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.040> nice<00:01:35.189> quality

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
mechanical so if that's a nice quality

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.950 
mechanical so if that's a nice quality
feel<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.509> hear<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> clicking

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
feel to it you can hear it clicking

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.230 
feel to it you can hear it clicking
there<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.380> really<00:01:37.530> pretty<00:01:37.770> nice<00:01:38.240> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
there it's really pretty nice the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.880 
there it's really pretty nice the
control<00:01:39.659> sticks<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.049> both<00:01:40.229> pushed<00:01:40.500> down<00:01:40.710> as

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
control sticks here both pushed down as

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
control sticks here both pushed down as
well<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:41.700> bit<00:01:41.880> stiffer<00:01:42.150> than<00:01:42.240> they<00:01:42.450> feel

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
well a little bit stiffer than they feel

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.300 
well a little bit stiffer than they feel
like<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.930> Xbox<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> little<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.159> more

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
like on the Xbox but a little bit more

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.160 
like on the Xbox but a little bit more
precise<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.090> because<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.960> kind<00:01:46.140> of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
precise to because of that so I kind of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.230 
precise to because of that so I kind of
like<00:01:46.350> those<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.130> don't<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> travel

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
like those but I don't like the travel

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.999 
like those but I don't like the travel
on<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.689> directional<00:01:49.200> pad<00:01:49.259> here<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.890> this

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
on the directional pad here so this

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.980 
on the directional pad here so this
actually<00:01:50.460> does<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> lot<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.210> travel<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
actually does have a lot of travel to it

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.300 
actually does have a lot of travel to it
and<00:01:52.170> when<00:01:52.500> I'm<00:01:52.590> playing<00:01:52.740> some<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> retro

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and when I'm playing some of the retro

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.490 
and when I'm playing some of the retro
games<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:53.970> hard<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.659> move<00:01:55.290> my

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
games it's really hard to move my

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.200 
games it's really hard to move my
character<00:01:55.950> around<00:01:56.189> precisely<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:57.030> you

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
character around precisely because you

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.389 
character around precisely because you
are<00:01:57.570> having<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.170> hard<00:01:58.350> time<00:01:58.409> once<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.310> of

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
are having a hard time once the one of

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.370 
are having a hard time once the one of
these<00:01:59.520> arrow<00:02:00.119> directional<00:02:00.780> things<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.140> pushed

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
these arrow directional things is pushed

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.109 
these arrow directional things is pushed
in<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:02.009> hard<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.549> get<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:02.790> thumb

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
in it's hard to kind of get your thumb

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.700 
in it's hard to kind of get your thumb
back<00:02:03.299> over<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> other<00:02:04.110> direction<00:02:04.500> because

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
back over to the other direction because

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.160 
back over to the other direction because
there<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.130> some<00:02:06.090> degree<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.390> time<00:02:06.659> actually<00:02:06.930> in

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
there is some degree of time actually in

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.570 
there is some degree of time actually in
milliseconds<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.770> course<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.220> takes<00:02:08.399> to

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
milliseconds of course that it takes to

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.790 
milliseconds of course that it takes to
just<00:02:08.700> kind<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.090> get<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.479> push<00:02:10.200> down<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
just kind of get that push down so it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.619 
just kind of get that push down so it
can<00:02:10.830> register<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.760> little<00:02:12.030> bit<00:02:12.209> too

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
can register so it's a little bit too

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.880 
can register so it's a little bit too
much<00:02:12.750> travel<00:02:13.200> here<00:02:13.590> and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
much travel here and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.440 
much travel here and
not<00:02:13.950> enough<00:02:14.190> travel<00:02:14.580> here<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.819> guess<00:02:15.060> for<00:02:15.300> me

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
not enough travel here I guess for me

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.360 
not enough travel here I guess for me
but<00:02:15.660> maybe<00:02:15.810> your<00:02:16.080> preferences<00:02:16.830> or<00:02:17.010> gameplay

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
but maybe your preferences or gameplay

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.740 
but maybe your preferences or gameplay
might<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.790> different<00:02:18.120> especially<00:02:18.180> using

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
might be different especially using

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.820 
might be different especially using
sticks<00:02:19.020> mostly<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.440> think<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.650> might<00:02:19.800> like

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
sticks mostly I think you might like

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.230 
sticks mostly I think you might like
this<00:02:20.190> because<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> little<00:02:20.940> bit<00:02:21.060> more

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
this because it is a little bit more

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.120 
this because it is a little bit more
precise<00:02:21.630> due<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.200> stiffness<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:23.040> have

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
precise due to the stiffness you have

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.620 
precise due to the stiffness you have
some<00:02:23.250> Android<00:02:23.700> controls<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.540> have

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
some Android controls here so you have

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.510 
some Android controls here so you have
your<00:02:24.720> back<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:24.990> home<00:02:25.319> buttons<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:25.980> you've

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
your back and home buttons here you've

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.070 
your back and home buttons here you've
got<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> power<00:02:26.970> button<00:02:27.060> for<00:02:27.270> turning<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:27.810> as

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
got a power button for turning it on as

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.080 
got a power button for turning it on as
well<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.500> some<00:02:28.800> buttons<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.730> can<00:02:29.760> map

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
well as some buttons you can map

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.060 
well as some buttons you can map
specifically<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:31.020> certain<00:02:31.290> games<00:02:31.530> if<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:31.890> so

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
specifically in certain games if you so

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.650 
specifically in certain games if you so
choose<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.610> powered<00:02:32.970> by<00:02:33.000> double-a

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
choose it is powered by double-a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.630 
choose it is powered by double-a
batteries<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.680> don't<00:02:34.950> need<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.280> double-a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
batteries you don't need the double-a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.720 
batteries you don't need the double-a
batteries<00:02:36.120> when<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.510> are<00:02:36.660> playing<00:02:36.990> with<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
batteries when you are playing with a

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
batteries when you are playing with a
USB<00:02:38.730> connection<00:02:39.090> but<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.420> will<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.690> course

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
USB connection but you will of course

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.720 
USB connection but you will of course
need<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.260> if<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.560> are<00:02:40.590> going<00:02:40.709> Wireless<00:02:41.550> and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
need it if you are going Wireless and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.160 
need it if you are going Wireless and
like<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.940> Xbox<00:02:42.300> controller<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.870> get<00:02:43.020> two

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
like the Xbox controller you get two

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.350 
like the Xbox controller you get two
analog<00:02:43.590> triggers<00:02:43.830> on<00:02:44.130> both<00:02:44.310> sides<00:02:44.580> as<00:02:44.790> well<00:02:45.209> as

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
analog triggers on both sides as well as

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.640 
analog triggers on both sides as well as
two<00:02:45.540> buttons<00:02:45.900> up<00:02:46.050> top<00:02:46.080> here<00:02:46.470> what's

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
two buttons up top here what's

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.260 
two buttons up top here what's
interesting<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.280> travel<00:02:47.610> time<00:02:47.790> on<00:02:48.030> these

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
interesting is the travel time on these

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.240 
interesting is the travel time on these
two<00:02:48.480> switches<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.440> little<00:02:49.709> bit<00:02:49.830> more<00:02:50.040> than

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
two switches is a little bit more than

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.430 
two switches is a little bit more than
it<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.480> buttons<00:02:51.780> here<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.170> front

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
it is on the buttons here on the front

phone so that's kind of a nice feature
so<00:03:08.940> what<00:03:09.030> we're<00:03:09.120> going<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.300> do<00:03:09.390> now<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.810> boot<00:03:10.080> up

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
so what we're going to do now is boot up

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.229 
so what we're going to do now is boot up
a<00:03:10.260> couple<00:03:10.440> games<00:03:10.739> on<00:03:10.920> my<00:03:11.010> Mac<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.580> on<00:03:11.790> my<00:03:12.000> phone

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
a couple games on my Mac and on my phone

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.060 
a couple games on my Mac and on my phone
and<00:03:12.420> see<00:03:12.570> how<00:03:12.660> this<00:03:12.810> performs<00:03:13.170> all<00:03:13.890> right<00:03:13.980> I've

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
and see how this performs all right I've

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.440 
and see how this performs all right I've
got<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.220> game<00:03:14.489> controller<00:03:14.850> connected<00:03:15.300> via

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
got the game controller connected via

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.780 
got the game controller connected via
bluetooth<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:16.140> my<00:03:16.260> LG<00:03:16.709> g4<00:03:17.280> here<00:03:17.550> as<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.760> can

bluetooth to my LG g4 here as you can

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.400 
bluetooth to my LG g4 here as you can
see<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.150> latency<00:03:18.510> doesn't<00:03:18.810> seem<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.110> be<00:03:19.200> all

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
see the latency doesn't seem to be all

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.229 
see the latency doesn't seem to be all

issue I am running into though is the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.930 
issue I am running into though is the
fact<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.380> travel<00:03:32.310> time<00:03:32.519> on<00:03:32.790> this

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
fact that the travel time on this

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.240 
fact that the travel time on this
directional<00:03:33.450> pad<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.079> bad<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.410> you

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
directional pad is so bad that you

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.580 
directional pad is so bad that you
really<00:03:35.579> have<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.910> kind<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.900> push<00:03:37.170> down<00:03:37.350> pretty

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
really have to kind of push down pretty

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.960 
really have to kind of push down pretty
far<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:37.890> get<00:03:38.130> signing<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.579> move<00:03:38.760> in<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
far to get signing to move in the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.520 
far to get signing to move in the
direction<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.510> want<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.810> go<00:03:39.930> into<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.440> it

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
direction that you want to go into so it

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.560 
direction that you want to go into so it
is<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.739> little<00:03:41.100> bit<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.549> lag<00:03:41.820> in<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.239> sense

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
is a little bit of a lag in that sense

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.930 
is a little bit of a lag in that sense
not<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.049> much<00:03:43.170> in<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.470> input<00:03:44.280> delay<00:03:44.459> but<00:03:44.730> just

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
not so much in the input delay but just

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.090 
not so much in the input delay but just
the<00:03:45.090> hardware<00:03:45.930> design<00:03:46.290> here<00:03:46.500> kind<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.769> getting

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
the hardware design here kind of getting

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.370 
the hardware design here kind of getting
in<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.370> way<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.820> enjoying<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.750> retro<00:03:49.170> game

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
in the way of enjoying this retro game

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.840 
in the way of enjoying this retro game
and<00:03:49.590> now<00:03:49.709> we're<00:03:49.920> going<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.070> do<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.400> check<00:03:50.610> out<00:03:50.820> a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
and now we're going to do is check out a

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.000 
and now we're going to do is check out a
game<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.480> uses<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.959> control<00:03:52.470> stick<00:03:52.769> so

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
game that uses the control stick so

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.160 
game that uses the control stick so
let's<00:03:53.160> see<00:03:53.340> how<00:03:53.549> bomb-squad<00:03:54.209> works<00:03:54.690> on<00:03:54.930> here

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
let's see how bomb-squad works on here

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.330 
let's see how bomb-squad works on here
will<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:55.440> resume<00:03:55.680> my<00:03:55.860> game<00:03:56.070> here<00:03:56.250> I'm

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
will just resume my game here I'm

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.340 
will just resume my game here I'm
getting<00:03:56.430> blown<00:03:56.730> up<00:03:56.790> as<00:03:57.120> things<00:03:57.840> are<00:03:57.959> happening

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
getting blown up as things are happening

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.449 
getting blown up as things are happening
but<00:03:58.470> here's<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.739> control<00:03:59.100> stick<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.430> can

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
but here's the control stick you can

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.250 
but here's the control stick you can
kind<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.700> see<00:03:59.910> how<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.150> performs<00:04:00.720> but

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
kind of see how that performs but

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.930 
kind of see how that performs but
because<00:04:01.560> they<00:04:01.709> are<00:04:01.920> kind<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.250> stiff<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.700> get

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
because they are kind of stiff you get

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.270 
because they are kind of stiff you get
some<00:04:03.150> really<00:04:03.690> fine<00:04:04.019> control<00:04:04.560> on<00:04:04.799> here<00:04:05.130> and<00:04:05.220> I

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
some really fine control on here and I

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.490 
some really fine control on here and I
do<00:04:05.340> kind<00:04:05.700> of<00:04:05.730> like<00:04:06.000> how<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.720> control<00:04:07.230> sticks

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
do kind of like how the control sticks

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500 
do kind of like how the control sticks
feel<00:04:07.680> certainly<00:04:08.010> more<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.489> than<00:04:08.760> the

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
feel certainly more so than the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.630 
feel certainly more so than the
directional<00:04:10.200> pad<00:04:10.380> does<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:11.220> buttons<00:04:11.489> here

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
directional pad does the buttons here

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.069 
directional pad does the buttons here
are<00:04:11.760> fine<00:04:12.000> again<00:04:12.390> it's<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.690> know<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.870> travel

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
are fine again it's you know the travel

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.449 
are fine again it's you know the travel
time<00:04:13.290> on<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.470> buttons<00:04:13.739> is<00:04:13.859> short<00:04:14.130> but<00:04:14.250> if<00:04:14.370> you

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
time on the buttons is short but if you

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.340 
time on the buttons is short but if you
have<00:04:14.579> like<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.790> real<00:04:15.480> quick<00:04:15.750> shooter<00:04:16.049> kind<00:04:16.260> of

here from the controller or at least

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.590 
here from the controller or at least
take<00:04:26.430> off<00:04:26.580> its<00:04:26.849> little<00:04:27.090> mounting

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
take off its little mounting

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.810

about the mounting bracket actually

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.960 
about the mounting bracket actually
because<00:04:31.440> it<00:04:31.860> doesn't<00:04:32.160> feel<00:04:32.250> like<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.580> can<00:04:32.730> do

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
because it doesn't feel like you can do

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.550 
because it doesn't feel like you can do
this<00:04:33.150> too<00:04:33.390> many<00:04:33.480> times<00:04:33.600> before<00:04:34.050> something<00:04:34.470> is

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
this too many times before something is

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.290 
this too many times before something is

going to snap off it really secures in

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.270 
going to snap off it really secures in
quite<00:04:37.140> well<00:04:37.170> and<00:04:37.620> I'm<00:04:37.710> not<00:04:37.740> sure<00:04:38.070> how<00:04:38.250> long

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
quite well and I'm not sure how long

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.070 
quite well and I'm not sure how long
that's<00:04:38.670> going<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:38.880> last<00:04:39.090> for<00:04:39.240> now<00:04:39.810> when<00:04:39.990> you

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
that's going to last for now when you

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.230 
that's going to last for now when you
plug<00:04:40.350> in<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.620> USB<00:04:40.770> cable<00:04:41.460> it<00:04:41.610> will<00:04:41.790> override

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
plug in the USB cable it will override

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.850 
plug in the USB cable it will override
the<00:04:42.420> Bluetooth<00:04:43.050> so<00:04:43.230> it'll<00:04:43.380> disable<00:04:43.770> the

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
the Bluetooth so it'll disable the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.350 
the Bluetooth so it'll disable the
Bluetooth<00:04:43.950> connection<00:04:44.670> to<00:04:44.760> whatever<00:04:44.910> device

that<00:04:45.540> you<00:04:45.630> have<00:04:45.660> then<00:04:46.560> we'll<00:04:46.710> connect<00:04:47.040> up<00:04:47.190> to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
that you have then we'll connect up to

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.010 
that you have then we'll connect up to
the<00:04:47.430> computers<00:04:47.910> we've<00:04:48.090> got<00:04:48.270> my<00:04:48.390> Mac<00:04:48.660> running

the computers we've got my Mac running
here<00:04:49.290> with<00:04:49.860> Sonic<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.220> Hedgehog<00:04:50.640> I'll<00:04:50.820> hit

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
here with Sonic the Hedgehog I'll hit

here with Sonic the Hedgehog I'll hit
the<00:04:51.000> start<00:04:51.270> button<00:04:51.300> here<00:04:51.660> as<00:04:51.780> you<00:04:51.900> can<00:04:51.930> see<00:04:52.230> we

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
the start button here as you can see we

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.460 
the start button here as you can see we
are<00:04:52.980> now<00:04:53.130> playing<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.880> game<00:04:54.150> here<00:04:54.510> on<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.720> the

are now playing the game here on the the
Mac<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:55.860> everything<00:04:56.220> seems<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.580> be<00:04:56.670> working

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
Mac and everything seems to be working

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.400 
Mac and everything seems to be working
pretty<00:04:57.120> well<00:04:57.390> on<00:04:57.630> there<00:04:57.960> although<00:04:58.230> I<00:04:58.290> don't

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
pretty well on there although I don't

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.100 
pretty well on there although I don't
play<00:04:58.740> very<00:04:58.920> well<00:04:59.040> at<00:04:59.460> all<00:04:59.700> so<00:05:00.270> up<00:05:00.720> you<00:05:00.900> can<00:05:01.020> get

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
play very well at all so up you can get

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.650 
play very well at all so up you can get
a<00:05:01.140> feel<00:05:01.350> for<00:05:01.590> how<00:05:02.190> things<00:05:02.460> are<00:05:03.210> performing

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
a feel for how things are performing

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.910 
a feel for how things are performing
here<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.840> Mac<00:05:03.990> is<00:05:04.140> being<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.380> little<00:05:04.500> bit<00:05:04.620> laggy

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
here the Mac is being a little bit laggy

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.530 
here the Mac is being a little bit laggy
this<00:05:05.220> evening<00:05:05.520> for<00:05:05.640> some<00:05:05.700> reason<00:05:06.120> so<00:05:06.270> this<00:05:06.420> is

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
this evening for some reason so this is

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.150 
this evening for some reason so this is
not<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.840> controller's<00:05:07.320> issue<00:05:07.530> but<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:08.010> Mac

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
not the controller's issue but the Mac

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.560 
not the controller's issue but the Mac
is<00:05:08.340> just<00:05:08.520> acting<00:05:08.820> up<00:05:08.910> here<00:05:09.060> my<00:05:09.210> little<00:05:09.330> Mac

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
is just acting up here my little Mac

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.660 
is just acting up here my little Mac
needs<00:05:09.780> to<00:05:09.930> get<00:05:10.110> refreshed<00:05:10.530> but<00:05:10.920> again<00:05:11.520> with

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
needs to get refreshed but again with

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.880 
needs to get refreshed but again with
the<00:05:11.760> USB<00:05:12.030> cable<00:05:12.180> plugged<00:05:12.720> in<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:12.960> can<00:05:13.080> see<00:05:13.290> the

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
the USB cable plugged in you can see the

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.740 
the USB cable plugged in you can see the
latency<00:05:14.250> here<00:05:14.400> is<00:05:14.550> pretty<00:05:14.790> pretty<00:05:15.180> decent<00:05:15.630> on

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
latency here is pretty pretty decent on

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.510 
latency here is pretty pretty decent on
the<00:05:16.500> button<00:05:16.800> pushes<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:17.280> that<00:05:17.370> would<00:05:17.460> be

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
the button pushes and that would be

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.340 
the button pushes and that would be
expected<00:05:17.940> because<00:05:18.060> we<00:05:18.210> do<00:05:18.480> have<00:05:18.660> a<00:05:18.720> hardwired

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
expected because we do have a hardwired

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.860 
expected because we do have a hardwired
connection<00:05:19.770> here<00:05:20.250> so<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.730> is<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.570> Razer

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
connection here so that is the Razer

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.960 
connection here so that is the Razer
serval<00:05:22.500> not<00:05:22.650> a<00:05:22.680> bad<00:05:22.920> controller<00:05:23.430> it<00:05:23.610> does<00:05:23.790> have

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
serval not a bad controller it does have

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.210 
serval not a bad controller it does have
some<00:05:24.660> pretty<00:05:25.140> nice<00:05:25.320> hardware<00:05:25.830> design

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
some pretty nice hardware design

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.980 
some pretty nice hardware design
especially<00:05:26.490> around<00:05:26.790> the<00:05:27.150> mechanical<00:05:27.660> buttons

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
especially around the mechanical buttons

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.480 
especially around the mechanical buttons
here<00:05:28.170> on<00:05:28.350> the<00:05:28.560> front<00:05:29.010> of<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.130> controller

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
here on the front of the controller

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.300 
here on the front of the controller
although<00:05:29.790> the<00:05:30.360> price<00:05:30.660> is<00:05:30.930> high<00:05:31.170> $80<00:05:32.010> for<00:05:32.250> a

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
although the price is high $80 for a

although the price is high $80 for a
game<00:05:32.640> controller<00:05:33.090> is<00:05:33.690> quite<00:05:33.960> steep

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
game controller is quite steep

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.450 
game controller is quite steep
especially<00:05:34.770> for<00:05:34.950> one<00:05:35.070> that's<00:05:35.220> kind<00:05:35.400> of

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
especially for one that's kind of

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.270 
especially for one that's kind of
targeted<00:05:35.940> towards<00:05:36.210> mobile<00:05:36.570> it<00:05:36.660> will<00:05:36.810> work<00:05:37.020> on

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
targeted towards mobile it will work on

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.910 
targeted towards mobile it will work on
PCs<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:38.520> Macs<00:05:38.850> as<00:05:39.060> well<00:05:39.300> but<00:05:39.570> I<00:05:39.840> feel<00:05:40.680> like<00:05:40.800> it

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
PCs and Macs as well but I feel like it

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.290 
PCs and Macs as well but I feel like it
should<00:05:41.070> cost<00:05:41.280> a<00:05:41.460> little<00:05:41.580> bit<00:05:41.700> less<00:05:42.000> than<00:05:42.180> it

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
should cost a little bit less than it
