00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:18.310
 noiteiros she talks to have value 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.050
 Calm, you're wrong on the program today. 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.760
 I 'm myself introducing luciana 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.400
 benatti for a very special reason 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.289
 the program is completing one year of 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.919
 life fell to do something very 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.890
 Special 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.990
 so I thought the following why myself 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.090
 do not open the program and I 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.130
 even if not interviewed 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.520
 the following when I suggested this idea to 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:47.380
 production none of them objected to because 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:53.010
 the idea of â€‹â€‹mine and I is not production like 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.010
 says the saying who says concept looks only 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.850
 I wanted to be happier still here 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.100
 today is that because it is a talk show 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.809
 I can do something that there is 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.479
 long time I can not do mine 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.630

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.400

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.530

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:31.610
