00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
it's a big deal for me that it's like a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.940 
it's a big deal for me that it's like a
couple<00:00:42.750> inches<00:00:42.899> longer<00:00:43.260> than<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.620> normally<00:00:43.710> is

and I'm really really excited and I will
say<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:46.800> off<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.190> bat<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.670> think

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
say right off the bat that I think

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.950 
say right off the bat that I think
pregnancy<00:00:48.660> had<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.260> lot<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.789> do<00:00:50.969> with<00:00:51.300> my<00:00:51.660> hair

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
pregnancy had a lot to do with my hair

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.220 
pregnancy had a lot to do with my hair
like<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:53.250> looking<00:00:53.820> better<00:00:54.120> they<00:00:54.870> say<00:00:55.079> when

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
like just looking better they say when

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.420 
like just looking better they say when
you're<00:00:55.350> pregnant<00:00:55.530> your<00:00:55.770> hair<00:00:55.949> doesn't<00:00:56.129> fall

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
you're pregnant your hair doesn't fall

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.189 
you're pregnant your hair doesn't fall
out<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.000> think<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.420> very<00:00:57.660> true<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:58.079> me

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
out and I think that's very true for me

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.170 
out and I think that's very true for me
because<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.739> lot<00:00:58.890> thicker<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> also

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
because it's a lot thicker but it also

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.939 
because it's a lot thicker but it also
grew<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.960> i<00:01:00.989> don't<00:01:01.199> know<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.320> that's<00:01:01.530> also

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
grew so i don't know if that's also

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.200 
grew so i don't know if that's also
because<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.250> pregnancy<00:01:02.699> or<00:01:02.730> some<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
because the pregnancy or some of the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.340 
because the pregnancy or some of the
other<00:01:03.329> things<00:01:03.420> I've<00:01:03.719> been<00:01:03.750> doing<00:01:03.870> differently

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
other things I've been doing differently

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.570

day where I just try not to put any
heavy<00:02:32.920> makeup<00:02:33.880> on<00:02:34.030> my<00:02:34.150> face<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.720> try<00:02:34.989> and

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
heavy makeup on my face so I try and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.140 
heavy makeup on my face so I try and
avoid<00:02:35.260> foundation<00:02:35.950> or<00:02:36.220> concealer<00:02:36.250> or<00:02:36.850> powder

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
avoid foundation or concealer or powder

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.270 
avoid foundation or concealer or powder
or<00:02:37.330> anything<00:02:37.630> like<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:37.780> try<00:02:38.470> my<00:02:38.680> my<00:02:38.800> skin<00:02:39.040> for

or anything like that try my my skin for
you<00:02:39.370> now<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:39.850> think<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.209> same<00:02:40.450> goes<00:02:40.720> with<00:02:40.750> hair

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
you now I think the same goes with hair

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.930 
you now I think the same goes with hair
you<00:02:41.500> should<00:02:41.530> give<00:02:41.800> your<00:02:41.950> hair<00:02:42.130> hair<00:02:42.430> holidays

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
you should give your hair hair holidays

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.960 
you should give your hair hair holidays
so<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.630> means<00:02:43.840> just<00:02:44.140> let<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.620> air<00:02:44.830> dry

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
so that means just let it air dry

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.400 
so that means just let it air dry
naturally<00:02:45.970> don't<00:02:46.269> put<00:02:46.450> heat<00:02:46.720> on<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:47.019> don't<00:02:47.260> put

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
few tiny little highlights um then not

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:37.430

probably make your hair a little bit

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.740 
probably make your hair a little bit
better<00:04:37.650> just<00:04:38.130> a<00:04:38.250> thought<00:04:38.280> this<00:04:38.940> is<00:04:39.120> taken<00:04:39.600> me

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
better just a thought this is taken me

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.530 
better just a thought this is taken me
like<00:04:40.200> a<00:04:40.500> long<00:04:40.950> time<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.790> get<00:04:41.940> my<00:04:42.120> hair<00:04:42.330> in<00:04:42.419> this

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
like a long time to get my hair in this

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.930 
like a long time to get my hair in this
length<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.169> by<00:04:43.500> no<00:04:43.560> means<00:04:43.919> is<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.130> perfect<00:04:44.729> or

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
length and by no means is it perfect or

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.180 
length and by no means is it perfect or
anything<00:04:45.300> like<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.510> but<00:04:46.080> I<00:04:46.320> did<00:04:46.770> make<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:46.950> lot

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
anything like that but I did make a lot

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.560 
anything like that but I did make a lot
of<00:04:47.220> changes<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:47.940> doing<00:04:48.120> a<00:04:48.180> lot<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.330> things

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
of changes and doing a lot of things

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.090 
of changes and doing a lot of things
differently<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.139> I<00:04:49.229> think<00:04:49.470> that<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.950> know

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
differently and I think that you know

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.310 
differently and I think that you know
it's<00:04:50.340> paying<00:04:50.850> off<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.240> hope<00:04:51.419> well<00:04:51.810> for<00:04:51.990> me<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.200> is

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
it's paying off I hope well for me it is

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.730 
it's paying off I hope well for me it is
anyway<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:53.340> um<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:54.540> means<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:54.930> being<00:04:55.260> super

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
anyway so um that means that being super

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.320 
anyway so um that means that being super
patient<00:04:55.919> when<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.340> comes<00:04:56.490> through<00:04:56.729> here<00:04:56.970> I'm

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
patient when it comes through here I'm

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.180 
patient when it comes through here I'm
eat<00:04:57.690> really<00:04:57.870> healthy<00:04:57.990> obviously<00:04:58.889> I<00:04:58.919> think

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.640
