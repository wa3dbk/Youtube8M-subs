00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
can see that there is plenty of crema

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.010 
can see that there is plenty of crema
even<00:02:02.090> though<00:02:02.180> this<00:02:02.300> is<00:02:02.510> week<00:02:03.290> old<00:02:03.619> coffee<00:02:04.490> and

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.710 

notations

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.050 

good<00:02:13.350> it<00:02:13.500> might<00:02:13.620> be<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.800> tiny<00:02:14.400> little<00:02:14.580> bit<00:02:14.790> sour

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
good it might be a tiny little bit sour

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.460 
good it might be a tiny little bit sour
and<00:02:15.390> I'm<00:02:15.540> not<00:02:15.660> sure<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:15.900> that's<00:02:16.020> because<00:02:16.200> i'm

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and I'm not sure if that's because i'm

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.100 
and I'm not sure if that's because i'm
under<00:02:16.740> roasting<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.820> or<00:02:18.330> because<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:18.870> not

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
under roasting it or because it's not

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.630 
under roasting it or because it's not
hot<00:02:19.380> enough<00:02:19.410> but<00:02:19.860> i<00:02:19.890> think<00:02:20.160> it's<00:02:20.280> plenty<00:02:20.610> hot

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
hot enough but i think it's plenty hot

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.550 
hot enough but i think it's plenty hot
enough<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:22.280> enjoy<00:02:23.280> your<00:02:23.400> coffee
