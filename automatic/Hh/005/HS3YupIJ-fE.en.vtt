00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.270
 to everyone of lunch and sia and 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.309
 Welcome to a trick mode 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.439
 multiplayer of grand theft auto 5 and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.170
 this trick is to walk under the 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.390
 map of gta 5 valuable throughout the map 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.520
 we can walk there may be some 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.950
 limitation and we can go back to the map but 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.230
 I think not because basically everything 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.630
 it is quite higher than normal but 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.279
 even so I think that there is possibly 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.200
 some limitation but anyway 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.390
 we can shoot from here we can 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.820
 kill can not do anything to us the police 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.740
 neither the enemies nor anything like that vargas 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.910
 he's pretty handsome to troll and so 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.100
 Well, let's start with the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.080
 tutorial then good all the first thing that 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.640
 we will have to do is come to this 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.950
 place of the map is worth this trick 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.780
 just the same as the one you already 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.280
 come up another day this one of flying and power 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 go above the water all this is worth 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.850
 so if you have not seen it then only 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.340
 I'll leave it in the description if you want 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.800
 see it and well then what we would have to 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.530
 to do is to hit us right on the wall 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.960
 ok we give the button r1 and if you are from 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.759
 xbox as the xbox yours is worth 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.159
 now I do not know what it is and well then we 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.850
 we stick to the wall and we go quickly 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.500
 until 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.390
 another tip more or less where I have arrived 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.950
 I have to do it fast because if it goes 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.409
 little by little you may not get there 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.060
 at the end it's worth it because it stays like that 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.950
 to do it quickly and when 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.540
 you get right up here because you 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.490
 you give the point button is worth to point 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.440
 towards the wall and let's go then 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.810
 the doll will start to rise a little 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.180
 as you saw then we move away another 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.770
 once we go back to the shore and now we 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.280
 we will have to position more or less 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.110
 where am I worth here and then 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.970
 now we will do the trick of flying like this 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.740
 say what I already taught you then 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.850
 when you see that we're going here because 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.649
 it has to be another one it has to be 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.600
 right up to that point of the ramp 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.979
 because I'm going up a bit more then we do not 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.899
 we can go back down and we have to 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.700
 do the trick again so when 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.380
 do this, we will have to come 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.970
 exactly where I'm going I'm worth 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.860
 and when you reach height and then 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.619
 we have to turn here to the right 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.810
 where are one of the fences these and 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.429
 here then there is a wal break worth a room 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.500
 secret that I already went up on my channel 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.630
 secondary a long time ago but good 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.610
 now let's take advantage of it because if we 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.489
 we turn around here we can go through 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.980
 all the map and be able to go below 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.390
 the whole map if we did 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.860
 this, what would happen is that we 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.290
 will fall 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.330
 and until we reach a point in the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.130
 that we appear inside the map so 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.930
 if we do this trick, we will not go down 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.520
 never and then we can then from 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.050
 here to kill people or we can do what 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.940
 that we want and apart that we do not 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.320
 would not catch the police or anything like that 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.810
