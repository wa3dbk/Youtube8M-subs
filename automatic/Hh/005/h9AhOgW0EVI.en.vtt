nice<00:02:54.630> long<00:02:55.630> mix<00:02:56.080> like<00:02:56.500> that<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:01.540> can<00:03:01.720> look

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
nice long mix like that you can look

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:14.070 
nice long mix like that you can look
your<00:03:02.320> duck<00:03:02.590> because<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.489> just<00:03:03.640> want<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.850> be<00:03:13.080> it

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
your duck because you just want to be it

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.759 
your duck because you just want to be it
works<00:03:14.880> pretty<00:03:15.880> good<00:03:16.060> if<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.200> want<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.440> go<00:03:17.560> back

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
works pretty good if you want to go back

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.470 
works pretty good if you want to go back
and<00:03:17.980> stop<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.580> sample<00:03:19.000> that's<00:03:19.120> playing

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
and stop the sample that's playing

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.600 
and stop the sample that's playing
you'll<00:03:20.080> know<00:03:20.290> which<00:03:20.560> one<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.950> playing<00:03:21.160> on<00:03:21.489> your

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
you'll know which one is playing on your

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:31.410 
you'll know which one is playing on your
sample<00:03:21.910> deck<00:03:22.360> because<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:24.820> blinks<00:03:30.420> and

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
sample deck because it it blinks and

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.650 
sample deck because it it blinks and
you'd<00:03:31.690> like<00:03:31.840> this<00:03:32.260> look<00:03:32.650> here<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:36.480> what<00:03:37.480> else

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
you'd like this look here and what else

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.210 
you'd like this look here and what else
you<00:03:37.930> press<00:03:38.260> record<00:03:38.440> mode<00:03:38.950> again<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:41.350> you

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
you press record mode again and you

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.840 
you press record mode again and you
still<00:03:42.519> have<00:03:42.700> gonna<00:03:44.610> do<00:03:45.610> normal<00:03:45.970> cue<00:03:46.180> points

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
still have gonna do normal cue points

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.740 
still have gonna do normal cue points
another<00:03:48.850> thing<00:03:49.239> too<00:03:49.480> is<00:03:49.510> with<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.140> roll<00:03:50.410> I

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
another thing too is with the roll I

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.210 
another thing too is with the roll I
guess<00:03:52.750> when<00:03:52.989> you<00:03:53.140> have<00:03:53.170> a<00:03:54.540> loop<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:56.220> haven't

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
guess when you have a loop I haven't

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.220 
guess when you have a loop I haven't
used<00:03:57.459> this<00:03:57.670> yet<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:58.000> saw<00:03:58.329> it<00:03:58.450> on<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.720> mr.<00:03:59.049> Otto

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
used this yet I saw it on the mr. Otto

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.410 
used this yet I saw it on the mr. Otto
website<00:03:59.680> but<00:03:59.890> you<00:03:59.920> can

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.120 

you<00:04:03.260> have<00:04:03.410> to<00:04:03.530> press<00:04:03.830> shift<00:04:05.380> at<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.440> same<00:04:06.650> time

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
you have to press shift at the same time

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.640 
you have to press shift at the same time
I<00:04:07.160> can<00:04:07.550> do<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.820> in<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.150> morning<00:04:08.600> well<00:04:08.780> we<00:04:09.410> try

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
I can do it in the morning well we try

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.490 
I can do it in the morning well we try
with<00:04:09.830> one<00:04:09.860> her<00:04:10.130> one<00:04:10.760> hand

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.340 

even<00:04:20.609> that<00:04:21.120> as<00:04:21.329> well<00:04:21.600> that's<00:04:21.810> something<00:04:22.230> that

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
even that as well that's something that

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.140 
even that as well that's something that
it<00:04:22.470> doesn't<00:04:22.770> do<00:04:22.860> before<00:04:23.340> with<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.700> sarado

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
it doesn't do before with the sarado

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:34.550 
it doesn't do before with the sarado
hitch<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:25.500> hold<00:04:26.960> if<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:27.990> have<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.290> loop<00:04:33.560> so

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
hitch so you hold if you have a loop so

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.870 
hitch so you hold if you have a loop so
that's<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.860> little<00:04:35.130> loop<00:04:35.280> right<00:04:35.310> there<00:04:35.520> oh<00:04:35.700> I'm

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
that's a little loop right there oh I'm

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.920 
that's a little loop right there oh I'm
sorry<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.300> my<00:04:36.990> selection<00:04:37.620> but<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.730> can<00:04:41.930> if

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
sorry that my selection but you can if

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.840 
sorry that my selection but you can if
you<00:04:43.050> hold<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.440> loop<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.980> mean<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.520> hold<00:04:44.730> this

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
you hold the loop I mean you hold this

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:52.070 
you hold the loop I mean you hold this
the<00:04:45.270> shift<00:04:45.750> button<00:04:46.080> then<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.070> could<00:04:51.080> of

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
the shift button then you could of

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.510 
the shift button then you could of
course<00:04:52.139> you<00:04:52.470> can<00:04:52.590> do<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:52.860> better<00:04:53.010> than<00:04:53.310> that

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
course you can do it better than that

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.219 
course you can do it better than that
but<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:54.240> get<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.540> idea<00:04:56.870> that's<00:04:57.870> another

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
but you get the idea that's another

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.480 
but you get the idea that's another
thing<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:59.450> for<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:00.810> sample<00:05:01.530> banks<00:05:02.310> to

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
thing and for the sample banks to

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.480 
thing and for the sample banks to
control<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:03.090> volume<00:05:03.770> while<00:05:04.770> you're<00:05:05.100> so

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
control the volume while you're so

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.550 
control the volume while you're so
you'll<00:05:05.880> be<00:05:06.060> able<00:05:06.150> to<00:05:06.360> do<00:05:06.600> it<00:05:06.810> from<00:05:07.110> my

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
you'll be able to do it from my

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.780 
you'll be able to do it from my
controller<00:05:08.389> but<00:05:09.389> if<00:05:09.510> you<00:05:09.630> have<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.870> little<00:05:10.410> a

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
controller but if you have a little a

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.010 
controller but if you have a little a
small<00:05:11.790> I'll<00:05:12.060> show<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:12.360> right<00:05:12.540> now<00:05:12.600> let<00:05:12.900> me

so<00:05:58.350> I<00:05:58.410> have<00:05:58.710> this<00:05:58.890> assigned<00:05:59.460> this<00:06:00.120> MIDI

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
so I have this assigned this MIDI

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.480 
so I have this assigned this MIDI
controller<00:06:01.020> small<00:06:01.710> little<00:06:01.980> thing<00:06:02.130> probably

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
controller small little thing probably

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.150 
controller small little thing probably
worth<00:06:02.640> 40<00:06:02.970> 40<00:06:03.810> to<00:06:03.900> 60<00:06:04.320> bucks<00:06:04.500> I<00:06:04.680> don't<00:06:04.710> know<00:06:04.950> if

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
worth 40 40 to 60 bucks I don't know if

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.480 
worth 40 40 to 60 bucks I don't know if
any<00:06:05.310> way<00:06:05.490> you<00:06:05.550> get<00:06:05.820> it<00:06:06.320> and<00:06:07.320> you<00:06:07.800> can<00:06:08.040> control

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
any way you get it and you can control

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.690 
any way you get it and you can control
the<00:06:08.760> volume<00:06:08.970> of<00:06:09.930> that<00:06:10.160> particular<00:06:11.160> sample

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
the volume of that particular sample

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.670 
the volume of that particular sample
right<00:06:12.210> here<00:06:13.760> think<00:06:14.760> of<00:06:14.910> this<00:06:15.090> MIDI<00:06:15.960> mountable

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
right here think of this MIDI mountable

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.350 
right here think of this MIDI mountable
so<00:06:16.890> you<00:06:16.950> hook<00:06:17.280> this<00:06:17.460> up<00:06:17.750> very<00:06:18.750> easy<00:06:19.110> to<00:06:20.060> to<00:06:21.060> set

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
so you hook this up very easy to to set

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.440 
so you hook this up very easy to to set
up<00:06:21.540> so<00:06:21.840> I<00:06:22.140> have<00:06:22.680> this<00:06:22.920> to<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.490> total<00:06:23.850> volume<00:06:23.970> on

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
up so I have this to the total volume on

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.590 
up so I have this to the total volume on
sample<00:06:24.960> one<00:06:25.140> two<00:06:25.500> three<00:06:25.950> four<00:06:26.370> five<00:06:26.820> and<00:06:27.180> six

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
sample one two three four five and six

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.070 
sample one two three four five and six
and<00:06:28.290> then<00:06:28.440> I<00:06:28.470> have<00:06:28.650> this<00:06:28.830> one<00:06:29.720> for<00:06:30.720> the<00:06:30.870> main

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
and then I have this one for the main

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.350 
and then I have this one for the main
volume<00:06:31.830> the<00:06:32.340> sampler<00:06:33.060> itself<00:06:34.940> so<00:06:35.940> it<00:06:36.150> works

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
volume the sampler itself so it works

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.830 
volume the sampler itself so it works
out<00:06:36.570> pretty<00:06:36.630> good

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
out pretty good

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.590 
out pretty good
and<00:06:39.840> this<00:06:40.020> thing<00:06:40.230> is<00:06:40.260> very<00:06:40.650> cheap<00:06:41.270> and<00:06:42.270> it's

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
and this thing is very cheap and it's

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.390 
and this thing is very cheap and it's
not<00:06:42.810> an<00:06:42.960> expensive<00:06:43.440> thing<00:06:43.710> you<00:06:44.250> have<00:06:44.370> control

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
not an expensive thing you have control

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.280 
not an expensive thing you have control
over<00:06:45.270> your<00:06:45.780> and<00:06:46.590> you<00:06:47.010> can<00:06:47.900> you're<00:06:48.900> gonna<00:06:49.020> sign

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
over your and you can you're gonna sign

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.470 
over your and you can you're gonna sign
whatever<00:06:49.560> you<00:06:49.770> want<00:06:50.070> to<00:06:50.220> these<00:06:50.400> pads<00:06:50.730> if<00:06:51.270> you

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
want extra control okay that's about it

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.300 
want extra control okay that's about it
for<00:06:57.090> now<00:06:57.300> but<00:06:58.200> you<00:06:58.350> can<00:06:58.500> see<00:06:58.710> all<00:06:58.830> this<00:06:59.010> in<00:06:59.220> the

00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.310 
for now but you can see all this in the

for now but you can see all this in the
Toronto<00:06:59.760> website<00:07:00.300> so<00:07:00.750> it's<00:07:02.810> not<00:07:03.810> like

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
Toronto website so it's not like

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.720 
Toronto website so it's not like
