yesterday<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.529> think<00:00:19.740> last<00:00:20.310> game<00:00:20.580> was<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
yesterday I think last game was the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.099 
yesterday I think last game was the
first<00:00:20.939> time<00:00:21.090> he<00:00:21.150> hit<00:00:21.330> me<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.570> three<00:00:21.720> years<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
first time he hit me in three years on a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.250 
first time he hit me in three years on a
late<00:00:22.619> pass<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.750> I've<00:00:24.750> been<00:00:24.869> looking<00:00:25.080> for<00:00:25.199> him

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
late pass but I've been looking for him

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.540 
late pass but I've been looking for him
for<00:00:25.320> three<00:00:25.500> years<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.070> know<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.490> just

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
for three years but you know it's just

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.529 
for three years but you know it's just
it<00:00:27.269> shows<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> development<00:00:28.230> he's<00:00:28.380> been<00:00:29.539> coming

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
it shows a development he's been coming

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:48.830 
it shows a development he's been coming
into<00:00:46.430> I've<00:00:47.430> played<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.360> players<00:00:48.600> before

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
into I've played in the players before

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.209 
into I've played in the players before
so<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:50.010> uh<00:00:51.260> it's<00:00:52.260> difficult<00:00:53.039> because

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
so I know it's uh it's difficult because

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.680 
so I know it's uh it's difficult because
you<00:00:53.489> don't<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:53.730> understand<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
you don't really understand the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.650 
you don't really understand the
magnitude<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.289> game<00:00:55.500> sevens<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.539> in<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
magnitude of game sevens and in the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.750 
magnitude of game sevens and in the
playoffs<00:00:57.989> until<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.460> in

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
playoffs until you really have to be in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.670 
playoffs until you really have to be in
it<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.390> last<00:01:01.199> year<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> great

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
it and I think last year was a great

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
it and I think last year was a great
stepping<00:01:01.949> stone<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:03.000> were<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
stepping stone because we were in the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.810 
stepping stone because we were in the
playoffs<00:01:03.780> i<00:01:04.140> guess<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.439> veteran<00:01:05.129> physical<00:01:05.610> teen

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
playoffs i guess a veteran physical teen

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.330 
playoffs i guess a veteran physical teen
and<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.360> well-prepared<00:01:07.260> team<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.890> i<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.070> that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
and a well-prepared team so i think that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.910 
and a well-prepared team so i think that
helped<00:01:09.090> us<00:01:09.270> coming<00:01:09.810> into<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.229> year<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.770> know

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
helped us coming into this year we know

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.550 
helped us coming into this year we know
that<00:01:11.840> Washington<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.170> physical

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
that Washington is going to be physical

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:25.580 
that Washington is going to be physical
in<00:01:13.680> we're<00:01:14.250> gonna<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.490> physical<00:01:14.909> from<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> jump

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.859 

that<00:01:26.590> doesn't<00:01:26.890> really<00:01:26.979> matter<00:01:27.219> that<00:01:27.869> nice

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
that doesn't really matter that nice

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.450 
that doesn't really matter that nice
stuff<00:01:29.109> in<00:01:29.289> clay<00:01:29.500> probably<00:01:29.859> best<00:01:30.009> backcourt

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
stuff in clay probably best backcourt

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.479 

pretty<00:02:19.930> much<00:02:20.140> we<00:02:20.410> take<00:02:20.620> good<00:02:20.829> shots<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.340> we

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
pretty much we take good shots and we

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.250 
pretty much we take good shots and we
take<00:02:22.150> shots<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.569> we<00:02:22.660> can<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.019> know<00:02:23.110> we're

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
take shots that we can you know we're

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.170 
take shots that we can you know we're
not<00:02:23.349> gonna<00:02:23.470> make<00:02:23.560> every<00:02:23.829> shot<00:02:23.980> but<00:02:24.489> you<00:02:25.060> know<00:02:25.150> I
