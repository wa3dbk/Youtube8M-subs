00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
for anything more but in terms of the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.260 
for anything more but in terms of the
performance<00:02:52.530> first<00:02:53.280> half<00:02:53.460> for<00:02:53.670> emma<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:53.970> very

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
performance first half for emma is very

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.070 
performance first half for emma is very
disappointed<00:02:54.870> for<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.350> tackling<00:02:55.770> was<00:02:55.920> about

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
disappointed for the tackling was about

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.020 
disappointed for the tackling was about
pure<00:02:58.080> we<00:02:58.590> were<00:02:58.710> very<00:02:58.740> one-dimensional<00:02:59.430> I

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
pure we were very one-dimensional I

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.670 
pure we were very one-dimensional I
think<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.690> know<00:03:00.810> we<00:03:00.930> wanted<00:03:01.200> dominant<00:03:01.620> were

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
think you know we wanted dominant were

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.990 
think you know we wanted dominant were
very<00:03:01.860> passive<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.460> tackling<00:03:02.820> we<00:03:02.940> were

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
very passive in a tackling we were

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.190 
very passive in a tackling we were
hitting<00:03:03.180> them<00:03:03.240> then<00:03:03.450> fallen<00:03:03.810> by<00:03:03.930> trial<00:03:04.170> and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
hitting them then fallen by trial and

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.980 
hitting them then fallen by trial and
knocking<00:03:04.560> them<00:03:04.590> back<00:03:04.770> but<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:06.060> know<00:03:06.180> we<00:03:06.480> what

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
knocking them back but you know we what

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.390 
knocking them back but you know we what
that<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.320> you're<00:03:07.800> always<00:03:07.920> going<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.130> be<00:03:08.190> rushed

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
that is you're always going to be rushed

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.130 
that is you're always going to be rushed
in<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.580> first<00:03:08.760> game<00:03:08.880> we<00:03:09.750> need<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.990> just

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
in the first game we need to just

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.290 
in the first game we need to just
continually<00:03:10.830> keep<00:03:11.340> building<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:12.000> think<00:03:12.210> if

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
continually keep building and I think if

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.700 
continually keep building and I think if
you<00:03:12.420> look<00:03:12.570> back<00:03:12.690> on<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:13.200> team<00:03:13.440> last<00:03:13.620> season

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
you look back on this team last season

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.530 
you look back on this team last season
we<00:03:14.340> were<00:03:14.460> pretty<00:03:14.640> much<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:15.030> wanted<00:03:15.210> as<00:03:15.300> good<00:03:15.450> as

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
we were pretty much we wanted as good as

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.110 
we were pretty much we wanted as good as
what<00:03:15.660> we<00:03:15.780> are<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.410> star<00:03:16.650> know<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.730> feeling<00:03:18.090> my

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
what we are and star know the feeling my

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.760 
what we are and star know the feeling my
wife<00:03:18.510> feeling<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.960> that<00:03:18.990> maybe<00:03:19.140> we<00:03:19.500> thought<00:03:19.680> it

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
wife feeling is that maybe we thought it

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.810 
wife feeling is that maybe we thought it
would<00:03:19.830> come<00:03:19.980> out<00:03:20.070> second<00:03:20.460> half<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
would come out second half of the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.640 
would come out second half of the
elements<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.450> partner<00:03:22.050> shows<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.350> back<00:03:22.530> at

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
elements and partner shows the back at

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.140 
elements and partner shows the back at
halftime<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.160> maybe<00:03:23.310> we<00:03:23.370> just<00:03:23.490> get<00:03:24.030> on<00:03:24.120> with

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
halftime and maybe we just get on with

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.240 
halftime and maybe we just get on with
it<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.480> they<00:03:24.990> absolutely<00:03:25.620> did<00:03:25.740> not<00:03:25.860> because

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
it and they absolutely did not because

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.690 
it and they absolutely did not because
the<00:03:26.370> whole<00:03:26.570> bleep<00:03:27.570> down<00:03:27.810> set<00:03:28.290> piece<00:03:28.700> basic

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
the whole bleep down set piece basic

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.960 
the whole bleep down set piece basic
passing<00:03:30.150> or<00:03:30.510> fell<00:03:30.930> apart<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:32.610> was<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.730> hot

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
passing or fell apart so it was a hot

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.570 
passing or fell apart so it was a hot
horrific<00:03:33.510> second<00:03:33.870> half<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:35.130> start<00:03:35.490> they

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
horrific second half the start they

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.460 
horrific second half the start they
given<00:03:35.820> within<00:03:36.150> any<00:03:36.360> any<00:03:36.870> sort<00:03:37.080> they<00:03:37.140> went<00:03:37.320> and

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
given within any any sort they went and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.900 
given within any any sort they went and
I<00:03:37.590> suppose<00:03:37.980> getting<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.280> four<00:03:38.460> sizes<00:03:38.670> just

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
I suppose getting the four sizes just

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.060 
I suppose getting the four sizes just
icing<00:03:39.390> on<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.570> cake<00:03:39.720> so<00:03:39.990> we'll<00:03:40.560> take<00:03:40.740> that<00:03:40.950> in

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
icing on the cake so we'll take that in

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.470 
icing on the cake so we'll take that in
there<00:03:41.160> next<00:03:41.280> week<00:03:41.490> we've<00:03:41.670> got<00:03:41.850> two<00:03:42.150> massive

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
there next week we've got two massive

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.120 
there next week we've got two massive
training<00:03:42.810> sessions<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.290> then<00:03:43.410> roughly<00:03:43.620> go<00:03:43.860> up

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
training sessions and then roughly go up

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.920 
training sessions and then roughly go up
there<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.460> block<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.850> which<00:03:45.030> is<00:03:45.480> never<00:03:45.750> an

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
there and block is which is never an

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.750 
there and block is which is never an
easy<00:03:46.050> task<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.710> there's<00:03:47.190> not<00:03:47.340> gonna<00:03:47.490> be<00:03:47.580> any

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
easy task so there's not gonna be any

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.090 
easy task so there's not gonna be any
easy<00:03:48.150> games<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.600> season<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.080> after<00:03:49.770> going<00:03:49.890> out

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
easy games of season so after going out

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.500 
easy games of season so after going out
with<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.280> same<00:03:50.310> mindset<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.940> hopefully<00:03:51.240> the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
with the same mindset and hopefully the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:06.290 
with the same mindset and hopefully the
same<00:03:51.690> result<00:03:52.020> follow

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.360
