00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello gorgeous today we are going to make a 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.450
 chocolate collage a classic dessert 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.490
 sure that some restaurant is what 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.860
 they have put or you have had 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.900
 opportunity to prepare is very simple 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.840
 and for those of you who have not done it, let's go 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.030
 to see how easy and fast it is is 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.940
 a dessert that was invented by the chef 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.100
 French michel bras and consists of a 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.279
 chocolate cake that when opened 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.680
 the liquid chocolate comes out inside the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.210
 ingredients as you see are very easy and 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.880
 recognizable for all sugar 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.260
 flour butter that ends in powder 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.399
 eggs 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.399
 and the Chocolate 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.230
 we started mixing the eggs with the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.800
 sugar you have to beat them you do not have to 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.800
 mount them 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.610
 once the sugar is dissolved 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.000
 let's melt the chocolate in the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.000
 microwave oven 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.990
 the only important thing is not to heat the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.550
 excess chocolate because maybe 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.770
 put it in the microwave 30 seconds 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.550
 we are controlling and we are putting 30 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.550
 in 30 seconds 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.130
 already 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.990
 with the residual heat that we have left 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.440
 We will end melt the little 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.440
 chocolate 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.920
 and add the butter as you see 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.880
 is 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.880
 beloved point 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.659
 we incorporate chocolate to the egg 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.129
 Check that it is very hot 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.970
 chocolate because if we are going to make a 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.970
 chocolate omelette 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.880
 well you will tell me that it is not easy 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.500
 let's incorporate the flour and now that 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.860
 we have mixed the chocolate well with 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.860
 the egg 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.430
 we process so there are no lumps 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.239
 Finally, remember that cocoa is not 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.310
 cocoa to make chocolate the cup is 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.790
 cocoa 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.260
 sugar free for baking is very easy 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.260
 to find in any store 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.670
 and 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.780
 this is not the fall it's a small spray 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.040
 dante that replaces the classic 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.379
 butter and flour so that then 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.670
 we can unmold our cool and go 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.990
 to do 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.990
 4 super cool ans 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.210
 keep in mind that the city does not come up 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.780
 practically stays in the size 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.810
 what do we put 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.450
 the baking time will depend on the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.110
 eyepiece size for a size made 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.520
 in plan was of these to use and city 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.640
 It will be about 12 minutes 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.260
 here will surely be a little more a 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.569
 trick to know when this is 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.530
 when we see that the ocular surface 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:15.040
 it grows like a cupcake then this 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.040
 it's perfect 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.120
 now go straight to the freezer 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.790
 here we have the straws directly from 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.860
 freezer 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.830
 let's put them in the oven as you see 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.480
 they are completely frozen remember 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.880
 that we have to have at least one 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.880
 I have had them all night 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.749
 let's try to unmold it with 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.749
 watch out 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.230
 ah 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.610
 perfect 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.260
 and now comes the most important step 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.950
 of a coulant that is to see how it has been 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.950
 inside 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.139
 as you see, there has been liquid 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.360
 as you can see, it is soft and soft 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.470
 I leave you with more recipes and see you tomorrow 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.470
 a little kiss
