it was a combination of cool deck and
exposed<00:00:39.510> aggregate<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.230> didn't<00:00:40.620> really

exposed aggregate that didn't really
look<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.160> great<00:00:44.149> you<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.300> see<00:00:45.329> how<00:00:45.660> these

small sharp stones and this exposed
aggregate<00:00:48.149> finish<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.200> hard<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.500> your

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
aggregate finish can be hard on your

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.860 
aggregate finish can be hard on your
feet<00:00:49.890> these<00:00:50.700> guys<00:00:50.940> stop<00:00:51.180> by<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> watch<00:00:51.629> his

work<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> these<00:00:52.949> two<00:00:53.160> hung<00:00:53.340> around<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
work one of these two hung around and

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.700 
work one of these two hung around and
took<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.120> very<00:00:54.300> keen<00:00:54.600> interest<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.320> us<00:00:55.500> for

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
took a very keen interest in us for

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.080 
took a very keen interest in us for
reasons<00:00:55.890> you'll<00:00:56.280> find<00:00:56.520> out<00:00:56.670> later<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
reasons you'll find out later in the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.869 
reasons you'll find out later in the
video<00:00:57.680> we<00:00:58.680> started<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.250> project<00:00:59.789> by

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
video we started up this project by

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.939 
video we started up this project by
first<00:01:00.149> opening<00:01:00.329> any<00:01:00.780> large<00:01:01.109> cracks<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.710> found

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
first opening any large cracks we found

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.649 
first opening any large cracks we found
with<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> grinder

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.289 

this<00:01:06.439> allows<00:01:06.770> for<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.070> crack<00:01:07.369> fill<00:01:07.700> epoxy

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
this allows for the crack fill epoxy

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.209 
this allows for the crack fill epoxy
that<00:01:08.329> we<00:01:08.539> use<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.140> wick<00:01:09.409> into<00:01:09.679> the<00:01:09.979> crack

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
that we use to wick into the crack

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.760 
that we use to wick into the crack
deeper<00:01:10.789> and<00:01:11.030> help<00:01:11.390> glue<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.200> sides<00:01:12.469> of<00:01:12.649> it

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
deeper and help glue the sides of it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.580 
deeper and help glue the sides of it
together<00:01:13.329> next<00:01:14.329> we<00:01:14.509> power<00:01:14.780> wash<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.229> entire

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
together next we power wash the entire

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.889 
together next we power wash the entire
slab<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.250> get<00:01:16.369> it<00:01:16.490> as<00:01:16.579> clean<00:01:16.880> as<00:01:16.909> possible<00:01:17.090> so

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
slab to get it as clean as possible so

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.840 
slab to get it as clean as possible so
that<00:01:17.960> our<00:01:18.140> overlay<00:01:18.590> will<00:01:18.799> stick<00:01:19.069> tightly<00:01:19.429> to

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
that our overlay will stick tightly to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.950 
that our overlay will stick tightly to
it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.510 

the<00:01:23.440> noise<00:01:23.620> didn't<00:01:23.920> seem<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.160> bother<00:01:24.340> our

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
the noise didn't seem to bother our

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.310 
the noise didn't seem to bother our
guests<00:01:25.000> who<00:01:25.090> kept<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.780> steely<00:01:26.260> eye<00:01:26.290> on<00:01:26.680> us

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
guests who kept the steely eye on us

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.050 
guests who kept the steely eye on us
once<00:01:29.320> we<00:01:29.440> wrapped<00:01:29.680> up<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.890> power<00:01:30.220> washing<00:01:30.520> we

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
once we wrapped up the power washing we

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.730 
once we wrapped up the power washing we
start<00:01:31.390> mixing<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.900> skin<00:01:32.170> coat<00:01:32.380> over<00:01:32.710> the

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
start mixing the skin coat over the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.010 
start mixing the skin coat over the
material<00:01:33.370> and<00:01:33.610> apply<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.360> floor<00:01:34.600> using

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
material and apply it to the floor using

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:44.179 
material and apply it to the floor using
a<00:01:35.110> squeegee

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.560 

here<00:01:45.189> you<00:01:45.340> can<00:01:45.490> see<00:01:45.700> just<00:01:45.729> how<00:01:46.030> well<00:01:46.390> the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
here you can see just how well the

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.420 
here you can see just how well the
overlay<00:01:46.899> material<00:01:47.439> helps<00:01:47.710> smooth<00:01:48.009> out<00:01:48.219> the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
overlay material helps smooth out the

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.999 
overlay material helps smooth out the
exposed<00:01:48.880> aggregate<00:01:49.149> it<00:01:50.049> fills<00:01:50.380> in<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.619> spaces

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
exposed aggregate it fills in the spaces

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.100 
exposed aggregate it fills in the spaces
between<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.640> stones<00:01:51.939> make<00:01:52.329> it<00:01:52.450> easier<00:01:52.930> to

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
between the stones make it easier to

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.590 
between the stones make it easier to
walk<00:01:53.289> on<00:01:54.060> normally<00:01:55.060> we<00:01:55.180> don't<00:01:55.360> try<00:01:55.539> to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
walk on normally we don't try to

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.450 
walk on normally we don't try to
completely<00:01:56.079> fill<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:56.560> in<00:01:56.710> just<00:01:57.159> make<00:01:57.310> it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
completely fill it in just make it

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.969 
completely fill it in just make it
smoother<00:01:57.939> and<00:01:58.210> easier<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.600> keep<00:01:58.810> clean<00:01:58.979> you

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
smoother and easier to keep clean you

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.380 
smoother and easier to keep clean you
can<00:02:00.130> still<00:02:00.399> see<00:02:00.610> a<00:02:00.640> litter<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.030> texture

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
can still see a litter of the texture

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.149 
can still see a litter of the texture
coming<00:02:01.689> through<00:02:01.960> but<00:02:02.140> it's<00:02:02.319> greatly<00:02:02.649> reduced

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
coming through but it's greatly reduced
