00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:39.670

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.540
 what took you jean-claude on 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.100
 the cases that I lost my footing 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.390
 I tell a story 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.000
 it's a guy who has gone through full 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.340
 value in his life and after each 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.060
 test he goes to the beach he 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.640
 walking on the sand 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.229
 and there he sees two pairs of footprints 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.190
 there are his there is God's side 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.830
 so he is reassured is not alone 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.940
 but one day in a final ordeal 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.899
 there are only his footprints in the 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.229
 sand then there we do not understand it is 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.789
 angry he feels abandoned 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:42.229
 he asks god but finally god but 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:44.630

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.729

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.369
 that you see there in the sand are not 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.480
 hold them but they are mine 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:56.110

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.650
 guy who went through full value in 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.470
 his life and after each trial he gets 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.340
 makes on the beach pictures on the sand and 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.090

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.320
 day at the final test 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.880
 there is more than it is by taking the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.790
 sand so he does not understand he's in 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.260
 angry he is angry with God and asks him 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.920
 but finally, but why are you 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.410

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.270
