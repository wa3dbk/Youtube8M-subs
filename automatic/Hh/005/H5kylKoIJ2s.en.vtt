scoop<00:02:13.000> not<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.300> whole<00:02:13.510> lot<00:02:13.690> just<00:02:13.930> enough<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.560> add

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
scoop not a whole lot just enough to add

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.080 
scoop not a whole lot just enough to add
some<00:02:14.920> flavor<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.310> already<00:02:15.520> put<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:15.970> there

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
some flavor I already put that in there

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.590 
some flavor I already put that in there
as<00:02:16.180> well<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:18.490> then<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.940> last<00:02:19.090> thing<00:02:19.330> I'll<00:02:19.450> add

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
as well and then the last thing I'll add

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.440 
as well and then the last thing I'll add
in<00:02:19.840> is<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:21.190> Crystal<00:02:21.580> Light<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.940> using<00:02:22.210> grape

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
in is the Crystal Light and using grape

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.090 
in is the Crystal Light and using grape
grape<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:22.990> lemon-lime<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.650> think<00:02:23.830> makes<00:02:24.010> a

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
grape and lemon-lime I think makes a

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.140 
grape and lemon-lime I think makes a
great<00:02:24.310> flavor<00:02:24.580> together<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:26.910> don't<00:02:27.910> use<00:02:28.120> a

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
great flavor together I don't use a

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.790 
great flavor together I don't use a
whole<00:02:28.240> lot<00:02:28.540> because<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:29.080> little<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.560> this<00:02:29.650> stuff

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
whole lot because a little of this stuff

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.930 
whole lot because a little of this stuff
go<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.310> long<00:02:30.520> way

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.980 

just<00:02:33.940> kind<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.180> sprinkle<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.630> in<00:02:34.750> there<00:02:34.780> too

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
just kind of sprinkle that in there too

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.970 
just kind of sprinkle that in there too
you<00:02:35.080> see<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> little<00:02:35.350> bit<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.530> color<00:02:35.740> at<00:02:35.890> the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
you see a little bit of color at the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.670 
you see a little bit of color at the
bottom<00:02:36.510> that's<00:02:37.510> all<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:37.840> need<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.290> don't

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
bottom that's all you need you don't

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.700 
bottom that's all you need you don't
have<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.100> use<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> Gatorade<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.710> Crystal

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
have to use the Gatorade and the Crystal

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.880 
have to use the Gatorade and the Crystal
Light<00:02:41.740> in<00:02:41.950> conjunction<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:43.600> do<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.560> because<00:02:44.680> I

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
Light in conjunction I do it because I

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.140 
Light in conjunction I do it because I
like<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.100> way<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.400> tastes<00:02:45.640> but<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:46.000> can

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
like the way it tastes but you can

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.730 
like the way it tastes but you can
certainly<00:02:46.360> just<00:02:46.570> just<00:02:47.140> use<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.440> Crystal

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
certainly just just use the Crystal

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.920 
certainly just just use the Crystal
Light<00:02:47.770> by<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.760> way<00:02:48.880> you'll<00:02:49.030> basically<00:02:49.480> be<00:02:49.750> at

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
Light by the way you'll basically be at

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.450 
Light by the way you'll basically be at
zero<00:02:50.230> calories<00:02:50.710> if<00:02:50.860> you're<00:02:50.980> worried<00:02:51.250> about<00:02:51.280> it

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
zero calories if you're worried about it

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.410 
zero calories if you're worried about it
I'm<00:02:51.670> not<00:02:52.620> because<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.800> Gatorade<00:02:54.190> has<00:02:54.880> 15<00:02:55.330> to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
I'm not because the Gatorade has 15 to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.570 
I'm not because the Gatorade has 15 to
20<00:02:55.690> extra<00:02:55.960> calories<00:02:56.350> when<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:57.100> throw<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.340> in

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
20 extra calories when I throw that in

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.210 
20 extra calories when I throw that in
there<00:02:58.500> anyway<00:02:59.500> so<00:02:59.530> that's<00:02:59.830> how<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.010> do<00:03:00.190> it

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
there anyway so that's how you do it

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.520 
there anyway so that's how you do it
it's<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.550> lot<00:03:00.580> cheaper<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.990> do<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:02.140> like<00:03:02.320> this

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
it's a lot cheaper to do it like this

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.340 
it's a lot cheaper to do it like this
then<00:03:02.740> to<00:03:02.830> buy<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.310> forty<00:03:04.239> dollar<00:03:04.360> tub<00:03:04.750> of

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
then to buy a forty dollar tub of

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.240 
then to buy a forty dollar tub of
something<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:05.830> you're<00:03:05.920> only<00:03:06.010> gonna<00:03:06.130> get
