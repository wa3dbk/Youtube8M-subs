the<00:00:01.199> similarities<00:00:02.010> that<00:00:02.159> all<00:00:02.340> of<00:00:02.460> these<00:00:02.580> cells

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
the similarities that all of these cells

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.849 
the similarities that all of these cells
are<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.270> have<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:03.870> that<00:00:04.080> they're<00:00:04.680> all

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
are going to have is that they're all

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.470 
are going to have is that they're all
going<00:00:05.190> for<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.700> same<00:00:07.370> actual<00:00:08.370> graphic<00:00:08.910> file

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
going for the same actual graphic file

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.360 
going for the same actual graphic file
for<00:00:10.110> their<00:00:10.290> background<00:00:10.860> although<00:00:11.010> it's<00:00:11.250> going

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
for their background although it's going

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.060 
for their background although it's going
to<00:00:11.429> be<00:00:11.490> positioned<00:00:11.820> differently<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:13.070> another

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
to be positioned differently and another

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.860 
to be positioned differently and another
common<00:00:14.519> thing<00:00:14.549> has<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.179> want<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.540> get<00:00:15.690> rid

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
common thing has that we want to get rid

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.779 
common thing has that we want to get rid
of<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.109> text<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:17.070> was<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.369> there<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.580> mean<00:00:17.699> we

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
of the text that was in there I mean we

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.279 
of the text that was in there I mean we
don't<00:00:17.880> want<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> get<00:00:18.240> rid<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:18.869> just<00:00:18.900> want

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
don't want to get rid of it we just want

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.519 
don't want to get rid of it we just want
to<00:00:19.580> not<00:00:20.580> have<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:21.000> viewer<00:00:21.330> be<00:00:21.720> able<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.109> see<00:00:22.380> it

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
to not have the viewer be able to see it

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.269 
to not have the viewer be able to see it
but<00:00:22.680> now<00:00:23.670> we're<00:00:24.510> at<00:00:24.689> kind<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.680> second<00:00:26.070> step

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
but now we're at kind of a second step

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.849 
but now we're at kind of a second step
and<00:00:26.310> that's<00:00:26.640> what's<00:00:27.480> unique<00:00:28.140> about<00:00:28.320> all<00:00:28.680> these

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
and that's what's unique about all these

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.759 
and that's what's unique about all these
and<00:00:29.160> that's<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.210> don't<00:00:30.570> want<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.900> see<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and that's what we don't want to see the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.440 
and that's what we don't want to see the
same<00:00:32.009> picture<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.700> all<00:00:32.790> these<00:00:32.969> right<00:00:33.239> because

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
same picture for all these right because

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.319 
same picture for all these right because
right<00:00:33.630> now<00:00:33.660> we're<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:33.960> looking<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
right now we're just looking at the

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.360 
right now we're just looking at the
image<00:00:36.329> art<00:00:36.600> or<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.840> album<00:00:37.230> art<00:00:37.350> for<00:00:37.680> Brian<00:00:37.980> Eno

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
image art or the album art for Brian Eno

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.240 
image art or the album art for Brian Eno
but<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.790> want<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.410> set<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.620> for<00:00:40.649> everybody

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
but we want to set it up for everybody

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.450 
but we want to set it up for everybody
else<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:41.969> well<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.719> their<00:00:43.079> unique<00:00:43.350> ones<00:00:43.800> so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
else as well for their unique ones so

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.850 
else as well for their unique ones so
this<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.730> actually<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.239> require<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:46.140> new

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
this is actually going to require a new

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.590 
this is actually going to require a new
class<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.610> us<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.210> actually<00:00:48.329> also

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
class for us and this is actually also

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.959 
class for us and this is actually also
going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:48.989> into<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> essence<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.190> what

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
going to get into the essence of what

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.569 
going to get into the essence of what
these<00:00:51.239> image<00:00:51.690> sprites<00:00:52.110> are<00:00:52.289> about<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.920> why<00:00:53.399> we

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
these image sprites are about and why we

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.840 
these image sprites are about and why we
went<00:00:53.760> through<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> trouble<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.719> creating<00:00:55.079> a

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
went through the trouble of creating a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.119 
went through the trouble of creating a
graphic<00:00:56.850> file<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.809> was<00:00:58.129> had

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
graphic file like this that was had

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.430 
graphic file like this that was had
these<00:00:59.309> exact<00:00:59.760> dimensions<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.750> hundred

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
these exact dimensions of a hundred

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.340 
these exact dimensions of a hundred
pixels<00:01:01.710> wide<00:01:02.309> by<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.480> image<00:01:03.750> being<00:01:03.930> 100

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
pixels wide by this image being 100

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.410 
pixels wide by this image being 100
pixels<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> next<00:01:05.640> image<00:01:05.850> starting<00:01:06.330> at

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
pixels and the next image starting at

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.090 
pixels and the next image starting at
the<00:01:06.570> next<00:01:06.840> hundred<00:01:07.170> pixels<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.950> these

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the next hundred pixels and these

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.570 
the next hundred pixels and these
hundred<00:01:08.670> pixel<00:01:09.000> intervals<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.430> here's<00:01:11.430> what

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
hundred pixel intervals so here's what

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.840 
hundred pixel intervals so here's what
we're<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:13.040> we're<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.280> create

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
we're going to do we're going to create

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
we're going to do we're going to create
a<00:01:14.939> new<00:01:15.150> class<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:16.110> I'm<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.439> is

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
a new class and what I'm going to do is

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.960 
a new class and what I'm going to do is
create<00:01:16.740> right<00:01:17.340> off<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> bat<00:01:17.700> I'm<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:17.909> to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
create right off the bat I'm going to

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.660 
create right off the bat I'm going to
create<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> class<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.470> each<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> these

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
create a class for for each one of these

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.630 
create a class for for each one of these
artists<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.240> i'll<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.540> ino<00:01:24.950> i'll<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.189> copy

and muddy waters are just waters okay so
here<00:01:52.340> we<00:01:52.460> go<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:52.939> now<00:01:53.330> let's<00:01:53.900> do<00:01:54.140> some

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
here we go and now let's do some

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.609 
here we go and now let's do some
positioning<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:55.960> I'm<00:01:56.960> going<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.350> first

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
positioning and I'm going to first

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.310 
positioning and I'm going to first
position<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.340> know<00:01:58.520> at<00:01:59.320> background

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
position that you know at background

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.139 
position that you know at background
position<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.100> I'm<00:02:01.880> going<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.060> set<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.299> at<00:02:03.130> 0-0

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
position and I'm going to set it at 0-0

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.169 
position and I'm going to set it at 0-0
that's<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.299> x<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.720> y<00:02:05.869> axis<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:07.490> if<00:02:08.030> you

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
that's the x and y axis and if you

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.840 
that's the x and y axis and if you
recall<00:02:08.720> from<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:09.890> know<00:02:10.039> your<00:02:10.280> high<00:02:10.550> school

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
recall from you know your high school

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.990 
recall from you know your high school
geometry<00:02:11.560> yeah<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:12.590> didn't<00:02:12.860> listen<00:02:13.040> either<00:02:13.310> but

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
geometry yeah I didn't listen either but

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.660 
geometry yeah I didn't listen either but
I<00:02:14.209> recall<00:02:14.630> because<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.260> look<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.560> up<00:02:15.590> here's<00:02:16.580> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
I recall because I look it up here's the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.720 
I recall because I look it up here's the
x<00:02:16.940> axis<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.690> vertical<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.890> y<00:02:19.100> axis<00:02:19.580> is

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
x axis is the vertical and the y axis is

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.320 
x axis is the vertical and the y axis is
the<00:02:19.760> horizontal<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:21.230> this<00:02:22.010> first<00:02:22.310> value<00:02:22.880> over

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
the horizontal so this first value over

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.080 
the horizontal so this first value over
here<00:02:23.560> represents<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.560> x<00:02:24.890> value<00:02:25.519> and<00:02:25.730> the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
here represents the x value and the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.890 
here represents the x value and the
second<00:02:26.480> one<00:02:26.600> represents<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.680> Y<00:02:27.920> value<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:28.970> 00

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
second one represents the Y value so 00

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.400 
second one represents the Y value so 00
at<00:02:30.170> least<00:02:30.319> on<00:02:30.470> this<00:02:30.620> grid<00:02:30.890> would<00:02:31.040> be<00:02:31.750> 00<00:02:32.750> right

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
at least on this grid would be 00 right

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.820 
at least on this grid would be 00 right
here<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:33.980> that's<00:02:34.610> referring<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.510> wear<00:02:36.170> this

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.199 
image is going to be sitting in the
viewport<00:02:39.769> so<00:02:40.489> at<00:02:40.760> 0<00:02:40.790> 0<00:02:41.750> just<00:02:42.440> imagine<00:02:42.709> that<00:02:43.209> the

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
viewport so at 0 0 just imagine that the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.410 
viewport so at 0 0 just imagine that the
only<00:02:44.360> thing<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:45.739> can<00:02:45.920> see<00:02:46.220> in<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:46.819> grid<00:02:47.120> over

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
only thing you can see in this grid over

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.660 
only thing you can see in this grid over
here<00:02:47.690> is<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.870> hundred<00:02:48.319> by<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.680> hundred<00:02:49.160> pixel

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
here is a hundred by a hundred pixel

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.539 
here is a hundred by a hundred pixel
area<00:02:50.630> right<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:51.440> there's<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.680> square<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.430> what

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
area right so there's a square so what

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.400 
area right so there's a square so what
I'm<00:02:52.640> saying<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:53.090> there's<00:02:53.329> a<00:02:53.480> will<00:02:54.230> say

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
I'm saying is that there's a will say

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.380 
I'm saying is that there's a will say
that<00:02:54.560> there's<00:02:54.799> this<00:02:54.950> square<00:02:55.519> right<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:56.299> the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
that there's this square right in the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.960 
that there's this square right in the
middle<00:02:56.570> over<00:02:56.930> here<00:02:57.350> that's<00:02:57.920> allow<00:02:58.549> it<00:02:58.760> like<00:02:58.940> a

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
middle over here that's allow it like a

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.240 
middle over here that's allow it like a
hundred<00:02:59.180> 100<00:02:59.780> dimensions<00:03:00.320> square<00:03:00.709> that's

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
hundred 100 dimensions square that's

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.789 
hundred 100 dimensions square that's
allowing<00:03:01.850> for<00:03:02.060> an<00:03:02.150> image<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.600> be<00:03:02.750> seen<00:03:03.049> well

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
allowing for an image to be seen well

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.080 
allowing for an image to be seen well
what<00:03:04.010> we're<00:03:04.160> going<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.370> see<00:03:04.549> is<00:03:04.640> this<00:03:04.820> top

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
what we're going to see is this top

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.370 
what we're going to see is this top
image<00:03:05.420> because<00:03:05.660> it's<00:03:05.690> positioned<00:03:06.260> at<00:03:06.350> a

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
image because it's positioned at a

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.810 
image because it's positioned at a
hundred<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.890> one<00:03:07.010> hundred<00:03:07.310> this<00:03:07.459> bottom

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
hundred and one hundred this bottom

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.960 
hundred and one hundred this bottom
left-hand<00:03:08.120> corner<00:03:08.329> over<00:03:08.780> here<00:03:09.340> but<00:03:10.340> now<00:03:10.519> if<00:03:10.790> we

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
left-hand corner over here but now if we

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.490 
left-hand corner over here but now if we
want<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.269> see<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.660> Hank<00:03:12.260> Williams<00:03:14.500> graphic

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
want to see the Hank Williams graphic

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.289 
want to see the Hank Williams graphic
then<00:03:16.160> we're<00:03:16.310> going<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.459> have<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.940> kind<00:03:17.209> of

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
then we're going to have to kind of

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.569 
then we're going to have to kind of
adjust<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.930> positioning<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:19.280> way<00:03:19.400> that

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
adjust that positioning and the way that

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.370 
adjust that positioning and the way that
happens<00:03:19.820> is<00:03:20.209> we're<00:03:20.390> going<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.540> adjust<00:03:21.079> it<00:03:21.350> so

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
happens is we're going to adjust it so

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.349 
happens is we're going to adjust it so
that<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.799> very<00:03:22.280> margin<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.120> going<00:03:23.299> to

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
that the very margin of it is going to

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.710 
that the very margin of it is going to
be<00:03:23.420> at<00:03:23.720> negative<00:03:24.560> 100<00:03:25.370> pixels<00:03:25.850> because<00:03:26.420> by

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
be at negative 100 pixels because by

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.289 
be at negative 100 pixels because by
setting<00:03:27.290> that<00:03:27.709> thing<00:03:27.980> up<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.310> negative<00:03:28.640> 100

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
setting that thing up to negative 100

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.000 
setting that thing up to negative 100
pixels<00:03:29.630> it's<00:03:29.840> going<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.019> bring<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.560> up<00:03:30.709> and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
pixels it's going to bring it up and

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.349 
pixels it's going to bring it up and
you're<00:03:31.459> going<00:03:31.549> to<00:03:31.609> see<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.940> in<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.090> viewport

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
you're going to see that in the viewport

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.229 
you're going to see that in the viewport
so<00:03:32.750> let<00:03:33.470> me<00:03:33.560> just<00:03:33.739> show<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.000> what<00:03:35.000> I'm<00:03:35.090> going

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
so let me just show you what I'm going

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.300 
so let me just show you what I'm going
to<00:03:35.299> do<00:03:35.480> here<00:03:35.510> so<00:03:35.870> I'm<00:03:35.959> going<00:03:36.079> to<00:03:36.170> do<00:03:36.489> background

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.360 

position<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:42.050> so<00:03:43.050> it's<00:03:43.290> going<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.530> be<00:03:43.620> zero

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
position and so it's going to be zero

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.360 
position and so it's going to be zero
pixels<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.360> then<00:03:46.070> you're<00:03:47.070> going<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.220> do

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
pixels and then you're going to do

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.700 
pixels and then you're going to do
negative<00:03:47.810> 100<00:03:48.810> pixels<00:03:49.760> okay<00:03:51.830> there<00:03:52.830> we<00:03:52.950> go<00:03:52.980> and

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
negative 100 pixels okay there we go and

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.470 
negative 100 pixels okay there we go and
you<00:03:55.710> know<00:03:55.830> before<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.280> go<00:03:56.400> further<00:03:56.430> let<00:03:57.240> me<00:03:57.270> make

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
you know before I go further let me make

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.900 
you know before I go further let me make
sure<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.720> apply<00:03:58.140> this<00:03:58.200> class<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:59.280> see<00:03:59.490> that<00:03:59.700> my

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
sure I apply this class to see that my

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.450 
sure I apply this class to see that my
logic<00:04:00.420> is<00:04:00.540> working<00:04:01.050> over<00:04:01.350> here<00:04:01.380> I'm<00:04:02.220> going<00:04:02.400> to

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
logic is working over here I'm going to

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.480 
logic is working over here I'm going to
go<00:04:02.580> back<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.850> my<00:04:03.180> source<00:04:03.510> code<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.100> now<00:04:05.100> where

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
go back to my source code and now where

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.380 
go back to my source code and now where
I<00:04:05.520> have<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:05.850> TD<00:04:06.540> class<00:04:07.340> where<00:04:08.340> they're<00:04:08.820> all<00:04:08.970> TD

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
I have the TD class where they're all TD

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.100 
I have the TD class where they're all TD
class<00:04:09.630> artwork<00:04:10.530> but<00:04:11.070> you<00:04:11.250> could<00:04:11.430> add<00:04:12.110> one

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
class artwork but you could add one

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.570 
class artwork but you could add one
element<00:04:13.500> could<00:04:13.680> have<00:04:13.860> multiple<00:04:14.130> different

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
element could have multiple different

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.940 
element could have multiple different
classes<00:04:15.270> it<00:04:15.390> can't<00:04:15.600> have<00:04:15.720> multiple<00:04:16.200> IDs<00:04:16.620> but

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
classes it can't have multiple IDs but

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.910 
classes it can't have multiple IDs but
it<00:04:17.310> could<00:04:17.430> have<00:04:17.520> multiple<00:04:17.730> classes<00:04:18.360> so<00:04:19.260> i'm

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
it could have multiple classes so i'm

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.060 
it could have multiple classes so i'm
going<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.160> look<00:04:20.720> right<00:04:21.720> here<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.320> i'm<00:04:22.980> going

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
going to look right here and i'm going

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.970 
going to look right here and i'm going
to<00:04:23.130> start<00:04:23.340> looking<00:04:23.610> for<00:04:24.470> since<00:04:25.470> i<00:04:25.590> already<00:04:25.620> put

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
to start looking for since i already put

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.720 
to start looking for since i already put
it<00:04:26.130> in<00:04:26.250> dreamweaver<00:04:26.850> brings<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:27.300> right<00:04:27.510> up<00:04:27.720> so

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
it in dreamweaver brings it right up so

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.030 
it in dreamweaver brings it right up so
picture<00:04:29.730> brian<00:04:30.030> eno<00:04:30.420> now<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:30.900> see<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:31.830> see

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
picture brian eno now you see you see

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.560 
picture brian eno now you see you see
what<00:04:32.190> this<00:04:32.310> looks<00:04:32.370> like<00:04:32.700> it's<00:04:32.970> separated<00:04:33.480> by

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
what this looks like it's separated by

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.830 
what this looks like it's separated by
spaces<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.440> it<00:04:34.980> has<00:04:35.250> two<00:04:36.060> separate<00:04:36.510> classes

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
spaces and it has two separate classes

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.160 
spaces and it has two separate classes
over<00:04:37.350> there<00:04:37.500> so<00:04:38.040> now<00:04:38.370> i<00:04:38.400> can<00:04:38.520> go<00:04:38.880> down<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:39.540> do

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
over there so now i can go down and do

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.970 
over there so now i can go down and do
the<00:04:40.320> same<00:04:40.560> thing<00:04:41.090> for<00:04:42.090> my<00:04:42.810> Williams<00:04:43.350> so<00:04:43.710> here's

that<00:05:04.860> other<00:05:05.250> portion<00:05:05.790> all<00:05:06.060> right<00:05:06.120> when<00:05:06.360> we

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
that other portion all right when we

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
doing it that other bottom graphic if we

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.840 
doing it that other bottom graphic if we
look<00:05:09.000> if<00:05:09.780> i<00:05:09.930> zoom<00:05:09.960> in<00:05:10.470> over<00:05:10.740> here<00:05:10.980> you<00:05:11.490> see<00:05:11.700> that

look if i zoom in over here you see that

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.960 
look if i zoom in over here you see that
other<00:05:12.000> icon<00:05:12.540> peeking<00:05:13.350> in<00:05:13.670> right<00:05:14.670> underneath

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
other icon peeking in right underneath

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.230 
other icon peeking in right underneath
it<00:05:15.330> that's<00:05:15.840> all<00:05:16.080> right<00:05:16.230> because<00:05:16.910> i'm<00:05:17.910> going<00:05:18.150> to

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
it that's all right because i'm going to

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.170 
it that's all right because i'm going to
fine-tune<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.860> dimensions<00:05:20.580> of<00:05:20.730> these<00:05:20.880> things

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
fine-tune the dimensions of these things

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.990 
fine-tune the dimensions of these things
and<00:05:21.800> that's<00:05:22.800> going<00:05:22.950> to<00:05:23.010> be<00:05:23.100> my<00:05:23.250> next<00:05:23.310> step<00:05:23.760> but

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
and that's going to be my next step but

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.430 
and that's going to be my next step but
for<00:05:24.240> now<00:05:24.390> I<00:05:24.420> just<00:05:24.600> want<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:24.990> make<00:05:25.110> sure<00:05:25.170> that

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
for now I just want to make sure that

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.830 
for now I just want to make sure that
each<00:05:25.650> one<00:05:25.890> of<00:05:25.950> these<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:27.030> background<00:05:27.600> is

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
each one of these the background is

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.840 
each one of these the background is
going<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.170> be<00:05:28.260> positioned<00:05:28.770> differently<00:05:29.280> and

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
going to be positioned differently and

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.550 
going to be positioned differently and
it's<00:05:30.000> going<00:05:30.150> to<00:05:30.240> show<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.870> different<00:05:31.200> icon

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
it's going to show the different icon

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.980 
it's going to show the different icon
for<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.280> most<00:05:32.490> part<00:05:32.760> we're<00:05:33.330> like<00:05:33.570> I<00:05:33.690> said<00:05:33.840> I'm

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
for the most part we're like I said I'm

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.490 
for the most part we're like I said I'm
going<00:05:34.140> to<00:05:34.280> position<00:05:35.280> it<00:05:35.700> perfect<00:05:36.390> in<00:05:36.600> in<00:05:37.350> the

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
going to position it perfect in in the

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.070 
going to position it perfect in in the
steps<00:05:37.800> to<00:05:37.980> come<00:05:38.250> but<00:05:38.460> for<00:05:38.670> now<00:05:38.880> let<00:05:39.810> me<00:05:39.840> go

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
steps to come but for now let me go

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.510 
steps to come but for now let me go
ahead<00:05:40.170> and<00:05:40.320> just<00:05:40.590> do<00:05:40.830> exactly<00:05:40.980> what<00:05:41.340> I<00:05:41.460> was

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
ahead and just do exactly what I was

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.590 
ahead and just do exactly what I was
thinking<00:05:41.580> i'll<00:05:42.150> add<00:05:42.690> Coltrane

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
thinking i'll add Coltrane

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:53.270 
thinking i'll add Coltrane
and<00:05:46.970> Davis<00:05:47.970> and<00:05:50.030> believe<00:05:51.030> waters<00:05:51.750> okay<00:05:52.470> save

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
and Davis and believe waters okay save

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.740 
and Davis and believe waters okay save
it<00:05:53.310> now<00:05:53.760> going<00:05:54.420> back<00:05:54.600> to<00:05:54.810> my<00:05:54.960> CSS<00:05:56.450> now<00:05:57.450> it's

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
it now going back to my CSS now it's

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.470 
it now going back to my CSS now it's
just<00:05:57.840> going<00:05:58.050> to<00:05:58.080> be<00:05:58.170> a<00:05:58.260> matter<00:05:58.560> of<00:05:59.120> going<00:06:00.120> in

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
just going to be a matter of going in

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.560 
just going to be a matter of going in
increments<00:06:00.750> of<00:06:01.170> a<00:06:01.440> hundred<00:06:01.890> so<00:06:02.280> from<00:06:02.640> ino<00:06:03.090> to

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
increments of a hundred so from ino to

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.160 
increments of a hundred so from ino to
Williams<00:06:04.080> I<00:06:04.290> could<00:06:04.440> just<00:06:04.620> take<00:06:04.920> this<00:06:05.130> code<00:06:05.490> and

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
Williams I could just take this code and

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.140 
Williams I could just take this code and
paste<00:06:07.170> it<00:06:07.470> and<00:06:07.650> since<00:06:08.430> it's<00:06:08.670> going<00:06:08.850> to<00:06:08.910> be<00:06:09.030> the

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
paste it and since it's going to be the

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.180 
paste it and since it's going to be the
next<00:06:09.330> hundred<00:06:09.840> increment<00:06:10.560> this<00:06:10.890> went<00:06:11.100> from

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
next hundred increment this went from

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.430 
next hundred increment this went from
zero<00:06:11.280> to<00:06:11.670> negative<00:06:12.030> 100<00:06:12.780> this<00:06:12.960> is<00:06:13.080> going<00:06:13.260> to<00:06:13.350> go

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
zero to negative 100 this is going to go

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.820 
zero to negative 100 this is going to go
to<00:06:13.500> negative<00:06:14.210> 200<00:06:15.210> and<00:06:15.420> then<00:06:15.930> what's<00:06:16.470> dave<00:06:16.680> is

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
to negative 200 and then what's dave is

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.650 
to negative 200 and then what's dave is
going<00:06:16.950> to<00:06:17.040> go<00:06:17.220> to<00:06:19.640> write<00:06:20.640> and<00:06:20.910> then<00:06:21.450> what's

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
going to go to write and then what's

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.840 
going to go to write and then what's
water<00:06:21.930> is<00:06:22.050> going<00:06:22.200> to<00:06:22.260> go<00:06:22.410> to<00:06:23.960> 400<00:06:24.960> right<00:06:25.310> so<00:06:26.310> now

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
water is going to go to 400 right so now

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.760 
water is going to go to 400 right so now

the<00:07:28.770> first<00:07:28.950> icon<00:07:29.430> i<00:07:29.460> had<00:07:29.790> i<00:07:30.030> put<00:07:30.270> background

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 
the first icon i had i put background

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.070 
the first icon i had i put background
position<00:07:31.290> 0<00:07:31.680> 20<00:07:32.070> pixels<00:07:32.580> then<00:07:33.540> because<00:07:33.960> i

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 
position 0 20 pixels then because i

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.350 
position 0 20 pixels then because i
wanted<00:07:34.350> to<00:07:34.500> adjust<00:07:34.950> this<00:07:35.100> thing<00:07:35.430> so<00:07:36.000> that<00:07:36.180> was

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 
wanted to adjust this thing so that was

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.830 
wanted to adjust this thing so that was
so<00:07:36.810> background<00:07:37.500> image<00:07:37.800> was<00:07:38.010> 0<00:07:38.400> to<00:07:39.060> 0<00:07:39.420> so<00:07:39.720> it's

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 
so background image was 0 to 0 so it's

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.810 
so background image was 0 to 0 so it's
kind<00:07:40.080> of<00:07:40.140> like<00:07:40.320> the<00:07:40.560> viewport<00:07:41.100> is<00:07:41.250> like<00:07:41.520> this

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:41.820 
kind of like the viewport is like this

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.360 
kind of like the viewport is like this
if<00:07:42.060> you<00:07:42.390> think<00:07:42.660> about<00:07:42.720> it<00:07:42.900> like<00:07:43.050> this<00:07:43.260> then<00:07:44.070> i

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.370 
if you think about it like this then i

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.230 
if you think about it like this then i
set<00:07:44.880> it<00:07:44.910> up<00:07:45.150> so<00:07:45.390> that<00:07:45.420> the<00:07:46.370> x-axis<00:07:47.370> margin<00:07:48.120> was

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 
set it up so that the x-axis margin was

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.270 
set it up so that the x-axis margin was
negative<00:07:48.780> 100<00:07:49.320> so<00:07:49.470> that<00:07:49.500> brought<00:07:49.860> it<00:07:49.950> up<00:07:50.160> a

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 
negative 100 so that brought it up a

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.730 
negative 100 so that brought it up a
hundred<00:07:50.640> pixels<00:07:50.880> and<00:07:51.300> it<00:07:51.780> popped<00:07:52.080> it<00:07:52.260> up<00:07:52.350> here

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:52.740 
hundred pixels and it popped it up here

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.950 
hundred pixels and it popped it up here
then<00:07:53.460> I<00:07:53.580> brought<00:07:53.820> the<00:07:54.030> coltrane<00:07:54.510> one<00:07:54.810> to

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 
then I brought the coltrane one to

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.410 
then I brought the coltrane one to
negative<00:07:55.320> 200<00:07:55.979> so<00:07:56.130> negative<00:07:56.520> 200

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:57.420 
negative 200 so negative 200

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.990 
negative 200 so negative 200
12<00:07:58.050> and<00:07:58.440> then<00:07:58.650> here<00:07:59.130> was<00:07:59.250> the<00:07:59.370> margin<00:07:59.790> that<00:07:59.820> it

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 
12 and then here was the margin that it

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.390 
12 and then here was the margin that it
was<00:08:00.090> doing<00:08:00.420> the<00:08:01.260> Davis<00:08:01.710> one<00:08:01.890> was<00:08:02.040> bringing<00:08:02.340> it

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 
was doing the Davis one was bringing it

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.300 
was doing the Davis one was bringing it
up<00:08:02.520> three<00:08:02.820> right<00:08:03.060> one<00:08:03.420> two<00:08:04.110> three<00:08:04.620> and<00:08:04.830> there

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:05.310 
up three right one two three and there

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.370 
up three right one two three and there
it<00:08:05.430> goes<00:08:05.460> and<00:08:06.000> the<00:08:06.360> waters<00:08:06.810> was<00:08:06.960> bringing<00:08:07.320> it

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.380 
it goes and the waters was bringing it

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.160 
it goes and the waters was bringing it
