but<00:00:04.180> there<00:00:04.300> is<00:00:04.420> someone<00:00:04.660> I've<00:00:04.810> come<00:00:05.080> across

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:05.200 
but there is someone I've come across

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.590 
but there is someone I've come across
who<00:00:05.500> might<00:00:05.770> have<00:00:05.920> a<00:00:05.950> different<00:00:06.279> solution<00:00:06.760> even

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 
who might have a different solution even

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.830 
who might have a different solution even
if<00:00:07.690> it's<00:00:07.810> not<00:00:07.990> entirely<00:00:08.320> conventional<00:00:09.840> and

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
if it's not entirely conventional and

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.170 
if it's not entirely conventional and
there's<00:00:11.020> no<00:00:11.170> super<00:00:11.619> computers<00:00:12.039> involved<00:00:12.459> so

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
there's no super computers involved so

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.730 
there's no super computers involved so
need<00:00:13.389> more<00:00:13.570> computer<00:00:14.020> power<00:00:14.049> so<00:00:14.379> how<00:00:14.559> did<00:00:14.619> you

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
need more computer power so how did you

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.890 
need more computer power so how did you
come<00:00:14.889> up<00:00:14.920> with<00:00:15.160> this<00:00:15.279> idea<00:00:15.430> well<00:00:16.150> I<00:00:16.180> was<00:00:16.570> so

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
come up with this idea well I was so

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.530 
come up with this idea well I was so
everyone<00:00:17.500> evening<00:00:17.770> with<00:00:17.920> a<00:00:17.949> friends<00:00:18.420> who<00:00:19.420> was

noise<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:39.340> trouble<00:00:39.760> was<00:00:39.880> so<00:00:40.270> much<00:00:40.480> data<00:00:40.810> was

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
it all so they hit on a brilliant idea

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.790 
it all so they hit on a brilliant idea
they<00:00:49.059> parceled<00:00:49.660> up<00:00:49.750> the<00:00:49.870> radio<00:00:50.050> signals<00:00:50.620> and

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
they parceled up the radio signals and

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.740 
they parceled up the radio signals and
sent<00:00:51.250> them<00:00:51.370> out<00:00:51.489> over<00:00:51.700> the<00:00:51.940> internet<00:00:52.360> for

home miles wondered if we could use the
same<00:00:58.149> method<00:00:58.540> to<00:00:58.690> run<00:00:58.870> climate<00:00:59.410> models<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
same method to run climate models and

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.139 
same method to run climate models and
submit<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.440> initial<00:01:02.800> reaction<00:01:03.640> was<00:01:03.760> pretty

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
submit the initial reaction was pretty

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.109 
submit the initial reaction was pretty
skeptical<00:01:04.689> I<00:01:04.960> mean<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.920> lot<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.700> people<00:01:06.819> just

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
skeptical I mean a lot of people just

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.050 
skeptical I mean a lot of people just
said<00:01:07.299> yeah<00:01:07.420> but<00:01:07.569> you'll<00:01:07.719> never<00:01:07.869> get<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:09.060> real

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
said yeah but you'll never get a real

but Mars wasn't to be deterred he spent

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.290 
but Mars wasn't to be deterred he spent
years<00:01:19.190> trying<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.670> get<00:01:19.850> massively

ordinary home computers and as home

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.990 
ordinary home computers and as home
computers<00:01:27.050> became<00:01:27.320> ever<00:01:27.620> more<00:01:27.710> powerful<00:01:28.460> he

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
computers became ever more powerful he

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.250 
computers became ever more powerful he
eventually<00:01:29.240> confounded<00:01:30.230> the<00:01:30.380> skeptics<00:01:32.260> okay

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
eventually confounded the skeptics okay

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.690 
eventually confounded the skeptics okay
we'll<00:01:33.440> come<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:33.620> here<00:01:34.010> and<00:01:34.220> in<00:01:34.400> what<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.580> can

computing shop yeah is running its own
climate<00:01:45.860> model<00:01:46.190> it<00:01:46.520> it's<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.880> most

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
climate model it it's the most

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.110 
climate model it it's the most
complicated<00:01:47.620> computer<00:01:48.620> program<00:01:49.160> of<00:01:49.400> its<00:01:49.850> type

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
complicated computer program of its type

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.430 
complicated computer program of its type
that's<00:01:50.479> ever<00:01:50.600> been<00:01:50.750> run<00:01:50.930> on<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:51.110> personal

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440

computer so this what's going on here

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.370 
computer so this what's going on here
this<00:01:54.800> is<00:01:54.950> obviously<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.640> earth<00:01:56.360> yes<00:01:57.020> at

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
this is obviously the earth yes at

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.440 
this is obviously the earth yes at
different<00:01:58.130> temperatures<00:01:58.550> early<00:01:58.729> Earth<00:01:59.060> this

so<00:03:57.459> anyone<00:03:57.819> can<00:03:58.030> join<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.540> all<00:03:59.319> you<00:03:59.530> do<00:03:59.709> is

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
so anyone can join in all you do is

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.100 
so anyone can join in all you do is
download<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.549> software<00:04:00.930> everything<00:04:01.930> else

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
download the software everything else

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.050 
download the software everything else
happens<00:04:02.500> automatically<00:04:03.099> and<00:04:03.640> it<00:04:03.849> won't

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
happens automatically and it won't

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.729 
happens automatically and it won't
interfere<00:04:04.269> with<00:04:04.599> your<00:04:04.780> normal<00:04:05.019> computing

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
interfere with your normal computing

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.949 
interfere with your normal computing
it'll<00:04:06.340> work<00:04:06.579> in<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.849> background<00:04:07.329> like<00:04:07.930> a

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
it'll work in the background like a

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.610 
it'll work in the background like a
screensaver<00:04:09.120> now<00:04:10.120> what<00:04:10.299> do<00:04:10.390> we<00:04:10.480> need<00:04:10.629> to<00:04:11.440> get

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
just need hundreds of thousand and it

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.629 
just need hundreds of thousand and it
won't<00:04:17.680> interfere<00:04:17.889> with<00:04:18.220> your<00:04:18.370> normal

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639

bigger than the world's biggest
supervision<00:05:03.099> that's<00:05:03.940> unbelievable<00:05:04.720> exactly

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.490 

you<00:05:11.210> know<00:05:11.360> when<00:05:11.810> I<00:05:11.840> started<00:05:12.290> this<00:05:12.440> journey

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
you know when I started this journey

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.190 
you know when I started this journey
like<00:05:13.280> a<00:05:13.310> lot<00:05:13.550> of<00:05:13.610> people<00:05:13.730> I<00:05:14.270> wasn't<00:05:14.810> even<00:05:15.050> sure

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
like a lot of people I wasn't even sure

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.980 
like a lot of people I wasn't even sure
if<00:05:15.560> global<00:05:15.830> warming<00:05:16.040> existed<00:05:16.910> but<00:05:17.720> when<00:05:17.900> you

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
if global warming existed but when you

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.600 
if global warming existed but when you
see<00:05:18.200> the<00:05:18.320> disappearing<00:05:18.950> glacier<00:05:19.400> in

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
see the disappearing glacier in

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.240 
see the disappearing glacier in
Greenland<00:05:20.150> the<00:05:21.020> vanishing<00:05:21.500> ice<00:05:21.680> shelves<00:05:22.040> in

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
Greenland the vanishing ice shelves in

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.940 
Greenland the vanishing ice shelves in
Antarctica<00:05:22.910> and<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.180> hockey<00:05:23.990> stick<00:05:24.320> graph<00:05:24.380> is

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
Antarctica and the hockey stick graph is

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.239 
Antarctica and the hockey stick graph is
certainly<00:05:25.760> convinces<00:05:26.390> me

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:29.249 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:32.929 

the<00:05:29.909> only<00:05:30.149> question<00:05:30.359> is<00:05:31.129> exactly<00:05:32.129> how<00:05:32.399> bad<00:05:32.729> is

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:32.939 
the only question is exactly how bad is

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:35.839 
the only question is exactly how bad is
going<00:05:33.149> to<00:05:33.359> be<00:05:33.539> and<00:05:34.009> now<00:05:35.009> it<00:05:35.159> looks<00:05:35.309> as<00:05:35.609> if<00:05:35.639> we

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
going to be and now it looks as if we

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.509 
going to be and now it looks as if we
might<00:05:36.089> even<00:05:36.299> get<00:05:36.539> an<00:05:36.659> answer<00:05:37.019> to<00:05:37.199> that<00:05:37.229> and<00:05:37.679> the

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:38.519 
might even get an answer to that and the

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:40.069 
might even get an answer to that and the
biggest<00:05:38.729> surprise<00:05:38.939> for<00:05:39.389> me<00:05:39.509> is<00:05:39.809> not<00:05:39.929> the

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:40.079 
biggest surprise for me is not the

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.539 
biggest surprise for me is not the
scientist<00:05:40.679> so<00:05:40.829> we're<00:05:40.919> going<00:05:41.009> to<00:05:41.099> provide<00:05:41.399> the

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:41.549 
scientist so we're going to provide the

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:44.569 
scientist so we're going to provide the
answers<00:05:41.999> it's<00:05:42.449> you<00:05:42.749> and<00:05:43.049> me<00:05:43.079> so<00:05:44.009> to<00:05:44.069> find<00:05:44.399> out

the<00:06:04.090> way<00:06:04.210> I<00:06:04.240> see<00:06:04.420> it<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:05.170> planet<00:06:05.530> belongs<00:06:05.800> to

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980 
the way I see it the planet belongs to

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.670 
the way I see it the planet belongs to
all<00:06:06.190> of<00:06:06.220> us<00:06:06.570> but<00:06:07.570> it's<00:06:07.750> not<00:06:07.930> often<00:06:08.170> we<00:06:08.410> get<00:06:08.620> a

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
all of us but it's not often we get a

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.740 
all of us but it's not often we get a
chance<00:06:09.010> to<00:06:09.220> be<00:06:09.340> involved<00:06:09.700> in<00:06:10.060> shaping<00:06:10.360> its

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
chance to be involved in shaping its

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.130 
chance to be involved in shaping its
future<00:06:11.230> I'm<00:06:11.940> hoping<00:06:12.940> this<00:06:13.090> experiment<00:06:13.780> will

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
future I'm hoping this experiment will

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.820 
future I'm hoping this experiment will
change<00:06:14.530> that<00:06:14.800> in<00:06:15.540> a<00:06:16.540> few<00:06:16.780> months<00:06:16.900> time<00:06:17.080> will

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
change that in a few months time will

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.440 
change that in a few months time will
report<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:18.340> results<00:06:18.490> in<00:06:18.910> a<00:06:19.000> special

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
report the results in a special

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.160 
report the results in a special
follow-up<00:06:19.930> program<00:06:20.760> until<00:06:21.760> then<00:06:22.060> it's<00:06:22.930> over

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.170 
follow-up program until then it's over

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:46.279 
follow-up program until then it's over
to<00:06:23.350> you

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:46.289 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:52.200 

you

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.240 

Oh
