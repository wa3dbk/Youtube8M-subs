00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
of go to the whole line gradually so

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.289 
of go to the whole line gradually so
this<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.430> got<00:03:29.640> in<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:31.400> was<00:03:32.400> either<00:03:32.549> februari<00:03:33.120> or

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
this I got in it was either februari or

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.720 
this I got in it was either februari or
march<00:03:33.569> there's<00:03:34.380> still<00:03:34.709> tons<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.489> tons<00:03:35.579> of

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
march there's still tons and tons of

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.630 
march there's still tons and tons of
product<00:03:36.150> in<00:03:36.299> there<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.829> expensive<00:03:38.220> but

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
product in there so it is expensive but

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.030 
product in there so it is expensive but
it'll<00:03:38.880> last<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.359> long<00:03:39.600> time<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.560> one

because you can't do like the half
squirt<00:03:42.540> with<00:03:42.660> this<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.470> one<00:03:43.769> square<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.310> enough

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
squirt with this so one square is enough

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.460
