deserve it so when I uploaded my review

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.179 
deserve it so when I uploaded my review
I<00:00:21.570> said<00:00:21.840> my<00:00:21.960> main<00:00:22.170> issue<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.769> puzzle

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
I said my main issue with this puzzle

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.730 
I said my main issue with this puzzle
was<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.029> locking<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.289> feeling<00:00:25.619> was

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
was the locking and that the feeling was

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.759 
was the locking and that the feeling was
great<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.340> extremely<00:00:26.789> smooth<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
great it was extremely smooth but the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.389 
great it was extremely smooth but the
cube<00:00:29.070> locked<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.869> when<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.380> said<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.070> lot<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
cube locked so when I said this a lot of

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.060 
cube locked so when I said this a lot of
people<00:00:32.550> were<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.450> tried

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
people were like have you tried

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.650 
people were like have you tried
tensioning<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.430> corners<00:00:35.820> or<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.329> don't<00:00:36.570> know

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
tensioning the corners or I don't know

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.299 
tensioning the corners or I don't know
if<00:00:36.750> that's<00:00:36.930> exactly<00:00:37.290> what<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.559> said<00:00:37.739> but

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
if that's exactly what they said but

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.580 
if that's exactly what they said but
basically<00:00:38.730> there<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.059> screws<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> corners

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
basically there is screws in the corners

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.340 
basically there is screws in the corners
of<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.460> puzzle<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.120> people<00:00:42.719> asked<00:00:42.899> me<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.230> I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
of this puzzle and people asked me if I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.139 
of this puzzle and people asked me if I
had<00:00:43.379> bothered<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.070> loosen<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.760> I'm<00:00:44.910> like

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
had bothered to loosen it and I'm like

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.630 
had bothered to loosen it and I'm like
no<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.140> didn't<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.460> was<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
no like I I didn't think that that was a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.310 
no like I I didn't think that that was a
thing<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.420> normally<00:00:48.570> did<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.200> you

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
thing that you normally did because you

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.920 
thing that you normally did because you
don't<00:00:49.500> cuz<00:00:49.710> most<00:00:49.860> cubes<00:00:50.219> don't<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.930> screws

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
don't cuz most cubes don't have screws

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.650 
don't cuz most cubes don't have screws
in<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> corners<00:00:53.030> but<00:00:54.030> people<00:00:54.239> were<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.510> if

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
in the corners but people were like if

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.970 
in the corners but people were like if
you<00:00:54.780> haven't<00:00:55.110> done<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.620> should<00:00:55.829> really

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
you haven't done that you should really

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.189 
you haven't done that you should really
try<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.370> because<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.420> helps<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.780> lot<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
try it because it helps a lot with the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.779 
try it because it helps a lot with the
locking<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.710> when<00:00:59.100> people<00:00:59.340> told<00:00:59.430> me<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.670> I

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
locking and when people told me this I

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.720 
locking and when people told me this I
was<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.059> that's<00:01:00.410> very<00:01:01.410> strange<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:02.430> I've

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
was like that's very strange like I've

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.579 
was like that's very strange like I've
never<00:01:03.180> heard<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.629> something<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.379> for

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
never heard of something like that for

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.039 
never heard of something like that for
obvious<00:01:04.949> reasons<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.240> decided<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.780> try<00:01:06.930> it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
obvious reasons but I decided to try it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
obvious reasons but I decided to try it
because<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.470> really<00:01:08.070> did<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.760> feeling<00:01:09.119> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
because I really did like the feeling of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.090 
because I really did like the feeling of
this<00:01:09.390> puzzle<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.960> extreme<00:01:10.409> smoothness<00:01:10.710> and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
this puzzle the extreme smoothness and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.210 
this puzzle the extreme smoothness and
if<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.180> would<00:01:12.570> fix<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> locking<00:01:13.409> which<00:01:13.710> was

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
if it would fix the locking which was

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.429 
if it would fix the locking which was
the<00:01:14.400> main<00:01:14.430> issue<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.000> had<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:15.990> mean

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the main issue I had with it then I mean

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.700 
the main issue I had with it then I mean
why<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:16.799> try<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.060> did<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.650> took

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
why not try it so I did that and I took

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.030 
why not try it so I did that and I took
apart<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> cube<00:01:20.640> completely<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.799> relived<00:01:22.799> it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
apart the cube completely I relived it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
apart the cube completely I relived it
and<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.750> loosened<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.990> corners<00:01:25.729> hoping<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and I loosened the corners hoping that

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.929 
and I loosened the corners hoping that
it<00:01:27.150> would<00:01:27.240> help<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.750> as<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:29.340> may<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.610> able<00:01:29.790> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.670 
it would help and as you may be able to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
watching this listing the review but I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.310 
watching this listing the review but I
had<00:01:36.000> some<00:01:36.210> songs<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> review<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
had some songs in the review and the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.980 
had some songs in the review and the
locking<00:01:37.710> was<00:01:38.240> extremely<00:01:39.240> bad<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.780> video

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
locking was extremely bad in that video

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.090 
locking was extremely bad in that video
and<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:41.189> really<00:01:41.960> invariable<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.890> just

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
and I really invariable but I just

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.530
