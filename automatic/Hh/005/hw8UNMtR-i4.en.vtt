00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
worth pointing out sort of an easter egg

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.640 
worth pointing out sort of an easter egg
and<00:00:09.809> this<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:09.990> actually<00:00:10.260> going<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.469> be<00:00:10.559> an

and this is actually going to be an

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.200 
and this is actually going to be an
eleventh<00:00:11.130> terminal<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.880> they<00:00:11.969> kind<00:00:12.150> of

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
eleventh terminal that they kind of

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.450 
eleventh terminal that they kind of

like showing you guys how to do it now
add<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.570> bunch<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.020> codes<00:00:43.290> at<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.559> point<00:00:43.739> i

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
add in a bunch of codes at this point i

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.319 
add in a bunch of codes at this point i
mean<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:44.610> you're<00:00:44.820> looking<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
mean this if you're looking to this and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.279 
mean this if you're looking to this and
you've<00:00:45.420> never<00:00:45.510> seen<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.840> before<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.200> have

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
you've never seen this before you have

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.930 
you've never seen this before you have
no<00:00:46.379> idea<00:00:46.500> what<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.770> means<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.489> something<00:00:47.850> on

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
no idea what it means but I something on

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.209 
no idea what it means but I something on
my<00:00:48.030> second<00:00:48.329> screen<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.840> shows<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.350> what<00:00:50.129> you

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
my second screen that shows you what you

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.410 
my second screen that shows you what you
need<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> input<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.030> think<00:00:51.329> I'll

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
need to input and I think I'll

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.299 
need to input and I think I'll
fast-forward<00:00:51.870> through<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.590> really<00:00:53.160> really

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
fast-forward through this really really

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:10.560 
fast-forward through this really really
quick

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.120 

and<00:01:10.659> while<00:01:11.320> you're<00:01:11.470> doing<00:01:11.500> this<00:01:11.860> you're<00:01:11.920> going

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
and while you're doing this you're going

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.460 
and while you're doing this you're going
to<00:01:12.250> be<00:01:12.340> getting<00:01:12.430> a<00:01:12.700> ton<00:01:13.540> of<00:01:13.810> points<00:01:14.110> and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
to be getting a ton of points and

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.920 
to be getting a ton of points and
basically<00:01:15.340> you<00:01:15.550> have<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.760> code<00:01:16.090> for<00:01:16.360> each<00:01:16.540> one

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
basically you have a code for each one

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.149 
basically you have a code for each one
of<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.140> terminals<00:01:17.350> so<00:01:17.650> it's<00:01:17.800> ten<00:01:17.979> different

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
of the terminals so it's ten different

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.890 
of the terminals so it's ten different
codes<00:01:18.430> in<00:01:18.610> general<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:19.090> after<00:01:19.390> you<00:01:19.510> add<00:01:19.690> in

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
codes in general and after you add in

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.400 
codes in general and after you add in
all<00:01:20.080> 10<00:01:20.410> of<00:01:20.440> them<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:21.460> will<00:01:21.670> get<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.240> you'll<00:01:23.229> get

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
all 10 of them you will get a you'll get

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.140 
all 10 of them you will get a you'll get
the<00:01:23.619> 11th<00:01:24.130> terminal<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:24.550> will<00:01:24.670> be<00:01:24.790> unlocked

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
the 11th terminal that will be unlocked

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.399 
the 11th terminal that will be unlocked
and<00:01:25.300> I'm<00:01:25.420> gonna<00:01:25.510> go<00:01:25.659> ahead<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:25.869> do<00:01:26.050> that<00:01:26.080> real

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
and I'm gonna go ahead and do that real

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.660 
and I'm gonna go ahead and do that real
quick<00:01:26.440> which<00:01:26.770> I<00:01:26.830> have<00:01:26.950> never<00:01:27.070> done<00:01:27.160> this<00:01:27.400> on<00:01:27.550> my

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
quick which I have never done this on my

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
I've entered in all 10 of the codes all

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.820 
I've entered in all 10 of the codes all
10<00:01:33.910> of<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.060> codes<00:01:34.270> are<00:01:34.600> specific<00:01:35.259> for<00:01:35.290> each

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
10 of the codes are specific for each

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.219 
10 of the codes are specific for each
and<00:01:36.310> every<00:01:36.460> terminal<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.240> if<00:01:37.930> you<00:01:38.050> actually

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
and every terminal and if you actually

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.219 
and every terminal and if you actually
look<00:01:38.440> each<00:01:38.830> terminal<00:01:39.160> has<00:01:39.580> its<00:01:39.910> own<00:01:40.060> code<00:01:40.450> so

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
look each terminal has its own code so

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.810 
look each terminal has its own code so
if<00:01:41.410> you<00:01:41.530> look<00:01:41.740> at<00:01:41.860> each<00:01:42.009> terminal<00:01:42.340> when<00:01:42.700> you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
if you look at each terminal when you

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.760 
if you look at each terminal when you
first<00:01:43.240> start<00:01:43.479> playing<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:44.140> terminal<00:01:44.530> it'll

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
first start playing that terminal it'll

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.139 
first start playing that terminal it'll
show<00:01:44.920> you<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.070> code<00:01:45.399> so<00:01:45.700> if<00:01:45.789> you<00:01:45.880> enter<00:01:46.119> that

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
show you a code so if you enter that

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.570 
show you a code so if you enter that
code<00:01:46.420> into<00:01:46.690> halo<00:01:46.930> waypoint<00:01:47.430> obviously<00:01:48.430> it'll

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
code into halo waypoint obviously it'll

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.430 
code into halo waypoint obviously it'll
give<00:01:48.850> you<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.030> lot<00:01:49.330> of<00:01:49.420> credits<00:01:49.750> for<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:49.990> armory

youtube<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.190> someone<00:02:07.149> has<00:02:07.300> a<00:02:07.539> walk<00:02:07.930> through

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
youtube it someone has a walk through

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.840 
youtube it someone has a walk through
that<00:02:08.229> shows<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.679> all<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.920> codes<00:02:09.459> are<00:02:09.610> next<00:02:09.789> to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
that shows you all the codes are next to

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.190 
that shows you all the codes are next to
each<00:02:09.940> other<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.269> it's<00:02:10.390> just<00:02:10.450> easier<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.050> put

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
each other so it's just easier to put

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.350 
each other so it's just easier to put
them<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.380> that<00:02:11.410> way<00:02:11.560> but<00:02:12.340> that's<00:02:12.610> originally

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
them in that way but that's originally

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.250 
them in that way but that's originally
how<00:02:13.480> you're<00:02:13.600> supposed<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.840> be<00:02:13.900> able<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.110> find

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.390 
how you're supposed to be able to find
it<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.410> that's<00:02:14.590> how<00:02:14.680> someone<00:02:14.980> originally

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
it and that's how someone originally

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.280 
it and that's how someone originally
found<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:15.730> but<00:02:16.090> after<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.450> instant<00:02:16.900> enter
