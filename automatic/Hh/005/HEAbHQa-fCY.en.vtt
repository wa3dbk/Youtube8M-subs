00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Good day today soldered 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.040
 fine voltage converter 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.730
 which makes 12 volts 220 for power 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.839
 such elimination lamp 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:18.840
 Well, now more in detail means the heart 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.320
 the chip is the heart of the circuit 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.369
 is make 4 this microchip 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.609
 is a master oscillator which 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.470
 generates pulses of 100 kilohertz 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.010
 sends them to these transistors these 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.930
 Help transistors lyayut and the whole thing in 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.850
 As pumps in here 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.559
 transformer 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.170
 homemade ferrite transformer 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.950
 who was personally wrapped around me 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.829
 such a filter ring 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:56.760
 fx number 87 material can be used 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:02.940
 better the primary winding here consists 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.710
 of the two lived secondary winding here 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.650
 wound wire mgtf 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:16.470
 015 wire diameter and somewhere around 150 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.460
 turns in the secondary winding further with 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.840
 secondary winding 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:26.009
 the wire went out and we have this thing going on 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:29.850
 voltage doubler it is assembled on diodes 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.310
 fr 307 and 2 electrolytic 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.659
 almost all capacitors 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:42.720
 microfarate each 470 microfarad 250 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:46.170
 volt what else is here now 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.960
 fuse that protects the circuit 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.759
 Well, from any abnormal situations, it is not enough 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.509
 what suddenly this goat will be or else 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.640
 anything in anything happens here it is 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.229
 just blown out here too 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.140
 there is such a powerful diode which 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.790
 protects the circuit from reverse polarization ie 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.590
 the case of reversal when we was with 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.050
 plus inadvertently changed to food 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.959
 us nothing explodes with us just 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.650
 this LED will light up 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.510
 signal 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.519
 that we have the wrong connection 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.200
 right on the food case right 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.129
 connection this led is off 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.439
 lights are just those he's lit 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.239
 always when terminals are connected like 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.069
 only we turn on the mouse switch 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.720
 us to meet yet this led 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.680
 which will signal that 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.989
 the circuit is working now that is these 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.930
 two LEDs extremely yellow green 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.030
 they shine always when working during 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.299
 work 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.829
 so further here we still go 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.790
 stabilizer type 708 12 which 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:55.459
 stabilizes voltage only for 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.989
 power supply driver on 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.659
 the transistor is just a ghetto straight 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.829
 the tension is already here for us only 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.670
 what if turned on in the car 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.470
 if suddenly there will be some kind of leap 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.540
 voltage transistors 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.139
 it easily withstand because they are up to 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.120
 30 volts can raise the voltage 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:20.690
 but the chip does not stand on what is not 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:23.190
 can be a maximum of up to 16 but with this 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.650
 with this stabilizer you can also 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.150
 supply up to 30 volts to the output 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:33.150
 the stabilizer will still be 12 so 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.609
 I told about the LED here 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.659
 asked told also here 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:45.359
 confine myself to the field resistor 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:48.030
 transistors here are resistors which 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.120
 set the width of the pulse here these 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.150
 first two left 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.829
 then goes yellow capacitor 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.780
 which sets the frequency of the generator and 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:02.579
 next to him on the right most extreme is 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:07.079
 a resistor that also sets the purity 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:09.479
 there are they butt contour which sets 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.680
 the frequency in this case is 100 kilohertz 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:17.889
 frequency here 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:21.019
 it was all collected on the PCB 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:25.699
 top was covered with varnish DAC varnish 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:30.680
 usually not very beautiful 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:35.479
 be but nonetheless works on soldered 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:39.949
 as I could here, I even signed what 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:47.240
 it is a bolt from a transformer 12 volts dc in 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:53.870
 220 volt dc so we will power from 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:57.259
 This battery immediately show how much 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:02.210
 we have this battery volt gives me 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:05.599
 written 7 amps per hour that with difficulty 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:14.360
 Of course, the Chinese believe forever 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:19.070
 overestimate so that's 12 and a half volts 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:25.000
 24 volt battery from this 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:28.250
 voltage I will now feed m means 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.080
 for starters, I'll show you how protection against 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.400
 polarity reversal 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:39.970
 here I am a positive wire connected a 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:42.849
 minus a minus wire for plus 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.199
 nothing exploded 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:49.570
 LED lit up which simply 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:51.789
 signals that it is not correct 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:57.070
 connected 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:57.070
 the circuit is now changing terminals 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.410
 here is a medium shining which 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:11.560
 signals that the power is just 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.560
 there is at the terminals now turn on the switch 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:22.780
 That's how we have all the scheme in full 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.780
 condition and watch the great miracle 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:46.939
 everything works transistors to 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:51.529
 you need to heat up such three lamps 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:54.620
 hang at the exit even 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:56.569
 I think this probably will not pull from 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:01.789
 transformer is a transformer with difficulty 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:04.360
 this light bulb diminishes later at home 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:08.270
 rewind for more 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.349
 ring and more take a little bit 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.349
 more powerful to make a transformer 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:20.779
 everything works so now we turn on now 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:26.629
 need to discharge high voltage 

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:31.340
 capacitors are discharged like this 

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:33.370
 my circuit converter works 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.180
 voltage is a very good thing 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.879
 battery consumption is 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.589
 approximately one and a half ampere case with this 

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:42.610
 bulb case with incandescent bulb 

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:45.770
 it will be about 3 amps 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:51.639
 either the case of two such lamps i think 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:55.419
 will be somewhere under 4 amps 

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:55.419
 at 220 volts 

00:07:55.899 --> 00:08:01.460
 20 watts 220 240 volts 50 60 hertz 

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:05.389
 written on my case as many as 100 

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:09.219
 kilohertz in general thank you all for 

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:09.219
 attention yet
