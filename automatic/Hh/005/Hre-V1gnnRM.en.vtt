00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
mean I started thinking about this when

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.650 
mean I started thinking about this when
I<00:00:19.270> was<00:00:19.420> a<00:00:19.480> teenager<00:00:20.160> my<00:00:21.160> friend's<00:00:22.090> keyboard

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
I was a teenager my friend's keyboard

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.920 
I was a teenager my friend's keyboard
player<00:00:22.900> J<00:00:23.289> Oliver<00:00:23.710> that<00:00:24.509> we<00:00:25.509> grew<00:00:25.689> up<00:00:25.779> together

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
player J Oliver that we grew up together

player J Oliver that we grew up together
and<00:00:26.529> he<00:00:27.360> not<00:00:28.360> only<00:00:28.390> being<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.809> great<00:00:29.020> keyboard

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
and he not only being a great keyboard

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.580 
and he not only being a great keyboard
player<00:00:29.680> he<00:00:30.579> had<00:00:31.119> his<00:00:31.270> own<00:00:31.419> studio<00:00:31.899> from<00:00:32.290> a<00:00:32.380> very

early age as well in his own house and
you<00:00:36.760> know<00:00:36.850> that<00:00:37.030> was<00:00:37.180> like<00:00:37.360> a<00:00:37.420> playground<00:00:38.079> for

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
you know that was like a playground for

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.610 
you know that was like a playground for
us<00:00:38.590> to<00:00:38.920> experiment<00:00:39.460> and<00:00:39.940> and<00:00:40.840> we<00:00:41.110> started

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
us to experiment and and we started

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.840 
us to experiment and and we started
learning<00:00:42.100> about<00:00:43.199> how<00:00:44.280> especially<00:00:45.280> for<00:00:45.519> me<00:00:45.640> the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
learning about how especially for me the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.389 
learning about how especially for me the
drums<00:00:46.149> were<00:00:46.420> captured<00:00:46.960> with<00:00:46.989> with<00:00:47.710> mics<00:00:48.039> and

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
drums were captured with with mics and

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.970 
drums were captured with with mics and
the<00:00:48.480> relationship<00:00:49.480> of<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.780> tuning<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.469> how

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
the relationship of the tuning and how

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.380 
the relationship of the tuning and how
that<00:00:51.159> that<00:00:51.550> worked<00:00:51.879> together

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
that that worked together

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.619 
that that worked together
in<00:00:52.659> sound<00:00:53.320> presentation<00:00:54.129> and<00:00:54.460> then<00:00:54.699> you<00:00:55.510> know

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
in sound presentation and then you know

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.349 
in sound presentation and then you know
manipulation<00:00:56.199> through<00:00:56.999> processing<00:00:57.999> and<00:00:58.149> such

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
manipulation through processing and such

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.919 
manipulation through processing and such
and<00:00:59.199> you<00:01:00.039> know<00:01:00.159> that<00:01:00.339> kind<00:01:00.670> of<00:01:00.929> transferred

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
and you know that kind of transferred

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.229 
and you know that kind of transferred
itself<00:01:02.260> into<00:01:02.679> the<00:01:02.979> live<00:01:03.219> aspect<00:01:03.519> as<00:01:04.030> well

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
itself into the live aspect as well

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.580 
itself into the live aspect as well
because<00:01:04.780> I<00:01:05.170> wanted<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.860> as<00:01:06.430> best<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:07.000> could

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
because I wanted to as best I could

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.870 
because I wanted to as best I could
represent<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:09.729> nice<00:01:11.070> fidelity<00:01:12.070> sound

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
represent really nice fidelity sound

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.679 
represent really nice fidelity sound
live<00:01:13.770> because<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:15.010> remember<00:01:15.670> later<00:01:15.969> in<00:01:16.479> New

kind of thing as far as light weight you

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.290 
kind of thing as far as light weight you
know<00:02:19.150> self<00:02:19.989> powered<00:02:20.550> stuff<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:22.000> know<00:02:22.120> where<00:02:22.269> I

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
know self powered stuff you know where I

know self powered stuff you know where I
grew<00:02:22.569> up<00:02:22.659> in<00:02:22.870> st.<00:02:23.080> Louis<00:02:23.470> there<00:02:23.680> wasn't<00:02:24.010> a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
grew up in st. Louis there wasn't a

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.600 
grew up in st. Louis there wasn't a
whole<00:02:24.730> lot<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:25.000> people<00:02:25.120> do

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
with our gear but but but we we learned

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.350 
with our gear but but but we we learned
