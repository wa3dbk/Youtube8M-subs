00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.320
 ah 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.090
 this robot reacts like a human being 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.619
 and he is the most difficult patient to treat 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.960
 within the training unit 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.250
 medical faculty of medicine 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.680
 unam has heartbeat 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.380
 have you going to see right now how 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.670
 move breathe but also if you 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.500
 puts a stethoscope listening 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.220
 perfectly the heartbeat and going to 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.690
 see how the rib cage is 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.330
 expand if you have a pulse you can 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.670
 touch the pulse and beats like a human being 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.860
 calm can be contracted or delayed 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.840
 you can cough already express your feeling 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.840
 all patients 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.480
 and I could ask him why then he 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.620
 and he will answer me 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.620
 how it feels 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.080
 in this this simulator has like 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.450
 goal put in complex situations 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.400
 to the students if they are wrong the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.560
 simulator will let you know but in the 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.560
 actually a negligence can be fatal 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.380
 but being human here we can see a 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.150
 monitor as they are really going to be 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 interacting as a patient 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.460
 real giving us data five vital signs 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.470
 even of corpses is an approach 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.210
 to the human body experience with a 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.550
 simulator is beyond that in the 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.240
 corpse what is done is therefore see 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:52.120
 anatomical structures but we can not 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.790
 have physiological responses like here 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.740
 we can do it in this first robot 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.210
 we can even change it from insects 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.890
 the students will face in the 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.960
 laboratory to the patient with a crisis 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.730
 epilepticus a myocardial infarction a 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.680
 cardiovascular arrest an infection of 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.750
 Respiratory urinary tract in order 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.330
 cases that must be resolved in life 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.400
 real and I'm going to give them to the 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.340
 boys, I'm going to bring you closer 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.200
 possible to what a real patient is if 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.720
 then the example that we want them 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.130
 to present is that right now 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.840
 patient is an asthmatic patient who for 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.180
 at some point it becomes complicated 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.379
 arrives at the emergency service from the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.060
 doctor who looks for the right place that 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.379
 the second intercostal space line 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.770
 half clavicular to introduce his 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:46.960
 needle in such a way that 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.960
 and the air starts to come out 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.280
 the players are accompanied by a 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.990
 sophisticated software that 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.350
 trainers have already begun to know 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.350
 ah 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.690
 when the vision pineda in light of that 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.690
 no longer radio should land
