00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.350
 good others come to a new video 

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:05.450
 good to say that rockstar has 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.590
 announced now that the dawn that is a 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.750
 rather strange work for me 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.250
 I would like to announce things the truth I do not 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.809
 I expected it for nothing and more today that is 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.210
 a day that they do not stop having told us 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.820
 today is a day that we arrived the days that 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.099
 more news there is at the height of great 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.189
 events and other good are going to add 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.890
 new game modes here I have them 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.859
 here the translated ones will arrive on the 10th 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.460
 march in together with the robberies and they will be 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.309
 online gnost gnomes 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.879
 we go with the first mentality of does 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.289
 do not go out to play will be the translation of 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.769
 this new game mode that surely 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.359
 then in Spanish I have another 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.030
 another translation a team of three 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.579
 people have to get to a house 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.559
 basically I do not know if with house you want 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.589
 say a house or the goal and good 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.030
 you're basically limited to going on foot and 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.129
 then the hunters the other team of 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.449
 Hunt the other team are hunters to see 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.460
 I will explain a team of three 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.340
 people have to reach a goal 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.320
 we are limited and fast and others and 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.479
 we will have weapons and all this 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.350
 hunters have vehicles and they have to 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.030
 prevent us from reaching that point 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.610
 logically they have vehicles and life to be 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.040
 imitated the others not the runners 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.380
 normal teams of three do not have 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.330
 unlimited lives and if they die then to the 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.770
 super fuck so good we'll have to go 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.780
 with careful kind of games of 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.869
 hungry but not imbalanced 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.380
 we could say with a goal of 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.420
 arrival then we have the mentality mode 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.950
 of siege up to four players have 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.420
 that maintain your position against six 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.729
 attackers in a defense mode of 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.800
 gta style location the attackers 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.050
 they have unlimited lives but only just 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.210
 they have 100 if they have limited lives 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.210
 I wanted you to tell them 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.800
 the attackers have unlimited lives 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.350
 but to whom the pot has gone but 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.470
 they basically only have shotguns 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.900
 clipped and the defenders have a 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.610
 full use of all weapons so 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.430
 well they will only have shotguns 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.080
 cropped and the defenders as I say 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.300
 we will have all our all 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.310
 our weapons and we can thus to 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.790
 alleviate it and others I do not know very well how to go 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.790
 to this mode 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.390
 not so we 'll see how it goes 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.519
 how are those points that maintain and 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.830
 besides the truth that quite see it 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.830
 it can be a pretty interesting mode and 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.330
 we go with the third game mode that I 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.760
 it seems I think the best 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.319
 it's called up to the view basically you 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.930
 it will be a chase between trucks and 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.370
 bikes the trucks will have to chase 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.870
 to the bikes try to kill them 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.120
 run over them and they do not reach their 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.180
 target cyclists on the other hand 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.410
 then we will be able to go up to 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.470
 a point and when when we got there 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.200
 I imagine that we will have won then to 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.120
 from that or apart from that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.470
 We will have daily goals and we can 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.190
 earn up to half a million dollars 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.840
 in bonds and others within the within 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.730
 game is in this 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.620
 and it seems that there will also be 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.410
 new functionalities activities and 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.920
 others in the mode in free mode 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.200
 new missions of trevor 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.700
 and from rum from abroad all of these 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.099
 one that they will ask us to do 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.020
 different things so good on day 10 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.750
 March we will have many things 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.880
 apart from the heists remember that 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.760

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.209
