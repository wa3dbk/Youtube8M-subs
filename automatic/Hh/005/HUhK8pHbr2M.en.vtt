00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.369
 welcome to the latest video of the velux 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.659
 attic make about six weeks ago 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.460
 started rebuilding the 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.779
 dark mess attic of the family of 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.579
 roasting 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.230
 Mark and Janneke were then told that 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.979
 they were the lucky winners of the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.149
 were a makeover of 25,000 euros 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.980
 meanwhile the dark one is unnamed 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.900
 Space turns into a sleep paradise 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.750
 where today the dots on the i 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.190
 put the house on the list of vtwonen 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.810
 the last styling on before it 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.350
 end result to mark and janneke 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.350
 is displayed 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.140
 put those upstairs I stood by the stairs 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.970
 and I already saw seven light downstairs 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.280
 I really had something like this wow this is real 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.750
 so fantastic this really is a metamorphosis 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.300
 compared to the first time we 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.650
 were here because was throne night and now is 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.180
 the light 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.100
 it's day the end must be wild 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.109
 is made but we thought it was 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.640
 keep troubled very basic 

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:15.229
 so with light colors soft in color 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.590
 maybe some cool elements in it and 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.940
 furthermore the personal that you like that 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.250
 you can see that is for me too 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.020
 essential and also bing for the house 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.670
 that the trusses 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.650
 that they are just sanded because they 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.690
 have been preserved in the color that 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.190
 once painted with that 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.920
 I think it's a really beautiful element 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.990
 in this room 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.290
 I deliberately chose the material 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.270
 for wood and wool cotton so the 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.979
 natural materials also very much 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.030
 uses the vtwonen 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.560
 house collection 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.830
 it just fits very, very, very nicely 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.380
 basic it is in many houses 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.220
 and so here in the me it is too 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.600
 see and feel 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.600
 yes experience it 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.700
 huge difference and it was really dark and 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.230
 well difficult to proof hates the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.220
 sunglasses but fortunately this is not 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.530
 by that the weight is even 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.000
 divided but it really is really one 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.950
 complete change occurs in the closet 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.590
 also very good in the room 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.090
 well it has really become a picture 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.560
 we have a lot more sense of space 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.310
 got it whole daylight 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.140
 come in 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.360
 We are also going to open all 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.020
 natural ventilation can put it in the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.570
 summer too 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.850
 snap rinsing and helping in that way 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.960
 made pleasant living space 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.100
 next to natural light 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.840
 ventilation you can ease of operation 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.200
 suspected this tablet is very upset 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.000
 operate 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.040
 both the name and the window decoration and 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.040
 that acne and it is nice to wear because 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.739
 the skylight there are also equipped with 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.599
 rain sensors 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.920
 as soon as that water will detect the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.959
 close windows automatically 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.099
 so marjanneke doesn't have to be scared 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.019
 for flooding 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.030
 it is also possible to use the 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.099
 outside the veluws active climate 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.180
 control system 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.769
 this is an automated 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.450
 operating system involving the blinds 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.079
 is automatically controlled by 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.519
 sensors 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.989
 when the sun's rays and 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.329
 outside temperature a certain height 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.069
 the sun blinds will reach automatically 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.170
 going down this causes that 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.269
 the inside temperature remains optimal 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.620
 it also reduces energy costs 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.940
 because you have less to cool through 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.450
 for example an air conditioning too 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.340
 use 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.319
 research shows that this energy 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.920
 saving can run up to 7 and a half 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.290
 per cent 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.290
 look for more information on much iex.nl 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.769
 and 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.280
 we are super happy with it is really it 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.510
 surpasses all our dreams 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.250
 yes it is huge it is a world of 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.770
 difference so a very light space 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.180
 Be there is just like there is a floor 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.840
 skims the top of the house 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.270
 really very beautiful and very light and fresh 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.970
 so it's a great bedroom 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.050
 nice fresh air and daylight and yes 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.530
 everything is just completely right yet 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.970
 Drink plenty of storage can get and 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.080
 yes so that it can be about your stuff 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.209
 being able to lose 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.870
 if machines are perfectly concealed then 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.340
 they can still build here and yet 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.390
 remain a large space 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.100
 to hold 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.320
 so that is really beautiful while very 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.290
 special that the real becomes exactly that way 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.730
 if we had a one figured it out 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.220
 i in your head like that i want it 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.310
 and that it can then come so close 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.010
 I think it is very special and very beautiful 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.340
 they remain old beams incorporated therein 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:35.770
 so it remains very nice contrast 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:38.290
 with the white super it's a pair you have 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.970
 Well slept two nights so the stood 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.669
 him i find some one in bed 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.770
 The first day was once more their role they 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.930
 windows were beautifully open 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.180
 all flashes come beautiful see super beautiful 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.669
 skies and took pictures 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.050
 it really is an experience to be here 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.870
 to sleep 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.210
 I think 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.210
 a very successful one with pictures though 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:15.430
 no longer suspect that mark and 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.309
 janneke one and a half month ago 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.990
 had unused dark mess 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:22.240
 thanks to the large amount of daylight and 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.860
 ventilation now to suck now perfect service 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.210
 as a bedroom 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.460
 the space is fully equipped 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.259
 and is also sustainable through the smart 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.699
 energy benefits that the velux skylights 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.050
 offer 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.639
 An additional advantage of such a the 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.069
 renovation is the value of their home 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.839
 as a rule of thumb you can continue 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.939
 that the area of ​​an unused 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.809
 30% in the attic 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:43.659
 the total 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:45.279
 and and for 100% we used this 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.869
 renovation has of course really been unpacked 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:48.550
 but also with the placement of the 

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:51.490
 Example 2 skylights can already be a nice one 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.930
 create light and fresh living space 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.979
 you will see such an investment 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.979
 in the value of your home 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.610
 and with this we have come to the end 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.229
 of this series you want to see videos again 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.399
