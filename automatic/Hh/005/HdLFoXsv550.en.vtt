okay this is spray-paint art secrets and

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.789 
okay this is spray-paint art secrets and
today<00:00:02.580> we're<00:00:02.939> gonna<00:00:03.090> paint<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.780> planets<00:00:04.650> in

our<00:00:04.950> solar<00:00:04.980> system<00:00:05.339> not<00:00:05.910> couldn't<00:00:06.210> fit<00:00:06.330> them

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
our solar system not couldn't fit them

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.660 
our solar system not couldn't fit them
all<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.680> paper<00:00:07.919> but<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.280> got<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> whole

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.680 
can see I'm filling it with yellow paint
and<00:00:17.100> then<00:00:17.369> I'm<00:00:17.490> gonna<00:00:17.580> put<00:00:17.789> some<00:00:17.940> orange<00:00:18.180> and

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.170 
some red and then I want my son to have
a<00:00:22.859> little<00:00:23.100> bit<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.220> texture<00:00:23.609> because<00:00:24.029> it's

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
a little bit of texture because it's

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.640 
a little bit of texture because it's
like<00:00:24.300> sunspots<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.050> use<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> little<00:00:25.439> bit<00:00:25.560> of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
like sunspots so I use a little bit of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.950 
like sunspots so I use a little bit of
newspaper<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:27.060> give<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.420> texture<00:00:27.840> I

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
newspaper to give it that texture I

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.599 
newspaper to give it that texture I
crumpled<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.710> right<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> put<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.519> on

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
crumpled it up and right I put it on

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.669 
crumpled it up and right I put it on
that<00:00:29.849> paint<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.420> get<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.689> effect<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
that paint and I get that effect and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.510 
that paint and I get that effect and
then<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.859> make<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.309> little<00:00:32.340> bit

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
then I make it just a little bit

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.850 
then I make it just a little bit
brighter<00:00:32.820> by<00:00:33.030> adding<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> little<00:00:33.510> yellow<00:00:33.860> okay

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
brighter by adding a little yellow okay

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.110 
brighter by adding a little yellow okay
so<00:00:34.920> now<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.219> want<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.460> make<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> really

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
so now I want to make a really

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.090 
so now I want to make a really
cool-looking<00:00:36.510> Venus<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.710> I'm<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.950> do

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
cool-looking Venus and I'm going to do

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.220 
cool-looking Venus and I'm going to do
that<00:00:38.309> by<00:00:38.460> putting<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.790> bunch<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.230> underpainting

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
colors that I see in the pictures of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.190 
colors that I see in the pictures of
Venus<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> greens<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.180> yellows<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.140> the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
shape the top with a little bit of light

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.199 
shape the top with a little bit of light
so<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.649> planet<00:01:40.009> has<00:01:40.549> a<00:01:40.580> dark<00:01:40.909> side<00:01:41.149> and

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
so that the planet has a dark side and

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:43.510 
so that the planet has a dark side and
the<00:01:41.479> light<00:01:41.569> side<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.409> it's<00:01:43.159> gonna<00:01:43.310> be<00:01:43.490> a

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
the light side and it's gonna be a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.660 
the light side and it's gonna be a
beautiful<00:01:43.759> planet<00:01:44.299> once<00:01:44.659> we<00:01:44.810> put<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:46.100> sky<00:01:46.429> all

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
beautiful planet once we put the sky all

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.449 
beautiful planet once we put the sky all
around<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.149> you'll<00:01:47.270> see<00:01:47.539> in<00:01:47.690> just<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.990> moment

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
around it you'll see in just a moment

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.740 
around it you'll see in just a moment
I'm<00:01:49.459> gonna<00:01:49.549> make<00:01:49.759> some<00:01:49.909> of<00:01:49.940> my<00:01:50.000> other<00:01:50.209> planets

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
I'm gonna make some of my other planets

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.020 
I'm gonna make some of my other planets
I'm<00:01:51.259> not<00:01:51.409> making<00:01:51.709> them<00:01:51.860> exactly<00:01:52.250> as<00:01:52.520> they<00:01:52.789> look

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
I'm not making them exactly as they look

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.300 
I'm not making them exactly as they look
because<00:01:56.259> they<00:01:57.259> look<00:01:57.440> kind<00:01:57.770> of<00:01:57.830> far<00:01:58.039> away<00:01:58.130> so

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
because they look kind of far away so

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.800 
because they look kind of far away so
you<00:01:58.610> can't<00:01:58.970> really<00:01:59.090> tell<00:01:59.179> a<00:01:59.420> lot<00:01:59.569> of<00:01:59.630> times

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
you can't really tell a lot of times

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.960 
you can't really tell a lot of times
without<00:01:59.990> some<00:02:00.289> red<00:02:00.470> one<00:02:00.679> and<00:02:01.310> that's<00:02:01.670> gonna<00:02:01.819> be

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
without some red one and that's gonna be

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.580 
without some red one and that's gonna be
my<00:02:02.119> Saturn<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:02.750> notice<00:02:02.959> that<00:02:03.080> it's<00:02:03.319> kind<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.470> a

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
my Saturn I notice that it's kind of a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.199 
my Saturn I notice that it's kind of a
dull<00:02:03.799> planet<00:02:04.220> so<00:02:04.369> I<00:02:04.429> made<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.700> kind<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:04.909> adult

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
dull planet so I made it kind of adult

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.779 
dull planet so I made it kind of adult
color<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:06.289> again<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.649> put<00:02:06.830> this<00:02:07.009> color<00:02:07.549> on

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
color and again you put this color on

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.460 
color and again you put this color on
and<00:02:08.060> then<00:02:08.149> you<00:02:08.239> put<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.390> little<00:02:08.569> shadow<00:02:08.840> on<00:02:09.229> and

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
and then you put a little shadow on and

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.630 
and then you put a little shadow on and
perhaps<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.860> little<00:02:09.950> light

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.890 

and<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.760> when<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.940> put<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.150> little<00:02:18.330> light<00:02:18.600> color

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
and that when I put a little light color

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.670 
and that when I put a little light color
underneath<00:02:19.260> from<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.770> bar<00:02:20.040> color<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.550> top<00:02:21.680> and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
underneath from the bar color on top and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.309 
underneath from the bar color on top and
I<00:02:22.920> use<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.130> newspaper<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:24.510> play<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.810> pattern<00:02:25.170> on

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
I use a newspaper to play the pattern on

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.690 
I use a newspaper to play the pattern on
it<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.620> then<00:02:25.800> I'm<00:02:25.950> shadowing<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.550> with<00:02:26.640> a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
it and then I'm shadowing it with a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.449 
it and then I'm shadowing it with a
little<00:02:26.910> bit<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.090> metallic<00:02:27.390> color<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:32.190> I'm<00:02:32.250> just

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
little bit of metallic color so I'm just

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.120 
little bit of metallic color so I'm just
wrapping<00:02:32.640> up<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> rest<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.360> my<00:02:33.480> planets<00:02:33.900> now

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
wrapping up the rest of my planets now

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.559 
wrapping up the rest of my planets now
making<00:02:35.130> each<00:02:35.400> one<00:02:35.610> will<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.850> bit<00:02:36.030> different<00:02:36.450> a

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
making each one will a bit different a

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.630 
making each one will a bit different a
little<00:02:36.600> interesting<00:02:37.290> using<00:02:38.100> different

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
little interesting using different

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.330 
little interesting using different
combinations<00:02:38.819> of<00:02:39.330> colors<00:02:40.130> sometimes<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.220> use

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
combinations of colors sometimes I use

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.920 
combinations of colors sometimes I use
newspapers<00:02:41.880> sometimes<00:02:42.300> they<00:02:42.540> use<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.810> little

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
newspapers sometimes they use a little

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.900 
newspapers sometimes they use a little
bit<00:02:43.170> poster<00:02:43.890> board<00:02:44.100> which<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.580> different

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
bit poster board which is a different

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.699 
bit poster board which is a different
kind<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.120> effect<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:46.110> sometimes<00:02:46.290> they<00:02:46.590> use

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
kind of effect and sometimes they use

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.759 
kind of effect and sometimes they use
the<00:02:46.860> foam<00:02:47.989> I'm<00:02:48.989> getting<00:02:49.290> all<00:02:49.410> kinds<00:02:49.440> of

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
the foam I'm getting all kinds of

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.400 
the foam I'm getting all kinds of
different<00:02:50.660> different<00:02:51.660> kinds<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.019> blender

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
different different kinds of blender

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:19.370 
different different kinds of blender
that<00:02:52.620> way

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.340

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
okay so now we're about ready to put the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.860 
okay so now we're about ready to put the
sky<00:03:23.620> on<00:03:23.800> now<00:03:24.730> our<00:03:24.880> planets<00:03:25.300> are<00:03:25.420> down<00:03:25.570> so<00:03:25.750> we're

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
sky on now our planets are down so we're

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.440 
sky on now our planets are down so we're
gonna<00:03:25.930> cover<00:03:26.260> them<00:03:26.440> up<00:03:26.590> with<00:03:27.190> some<00:03:27.340> plates<00:03:27.580> and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
gonna cover them up with some plates and

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.940 
gonna cover them up with some plates and
then<00:03:28.630> I'm<00:03:28.690> going<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:28.840> put<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.080> sky<00:03:29.320> around

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
then I'm going to put the sky around

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.700 
then I'm going to put the sky around
them<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.900> plates<00:03:32.110> are<00:03:32.230> going<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.410> protect

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
them and the plates are going to protect

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.280 
them and the plates are going to protect
them<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.700> those<00:03:33.850> those<00:03:34.330> pretty<00:03:34.930> effects

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
them so that those those pretty effects

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.220 
them so that those those pretty effects
that<00:03:35.470> we<00:03:35.620> made<00:03:36.210> are<00:03:37.210> safe<00:03:37.600> underneath<00:03:38.050> those

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
that we made are safe underneath those

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.000 
that we made are safe underneath those
plates<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.910> anybody<00:03:40.660> can<00:03:40.930> do<00:03:41.080> this<00:03:41.230> we<00:03:41.980> just

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
plates and anybody can do this we just

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.680 
plates and anybody can do this we just
gotta<00:03:42.370> try<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:42.880> can<00:03:42.910> make<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.180> gorgeous

gotta try it you can make a gorgeous

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.710 
gotta try it you can make a gorgeous
solar<00:03:44.080> system<00:03:44.590> for<00:03:45.400> just<00:03:45.520> these<00:03:45.730> simple

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
solar system for just these simple

00:03:46.720 --> 00:04:12.420 
solar system for just these simple
materials

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.369 

it's<00:04:12.970> now<00:04:13.090> putting<00:04:13.330> my<00:04:13.480> sky<00:04:13.810> on<00:04:13.989> I'm<00:04:14.200> just

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
I'm gonna put some galaxies and some

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.070 
I'm gonna put some galaxies and some
lights<00:04:42.520> in<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.790> sky<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.389> start<00:04:43.750> with<00:04:43.840> white

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.529 
light in my sky and then I'm gonna put
some<00:04:56.470> stars<00:04:56.889> on<00:04:57.130> by<00:04:57.550> putting<00:04:58.090> some<00:04:58.360> white

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
and I'm in the painting it's that easy

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.850 
and I'm in the painting it's that easy
you<00:05:02.979> can<00:05:03.100> make<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.250> whole<00:05:03.570> solar<00:05:04.570> system<00:05:04.860> I'm

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
you can make a whole solar system I'm

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.770 
you can make a whole solar system I'm
gonna<00:05:06.010> take<00:05:06.370> our<00:05:06.520> plates<00:05:06.760> off<00:05:06.940> and<00:05:07.240> look<00:05:07.660> at

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
gonna take our plates off and look at

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.310 
gonna take our plates off and look at
that<00:05:07.930> there's<00:05:08.410> Venus<00:05:10.110> there's<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.289> earth

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
that there's Venus there's the earth

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:31.850 
that there's Venus there's the earth
you<00:05:13.920> can<00:05:14.070> do<00:05:14.160> it<00:05:14.310> too

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.140 

so<00:05:32.860> one<00:05:33.010> cool<00:05:33.190> thing<00:05:33.460> that<00:05:33.490> you<00:05:33.640> can<00:05:33.730> do<00:05:33.970> is<00:05:34.060> you

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
so one cool thing that you can do is you

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.700 
so one cool thing that you can do is you
could<00:05:34.270> put<00:05:34.300> rings<00:05:34.570> around<00:05:34.960> planets<00:05:35.380> with<00:05:35.560> just

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
could put rings around planets with just

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.790 
could put rings around planets with just
a<00:05:36.100> hard<00:05:36.910> piece<00:05:37.210> of<00:05:37.390> poster<00:05:37.630> blur<00:05:38.020> which<00:05:38.650> is

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
a hard piece of poster blur which is

00:05:38.800 --> 00:06:03.690 
a hard piece of poster blur which is
drawn<00:05:39.100> basically

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.120 

and<00:06:04.240> then<00:06:04.390> if<00:06:04.480> you<00:06:04.600> want<00:06:04.750> some<00:06:04.990> stars<00:06:05.830> and

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
and then if you want some stars and

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.790 
and then if you want some stars and
galaxies<00:06:06.820> some<00:06:07.810> you<00:06:08.440> know<00:06:08.530> brighter

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
galaxies some you know brighter

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.320 
galaxies some you know brighter
sometimes<00:06:09.220> there's<00:06:09.400> brighter<00:06:09.640> stars<00:06:10.000> and

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
sometimes there's brighter stars and

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.090 
sometimes there's brighter stars and
darker<00:06:10.600> stars<00:06:10.900> you<00:06:11.440> poke<00:06:11.620> a<00:06:11.650> little<00:06:11.770> bit<00:06:12.070> a

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
darker stars you poke a little bit a

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.860 
darker stars you poke a little bit a
hole<00:06:12.310> in<00:06:12.550> a<00:06:12.730> poster<00:06:13.090> board<00:06:13.240> and<00:06:13.510> then<00:06:13.690> you<00:06:13.750> can

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
hole in a poster board and then you can

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.950 
hole in a poster board and then you can
spray<00:06:14.170> through<00:06:14.530> that<00:06:15.210> with<00:06:16.210> some<00:06:16.420> white<00:06:16.630> or

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
spray through that with some white or

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.420 
spray through that with some white or
sweater<00:06:17.260> the<00:06:17.440> color<00:06:17.650> you<00:06:17.860> want<00:06:18.040> to<00:06:18.070> use<00:06:18.220> and

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
you can make little stars little

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.280 
you can make little stars little
highlights<00:06:20.200> in<00:06:20.470> your<00:06:20.500> painting<00:06:21.990> and<00:06:22.990> it<00:06:23.110> makes

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
highlights in your painting and it makes

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:29.400 
highlights in your painting and it makes
a<00:06:23.410> big<00:06:23.560> difference<00:06:27.660> make<00:06:28.660> sure<00:06:28.840> you<00:06:28.990> have

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
a big difference make sure you have

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.920 
a big difference make sure you have
different<00:06:30.010> size<00:06:30.190> stars<00:06:31.110> and<00:06:32.110> there<00:06:32.260> we<00:06:32.350> are

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
different size stars and there we are

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.040 
different size stars and there we are
part<00:06:34.930> of<00:06:35.020> our<00:06:35.140> solar<00:06:35.410> system<00:06:36.660> you<00:06:37.660> can<00:06:37.840> do<00:06:37.930> it

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
part of our solar system you can do it

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.250 
part of our solar system you can do it
too<00:06:39.150> so<00:06:40.150> come<00:06:40.360> check<00:06:40.390> out<00:06:40.660> spray-paint<00:06:41.140> out
