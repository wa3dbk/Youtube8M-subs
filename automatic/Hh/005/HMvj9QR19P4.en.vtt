 Hi, I'm Michael Hampden, design chief of the Assassin's Creed Rogue game. Earn money 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.820
 and gathering resources is essential in Rogue. In this video I'm going to offer you some clues 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.150
 and a few tricks that will facilitate your life as a Templar. 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.669
 As soon as you arrive in New York you will notice that it has fallen into the hands of 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:28.099
 of the Assassins, who rely on organized gangs to control it. In every district of New York you will find 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.390
 the headquarters of a band. By destroying these barracks you can strengthen your control of the city. 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.050
 You can also help build the city with Renovations, which will cost you money and resources such 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.250
 like wood, cloth, metal or stone, but in the long run they are worth it. Both 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.930
 activities will report regular income. 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.580
 Try to explore the entire city to discover all these activities. 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.120
 Do not forget to return every few hours to your barracks or to your captain's cabin 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.239
 in the Morrigan in order to receive this well-deserved income. 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.579
 To advance in the game, you will have to access new zones and face harder enemies. 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:14.429
 You must also improve the Morrigan. Acopia resources such as metal, wood and fabric for 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:19.880
 get upgrades of weapons and armor, and also to improve your harpooning skills 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.590
 and storage. 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.060
 Metal and wood are basic for naval improvements. Boarding brigantines, frigates and convoys 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.130
 integers to collect more resources. You can send defeated ships to Shay's fleet to 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.829
 Grow in power and wealth, and get more improvements for the Morrigan. 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.079
 A more powerful and better equipped ship is the key to triumph in legendary combats, 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.009
 the greatest naval battles that have ever been seen in Assassin's Creed. 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.920
 Also, in some of the forts scattered throughout River Valley and the North Atlantic there are 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.659
 barracks of bands that can be destroyed, and also occasions for renovations. 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.439
 Thanks to them you can generate more regular income. 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.170
 I love how that sounds.
