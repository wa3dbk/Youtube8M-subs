00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.600
 elements from the rhythm to the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.940

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.670
 moment ready for the meeting 26 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.700
 of pavement 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.700

 install the law drivers and l5 in 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.480
 mediafire I leave the drivers system 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.030
 backup and the root the and l5 the second step 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.980
 is to go to our and l5 we look at 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.079
 adjustments then we choose the option 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.360
 developer options and then 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.400
 we choose the debug option of usb 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.280
 will be unmarked we mark it and we 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.470
 a message will come out and we give it in in ok the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.199
 third step is to pass the system backup to 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.689
 our in and l5 well until now we're going 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.970

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:04.339
 q we search for and install it 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.130
 then we open it by the way do these 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.350
 steps just like I say ok do not go 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.200
 to shit because he suffers he can receive 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.409
 some damages I am not responsible for what 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.930
 that go wrong ok but it does not happen to restart 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.240
 what anyway in the next psycho 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.759
 tutorial I will upload a video of how 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.009
 restart it by factory default and 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.530
 how to unlock it without needing the 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.670
 password then we open the system 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.530
 backup and we will leave 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.930
 a message that is in English but 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.759
 means hello xd world we keep 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.979
 pressed the button above the sel 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.320
 to turn off we will leave a menu with three 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.820
 options we choose the one of cádiz and to extinguish 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.979
 and restart and we accept 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.930
 by the way do this step with your being 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.039
 connected to the computer as if 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.039
 were going to pass files 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.450
 i 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.390
 ah 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.560
 Y 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.299
 we wait until it restarts and 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.299
 we disconnected the day of 5 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.220
 and then we reconnect on day 5 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.680
 and when the usb menu comes out we give it 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.810
 to the option of just loading and we wait for 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.709
 that says slow loading and we continue with 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.709
 the fifth step 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.530
 and 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.370
 well the fifth step is to open the folder 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.560
 of the router and to the 5 and there is a 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.960
 file that says ruth we give double 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.910
 click on the raw file and do not close anything 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.920
 computer does everything else is us 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.230
 a black window will appear 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.180
 symbol of systems do not lose that 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.610
 it means that the root is installed in 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.320
 our cell xd after finishing 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.870
 this process the last word of 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.970
 system symbols you should tell him voice and 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.580
 if so they chingaron and xd and is 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.500

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.390
 they just do not expand this is natural 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.210
