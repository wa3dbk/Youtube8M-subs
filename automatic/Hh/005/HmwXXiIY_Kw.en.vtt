00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.940
Hi everyone, its Aunt fernita.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.510
today's story is called "payday at the vineyard"

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.770
The memory verse is from Acts chapter 10 verse 34

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.710
it says, "God does not show favoritism "

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.020
Today's message is God wants us to treat others as He treats us

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:44.400
John was busy raking leaves in his yard after an hour,
 his friend Sam came by and offered to help

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.680
John found another rake and the two boys worked together

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.710
2 hours later, they were done with the job

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.710
John's father was very pleased

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.880
He gave each boy some money to say thank you

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.910
John and Sam received the same pay

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.340
even though John had worked 1 hour more

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.340
 John thought to himself "This is not fair!"

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.370
Then he remembered a story Jesus told about Fairness

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.800
The kingdom of heaven is like a land owner

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.340
Who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.570
In Jesus's time men would gather in the marketplace at  6 o'clock in the morning

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.650
there they would wait for someone to come and hire them

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.280
One morning a vineyard owner came looking for workers

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.420
At 6 o'clock he hired some men

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.850
He agreed to pay them the usual pay for 12 hours of work

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.000
at 9 o'clock he came back to the marketplace

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.170
he saw men still standing around

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.940
"Go work in my vineyard and i'll pay you what is right"he told them

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.970
At noon and at 3  o'clock he hired more men

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:14.570
again at 5 o'clock in the afternoon just one hour before quitting time he did the same thing

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.880
at six o'clock in the evening the land owner told his foremen to pay the workers

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.250
he should begin with the those who were hired last

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.540
and end with those who were hired first

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.280
first the foremen payed those who had only worked for an hour

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.850
he gave them a full days' pay

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.400
then he pay those who worked for 3 hours

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400
he gave them a full days' pay too

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.400
Those who were hired first began to smile

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.170
They were sure they would receive more

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.250
After all, they had worked longer and harder than the others

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.080
it would only be fair wouldn't it?

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.050
but when they received their pay

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.850
their smiles turned to frowns

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.450
They got the same pay as everyone else

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.680
"Wait! " they complained

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.540
"Those men only worked an hour"

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.250
"You made them equal to us"

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.450
"we did most of the work and in the heat of the day too"

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.800
"I'm not being unfair to you" said the land owner

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.680
"You agreed to work for the usual pay for a day's work, that's what i''m paying you"

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.600
 "i can do what i want with my money, don't be jealous because I'm generous"

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:43.770
Then Jesus said it again, "the last will be first and the first will be last"

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.940
Do you like that story? do you think its fair?

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.710
You may not and that's the point Jesus is making

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.000
God does not treat us the way we deserve

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.850
God treats us much much better than that

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.940
It is grace that saves all of us

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.110
those who accept him at the last minute and those who accept him early

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.850
God doesn't have to save any of us, he does it because he loves us

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.340
Do you treat others in God's family the same way God has treated you?

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.800
when someone is mean to you, do you treat them with love and kindness?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.170
Try to treat others as God treats us

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.800
in that way, you show at God is much much better than simply fair
