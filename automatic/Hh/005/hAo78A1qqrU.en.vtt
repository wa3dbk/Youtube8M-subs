00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.529
 so people welcome to probably 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.899
 main video here on a channel 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.340
 And that's about whether I have one 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.630
 make new channel or not in the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.080
 background you see a war or 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.599
 games gameplay on old metal it plays 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.760
 actually quite good at the end rotors 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.949
 hacker called and so on to 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.779
 it 's about making me a new one 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.869
 It's like that, I want to 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.920
 I like to make a new channel and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.330
 Nevertheless, I would like to have a few 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.920
 opinions are heard from you and I would 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.870
 like to hear reasons why I do not have one 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.670
 should make new channel and why me 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.350
 I want to make a new channel 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.570
 tell me my reasons why I 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.420
 would love to do a channel 9 channel 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.270
 and that is simply because main 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.739
 channel of now almost yes 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.480
 yes, I cover nearly 6,500 subscribers 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.239
 I started and have only hsg 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.460
 brought and no idea I guess 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.750
 that's how my channel got bigger 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.420
 that's how many people have me 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.449
 subscribed I was also reasonably good to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.850
 because we played each other but yes 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.939
 it is not hot anymore 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.790
 more and more players and so on and so on 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.710
 that's why the problem is for me 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.020
 easy to record and play on 5 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.490
 not really but to play 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.549
 sometimes it's not like recording 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.869
 the best because of the whole hacking because 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.360
 the whole team and I guess 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.860
 therefore also loses on many 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.430
 players are average 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.259
 now just 6000 people online or 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.920
 Just look how many moments are online 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.430
 yes it is half past three and there are 39 times 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.610
 3000 people and task are almost 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.729
 10,000 and yes, I guess that just 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.350
 come the server will be on the me 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.299
 to play most of the time 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.619
 and that's why I wanted to 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.170
 make a new channel that will be there 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.400
 stop the series as top 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.850
 clubs of the week 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.230
 and mcc or definitely killstreak 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.940
 I hear myself safe but I still have 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.540
 another format which I like to bring 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.020
 would 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.380
 that's more of a bit more serious 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.270
 address topics and stuff and yes, yes 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.580
 I would like to hear your opinion 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.950
 because i dont want to be inactive 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.780
 subscribers 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.370
 yes this is just a pity that me 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.190
 I got in active subscribers 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.370
 It is my own fault that I am 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.840
 I'm aware of it, but I do 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.459
 I would like to have a new channel 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.110
 if you have any 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.430
 counter argument then write me the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.810
 just below in the comments 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.140
 but it should be really good 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.209
 be counter arguments and not none 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.160
 I do not know anyway 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.690
 new channel you have 6000 subscribers 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.520
 I do not care about the subscribers 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.270
 She's just me for that 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.680
 to have fun and to remember so fun 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.740
 I have so synonymous but rather too 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.870
 note that I number my subscribers 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.910
 get a good feedback accordingly 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.230
 and get good feedback and that 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.450
 is unfortunately no longer up 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.720
 given my channel here too 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.090
 I must say sorry, but still 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.550
 that's the way it is and I know I am 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.769
 half guilty and yes I would 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.290
 say then write me your opinion in 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.940
 the comments 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.300
 what you think about what you tell me 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.560
 would like and so on and then if 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.610
 I decided to be an even 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.709
 video com 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.390
 if I make then new channel or if 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.220
 not then it becomes quite normal 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.050
 go on with the series so how 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.690
 The series is said to be on the canal 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.970
 pot clips of the week in any case 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.130
 continued m cod in any case, too 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.050
 continued and another series 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.790
 that also determines quite interesting 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.510
 could be continued 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.709
 and yes, I would say that unfortunately 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.540
 ratings are for this video 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.780
 I only want comments 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.610
 see from you and so if you 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.380
 really no idea the future my 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.030
 say the channel of my youtube be there 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.530
 we are at heart then write me 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.720
 just something below the comments 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.330
 what you think your opinion is and 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.860
 I would say yes, then we'll see each other 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.960
 the next time either on this 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.480
 channel or on my new channel 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.130
 and I would say that next time 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.130
 until then potro
