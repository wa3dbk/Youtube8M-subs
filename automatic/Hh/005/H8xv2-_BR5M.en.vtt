you could wear it with a belt and that

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.210 
you could wear it with a belt and that
would<00:04:05.930> bench<00:04:06.170> in<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.500> waist<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:06.890> make<00:04:07.070> it

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
would bench in the waist and make it

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.190

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.840 
like the place that I'm wearing at the
moment<00:04:29.690> so<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.710> top<00:04:30.890> just<00:04:31.130> has<00:04:31.280> like<00:04:31.550> this

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
moment so the top just has like this

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.150 
moment so the top just has like this
white<00:04:32.210> little<00:04:32.540> detailing<00:04:33.020> then<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.770> cinches

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
white little detailing then it cinches

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.190 
white little detailing then it cinches
in<00:04:34.280> at<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.490> waist<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:35.210> little<00:04:35.660> bit<00:04:35.840> hotter<00:04:36.020> than

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
in at the waist a little bit hotter than

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.220 
in at the waist a little bit hotter than
the<00:04:36.320> waist<00:04:36.470> actually<00:04:37.040> goes<00:04:37.669> all<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.180> way<00:04:38.570> down

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
the waist actually goes all the way down

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.560 
the waist actually goes all the way down
to<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.560> ground<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:40.340> lay<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:40.970> like<00:04:41.180> this

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.690 
to the ground and lay it like this
detailing<00:04:42.350> like<00:04:42.530> I<00:04:42.770> think<00:04:43.100> this<00:04:43.280> is<00:04:43.490> just

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700
