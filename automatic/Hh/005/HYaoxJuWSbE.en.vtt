00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.300
 the bomb was a monster with you here 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.620
 how to adjust the 911 among more 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.009
 called the back image 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.169
 the four-channel body that has four 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:17.220
 buttons to make this adjustment 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:20.550
 then theoretically speaking and if this 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.160
 button today is the tail command and 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.009
 makes the command agent forward and 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.519
 back and make left adjustment 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.419
 right and this little team acceleration 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.880
 used 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.140
 Good, the command of Carlos gives it to you. 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.120
 make this adjustment 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.820
 the helicopter on the ground showing 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.560
 you here for now standing on the floor 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:51.270
 coming back in front of you gives you a 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:58.010
 slight acceleration on the ground bleeding can 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:00.720
 have this button to the left it has stopped 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:07.020
 I almost always feel a clock at 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.850
 tail now helicopter regulation 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.930
 forward and backward 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.300
 left and right they are only done 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.740
 100% a year so you need a little 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.480
 of practice was this 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.470
 Unfortunately I can not show it to you. 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.840
 I'm filming you and running to 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.270
 same time but I'll explain part 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.520
 theory that if you takes flight with 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.729
 eurocopter helicopters make a move 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.130
 alone ahead you will see in that 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.570
 button on this button and it will 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.229
 to the helicopter to do this 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.729
 move forward if you go back and 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.400
 will you let it go until it stops 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.409
 patras is always the post if you have one 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.290
 helicopter is making a move 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.010
 to the right or to stand alone 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.380
 flight 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.720
 You will see this button underneath the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.670
 lever on the right side for those who have 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.490
 moto two advisers do I think 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.770
 You'll see this button and go. 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.210
 start to put the country that Ana is what he 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.930
 stop making a move to the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.539
 right 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.970
 if he starts to do right for you 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.090
 go to the left 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.040
 he stands upright is always the opposite 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.650
 movement of the helicopter is 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.260
 doing good because the owner can 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.780
 post a comment what I know I will 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.410
 I'm helping you, I hope I've helped 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.410
 the little van
