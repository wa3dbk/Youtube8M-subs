00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.910
 well let's hear the tuca talk about 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.390
 arbitration arbitration with regard to the 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.390
 America 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.110
 and the best story not now and 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.860
 shrieking with courage 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.590
 A) Yes 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.029
 because I always ask that arbitration not 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.789
 influences the score and if it influenced how 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.160
 influenced against him and the spot tricot against 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.400
 everyone and not just with the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.600
 referee until you cut the federation with 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.340
 the whole world is if I lost a 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.770
 chain of things is one thing if not 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.579
 you belong is something else 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.420
 in 1985 I was a player 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.870
 to match in final querétaro 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.870
 america cougars 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.739
 an hour and a half before the game was 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.739
 a referee at the time of the match 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.860
 the result 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.560
 and the next day a picture of the 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.890
 newspapers with the america team formed 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.410
 and the other one in the middle I think that if 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.810
 it's the same, why is it because you 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.140
 you have to see what are you 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.140
 facing up 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.570
 you are right 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.600
 flip the candle your partner's shirt 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.710
 of wings 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.610
 I like this blue 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.600
 teach the right breast 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.600
 the heavy 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.600
 is the other the other shirt 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.960
 once yours of the action 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:53.500
 no it is not this is the other logo that 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.500
 competes with this one and that handles with this one 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.480
 good tuca ferretti refers to a case 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.320
 we have the chance to experience it 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.320
 and even if 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.360
 85 the party of me against a little 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.970
 after people are wrong the referee 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.010
 of course but it was more played makes 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.380
 play is played the first game is 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.450
 tied to a goal goes went to 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.730
 second game is tied to zero goals and 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.950
 there is a tragedy in extension is the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.780
 terrible pitiful is played the third 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.960
 party is going to querétaro by decision 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.090
 from someone to querétaro juan they are 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.890
 taking the alignments that are 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.300
 Antonio and remark is that in peace rest 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.460
 as a central referee 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.230
 no doubt there is pointing all 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.129
 we achieve 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.030
 and it came to him that in peace he rested 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.959
 vice president of the faction man 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.739
 important of the federation 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.739
 vice president of america 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.340
 excellent offered from america and after 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.349
 to the dressing habits 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.989
 and a little time later half an hour 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.319
 they say it's not Antonio Marquez is life 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.360
 real 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.030
 the referee referee leaves the referee 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.959
 central and marquez leaves league with the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.060
 another line that was not another one but the 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.360
 match ended 3 goals to 1 the first 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.090
 goal 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.060
 Urrea at 18 minutes scored a hand of 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.040
 pumas goal at 30 minutes there is a hand 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.879
 of tena in the area, the brand does not end 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.470
 grade 31 in america the pumas or cougars was 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.090
 a great soccer team played very well 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.670
 or directed mario velarde time to 6 class 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.489
 he had very good players he was very 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.860
 well it went very well and the American and the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.900
 left-handed Lopez who screamed that day we won 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.700
 by demolition we won by demolition 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.250
 when that microphone promotion is good 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.019
 demolition demolition and good in the 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.420
 match 3-1 but that's how they handle and that's the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.310
 referee an hour and a half before leaving 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.750
 that time like 45 minutes but right now 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.720
 things have not changed 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.130
 that changes 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.410
 because it ends from that of Mary 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.260
 president of the league to guadalajara but 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:00.060
 halfway and to the atlas do not sell to this 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.850
 be careful, but do not sell it to 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.370
 pachuca group because the group did not 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.820
 but direct referee 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.120
 but it happens to him with the respect of 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.070
 Schwager has confessed among his many 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.790
 nonsense that I said it's a mind 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:22.370
 I love it but it 's always people 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.400
 this 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.100
 he also has to understand that in 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.290
 great extent if tigers did not pass 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.240
 responsibility of the Dutchman or the speak 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:37.699
 of that in arbitration you also have to 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:40.690
 remember that many times this mystery 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.690
 this time new york against things 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.690
 ochoa 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:52.250
 surely then surely that yes 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.710
 the truth with all respect touches your 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.490
 trajectory everything can not an end of 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:04.570
 field and we ourselves go 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.570
 practically monterrey no and other things 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:15.050
 strap said with each brand is 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:22.600
 make a mistake 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.600
 now before the world 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:30.740
 it was 86 in 13 thousand 86 thousand 86 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.509
 america cougars that wins cougars with great 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.259
 goal from your mouth the free throw in the 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.259
 first leg 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.979
 previously fortunately he went 84 and 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.509
 5 world tests of america cougars but 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.509
 the goose fact was after his 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.370
 put after 86 that bieber it 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:52.759
 assumes that the World Cup was going to qualify and 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.550
 they were disqualified 90 90 by 31 no 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.930
 you are in this match against cougars 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.330
 in the Aztec stadium 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.039
 there is an expulsion to farfán that ney that 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.259
 missing any pumas player in 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.180
 the totally normal play and this 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.889
 they expelled farfán and they harmed us 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.580
 we and we never go out to give 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.580
 declarations 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:28.460
 of america and the people of america 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.610
 we go back there is no more 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.610
 Hello
