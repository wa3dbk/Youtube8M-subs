00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.509
 Hi everyone! All right, the teacher. 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.870
 andré 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:11.019
 today we will learn how to turn the pins 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.980
 the motherboard is the number of the 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:20.260
 pins where we should turn on power sw 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.210
 sw power led and hd led reserve 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.390
 here I have a motherboard that she 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.310
 makes the connection of the pins much easier 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.810
 beyond colors 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.850
 She has serigraphic writing on the board. 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.510
 informing the number of each pin and what 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.089
 you should call when you are connecting 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.519
 cabinet wires on the motherboard to 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.149
 everything works fine, no computer 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.079
 connect the reset function and mild 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.260
 employee 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.319
 but the scheme here for you to have 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.629
 a better understanding of the image of the 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:58.019
 the front panel and the pins still the plate 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.399
 mother then works as follows 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:04.210
 the motherboards 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.280
 this popular pattern is because 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:12.820
 proprietary architecture was a bit 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:22.330
 on these hp dell computers at last we 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:27.660
 we have four riders on top and 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:31.810
 on the bottom we have five pins 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.880
 on the top four pins on the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.910
 from below 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:50.410
 five pilots the bottom pins are 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:59.230
 all tie in a 3 5 7 and 9 and the tires in the 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:02:02.470
 top are all paris 2 4 6 and 8 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:07.180
 this is 9 opinion we will not use 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:11.650
 so preferably of alpine pium 8 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.420
 the main one is 6 and 8 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.709
 the computer if you pick up a 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.750
 crevice 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.079
 there is a knife-end of a key 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.000
 touch the 6 and 8 computer then 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.739
 it is essential in my opinion the main 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.659
 that makes the computer on 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.340
 We put the numbering on who is 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:31.090
 important from now we'll see 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:37.090
 who is positive and who is negative 1 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:47.590
 he is positive 13 is negative 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:52.659
 o 2 positive and 14 negative 16 positive 8 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.940
 negative 5 is negative and 7 is 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:58.480
 positive 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.629
 are 1 and 3 positive negative 2 and 4 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.500
 positive and negative six and eight positive 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.769
 and negative 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.439
 the exchange it reverses beyond being 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.040
 positive and negative is negative 57 is 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:20.530
 positive because because here it goes on 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:24.790
 the reset here is a reset sw reset sw 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:36.040
 Why is it the key and the six is ​​it? 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:40.720
 eight on power sw power button 1 6 and 8 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:46.150
 reset 157 power is always above the 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:54.729
 reset no e3 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:04:00.879
 let's turn on the hd led and in 2004 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:04:03.519
 We are going to turn on the power led love and the 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.459
 Most motherboards coming 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:11.379
 open architecture computer follows 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:13.780
 this pattern here da dah pinning there where 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:19.750
 connect the wires on the front panel of the 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:23.360
 cabinet we have the motherboard 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.210
 the corner here her lower right has 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:31.360
 the numbers of the writing pins 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:36.469
 serigraphic colors have another motherboard 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:41.629
 Only panel 1 to 1 is not written here. 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:43.370
 has colors have not written that is if 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:48.139
 you do not have a new motherboard you have 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:51.289
 who know this scheme that deep 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.750
 numbering and what to plug into each pin 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.849
 not to be confused if you do not have one 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.779
 manual does not know this scheme anyway you 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.150
 You are confused a screwdriver handle ok 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:04.909
 with the philips screwdriver and goes 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.659
 abutting on two pins with the tip 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:10.159
 slope on two coast pins in these two 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.810
 An hour will come when it will come. 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:15.229
 release two pins the computer will 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.750
 Call you already know where the power sw is. 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.620
 Can you turn the power on and off 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.680
 computer 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:27.080
 there is a reset and the LEDs will not 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:32.349
 function to fix this part better. 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.349
 of the panel what I'm going to do 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.770
 we have a computer here 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:48.750
 here below 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:51.990
 I have the next pins videoaula you 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:55.680
 You can search the next video I go. 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:06:00.210
 explain how to connect here is on the motherboard 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.310
 and the cabinet wires that the motherboard 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.800
 she out of the office and everything easier 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.660
 when she is in the office is the 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.560
 complete computer becomes more 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.980
 complicated 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:14.130
 ok watch the next video continue 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.710
 of this video-lesson if our blog 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.780
 The clinic did not like to help and 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.810
 our work divulge to your 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.240
 facebook friends anyway long ago 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:28.040
 Thank you for your attention. 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.040
 bye bye guys until the next at
