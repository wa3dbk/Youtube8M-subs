00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.360
 m 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.940
 Yes 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.780
 already it was following the invitation of 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.899
 norbert santos and the organizer here 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.969
 is happening is my a proposed Cayman 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.530
 that as usual if I was 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:20.689
 available i replied present that makes 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.770
 for a very long time that I try to make a 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.439
 rib race especially when the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.759
 cemetery or tessier samu and and 6.8 all 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.409
 years but I'm never available 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.450
 and there I said good but it's the opportunity 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.409
 the car is not quite I 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.020
 did not know the road already 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.340
 so this is my first ride I want 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.270
 to say I made three passages tonight I 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.759
 I'll go watch the videos 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.229
 but nan but the car is enough 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.640
 violent for this kind of race but 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.159
 have nevertheless of purpose it is to have fun 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.539
 so until that's perfect 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.179
 already good the hill climb I think that 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.689
 it's a real nice challenge when you're 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.939
 pilot now it's super dangerous 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.239
 that we all know you are not entitled to 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.989
 the mistake and sincerely my employer 

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:57.890
 who is wearing if he is not too 

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:59.299
 okay when I see this kind 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.539
 activity is not excluded that 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.369
 it was limit limit here good it's a 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.310
 demonstration so they know that I do not 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.079
 not going to do anything but I 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.700
 think we're crying rather in fifteen 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.660
 days in retirement a I hope more 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.769
 of ten years like that is that my 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.780
 career was very long but 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.430
 why not try it today 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.389
 in any case it's not do not know it's 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.389
