what<00:00:34.190> do<00:00:34.339> you<00:00:34.430> understand<00:00:35.000> brush<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.809> have<00:00:35.989> a

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
what do you understand brush to have a

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:37.630 
what do you understand brush to have a
lot<00:00:36.230> of<00:00:36.260> brushless<00:00:36.589> or<00:00:36.890> vice-versa

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
lot of brushless or vice-versa

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.240 
lot of brushless or vice-versa
basically<00:00:38.329> brushed<00:00:38.690> tools<00:00:39.199> have<00:00:39.500> small

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
basically brushed tools have small

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.639 
basically brushed tools have small
carbon<00:00:40.460> brushes<00:00:40.790> inside<00:00:41.089> them<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:41.720> over<00:00:42.470> time

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
carbon brushes inside them and over time

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.319 
carbon brushes inside them and over time
they<00:00:42.920> wear<00:00:43.129> out<00:00:43.159> and<00:00:43.489> need<00:00:43.550> to<00:00:43.699> be<00:00:43.820> replaced<00:00:44.089> so

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
they wear out and need to be replaced so

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.509 
they wear out and need to be replaced so
brushless<00:00:44.570> means<00:00:45.470> less<00:00:45.800> lameness

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
brushless means less lameness

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.770 

close<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.579> background<00:01:46.969> one<00:01:47.179> of<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.420> testing

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
close to background one of the testing

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.380 
close to background one of the testing
their<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.229> brush<00:01:48.619> versus<00:01:49.100> brushes<00:01:49.520> impact

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
their the brush versus brushes impact

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.440 
their the brush versus brushes impact
drop<00:01:50.600> test<00:01:50.899> pretty<00:01:51.380> big<00:01:51.560> differences<00:01:52.039> it

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
drop test pretty big differences it

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.029 
drop test pretty big differences it
definitely<00:01:53.450> done<00:01:53.659> here<00:01:54.049> we<00:01:54.170> see<00:01:54.409> the

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
definitely done here we see the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.969 
definitely done here we see the
brushless<00:01:55.780> screwed<00:01:56.780> in<00:01:56.899> 20<00:01:57.319> more<00:01:57.530> baton

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
brushless screwed in 20 more baton

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.490 
brushless screwed in 20 more baton
screws<00:01:58.250> than<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.119> brushed<00:01:59.329> Wow<00:02:00.140> yeah

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
screws than the brushed Wow yeah

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.289 
screws than the brushed Wow yeah
certainly<00:02:01.069> run<00:02:01.250> for<00:02:01.520> quite<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:01.789> bit<00:02:01.850> longer<00:02:01.969> as

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
certainly run for quite a bit longer as

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.719 
certainly run for quite a bit longer as
well<00:02:02.450> definitely<00:02:03.380> much<00:02:03.560> is<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:04.009> big<00:02:04.549> difference

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
well definitely much is a big difference

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.760 
well definitely much is a big difference
between<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.360> two<00:02:05.390> their<00:02:05.719> brushless<00:02:05.990> running

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
between the two their brushless running

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.800 
between the two their brushless running
for<00:02:06.950> longer<00:02:07.219> and<00:02:07.429> doing<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:08.090> lot<00:02:08.450> more<00:02:08.479> work

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
for longer and doing a lot more work

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.320 
for longer and doing a lot more work
like<00:02:09.039> okay<00:02:10.039> well<00:02:10.340> let's<00:02:10.519> get<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.729> round<00:02:11.150> 2<00:02:11.299> of

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
like okay well let's get to round 2 of

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.080 
like okay well let's get to round 2 of
the<00:02:11.420> testing<00:02:11.980> we<00:02:12.980> had<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.129> couple<00:02:13.340> of<00:02:13.549> cordless

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
the testing we had a couple of cordless

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.580 
the testing we had a couple of cordless
drills<00:02:14.450> we've<00:02:14.690> got<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.840> brushless<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.500> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
drills we've got the brushless and the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.729 
drills we've got the brushless and the
brush<00:02:16.030> what<00:02:17.030> are<00:02:17.090> we<00:02:17.180> going<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.720> debut<00:02:17.840> they

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
brush what are we going to debut they

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.640 
brush what are we going to debut they
both<00:02:19.040> got<00:02:19.190> brand<00:02:19.489> new<00:02:19.610> 12<00:02:20.180> mil<00:02:20.360> HSS<00:02:21.079> bits<00:02:21.349> and

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
both got brand new 12 mil HSS bits and

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.259 
both got brand new 12 mil HSS bits and
we're<00:02:21.890> going<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.069> drill<00:02:22.310> straight<00:02:22.730> through

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
we're going to drill straight through

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.559 
we're going to drill straight through
this<00:02:23.900> 63<00:02:24.560> mil<00:02:24.709> LVL<00:02:25.220> now<00:02:26.150> we're<00:02:26.299> going<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.480> run

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
this 63 mil LVL now we're going to run

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.680 
this 63 mil LVL now we're going to run
them<00:02:26.660> at<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.810> same<00:02:26.959> time<00:02:27.019> this<00:02:27.799> time<00:02:28.040> and

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
them at the same time this time and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.910 
them at the same time this time and
we've<00:02:29.690> noticed<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.200> brushless<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.739> lot

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
we've noticed the brushless is a lot

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.890 
we've noticed the brushless is a lot
smaller<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.579> it's<00:02:32.180> actually<00:02:32.450> lighter<00:02:32.720> as

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
smaller and it's actually lighter as

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.309 
smaller and it's actually lighter as
well

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
well

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.750 
well
they'll<00:02:33.769> be<00:02:33.860> interesting<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.310> see<00:02:34.459> if<00:02:34.610> it's

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
they'll be interesting to see if it's

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.610 
they'll be interesting to see if it's
better<00:02:35.360> performance<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.349> we're<00:02:36.440> going<00:02:36.530> to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
better performance so we're going to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.229 
better performance so we're going to
find<00:02:36.799> out<00:02:37.010> which<00:02:37.400> puts<00:02:37.670> in<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.879> more<00:02:38.030> holes

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
find out which puts in the more holes

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:54.729 
find out which puts in the more holes
and<00:02:38.599> which<00:02:38.810> runs<00:02:39.019> for<00:02:39.260> longer

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:03.470 

it<00:02:55.739> did

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.890 

that's<00:03:04.480> it

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
that's it

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.040 
that's it
massive<00:03:05.500> difference<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.220> brushless<00:03:07.050> almost

a<00:03:15.400> big<00:03:15.880> difference<00:03:16.210> in<00:03:16.330> runtime<00:03:16.540> performance

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
a big difference in runtime performance

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.340 
a big difference in runtime performance
and<00:03:18.040> clear<00:03:18.340> winner<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:19.000> brushless<00:03:19.300> over<00:03:20.230> the

brush<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:21.190> on<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.790> Round<00:03:21.970> three

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
brush so on to Round three

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.500 
brush so on to Round three
ok<00:03:23.380> we've<00:03:23.530> got<00:03:23.560> brand<00:03:23.950> new<00:03:24.100> six<00:03:24.700> mill<00:03:24.940> masonry

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
ok we've got brand new six mill masonry

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.840 
ok we've got brand new six mill masonry
bits<00:03:25.720> in<00:03:26.050> each<00:03:26.230> drill<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.770> set<00:03:27.459> them<00:03:27.580> up<00:03:27.670> so

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
bits in each drill and set them up so

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.460 
bits in each drill and set them up so
that<00:03:27.880> we'll<00:03:28.090> be<00:03:28.180> drilling<00:03:28.330> 35<00:03:28.870> mill<00:03:29.140> depth

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
that we'll be drilling 35 mill depth

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.310 
that we'll be drilling 35 mill depth
into<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.310> concrete<00:03:30.610> lintel<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:32.110> should

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
into this concrete lintel and it should

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.810 
into this concrete lintel and it should
put<00:03:32.500> them<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.770> a<00:03:32.800> pretty<00:03:33.340> tough<00:03:33.520> test

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
put them to a pretty tough test

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.510 
put them to a pretty tough test
obviously<00:03:34.540> brushless<00:03:34.930> so<00:03:35.440> far<00:03:35.709> taking<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.310> cake

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
obviously brushless so far taking a cake

00:03:36.520 --> 00:04:03.720 
obviously brushless so far taking a cake
so<00:03:37.120> see<00:03:37.990> if<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.140> trend<00:03:38.380> continues

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.210 

I<00:04:04.110> guess<00:04:05.110> choose<00:04:05.349> to<00:04:05.530> test<00:04:05.739> number<00:04:05.860> three

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
I guess choose to test number three

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.619 
I guess choose to test number three
there<00:04:06.400> with<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.760> hammer<00:04:07.060> drills<00:04:07.330> into<00:04:07.569> the

there with the hammer drills into the
concrete<00:04:08.050> lintel<00:04:08.349> there<00:04:08.830> was<00:04:08.950> some<00:04:09.129> pretty

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
concrete lintel there was some pretty

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.490 
concrete lintel there was some pretty
tough<00:04:09.610> going<00:04:09.819> there<00:04:10.180> again<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.260> brushless

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
tough going there again the brushless

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.710 
tough going there again the brushless

48 to 38 clear winner again and just to
note<00:04:17.889> that<00:04:17.919> we<00:04:18.130> did<00:04:18.310> change<00:04:18.340> change<00:04:19.090> our<00:04:19.239> drill

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
note that we did change change our drill

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.960 
note that we did change change our drill
bits<00:04:19.660> for<00:04:19.989> brand<00:04:20.200> new<00:04:20.440> ones<00:04:20.760> identical<00:04:21.760> drill

that<00:04:24.070> testing<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:25.150> four<00:04:25.900> minutes<00:04:26.200> longer<00:04:26.560> as

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
that testing and four minutes longer as

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.920 
that testing and four minutes longer as
well<00:04:26.860> in<00:04:27.130> run<00:04:27.760> time<00:04:27.790> about<00:04:28.240> 20<00:04:28.540> minutes<00:04:28.780> run

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
well in run time about 20 minutes run

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.200 
well in run time about 20 minutes run
time<00:04:29.139> with<00:04:29.260> this<00:04:29.320> brushless<00:04:30.090> drilling<00:04:31.090> into

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
time with this brushless drilling into

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.430 
time with this brushless drilling into
the<00:04:31.300> concrete<00:04:31.660> lintel<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.080> know<00:04:32.139> it's<00:04:32.290> pretty

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
the concrete lintel I know it's pretty

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.020 
the concrete lintel I know it's pretty
tough<00:04:32.680> going<00:04:32.950> and<00:04:33.280> it's<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.610> pretty<00:04:33.790> impressive

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
tough going and it's a pretty impressive

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.550 
tough going and it's a pretty impressive
performance<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:34.810> think<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:35.110> get<00:04:35.229> that<00:04:35.380> long

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
performance I think to get that long

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.610 
performance I think to get that long
it's<00:04:36.130> great<00:04:36.340> really<00:04:36.610> is<00:04:36.910> it's<00:04:37.389> a<00:04:37.510> another<00:04:38.410> win

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
it's great really is it's a another win

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.860 
it's great really is it's a another win
for<00:04:38.650> brushless<00:04:39.090> okay<00:04:40.090> we'll<00:04:40.389> trade<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.660> tough

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
for brushless okay we'll trade a tough

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.230 
for brushless okay we'll trade a tough
test<00:04:41.020> on<00:04:41.229> before<00:04:41.500> coming<00:04:41.889> right<00:04:42.040> up<00:04:42.190> up<00:04:43.000> till

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
test on before coming right up up till

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.670 
test on before coming right up up till
now<00:04:43.389> I've<00:04:43.540> been<00:04:43.660> running<00:04:43.960> all<00:04:44.050> our<00:04:44.110> trading

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
now I've been running all our trading

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.840 
now I've been running all our trading
tough<00:04:44.860> tests<00:04:45.250> under<00:04:45.430> pretty<00:04:45.580> tough

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
tough tests under pretty tough

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.790 
tough tests under pretty tough
conditions<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:46.570> this<00:04:47.260> time<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.710> difference

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
conditions and this time the difference

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.190 
conditions and this time the difference
is<00:04:48.100> going<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.310> be<00:04:48.460> absolutely<00:04:49.389> no<00:04:49.510> load<00:04:49.900> will

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
is going to be absolutely no load will

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.940 
is going to be absolutely no load will
run<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.650> brushless<00:04:50.919> burst<00:04:51.669> a<00:04:51.850> brush<00:04:52.620> under<00:04:53.620> no

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
run the brushless burst a brush under no

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.170 
run the brushless burst a brush under no
load<00:04:54.160> until<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.610> battery<00:04:54.940> dies

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
load until the battery dies

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.659 
load until the battery dies
I<00:04:55.450> guess<00:04:56.200> what<00:04:56.440> that's<00:04:56.860> going<00:04:57.100> to<00:04:57.220> do<00:04:57.460> is

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
I guess what that's going to do is

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.490 
I guess what that's going to do is
eliminate<00:04:57.880> any<00:04:58.389> variables<00:04:58.450> that<00:04:59.080> might<00:04:59.320> have

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
eliminate any variables that might have

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.920 
eliminate any variables that might have
a<00:04:59.530> consistency<00:05:00.310> of<00:05:00.340> inaudible<00:05:00.790> level<00:05:00.940> exactly

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
a consistency of inaudible level exactly

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.840

the trigger on that attachment brushless

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.900 
the trigger on that attachment brushless
compared<00:06:18.320> to<00:06:18.410> only<00:06:18.500> 42<00:06:19.130> minutes<00:06:19.370> on<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:19.700> brush

model<00:06:20.210> here<00:06:20.390> so<00:06:20.600> clear<00:06:21.170> winner<00:06:21.400> yeah<00:06:22.400> it<00:06:22.580> was

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
model here so clear winner yeah it was

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.090 
model here so clear winner yeah it was
made<00:06:23.000> very<00:06:23.240> clear<00:06:23.510> winner<00:06:23.870> more<00:06:24.590> than<00:06:24.740> half<00:06:24.950> an

made very clear winner more than half an

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.740 
made very clear winner more than half an
hour<00:06:25.190> longer<00:06:25.520> around<00:06:25.610> 4<00:06:25.970> is<00:06:26.060> actually<00:06:26.420> worried

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
hour longer around 4 is actually worried

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.150 
hour longer around 4 is actually worried
that<00:06:26.840> was<00:06:26.960> going<00:06:27.080> to<00:06:27.140> be<00:06:27.320> here<00:06:27.530> tomorrow<00:06:27.650> still

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
that was going to be here tomorrow still

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.980 
that was going to be here tomorrow still
for<00:06:28.370> a<00:06:28.400> while<00:06:28.460> there<00:06:28.760> but<00:06:29.300> no<00:06:29.450> we<00:06:29.600> got<00:06:29.750> there<00:06:29.900> in

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
for a while there but no we got there in

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.080 
for a while there but no we got there in
the<00:06:30.020> end<00:06:30.110> yeah<00:06:30.770> and<00:06:30.950> I<00:06:31.010> guess<00:06:31.160> those<00:06:31.640> results

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
the end yeah and I guess those results

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.970 
the end yeah and I guess those results
replicated<00:06:32.690> across<00:06:33.080> all<00:06:33.350> the<00:06:33.470> four<00:06:33.620> tests

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
replicated across all the four tests

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.100 
replicated across all the four tests
we've<00:06:34.100> done<00:06:34.250> brushless<00:06:34.610> clear<00:06:35.360> winners<00:06:35.690> every

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
we've done brushless clear winners every

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.720 
we've done brushless clear winners every
time<00:06:36.350> so<00:06:36.770> that's<00:06:36.950> where<00:06:37.100> my<00:06:37.280> money<00:06:37.520> would<00:06:37.670> be

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
time so that's where my money would be

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.650 
time so that's where my money would be
going

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660
