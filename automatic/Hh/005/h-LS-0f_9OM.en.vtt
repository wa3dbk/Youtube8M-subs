afterward so you want to you want to
like<00:01:52.250> kind<00:01:52.429> of<00:01:52.490> weave<00:01:52.759> in<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.119> out<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.899> make<00:01:54.050> it

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
like kind of weave in and out to make it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:03.240 
like kind of weave in and out to make it
look<00:01:54.289> like<00:01:54.440> has<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.649> lot<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:54.950> volume

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.120 

you

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.400 

and<00:02:06.219> then<00:02:06.909> once<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:07.299> get<00:02:07.479> kind<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.930> like<00:02:08.110> this

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
and then once you get kind of like this

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.910 
and then once you get kind of like this
you<00:02:09.030> want<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.149> start<00:02:10.390> doing<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.929> bottom<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:11.800> if

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
you want to start doing the bottom so if

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.010 
you want to start doing the bottom so if
I<00:02:12.010> take<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.220> strand<00:02:12.670> like<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.870> I'll<00:02:13.989> just

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
I take a strand like this and I'll just

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.130 
I take a strand like this and I'll just
fold<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.560> up<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.800> tiny<00:02:15.069> bit<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.519> then<00:02:16.019> put<00:02:17.019> it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
fold it up a tiny bit and then put it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.780 
fold it up a tiny bit and then put it
like<00:02:17.349> in<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.709> middle<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.400> doesn't<00:02:18.670> go<00:02:18.760> all

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
like in the middle so it doesn't go all

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.339 
like in the middle so it doesn't go all
to<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.450> top<00:02:19.630> learn<00:02:20.230> from<00:02:20.530> seeing<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:25.349> like

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
to the top learn from seeing it so like

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:35.890 
to the top learn from seeing it so like
that

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:03:09.420 

you

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.789 

so<00:03:10.299> after<00:03:10.569> you're<00:03:10.720> done<00:03:10.870> your<00:03:11.379> hair<00:03:11.530> should

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
so after you're done your hair should

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.270 
so after you're done your hair should
look<00:03:11.860> something<00:03:12.459> like<00:03:12.640> this<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.420> next<00:03:13.689> step

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
look something like this the next step

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.399 
look something like this the next step
is<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.640> finger<00:03:15.970> curl<00:03:16.329> give<00:03:17.079> it<00:03:17.200> some<00:03:17.379> volume

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
is to finger curl give it some volume

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.289 
is to finger curl give it some volume
and<00:03:17.980> start<00:03:18.159> a<00:03:18.189> finger<00:03:18.430> curling<00:03:18.819> first<00:03:19.150> before
