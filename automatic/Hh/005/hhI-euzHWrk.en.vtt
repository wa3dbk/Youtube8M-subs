darker but it really does it stays on
all<00:01:49.079> day<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:50.070> get<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> little<00:01:50.460> bit<00:01:50.610> dark<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.000> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
all day you get a little bit dark on a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.600 
all day you get a little bit dark on a
hand<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.630> wash<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.810> off<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:53.130> doesn't

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
hand but you can wash it off it doesn't

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.590 
hand but you can wash it off it doesn't
I<00:01:53.700> mean<00:01:53.820> I've<00:01:53.939> been<00:01:53.970> caught<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> rainstorm

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
I mean I've been caught in a rainstorm

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.450 
I mean I've been caught in a rainstorm
and<00:01:55.049> I'm<00:01:55.200> not<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.590> having<00:01:55.829> black<00:01:56.100> streaks

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and I'm not like having black streaks

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.649 
and I'm not like having black streaks
run<00:01:56.670> down<00:01:56.820> my<00:01:56.850> face<00:01:56.969> or<00:01:57.299> anything<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.540> that

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
run down my face or anything like that

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.679 
run down my face or anything like that
so<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.110> really<00:01:58.350> doesn't<00:01:58.590> work<00:01:58.770> well<00:01:59.509> and<00:02:00.509> it

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
so it really doesn't work well and it

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.179 
so it really doesn't work well and it
definitely<00:02:00.899> makes<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.560> difference<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.070> how

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
definitely makes a difference in how

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.490 
definitely makes a difference in how
your<00:02:02.310> hair<00:02:02.490> looks<00:02:02.759> as<00:02:03.299> far<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:07.140> know<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.469> I
