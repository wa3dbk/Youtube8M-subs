input<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> homes<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.710> still<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.009> bright

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
as it ever was

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.849 
as it ever was
I<00:02:06.210> think<00:02:06.689> overall<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.079> being<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.530> good

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
I think overall it being a good

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.350 
I think overall it being a good
improvement<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.489> very<00:02:08.670> very<00:02:08.849> happy<00:02:09.000> with<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
improvement and very very happy with the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.750 
improvement and very very happy with the
way<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.539> works<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.530> biggest<00:02:10.890> noticeable

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
way it works the biggest noticeable

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.479 
way it works the biggest noticeable
difference<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.330> me<00:02:12.480> has<00:02:12.780> been<00:02:13.019> that<00:02:13.459> because<00:02:14.459> I

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
difference to me has been that because I

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.490 
difference to me has been that because I
suffer<00:02:15.030> from<00:02:15.180> sleep<00:02:15.480> apnea<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.050> have<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.319> use

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
suffer from sleep apnea and have to use

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.240 
suffer from sleep apnea and have to use
a<00:02:16.709> CPAP<00:02:17.190> machine<00:02:17.510> which<00:02:18.510> has<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.590> mask<00:02:19.860> which<00:02:20.129> I

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
a CPAP machine which has a mask which I

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.509 
a CPAP machine which has a mask which I
have<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.580> wear<00:02:20.760> over<00:02:20.910> my<00:02:21.239> nose<00:02:22.069> in<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.250> past

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
have to wear over my nose in the past

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.030 
have to wear over my nose in the past
I've<00:02:23.910> suffered<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:25.019> lot<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.260> condensation<00:02:25.560> in

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
I've suffered a lot of condensation in

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.100 
I've suffered a lot of condensation in
that<00:02:26.190> mask<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.879> when<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.599> conversation

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
that mask and when the conversation

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.309 
that mask and when the conversation
builds<00:02:28.379> up<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.709> mask<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.760> wakes<00:02:30.150> me<00:02:30.390> up<00:02:30.420> so

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
builds up in the mask it wakes me up so

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.979 
builds up in the mask it wakes me up so
that's<00:02:31.680> very<00:02:31.890> annoying<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:33.330> since<00:02:33.690> we've<00:02:33.840> had

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
that's very annoying and since we've had

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.570 
that's very annoying and since we've had
the<00:02:34.110> crystal<00:02:34.440> bond<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.890> windows<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
the crystal bond on the windows the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.520 
the crystal bond on the windows the
biggest<00:02:36.000> difference<00:02:36.360> because<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.959> the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
biggest difference because of the the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.270 
biggest difference because of the the
the<00:02:37.560> room<00:02:37.980> temperature<00:02:38.579> stabilizing<00:02:39.569> and

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
the room temperature stabilizing and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.410 
the room temperature stabilizing and
remaining<00:02:41.280> stable<00:02:41.670> throughout<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.239> night

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
remaining stable throughout the night

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.270 
remaining stable throughout the night
and<00:02:42.750> not<00:02:43.170> having<00:02:43.349> as<00:02:43.500> much<00:02:43.530> condensation<00:02:44.190> on

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
and not having as much condensation on

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.330 
and not having as much condensation on
the<00:02:44.340> windows<00:02:44.720> that's<00:02:45.720> disappeared<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:47.040> hasn't

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
the windows that's disappeared it hasn't

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.890 
the windows that's disappeared it hasn't
even<00:02:47.400> reduced<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.090> completely<00:02:48.720> disappeared

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
even reduced it's completely disappeared

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.009 
even reduced it's completely disappeared
so<00:02:49.890> now<00:02:50.130> I'm<00:02:50.280> back<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.489> good<00:02:50.760> night<00:02:50.910> sleep<00:02:51.180> what

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
so now I'm back to good night sleep what

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.930 
so now I'm back to good night sleep what
I<00:02:52.049> reckon<00:02:52.349> in<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.530> product<00:02:55.519> crystal<00:02:56.519> bond<00:02:56.670> is

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940

to my office windows I found the effect

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.349 
to my office windows I found the effect
had<00:03:46.079> significantly<00:03:46.950> reduced<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.549> heat<00:03:47.730> the

had significantly reduced the heat the

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.900 
had significantly reduced the heat the
glare<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.959> as<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.889> result<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.340> was<00:03:50.430> able<00:03:50.579> to<00:03:50.730> work

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910

in<00:03:54.090> addition<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:55.380> effect<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:55.769> crystal<00:03:56.160> bond

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
in addition the effect of crystal bond

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.030 
in addition the effect of crystal bond
has<00:03:56.579> allowed<00:03:56.849> me<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.120> reduce<00:03:57.569> the<00:03:57.780> heating<00:03:58.109> in

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
has allowed me to reduce the heating in

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.339 
has allowed me to reduce the heating in
the<00:03:59.220> colder<00:03:59.519> months<00:03:59.819> and<00:03:59.970> likewise<00:04:00.930> reduce

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
the colder months and likewise reduce
