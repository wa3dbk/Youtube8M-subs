00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
talk about some of the adaptations of

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.090 
talk about some of the adaptations of
tortoise<00:00:13.240> beetles<00:00:13.600> now<00:00:14.559> first<00:00:14.830> I'm<00:00:14.950> going<00:00:15.039> to

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
tortoise beetles now first I'm going to

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.520 
tortoise beetles now first I'm going to
talk<00:00:15.250> about<00:00:15.369> the<00:00:15.610> adults<00:00:15.820> and<00:00:16.299> why<00:00:17.020> they<00:00:17.289> get

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.530 
talk about the adults and why they get

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.620 
talk about the adults and why they get
their<00:00:17.710> name<00:00:17.890> tortoise<00:00:18.430> beetles<00:00:18.789> so<00:00:19.270> tortoise

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
their name tortoise beetles so tortoise

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.420 
their name tortoise beetles so tortoise
beetles<00:00:19.960> are<00:00:20.110> a<00:00:20.140> type<00:00:20.380> of<00:00:20.590> leaf<00:00:20.890> beetle<00:00:21.310> which

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
beetles are a type of leaf beetle which

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.000 
beetles are a type of leaf beetle which
is<00:00:21.580> a<00:00:21.610> big<00:00:22.030> group<00:00:22.360> of<00:00:22.540> beetles<00:00:22.900> or<00:00:23.320> many<00:00:23.770> many

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
is a big group of beetles or many many

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.550 
is a big group of beetles or many many
species<00:00:24.670> but<00:00:25.210> tortoise<00:00:25.600> beetles<00:00:25.930> are<00:00:26.290> quite

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
species but tortoise beetles are quite

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.840 
species but tortoise beetles are quite
distinctive<00:00:27.160> because<00:00:27.310> they're<00:00:27.580> actually

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
distinctive because they're actually

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.029 
distinctive because they're actually
quite<00:00:28.000> flattened<00:00:28.690> and<00:00:28.900> their<00:00:29.410> wing<00:00:29.650> covers

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
quite flattened and their wing covers

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.400 
quite flattened and their wing covers
are<00:00:30.160> expanded<00:00:30.850> around<00:00:31.120> the<00:00:31.240> edges<00:00:31.720> so<00:00:32.289> the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
are expanded around the edges so the

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.040 
are expanded around the edges so the
wing<00:00:32.559> covers<00:00:32.800> are<00:00:33.039> the<00:00:33.129> hard<00:00:33.510> four<00:00:34.510> wings<00:00:34.780> that

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
wing covers are the hard four wings that

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.139 
wing covers are the hard four wings that
protect<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.620> hind<00:00:35.860> wings<00:00:36.129> in<00:00:36.309> beetles<00:00:36.640> and

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
protect the hind wings in beetles and

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.819 
protect the hind wings in beetles and
because<00:00:37.449> they're<00:00:37.600> spread<00:00:37.960> out<00:00:38.050> at<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.469> sides

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
because they're spread out at the sides

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.279 
because they're spread out at the sides
they<00:00:39.249> look<00:00:39.429> somewhat<00:00:39.940> like<00:00:40.480> a<00:00:40.510> turtle<00:00:41.079> or<00:00:41.230> a

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
they look somewhat like a turtle or a

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:42.569 
they look somewhat like a turtle or a
tortoise<00:00:41.379> so<00:00:41.890> that's<00:00:42.069> how<00:00:42.190> they<00:00:42.309> get<00:00:42.460> their

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
tortoise so that's how they get their

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.849 
tortoise so that's how they get their
common<00:00:42.909> name<00:00:43.089> they<00:00:43.780> look<00:00:44.440> a<00:00:44.499> little<00:00:44.649> bit<00:00:44.829> like

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
common name they look a little bit like

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.369 
common name they look a little bit like
Lady<00:00:45.339> beetles<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:46.809> they're<00:00:46.960> actually<00:00:47.230> not

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
Lady beetles but they're actually not

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.399 
Lady beetles but they're actually not
that<00:00:47.440> closely<00:00:47.829> related<00:00:48.269> now<00:00:49.329> this<00:00:49.870> strange

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
that closely related now this strange

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.770 
that closely related now this strange
shape<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:51.429> the<00:00:51.609> wing<00:00:51.819> covers<00:00:52.089> in<00:00:52.390> tortoise

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
shape to the wing covers in tortoise

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.869 
shape to the wing covers in tortoise
beetles<00:00:53.109> is<00:00:53.229> a<00:00:53.260> structural<00:00:53.979> adaptation<00:00:54.729> to

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
beetles is a structural adaptation to

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.759 
beetles is a structural adaptation to
protect<00:00:55.269> them<00:00:55.389> from<00:00:55.600> predators<00:00:55.690> things<00:00:56.559> like

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
protect them from predators things like

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.919 
protect them from predators things like
ants<00:00:57.339> that<00:00:57.489> might<00:00:57.729> wander<00:00:58.149> along<00:00:58.359> on<00:00:58.569> a<00:00:58.600> leaf

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
ants that might wander along on a leaf

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:00.959 
ants that might wander along on a leaf
and<00:00:59.229> try<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.559> pick<00:00:59.679> them<00:00:59.889> up<00:00:59.979> they<00:01:00.489> can<00:01:00.639> clamp

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
and try and pick them up they can clamp

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.729 
and try and pick them up they can clamp
their<00:01:01.210> body<00:01:01.420> down<00:01:01.659> onto<00:01:02.049> the<00:01:02.139> surface<00:01:02.499> of<00:01:02.649> the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
their body down onto the surface of the

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.979 
their body down onto the surface of the
leaf<00:01:02.949> and<00:01:03.159> protect<00:01:04.089> their<00:01:04.239> legs<00:01:04.479> so<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:04.870> an

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
leaf and protect their legs so that an

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.539 
leaf and protect their legs so that an
ant<00:01:05.199> can't<00:01:05.530> actually<00:01:05.860> grab<00:01:06.070> them<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.400> take

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
ant can't actually grab them and take

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.690 
ant can't actually grab them and take
them<00:01:06.700> away<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.260> amazing<00:01:08.830> adaptations

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
them away but the amazing adaptations

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.730 
them away but the amazing adaptations
that<00:01:09.940> tortoise<00:01:10.390> beetles<00:01:10.780> have<00:01:11.050> don't

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
that tortoise beetles have don't

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.130 
that tortoise beetles have don't
actually<00:01:12.180> correspond<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.510> adults<00:01:13.990> it's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
actually correspond to the adults it's

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.140 
actually correspond to the adults it's
the<00:01:14.320> larval<00:01:14.890> stages<00:01:15.190> it's<00:01:15.550> their<00:01:15.760> grubs

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
the larval stages it's their grubs

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.300 
the larval stages it's their grubs
they're<00:01:16.480> really<00:01:16.840> amazing<00:01:17.080> now<00:01:17.950> they<00:01:18.100> belong

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
they're really amazing now they belong

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.950 
they're really amazing now they belong
in<00:01:18.460> that<00:01:18.580> group<00:01:18.880> called<00:01:19.150> leaf<00:01:19.360> beetles<00:01:19.780> and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
in that group called leaf beetles and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.840 
in that group called leaf beetles and
they<00:01:20.080> get<00:01:20.290> that<00:01:20.440> name<00:01:20.770> because<00:01:21.280> they<00:01:21.460> feed<00:01:21.820> on

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
they get that name because they feed on

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.060 
they get that name because they feed on
leaves<00:01:22.330> tortoise<00:01:23.260> beetles<00:01:23.590> in<00:01:23.710> particular

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
leaves tortoise beetles in particular

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.430 
leaves tortoise beetles in particular
just<00:01:24.610> basically<00:01:25.150> feed<00:01:25.480> on<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.930> surface<00:01:26.320> of

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
just basically feed on the surface of

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.080 
just basically feed on the surface of
the<00:01:26.590> leaves<00:01:26.770> out<00:01:27.160> in<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.520> open<00:01:27.910> where

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
the leaves out in the open where

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.760 
the leaves out in the open where
anything<00:01:28.480> can<00:01:28.660> attack<00:01:28.960> them<00:01:29.170> so<00:01:29.650> they

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
anything can attack them so they

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.460 
anything can attack them so they
actually<00:01:29.920> need<00:01:30.400> quite<00:01:30.940> a<00:01:30.970> lot<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.470> adaptations

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
actually need quite a lot of adaptations

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.020 
actually need quite a lot of adaptations
to<00:01:32.680> protect<00:01:33.010> them<00:01:33.160> from<00:01:33.310> predators<00:01:33.520> and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
to protect them from predators and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.990 
to protect them from predators and
parasitoids<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:35.560> larval<00:01:35.950> stages<00:01:36.220> of<00:01:36.580> most

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
parasitoids the larval stages of most

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.610 
parasitoids the larval stages of most
tortoise<00:01:37.420> beetles<00:01:37.750> are<00:01:37.870> actually<00:01:38.200> kind<00:01:38.470> of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
tortoise beetles are actually kind of

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.240 
tortoise beetles are actually kind of
oval<00:01:39.250> flattened<00:01:39.940> grubs<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.990> their<00:01:41.950> first

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
oval flattened grubs and their first

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.400 
oval flattened grubs and their first
adaptation<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:43.030> they<00:01:43.120> have<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.660> camouflage

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
adaptation that they have is camouflage

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.380 
adaptation that they have is camouflage
many<00:01:44.980> of<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.220> species<00:01:45.460> including<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.150> ones

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
many of the species including the ones

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.660 
many of the species including the ones
that<00:01:46.570> I<00:01:46.630> bought<00:01:46.870> in<00:01:47.020> here<00:01:47.260> today<00:01:47.620> are<00:01:48.100> actually

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
that I bought in here today are actually

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.840 
that I bought in here today are actually
colored<00:01:49.120> to<00:01:49.540> match<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.890> color<00:01:51.250> of<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.550> leaves

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
colored to match the color of the leaves

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.310 
colored to match the color of the leaves
that<00:01:52.000> they're<00:01:52.210> feeding<00:01:52.450> on<00:01:52.660> so<00:01:52.870> the<00:01:52.990> ones<00:01:53.170> we

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
that they're feeding on so the ones we

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.230 
that they're feeding on so the ones we
have<00:01:53.470> here<00:01:53.860> are<00:01:54.010> a<00:01:54.040> beautiful<00:01:54.310> green<00:01:54.730> color<00:01:55.030> so

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
have here are a beautiful green color so

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.360 
have here are a beautiful green color so
they're<00:01:55.390> actually<00:01:55.510> very<00:01:55.960> hard<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.320> spot<00:01:56.530> when

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
they're actually very hard to spot when

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.740 
they're actually very hard to spot when
you<00:01:57.490> look<00:01:57.670> for<00:01:57.820> them<00:01:57.910> on<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.120> leaves<00:01:58.360> the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
you look for them on the leaves the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.480 
you look for them on the leaves the
other<00:01:58.930> trick<00:01:59.230> that<00:01:59.260> they<00:01:59.500> have<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.950> around<00:02:00.100> the

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
other trick that they have is around the

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.730 
other trick that they have is around the
outside<00:02:01.180> of<00:02:01.420> their<00:02:01.570> bodies<00:02:01.990> they<00:02:02.230> have<00:02:02.500> a

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
outside of their bodies they have a

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.280 
outside of their bodies they have a
whole<00:02:03.070> series<00:02:03.610> of<00:02:03.790> little<00:02:04.090> spikes<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.990> stick

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
whole series of little spikes that stick

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.609 
whole series of little spikes that stick
out<00:02:05.470> now<00:02:06.280> it's<00:02:06.460> not<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:07.240> much<00:02:07.450> protection<00:02:08.349> from

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
out now it's not so much protection from

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.619 
out now it's not so much protection from
the<00:02:08.830> spiky

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the spiky

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.690 
the spiky
edges<00:02:10.629> being<00:02:11.620> caught<00:02:11.980> on<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.220> mouths<00:02:12.460> of

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
edges being caught on the mouths of

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.070 
edges being caught on the mouths of
something<00:02:12.970> trying<00:02:13.210> to<00:02:13.330> eat<00:02:13.480> them<00:02:13.660> it's<00:02:13.840> more<00:02:14.020> a

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
something trying to eat them it's more a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.530 
something trying to eat them it's more a
case<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.350> disrupting<00:02:15.280> they're<00:02:15.640> out

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
case of disrupting they're out

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.229 
case of disrupting they're out
so<00:02:16.959> if<00:02:17.079> you've<00:02:17.290> got<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.530> an<00:02:17.769> oval-shaped<00:02:18.609> grub

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
so if you've got a an oval-shaped grub

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.229 
so if you've got a an oval-shaped grub
sitting<00:02:19.599> on<00:02:19.689> a<00:02:19.719> leaf<00:02:20.189> it<00:02:21.189> casts<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.730> shadow<00:02:21.760> and

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
sitting on a leaf it casts a shadow and

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.670 
sitting on a leaf it casts a shadow and
it<00:02:22.329> makes<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.599> much<00:02:22.719> easier<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:23.170> see<00:02:23.379> but<00:02:23.590> if

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
it makes it much easier to see but if

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.709 
it makes it much easier to see but if
you<00:02:23.769> have<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:23.980> spiky<00:02:24.640> outline<00:02:25.060> makes<00:02:25.510> those

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:25.719 
you have a spiky outline makes those

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.449 
you have a spiky outline makes those
shadows<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> bit<00:02:26.349> softer<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.010> it's<00:02:27.159> actually

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
shadows a bit softer and it's actually

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.819 
shadows a bit softer and it's actually
difficult<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:27.969> pick<00:02:28.120> them<00:02:28.299> up<00:02:28.469> so<00:02:29.469> if<00:02:29.590> we<00:02:29.680> have

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
difficult to pick them up so if we have

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.740 
difficult to pick them up so if we have
a<00:02:29.859> close<00:02:30.250> look<00:02:30.609> at<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.819> larva<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.359> can<00:02:31.510> see

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
a close look at the larva you can see

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.629 
a close look at the larva you can see
that<00:02:31.930> there's<00:02:32.079> this<00:02:32.200> other<00:02:32.469> weird<00:02:32.950> brown

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:33.639 
that there's this other weird brown

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.059 
that there's this other weird brown
thing<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.209> sticks<00:02:34.480> out<00:02:34.659> the<00:02:34.870> back<00:02:35.049> and<00:02:35.829> what

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
thing that sticks out the back and what

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.129 
thing that sticks out the back and what
they<00:02:36.250> do<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:36.730> they<00:02:36.879> have<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.209> pair<00:02:37.719> of<00:02:37.750> long

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
they do is they have a pair of long

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:39.990 
they do is they have a pair of long
Forks<00:02:38.739> on<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.069> back<00:02:39.219> end<00:02:39.489> now<00:02:39.639> you<00:02:39.700> can't

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
Forks on the back end now you can't

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.869 
Forks on the back end now you can't
actually<00:02:40.120> see<00:02:40.329> them<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.019> grub<00:02:41.290> here

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
actually see them in the grub here

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.390 
actually see them in the grub here
because<00:02:42.879> it's<00:02:43.150> covered<00:02:43.540> in<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.230> skins<00:02:44.799> that

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
because it's covered in the skins that

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.030 
because it's covered in the skins that
it's<00:02:45.579> cast<00:02:45.909> as<00:02:46.329> it<00:02:46.480> grows<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.500> every<00:02:47.799> time

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
it's cast as it grows so every time

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.490 
it's cast as it grows so every time
sheds<00:02:48.639> its<00:02:48.819> skin<00:02:48.879> instead<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.840> just<00:02:50.079> leaving

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
sheds its skin instead of just leaving

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.159 
sheds its skin instead of just leaving
the<00:02:50.620> skin<00:02:50.859> behind<00:02:51.159> it<00:02:51.430> actually<00:02:51.840> builds<00:02:52.840> up<00:02:53.019> on

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
the skin behind it actually builds up on

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.470 
the skin behind it actually builds up on
the<00:02:53.260> little<00:02:53.829> fork<00:02:54.099> at<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.340> back<00:02:54.489> end<00:02:54.760> now<00:02:55.359> it

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
the little fork at the back end now it

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.629 
the little fork at the back end now it
doesn't<00:02:55.659> do<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:55.989> by<00:02:56.169> accident<00:02:56.439> what<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.459> can

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
doesn't do that by accident what it can

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.500 
doesn't do that by accident what it can
do<00:02:57.879> is<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.720> little<00:02:59.549> club<00:03:00.549> of<00:03:00.790> skins<00:03:01.209> at<00:03:01.419> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
do is that little club of skins at the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.479 
do is that little club of skins at the
back<00:03:01.719> can<00:03:02.019> actually<00:03:02.319> move<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.950> around<00:03:03.069> to

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
back can actually move that around to

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.759 
back can actually move that around to
anywhere<00:03:04.030> over<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.629> body<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.019> can<00:03:05.049> flex<00:03:05.439> it<00:03:05.680> up

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
anywhere over the body it can flex it up

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.190 
anywhere over the body it can flex it up
over<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.250> body<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.639> that<00:03:07.030> if<00:03:07.209> an<00:03:07.299> ant<00:03:07.569> tries<00:03:07.989> to

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
over the body so that if an ant tries to

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.319 
over the body so that if an ant tries to
nibble<00:03:08.409> at<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.739> front<00:03:08.980> end<00:03:09.219> it<00:03:09.760> lifts<00:03:10.090> up<00:03:10.150> the

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
nibble at the front end it lifts up the

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.199 
nibble at the front end it lifts up the
skins<00:03:10.599> and<00:03:10.780> tries<00:03:11.139> to<00:03:11.590> dislodge<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.060> move

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
skins and tries to dislodge it and move

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.089 
skins and tries to dislodge it and move
it<00:03:13.299> away<00:03:13.540> by<00:03:13.780> swinging<00:03:14.139> the<00:03:14.349> skins<00:03:14.650> back<00:03:14.889> and

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
it away by swinging the skins back and

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.240 
it away by swinging the skins back and
forth<00:03:15.389> but<00:03:16.389> the<00:03:16.540> most<00:03:16.810> amazing<00:03:17.319> adaptation

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
forth but the most amazing adaptation

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.460 
forth but the most amazing adaptation
that<00:03:18.459> these<00:03:18.730> tortoise<00:03:19.389> beetle<00:03:19.629> larvae<00:03:20.139> have

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
that these tortoise beetle larvae have

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.349 
that these tortoise beetle larvae have
is<00:03:21.069> what<00:03:21.370> they<00:03:21.489> do<00:03:21.549> with<00:03:21.909> their<00:03:22.090> waste

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
is what they do with their waste

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.240 
is what they do with their waste
products<00:03:22.840> they<00:03:23.049> actually<00:03:23.440> use<00:03:23.739> their<00:03:24.040> waste

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
products they actually use their waste

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.949 
products they actually use their waste
products<00:03:24.669> to<00:03:24.849> protect<00:03:25.060> them<00:03:25.479> from<00:03:25.750> predators

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
products to protect them from predators

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.240 
products to protect them from predators
and<00:03:26.440> parasites<00:03:26.919> so<00:03:27.699> here<00:03:27.940> we've<00:03:28.090> got<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.299> lava

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
and parasites so here we've got a lava

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.189 
and parasites so here we've got a lava
down<00:03:30.250> looking<00:03:30.729> down<00:03:30.909> a<00:03:30.940> video<00:03:31.209> microscope<00:03:31.959> and

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
down looking down a video microscope and

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.330 
down looking down a video microscope and
we<00:03:32.379> can<00:03:32.500> actually<00:03:32.739> look<00:03:32.859> at<00:03:33.010> some<00:03:33.189> of<00:03:33.280> those

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
we can actually look at some of those

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.550 
we can actually look at some of those
responses<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.150> talked<00:03:34.419> about<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:35.349> here

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
responses that I talked about so here

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.920 
responses that I talked about so here
we've<00:03:35.680> got<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:36.069> larva<00:03:36.549> sitting<00:03:37.209> on<00:03:37.329> a<00:03:37.359> leaf<00:03:37.599> and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
we've got a larva sitting on a leaf and

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.659 
we've got a larva sitting on a leaf and
you<00:03:38.409> can<00:03:38.560> see<00:03:38.859> that<00:03:39.099> it's<00:03:39.250> got<00:03:39.370> these<00:03:39.489> amazing

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
you can see that it's got these amazing

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.550 
you can see that it's got these amazing
spikes<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:40.810> come<00:03:40.989> around<00:03:41.199> the<00:03:41.379> edge<00:03:41.409> that

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
spikes that come around the edge that

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.610 
spikes that come around the edge that
help<00:03:42.129> to<00:03:42.280> disrupt<00:03:42.819> that<00:03:43.419> oval<00:03:43.900> outline<00:03:44.349> so

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
help to disrupt that oval outline so

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.530 
help to disrupt that oval outline so
that<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:44.889> doesn't<00:03:45.159> cast<00:03:45.370> as<00:03:45.639> many<00:03:45.819> shadows<00:03:46.299> on

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
that it doesn't cast as many shadows on

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.530 
that it doesn't cast as many shadows on
the<00:03:46.569> leaf<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.949> can<00:03:48.099> see<00:03:48.340> here<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:49.359> this

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
the leaf and you can see here that this

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.110 
the leaf and you can see here that this
is<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:49.989> final<00:03:50.500> stage<00:03:50.859> lava<00:03:51.370> it's<00:03:51.669> as<00:03:51.790> big<00:03:52.000> as

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
is the final stage lava it's as big as

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.369 
is the final stage lava it's as big as
it's<00:03:52.269> going<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.629> get<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:52.900> it's<00:03:53.019> going<00:03:53.109> to<00:03:53.199> turn

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
it's going to get and it's going to turn

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.319 
it's going to get and it's going to turn
into<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.650> pupa<00:03:53.949> soon<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:54.549> we<00:03:54.909> can<00:03:55.060> tell<00:03:55.299> that

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
into a pupa soon and we can tell that

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.789 
into a pupa soon and we can tell that
because<00:03:55.509> it's<00:03:55.989> got<00:03:56.229> 1<00:03:57.099> 2<00:03:57.759> 3<00:03:58.439> 4

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
because it's got 1 2 3 4

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.580 
because it's got 1 2 3 4
cast<00:04:00.280> skins<00:04:00.939> all<00:04:01.299> in<00:04:01.599> a<00:04:01.689> row<00:04:01.840> along<00:04:02.259> the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
cast skins all in a row along the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.399 
cast skins all in a row along the
backend<00:04:03.090> forming<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.209> Club<00:04:04.569> and<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:05.259> can

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
backend forming that Club and you can

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.499 
backend forming that Club and you can
see<00:04:05.650> here<00:04:05.979> that<00:04:06.189> when<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.519> lava<00:04:07.090> first

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:07.509 
see here that when the lava first

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:09.449 
see here that when the lava first
hatches<00:04:07.870> out<00:04:07.989> of<00:04:08.139> an<00:04:08.229> egg<00:04:08.379> because<00:04:09.069> it<00:04:09.189> doesn't

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
hatches out of an egg because it doesn't

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.969 
hatches out of an egg because it doesn't
have<00:04:09.579> a<00:04:09.609> skin<00:04:10.090> on<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:10.720> backend<00:04:11.139> to<00:04:11.439> use

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:11.979 
have a skin on the backend to use

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:13.860 
have a skin on the backend to use
against<00:04:12.310> predators<00:04:12.669> it<00:04:12.819> actually<00:04:13.120> adds<00:04:13.419> a

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
against predators it actually adds a

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.550 
against predators it actually adds a
little<00:04:14.049> blob<00:04:14.409> of<00:04:14.439> its<00:04:15.040> own<00:04:15.189> poo<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:16.570> help<00:04:16.780> Club

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
little blob of its own poo to help Club

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.170 
little blob of its own poo to help Club
anything<00:04:18.099> that<00:04:18.250> might<00:04:18.430> try<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:18.729> pick<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.030> up

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
anything that might try and pick it up

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.370 
anything that might try and pick it up
and<00:04:19.329> take<00:04:19.509> it<00:04:19.570> away<00:04:20.579> so<00:04:21.579> if<00:04:21.699> I<00:04:21.849> just<00:04:22.360> hope<00:04:23.139> the

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
and take it away so if I just hope the

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.230 
and take it away so if I just hope the
lava<00:04:23.590> at<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:24.009> front<00:04:24.279> end

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
lava at the front end

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.029 
lava at the front end
with<00:04:25.449> the<00:04:25.600> pair<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:25.840> forceps<00:04:26.319> hopefully<00:04:26.889> it'll

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
with the pair of forceps hopefully it'll

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:32.210 
with the pair of forceps hopefully it'll
respond<00:04:29.550> there<00:04:30.550> we<00:04:30.699> go<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:31.120> can<00:04:31.270> flex<00:04:31.569> those

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
respond there we go it can flex those

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.680 
respond there we go it can flex those
skins<00:04:33.220> all<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.550> way<00:04:33.639> over<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:33.970> back<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.360> try

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
skins all the way over the back and try

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.010 
skins all the way over the back and try
and<00:04:34.720> dislodge<00:04:35.229> my<00:04:35.680> forceps<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.660> if<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:37.750> go<00:04:37.900> and

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
and dislodge my forceps and if I go and

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.809 
and dislodge my forceps and if I go and
do<00:04:38.139> it<00:04:38.229> on<00:04:38.319> the<00:04:38.440> other<00:04:38.530> side<00:04:38.650> it'll<00:04:39.340> should

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
do it on the other side it'll should

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.529 
do it on the other side it'll should
shift<00:04:40.150> it<00:04:40.330> over<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.840> other<00:04:40.960> side<00:04:42.389> there<00:04:43.389> we

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
shift it over to the other side there we

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.680 
shift it over to the other side there we
go

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
go

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.110 
go
so<00:04:46.690> these<00:04:46.810> amazing<00:04:47.500> beetles<00:04:47.949> both<00:04:48.190> as<00:04:48.430> adults

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
so these amazing beetles both as adults

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.080 
so these amazing beetles both as adults
and<00:04:49.270> as<00:04:49.389> larvae<00:04:49.780> have<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.020> whole<00:04:50.289> host<00:04:50.680> of

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
and as larvae have a whole host of

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.850 
and as larvae have a whole host of
adaptations<00:04:52.090> that<00:04:52.240> increase<00:04:53.110> their<00:04:53.319> survival

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
adaptations that increase their survival

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.059 
adaptations that increase their survival
rate<00:04:54.330> for<00:04:55.330> living<00:04:55.720> a<00:04:55.810> dangerous<00:04:56.020> life<00:04:56.500> exposed

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
rate for living a dangerous life exposed

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.580
