00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.929
 the chicken breed is a very old breed 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:11.869
 ef 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:13.739
 in the region of andalusia 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.739
 and is considered one of the initial wings 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.449
 was dedicated to the trainer are all squares 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.609
 american 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.759
 are originating from seca valter the horse of war of spain and portugal 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.179
 for 50 years at the time 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.320
 salazar 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.250
 dictator in portugal 'and franco in spain 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.710
 the aesa considered to be good of the state 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.980
 so although she is the creator of the Creole of the strong mangalarga level 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.100
 as nothing this dictatorship a portugal-spain lasted many years 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.870
 finished in the whole world the creation of the horse in the light only class day students 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.910
 so you sound the leixões 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.570
 outside that was solid and the diplomas a horse had no record of his mark 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.190
 she comes from the state 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.700
 1970s out there and race socialist revolution 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.510
 p 'portugal began to put the cavalera thing of bourgeois de villepin 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.450
 the killer' 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.110
 then to the Portuguese 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.970
 precious has lost all this genetic 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.890
 3 4 thousand years 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.020
 released to Brazil 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.150
 - it was made the opposite because 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.550
 so I get devastated because Sao Paulo was so much one of those that was three 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.690
 Brazilians who went to 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.219
 animals in portugal ' 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.010
 from 2000 to 170 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.010
 creation begins 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.010
 of the Andalusian horse in Brazil 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.490
 finished the 7 75 76 and there is an activity 600 Spanish Portuguese 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.040
 and then race 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.420
 vandals 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.540
 the horse maluf said divided the book of kings said david 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.240
 lusitano thoroughbred 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.200
 purebred spanish breed 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.040
 in the beginning of Spain and made it very difficult for the Portuguese to leave 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.890
 so in Brazil the pure lusitano blood is created today are different registers 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.109
 but for the truth we look I can not distinguish 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.880
 what I the Spanish quique is the port won madri 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.629
 if the police had arrived at 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.239
 an empty journey 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.389
 the difference between 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.379
 classic lusitano thoroughbred 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.559
 are new 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.229
 functional 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.279
 but it's a stallion 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:40.959
 street henrique is a friend of ours cujubim ctg boss where goes his government 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.809

 live to see the horses are miguel let's do no 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.479
 the representation 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.549
 to win this race she has so she does not have many animals in the world 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:00.409
 because it was forbidden a lot of time from there to avirrp portugal-spain hand of 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:01.509
 very expensive work 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.419
 normally used 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.079
 There are four five and a half streets. 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.230
 the co-creator elements have to care and he has to implant 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:12.280
 ah 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.979
 the reforms made in a wine 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:18.509
 then the lp in a3 four animals with the vast majority 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:22.759
 When it started in Brazil, it's different on Tuesday. 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:26.639

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.499
 deserted musicians and providing a driving vision. 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.629
 then nothing can be done for example in the rib but later 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:49.509
 we can only pass through the plateau shows including the azerox with by protests 

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:52.909

 it was a warhorse to give a horse that spain and portugual the students and 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.029

 was running boss to the works 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:39.999
 so they were the Christians 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.680
 and the locals were the Moors 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.300

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:06.119
 including henrique is bujuru 

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:11.779
 we massacred bujuru's shell as the place with the development of 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:13.230
 big river pellets 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.010
 there was stopped and this side was half of it disabled let's say so stayed 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.879
 closed up because it was famous for winter 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.990
 a lot of people today still walking 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.730
 on the one hand we see that the incidence of horses per day the other 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.189
 never comes back 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:31.590
 say outs in other places in any case won action 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:35.759
 for duty rim beyond bujuru and charge north 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.780
 There is a lot of sales rhythm there is a lot of Lusitanian blood. 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.780
 including on the empty stomach of soybean 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.919
 there are still many ideas 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.389
 to give life to the character too 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.789
 time of service in the mixed hand indeed the miscegenation of the races 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:00.020
 of peace with the government the horse mosiah rodrigues that was decided in this 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.770
 one of the largest 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.830
 horse breeders the singer rests for a few minutes on the beach of the bar 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.300
 anything from animal breeding 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.020
 to give the new operators in the medical work and corroborates our 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.149
 region 

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:19.689
 of the technical sanitation horse in just 3 9 seconds 

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:21.789
 then 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:25.559
 away from indigenous land economic importance at the end of the year 

00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:30.469
 with that the cock plus a mark of six times happier than all those years 

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:35.499
 but difficult to extinguish the light from the lamp in the middle how can we be afraid 

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:38.289
 of getting sick to die but living in florianópolis
