locks<00:06:13.219> is<00:06:13.489> just<00:06:13.669> not<00:06:13.819> much<00:06:13.969> and<00:06:14.239> the

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:14.569 
locks is just not much and the

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:15.999 
locks is just not much and the
tolerances<00:06:15.110> as<00:06:15.259> they<00:06:15.379> were<00:06:15.469> making<00:06:15.649> through

tolerances as they were making through
the<00:06:16.069> years<00:06:16.249> got<00:06:16.459> worse<00:06:16.669> and<00:06:16.909> worse<00:06:16.969> so<00:06:17.269> they're

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
the years got worse and worse so they're

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.350 
the years got worse and worse so they're
not<00:06:18.199> even<00:06:18.259> well<00:06:18.979> built<00:06:19.249> unfortunately<00:06:20.240> but

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
not even well built unfortunately but

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.109 
not even well built unfortunately but
that's<00:06:20.539> all<00:06:20.689> there<00:06:20.809> is<00:06:20.839> the<00:06:21.649> if<00:06:22.639> you<00:06:22.699> do<00:06:22.969> have

00:06:23.109 --> 00:06:23.119 
that's all there is the if you do have

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:26.019 
that's all there is the if you do have
an<00:06:23.240> older<00:06:23.300> style<00:06:23.659> again<00:06:24.459> you<00:06:25.459> can<00:06:25.639> recognize

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:26.029 
an older style again you can recognize

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:29.649 
an older style again you can recognize
it<00:06:26.360> by<00:06:26.679> circular<00:06:27.679> cylinder<00:06:28.389> versus<00:06:29.389> a

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
as the other notch on the L 66 but we do

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.369 
as the other notch on the L 66 but we do
everything<00:06:41.769> Airstream<00:06:42.769> and<00:06:43.069> and<00:06:43.789> I<00:06:43.879> may<00:06:44.149> be

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
one other brand I can't remember someone

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:50.439 
one other brand I can't remember someone
did<00:06:46.999> a<00:06:47.379> specialized<00:06:48.759> latch<00:06:49.759> bolt<00:06:50.119> on<00:06:50.329> the<00:06:50.419> side

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
did a specialized latch bolt on the side

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.089 
did a specialized latch bolt on the side
of<00:06:50.779> this<00:06:50.869> thing<00:06:51.110> if<00:06:51.289> you<00:06:51.439> look<00:06:51.619> at<00:06:51.769> these<00:06:51.889> two

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:52.099 
of this thing if you look at these two

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:55.709 
of this thing if you look at these two
side-by-side<00:06:53.379> you'll<00:06:54.379> see<00:06:54.679> that<00:06:54.949> they<00:06:55.129> are

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:55.719 
side-by-side you'll see that they are

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:58.269 
side-by-side you'll see that they are
very<00:06:56.719> similar<00:06:57.050> but<00:06:57.349> look<00:06:57.529> at<00:06:57.619> that<00:06:57.740> one<00:06:58.069> has<00:06:58.249> a

00:06:58.269 --> 00:06:58.279 
very similar but look at that one has a

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:01.149 
very similar but look at that one has a
much<00:06:58.519> wonder<00:06:58.849> latch<00:06:58.999> bolt<00:06:59.360> and<00:06:59.949> there's<00:07:00.949> still

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:01.159 
much wonder latch bolt and there's still

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:02.829 
much wonder latch bolt and there's still
the<00:07:01.309> same<00:07:01.490> lock<00:07:01.669> but<00:07:02.059> the<00:07:02.179> latch<00:07:02.419> bolt<00:07:02.749> has

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:02.839 
the same lock but the latch bolt has

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.629 
the same lock but the latch bolt has
been<00:07:02.990> replaced<00:07:03.469> in<00:07:03.740> these<00:07:03.949> by<00:07:04.279> the<00:07:04.339> airstream

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 
been replaced in these by the airstream

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.219 
been replaced in these by the airstream
company<00:07:05.179> or<00:07:05.300> by<00:07:05.419> garbagemen<00:07:05.899> probably

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229 
company or by garbagemen probably

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:08.469 
company or by garbagemen probably
originally<00:07:06.679> with<00:07:07.279> an<00:07:07.429> extra<00:07:08.089> one<00:07:08.269> when<00:07:08.449> I

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 
originally with an extra one when I

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:09.609 
originally with an extra one when I
think<00:07:08.659> it's<00:07:08.749> about<00:07:08.839> an<00:07:08.959> inch<00:07:09.079> and<00:07:09.559> a<00:07:09.589> half

00:07:09.609 --> 00:07:09.619 
think it's about an inch and a half

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:12.669 
think it's about an inch and a half
longer<00:07:10.009> we<00:07:11.229> that's<00:07:12.229> the<00:07:12.379> only<00:07:12.589> difference

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:12.679 
longer we that's the only difference

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:15.249 
longer we that's the only difference
between<00:07:12.949> them<00:07:13.219> we've<00:07:13.729> had<00:07:13.879> those<00:07:14.059> machined<00:07:14.599> so

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:15.259 
between them we've had those machined so

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:16.769 
between them we've had those machined so
we<00:07:15.409> actually<00:07:15.559> have<00:07:15.769> some<00:07:15.919> very<00:07:16.069> nice

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:16.779 
we actually have some very nice

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:18.609 
we actually have some very nice
reproductions<00:07:17.779> of<00:07:17.990> those<00:07:18.169> old<00:07:18.439> ones

00:07:18.609 --> 00:07:18.619 
reproductions of those old ones
