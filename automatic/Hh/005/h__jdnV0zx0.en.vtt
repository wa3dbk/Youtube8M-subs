in<00:00:05.660> addition<00:00:06.140> to<00:00:06.230> how<00:00:06.319> important<00:00:06.770> the<00:00:06.890> entry

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
in addition to how important the entry

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.670 
in addition to how important the entry
is<00:00:07.430> the<00:00:08.059> exit<00:00:08.510> is<00:00:08.630> also<00:00:08.990> very<00:00:09.200> important

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:09.680 
is the exit is also very important

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.140 
is the exit is also very important
especially<00:00:09.889> because<00:00:10.459> that's<00:00:10.670> going<00:00:10.850> to<00:00:10.940> lead

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
especially because that's going to lead

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.390 
especially because that's going to lead
you<00:00:11.299> into<00:00:11.450> a<00:00:11.570> successful<00:00:11.990> transition<00:00:12.590> from

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
you into a successful transition from

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.140 
you into a successful transition from
pool<00:00:14.360> to<00:00:14.869> bike<00:00:15.080> all<00:00:15.799> right<00:00:15.949> now<00:00:16.190> coming<00:00:16.460> in<00:00:16.820> in

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
pool to bike all right now coming in in

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.900 
pool to bike all right now coming in in
the<00:00:17.390> ocean<00:00:17.810> again<00:00:18.590> you<00:00:18.830> want<00:00:19.010> to<00:00:19.100> you<00:00:19.699> can

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
the ocean again you want to you can

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.940 
the ocean again you want to you can
really<00:00:20.210> use<00:00:20.510> the<00:00:20.779> waves<00:00:21.020> to<00:00:21.350> your<00:00:21.500> advantage

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
really use the waves to your advantage

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.560 
really use the waves to your advantage
there's<00:00:22.190> nothing<00:00:22.550> nothing<00:00:23.030> worse<00:00:23.180> than<00:00:23.420> out

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
there's nothing nothing worse than out

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.690 
there's nothing nothing worse than out
swimming<00:00:24.140> a<00:00:24.230> competitor<00:00:24.770> and<00:00:24.980> turning<00:00:25.610> around

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
swimming a competitor and turning around

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.359 
swimming a competitor and turning around
and<00:00:26.030> watching<00:00:26.360> them<00:00:26.539> taking<00:00:27.080> a<00:00:27.320> wave<00:00:27.590> into<00:00:28.220> the

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
and watching them taking a wave into the

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.540 
and watching them taking a wave into the
finish<00:00:29.440> again<00:00:30.440> it<00:00:30.560> doesn't<00:00:30.740> use<00:00:31.010> any<00:00:31.220> more

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
finish again it doesn't use any more

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.490 
finish again it doesn't use any more
energy<00:00:31.970> and<00:00:32.210> in<00:00:32.660> fact<00:00:32.960> you'd<00:00:33.140> be<00:00:33.230> saving

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
energy and in fact you'd be saving

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.170 
energy and in fact you'd be saving
energy<00:00:33.829> letting<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:34.399> ocean<00:00:34.760> do<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:35.000> work

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
energy letting the ocean do the work

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.760 
energy letting the ocean do the work
compared<00:00:35.629> to<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:35.780> person<00:00:36.199> next<00:00:36.350> to<00:00:36.500> you<00:00:36.620> who

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
compared to the person next to you who

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.889 
compared to the person next to you who
may<00:00:36.920> be<00:00:36.949> fighting<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:37.730> ocean<00:00:37.879> and<00:00:38.329> trying<00:00:38.780> to

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
may be fighting the ocean and trying to

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.649 
may be fighting the ocean and trying to
swim<00:00:39.140> their<00:00:39.350> way<00:00:39.469> in<00:00:39.710> so<00:00:40.339> paying<00:00:40.789> attention<00:00:41.420> to

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:41.659 
swim their way in so paying attention to

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.599 
swim their way in so paying attention to
the<00:00:41.809> forces<00:00:42.230> in<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.440> water<00:00:42.649> always<00:00:43.219> something

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
the forces in the water always something

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.790 
the forces in the water always something
very<00:00:43.760> very<00:00:44.210> important<00:00:44.749> one<00:00:45.229> way<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:45.440> can<00:00:45.649> do

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
very very important one way you can do

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.169 
very very important one way you can do
that<00:00:45.949> is<00:00:46.159> to<00:00:46.309> adjust<00:00:46.429> your<00:00:46.789> breathing

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
that is to adjust your breathing

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.090 
that is to adjust your breathing
typically<00:00:47.600> when<00:00:47.749> you<00:00:47.870> breathe<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:49.069> know

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
typically when you breathe you know

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.649 
typically when you breathe you know
coming<00:00:49.429> in<00:00:49.670> you're<00:00:49.789> going<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:49.940> be<00:00:50.059> siding<00:00:50.510> so

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
coming in you're going to be siding so

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.149 
coming in you're going to be siding so
your<00:00:50.780> heads<00:00:50.899> going<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:51.170> be<00:00:51.229> forward<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:51.889> the

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
your heads going to be forward and the

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:53.559 
your heads going to be forward and the
traditional<00:00:52.670> breath<00:00:52.879> that<00:00:53.089> you're<00:00:53.210> used<00:00:53.389> to

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:53.569 
traditional breath that you're used to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:55.360 
traditional breath that you're used to
to<00:00:53.749> the<00:00:53.870> side<00:00:54.109> another<00:00:54.739> way<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:54.979> do<00:00:55.219> that

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
to the side another way to do that

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.039 
to the side another way to do that
without<00:00:55.579> disrupting<00:00:56.149> your<00:00:56.389> stroke<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:56.929> to

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:57.049 
without disrupting your stroke is to

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:58.509 
without disrupting your stroke is to
start<00:00:57.260> breathing<00:00:57.499> a<00:00:57.679> little<00:00:57.889> bit<00:00:58.010> deeper<00:00:58.190> into

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
start breathing a little bit deeper into

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.069 
start breathing a little bit deeper into
your<00:00:58.609> armpit<00:00:59.030> what<00:00:59.449> that's<00:00:59.659> going<00:00:59.809> to<00:00:59.899> be<00:00:59.989> able

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
your armpit what that's going to be able

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.840 
your armpit what that's going to be able
to<00:01:00.229> do<00:01:00.440> is<00:01:00.589> let<00:01:00.769> you<00:01:00.889> see<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:01.339> ways<00:01:01.519> that<00:01:01.729> are

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
to do is let you see the ways that are

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.819 
to do is let you see the ways that are
approaching<00:01:02.210> okay<00:01:02.839> so<00:01:02.989> breathing<00:01:03.559> into<00:01:03.799> your

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
approaching okay so breathing into your

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.890 
approaching okay so breathing into your
armpit<00:01:04.309> is<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.460> way<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.729> kind<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.120> survey<00:01:05.840> the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
armpit is a way to kind of survey the

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.300 
armpit is a way to kind of survey the
scene<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.440> make<00:01:06.560> sure<00:01:06.740> you're<00:01:06.950> not<00:01:06.979> going<00:01:07.220> to

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
scene and make sure you're not going to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.340 
scene and make sure you're not going to
miss<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.520> wave<00:01:07.790> as<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.120> comes<00:01:08.330> fast<00:01:08.540> there's<00:01:09.259> a

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
miss a wave as it comes fast there's a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.139 
miss a wave as it comes fast there's a
couple<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.649> different<00:01:09.920> ways<00:01:10.009> to<00:01:10.399> ride<00:01:10.969> the

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
couple of different ways to ride the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.240 
couple of different ways to ride the
wave<00:01:11.329> in<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:12.200> can<00:01:12.380> go<00:01:12.530> with<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:12.799> traditional

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
wave in you can go with the traditional

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.770 
wave in you can go with the traditional
streamline<00:01:13.729> position<00:01:14.210> which<00:01:14.360> is<00:01:14.539> very

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
streamline position which is very

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.029 
streamline position which is very
efficient<00:01:15.289> to<00:01:15.409> move<00:01:15.560> through<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.890> water

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
efficient to move through the water

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.370 
efficient to move through the water
however<00:01:16.670> your<00:01:17.090> mouth<00:01:17.329> is<00:01:17.570> in<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:17.930> water<00:01:18.140> so

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
however your mouth is in the water so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.359 
however your mouth is in the water so
you're<00:01:18.469> not<00:01:18.560> going<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.799> be<00:01:18.860> getting<00:01:19.009> a<00:01:19.130> lot<00:01:19.250> of

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
you're not going to be getting a lot of

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.459 
you're not going to be getting a lot of
air<00:01:19.549> you<00:01:20.060> can<00:01:20.210> also<00:01:20.329> go<00:01:20.600> with<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.899> traditional

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
air you can also go with the traditional

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:22.929 
air you can also go with the traditional
body<00:01:21.680> surfing<00:01:22.130> technique<00:01:22.490> which<00:01:22.700> would<00:01:22.820> be

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
body surfing technique which would be

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.029 
body surfing technique which would be
one<00:01:23.119> arm<00:01:23.299> forward<00:01:23.630> one<00:01:23.960> arm<00:01:23.990> back<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:24.890> is

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
one arm forward one arm back that is

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.830 
one arm forward one arm back that is
used<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.460> little<00:01:25.579> bit<00:01:25.729> more<00:01:25.850> for<00:01:26.390> a<00:01:26.420> lateral

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
used a little bit more for a lateral

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.109 
used a little bit more for a lateral
movement<00:01:27.140> side<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.740> side<00:01:27.979> but<00:01:28.280> again<00:01:28.369> this

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
movement side to side but again this

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.490 
movement side to side but again this
gives<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.509> a<00:01:29.539> little<00:01:29.719> bit<00:01:29.899> more<00:01:30.049> security

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
gives you a little bit more security

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.080 
gives you a little bit more security
just<00:01:30.770> in<00:01:30.859> case<00:01:31.039> the<00:01:31.219> wave<00:01:31.399> does<00:01:31.640> pitch<00:01:31.939> you

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
just in case the wave does pitch you

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.940 
just in case the wave does pitch you
