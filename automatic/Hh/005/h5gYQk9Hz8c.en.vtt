00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.190
 today we are going to talk a little about care 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.680

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.320

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.920
 care so what am I doing all 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.540
 morning and every night on the face 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.720
 so I warn you it's going to be pretty 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.670
 fast because I do not do much 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.350
 I prefer to do - and it worked 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.640
 really rather than putting tons 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.059
 and tons because in general 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.129
 the more we do less is good finally in 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.360
 anyway me that's what I think so 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.100
 here I am going to introduce you to a small 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.050
 little fast what am I doing morning and 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.629
 evening for my skin I do not have a skin 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.970
 perfect far from here I have some 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.490
 But it's true that since 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.740
 I do this routine care I have 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.850
 a lot in general so it's for 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.380
 what I wanted you to watch and 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.150
 maybe it can serve you and 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.130
 give you ideas on what you 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.780
 can do 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.530
 dobbins lying down right now I'm going 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.280
 you present this in voiceover taker 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:35.540
 an influenza symptom is treated at 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:37.430
 parties for the routine tonight so 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.590
 for now the press because we did not 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.360
 not necessarily had a lot of time when 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.980
 there is a lot of all this so I 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.620
 start by taking my micellar water 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.030
 of baragouine shepard on a cotton and I 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.510
 go remove all the little flowers 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.130
 done if we can stay from the finish 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.650
 this change could have settled 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.150
 during the night I then take a 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.220
 role of for the eyes of garnier 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.600
 we raise all these scenes 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.370
 unsightly 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.150
 what we do not know when we do not have a 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.220
 client him like me there are Serbian 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.590
 Swiss franc game a serum of checchi 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.810
 caused aims to remove all 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.440
 traces of buttons and buttons in general 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.570
 you fall 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.070
 it's really awesome 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.290
 recommend because ever since 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:25.300
 I really have a lot of traces of 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.550
 buttons and buttons and well su take 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.230
 Yellow-white mane in keeping 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.900
 the form 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.730
 nationally before him the green that is 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.450
 alright but there I have not asked so sad 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.830
 honor for extreme forms way 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.830
 in addition he feels combo 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.460
 to finish I come to take a burst of 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.150
 light of the chateau logis 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.840
 I come back on my face to give it back 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.260
 a thousand and a few 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:00.660
 a little more fishing he wants to be 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.660
 ready and radiant for the martin 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.520
 and here is a good base before 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.840
 appoint 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:14.460
 here we go now at night I 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.740
 start by removing my eyes with 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.760
 a two-phase makeup remover because it's 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.760
 much more effective 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.830
 I do the rest of my face with 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.520
 names I've been removing all that is 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.520
 the simplest 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.010
 I then take cleansing gel and 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.050
 this brush that in this case dupes of 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.410
 the sonic classic in much less 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.610
 dear and we just rub all the face 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.610
 to thoroughly clean 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.360
 we shave and we follow after 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.950
 I still come to take his serum 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.370
 needs morning and evening you have a real 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.370
 effect 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.580
 I come to take 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:30.949
 yale for the eyes and I come right side 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.080
 Toulon is there I also tap 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.080
 to make the material penetrate 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.290
 I come then take the cream Nivea 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.940
 I use as a night cream 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.640
 because it is much thicker than 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.930
 the cream I used this morning and the 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.910
 blow she can put a lot more and 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:57.150
 she really has a top effect on my skin 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:59.720
 I think after that and we ended it 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.720
 can go to bed 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.160
 so what girls I hope it 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.080
 you were pleased 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.760
 I have some small details 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.470
 bring anyway 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.770
 so there are little things that I 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.930
 do more of that sometimes so 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.210
 I use these two products 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.250
 so it actually depends on the state of my 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.810
 skin at that moment when I find that 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.820
 my skin tends to be a little bit 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.370
 plus a little greasy or that I have a 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.300
 little more sebum 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.010
 so when I find that I have a little 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.900
 too much sebum on the skin or that my skin 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.310
 starts to have little pimples and 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:44.680
 where I use every other day we will say 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:46.300
 so that's the pure bros expo expo of 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.890
 garnish it's been a long time that I 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.630
 the beloved it was soon never found 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:54.419
 their intentions so that's great 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:06:01.630
 pass product after anglers 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:03.070
 here and then from time to time but 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.770
 it's true that I do it less and 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:10.020
 less right now i can do that too 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:13.330
 this finally I'm doing this binder expo so 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.890
 this neutrogena so skite stress 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.360
 control on the contrary I love the good 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.340
 but that one I do it often in the summer 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.530
 rather because it's super cool on 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.450
 the skin so it's great 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.280
 these are two complementary products 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.930
 so here are the girls I'm done 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.390
