now that our bowtie is built I mean go
ahead<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.670> draw<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:22.939> pattern<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:27.530> go<00:01:27.649> up

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.060 

and<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.220> create<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.880> ripples<00:01:36.620> I'm<00:01:37.620> just<00:01:37.860> going

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070

and to create the ripples I'm just going
to<00:01:38.130> go<00:01:38.310> ahead<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.970> start<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.320> ring<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
to go ahead and start on this ring and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.870 
to go ahead and start on this ring and
draw<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.490> in

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.370

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and I'm going to do it exactly the same

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.780 
and I'm going to do it exactly the same
on<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.800> other<00:01:46.830> side<00:01:50.450> like<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.510> and<00:01:52.790> I'm
