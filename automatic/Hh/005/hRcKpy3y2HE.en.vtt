 to 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.760
 to all those guys and we are writers 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.559
 in this case we are in the rebellion of 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.730
 the three investigate and go name 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.169
 that this man has chosen and has 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.580
 painted that some good ones are reversed 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.950
 that had not sent me for a while 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.660
 nobody speculates from behind and lost his 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.189
 dad that has to do with my ladies and 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.109
 three inverted darlings were all 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.820
 parkour within survey costs me 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.570
 find maps with history or not 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.400
 have to see and that in this case 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.629
 I share within this what to say that I 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.790
 like to receive so much from everything 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.680
 as parkour with stories that these 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.150
 also that is, there are barbones maps with 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.920
 story that is very cool but without more 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.850
 let's start the map that 's good 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.290
 I suppose that here I have put some 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.629
 book a is in the form of an inverted t 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.760
 this I know I know how to do at night and 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.760
 also to pacific let's see let's 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.500
 look at the rhombus what I do not get the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.510
 deposition of night vision and the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.860
 first story that says hello to 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.420

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.510
 history the meeting of the three 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.010
 you are trapped in this world 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.840
 because of the three inverted that 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.060
 they complain because humans mistreat them 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.100
 a lot and not what m then this one has 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.180
 tested this parkour test 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.730
 why 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.800

 12 percent will found 316 fico 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.410
 I think I have not saved it and this is 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.030
 because I am yes if I keep it perfect 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.470
 without more let's say the way to be 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.200
 you seeing inverted currents vial to 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.759
 that you read uncle how exciting it is to see 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.680

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.240
 very big I really appreciate that much 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.430
 the amount because to be outstanding 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.000
 inverted first stage river is 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.100
 winston beach pinchan has sounded a bit 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.580
 rare 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.259
 two pigs passing them strange things from 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.270
 inverted synths everywhere we go 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.429
 to try to do this quietly and 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.630
 I've been on the job but not 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.680
 I want to pull it even though I put it 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.540
 is that there are coins is laziness 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.800
 take it off we go and quietly not 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.840
 I think more lack of what we're going to do 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.280
 this pair as god sends this jump 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.280
 it looks up 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.780
 5 2 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.830
 and today it is very cool that I do not know what I have 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.350
 but it is very cool and once what you 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.550
 I wanted to comment is the internal one if 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.620
 you have stopped seeing her in these 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.630
 videos and more with the theme of passion 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.910
 pit the mic action that good many me 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.640
 you ask then what song do you use 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.440
 in total cool and so loving twin possess 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.600
 I'm going to tell you use an intro of a 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.060
 man or a group called pepas 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.500
 if passion pit and the song take a walk 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.850
 and look at these vouchers for the people that 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.950
 is asking and I'm going to have to do 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.840
 parkour among those things as it turns out 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.840
 that my intro is copyright is not 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.030
 a free song of royalties and 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.160
 license rights li take the faca hey 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.739
 I'm very sorry the little pigs look at the 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.200
 pickpockets are 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.610
 joey is all very original when you have 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.480
 all make them tell what happens with the 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.480
 copyright and those things 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.640
 poor pigs but I want to but 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.200
 what a good fuck is this the key has 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.150
 over here and good if more it turns out that 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.670
 you have to stop using the intro of 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.650
 passion and you are going to kill me 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.180
 the channel see if everyone's wallpaper 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.430
 your subscribers because change the intro 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.040
 but my channel can be seen in danger are 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.870
 a stage to extinguish my channel to be able 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.910
 danger like rockets inverted by 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.960
 this intro this means that I do not 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.240
 for a higher no type of 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.440
 copyright that has to do with this 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.940
 lord to feel that I 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.740
 I appreciate very much that I do not stand with miss 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.990
 I am happy with myself and leave us 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.240
 live calm with this I want 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.010
 deny the fact that they can 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.900
 use songs for only seven 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.970
 seconds and that does not jump to the cop and that's 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.820
 totally false if the song wants 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.980
 to get tighter says then since 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.540
 the second zero menu sounds like I want 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.890
 ask for rights to my song what 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.510
 they can do perfectly and they 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.610
 they can fuck all the people who are 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.090
 dedicate to excel I had I of you 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:19.050
 I would not play it and they are not from I have krill 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.870
 because it seems that it's because but I 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.130
 I feel strange not because here is missing as 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.280
 One Way 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.480
 I just felt lost in my life 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.190
 let's stay I put myself here in 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.140
 problems these errors that are happening 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.480
 one in life and with this you mean 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.800
 that people who use music with 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.750
 copyright I of you do not give me the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.760
 would play now and it would take him out then 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.590
 I was writing forced to remove my 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.590
 song that will transport changes fuck me 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.570
 much more to me than to you because 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.240
 I'm fond of you, not the subject of you 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.470
 and I can not use the more for alarm 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.710
 He lost competition he asked me 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.840
 copyright imagine that it's my turn 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.450
 It would fit into a pompadón more than 400 or 300 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.800
 videos and would not give much pleasure from mouth to mouth 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.970
 see how your videos to be acclaimed I follow 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.030
 how am I fighting such a way 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.090
 hardcore then I prefer to already remove what 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.580
 that fuck but because seen as holy 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.720
 then I preferred to remove that 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.340
 possibility that the copyright and 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.460
 of step if someday they ask me then to have 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.800
 that claim less less videos third 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.800
 stage yung jan vasco highlights ok 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.930
 youtube was a giant inverted t but 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.000
 that here he knew that having to go down today 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.410
 is much takes part congratulated is 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.970
 very cool you are hitting a currada 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.270
 awesome me to do these things 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.500
 equal mediated 20 years or 27 and also 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.150
 I study forgiveness for the six that I am 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.700
 committing because is that for god 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.620
 blessed because I'm going you lower it 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.620
 it quietly costs 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.290
 I can assure you that it gives me a lot 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.780
 800 times economic radio is horrible 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.000
 horrible and more now that youtube is being 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.760
 getting really fucking can sit well 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.320
 please is shocking against the wall in 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.030
 universal state charm I'm 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.640
 expressing because I'm falling in 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.170
 all the jumps now youtube is 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.170
 putting very touches balls and 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.010
 damn king mother 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.930
 get off the center and a secret that 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.890
 it seems that it is something soft and therefore what 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.510
 pass guy is that I had to look 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.650
 a song without copyright or buy 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.960
 some license some song that I 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.120
 let it use on YouTube or I do not know what 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.890
 I'll do but my intro is going to have to be 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.960
 evaporated and well have to use 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.370
 other music and other songs 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.920
 masses I hope you understand that I do not 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.690
 stone because I put it 500 safe 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.340
 the channel is the most important thing not for a 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.290
 song that does not really belong to me nor 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.990
 one more that belongs to the lord of passion 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.850
 pete then they do not actually improve 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.520
 also ok I forgot to read get out 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:56.250
 of happiness is a pimp like you 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.420
 see but lack the s with my head like this 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.390
 that is the dry one that such a load 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.160
 bears youtube today is very cool to see 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.980
 what it says here jumps many times but 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.880
 I want to take the book and as an end 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.230
 congratulations, they have managed to pass the 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.370
 map I hope you have gone very well 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.370
 health is from Colombia an inverted t 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.150
 i 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:27.900
 is inverted is far from congratulate 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.490
 thank you very much and good what was 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.530
 saying is that if you see that it disappears 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.509
 passion pit 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.710
 may know and do not go away because you 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:36.270
 It's still alive out there but I have to 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.650
 search inside without more and I think it 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.150
 like because we see a hug very 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.150
 big and until the next 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.360
 ah
