heavy and if you have three or four in a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.900 
heavy and if you have three or four in a
backpack<00:00:51.860> you<00:00:52.860> know<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.579> lot<00:00:53.760> of

backpack you know it's it's a lot of
weight<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.449> some<00:00:54.690> students<00:00:55.050> will<00:00:55.110> simply

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
weight and so some students will simply

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.819 
weight and so some students will simply
just<00:00:57.149> quit<00:00:57.629> bringing<00:00:57.840> text<00:00:58.350> books<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.680> class
