00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:14.580
 or I'm all I know, tinker 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:19.260
 once by following it is a lot of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.340
 you need a din a4 paper now 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.080
 the colleagues 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.080
 I give the micro 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.810
 yes, it has already been said correctly 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:41.480
 need the quarter of a din a4 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:44.059
 It does not need paper like that on her 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.620
 absolutely if he is good treasures 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:51.410
 can you do it without him? 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:57.820
 but you have to be about two inches 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.820
 from the top down 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:11.810
 So it looks like that then you have to 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:26.690
 you fold the corner forward and after 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:45.679
 the whole we do on the back 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:48.399
 then bend the other side if it does 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:55.789
 inside 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:59.330
 since then forests in the helmet the whole 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:10.670
 also on the other side that then 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:17.900
 so from then falls from below me 150 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:19.930
 centimeter off again only slightly to 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:26.060
 estimate 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:32.780
 then we turn it over and fold 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:35.200
 the tip from the bottom up and that 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.720
 so high 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.910
 that is 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.610
 if you turn it around again and only here 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.250
 in the middle of this piece is what 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:54.320
 later jonas head is so then why 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:03:01.850
 back the times that in the middle before 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.850
 raus whole with the other side 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:19.980
 does not cleanse so directly so that namely 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:25.310
 already perfect so this you this 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.310
 wonder to fold up 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:46.110
 so is done when you have no face 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:56.190
 want you can on a court 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:04:01.560
 you can of course make green paper 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:05.269
 So in addition to a paper like the Jew on 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.269
 had started 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.250
 Certainly somehow does not write that well 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.650
 you can also still knack brauckmann 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:41.830
 I always like to see you from above 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:41.830
 very small bit bigger now very big 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:59.960
 you can of course finish bigger me 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:08.840
 am very well explained my colleague and 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:11.680
 I feel really real really real 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.680
 I feel 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:23.350
 just as we have to do it then real 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.350
 jutta origami you have
