00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
there was some pretty crazy things that

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:22.550 
there was some pretty crazy things that
went<00:00:12.450> down<00:00:20.930> we<00:00:21.930> got<00:00:22.050> out<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> choice

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
went down we got out of the choice

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.189 
went down we got out of the choice
between<00:00:22.740> seven<00:00:23.189> different<00:00:23.279> jumps<00:00:24.019> lots<00:00:25.019> of

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
between seven different jumps lots of

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.330 
between seven different jumps lots of
long<00:00:25.470> wide<00:00:26.070> landings<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.590> I<00:00:28.590> think<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> first

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
long wide landings and I think the first

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.919 
long wide landings and I think the first
hit<00:00:29.670> for<00:00:29.699> everybody<00:00:30.210> or<00:00:30.359> first<00:00:30.570> drop<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
hit for everybody or first drop of the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.510
