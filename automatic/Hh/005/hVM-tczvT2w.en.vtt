00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.140 
SEPs and fast films i'd like to give you
a<00:00:04.049> quick<00:00:04.290> overview<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:05.400> routine<00:00:05.790> called

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
a quick overview of a routine called

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.480 
a quick overview of a routine called
index<00:00:06.690> color<00:00:06.990> separations<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.309> great

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
index color separations this is a great

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.009 
index color separations this is a great
routine<00:00:08.790> because<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.450> can<00:00:09.630> be<00:00:09.690> used<00:00:09.870> on<00:00:09.990> a

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
routine because it can be used on a

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.610 
routine because it can be used on a
variety<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.559> designs<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.340> it's<00:00:11.790> very<00:00:12.030> popular

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
variety of designs and it's very popular

separating your final separations are
nothing<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:23.279> little<00:00:23.580> tiny<00:00:23.730> square<00:00:24.060> dots<00:00:24.300> if<00:00:24.779> i

zoom<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.590> you'll<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.070> mean

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
zoom in on this you'll see what I mean

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.580 
zoom in on this you'll see what I mean
it's<00:00:27.300> little<00:00:27.570> dots<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.080> they're<00:00:28.170> all<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.380> st.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
it's little dots and they're all the st.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.050 
it's little dots and they're all the st.
little<00:00:28.800> squares<00:00:29.160> they're<00:00:29.400> all<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> same<00:00:29.640> size

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
little squares they're all the same size

little squares they're all the same size
this<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.420> often<00:00:30.929> Lee<00:00:31.080> often<00:00:31.560> called<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.890> square

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
this is often Lee often called a square

this is often Lee often called a square
type<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.820> separation<00:00:34.550> what<00:00:35.550> makes<00:00:35.760> us<00:00:35.910> unique

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
type of separation what makes us unique

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.850 
type of separation what makes us unique
is<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.540> when<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.899> start<00:00:37.200> indexing<00:00:37.710> in

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
is that when you start indexing in

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.170 
is that when you start indexing in
polling<00:00:38.190> colors<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.730> putting<00:00:38.969> them<00:00:39.090> all

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
polling colors and putting them all

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.910 
polling colors and putting them all
together<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> puzzle<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> dots

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
together it's like a puzzle so the dots

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.709 
together it's like a puzzle so the dots
print<00:00:41.219> next<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> dots<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> designs

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
print next to the dots so the designs

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.080 
print next to the dots so the designs
print<00:00:43.079> really<00:00:43.500> nicely<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.219> very<00:00:44.700> cleanly

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
print really nicely and very cleanly

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.209 
print really nicely and very cleanly
there<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.200> downside<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.070> for

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
there is the downside to it but for

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.470 
there is the downside to it but for
right<00:00:47.340> now<00:00:47.370> let's<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.879> talk<00:00:48.120> about<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
right now let's just talk about the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840 
right now let's just talk about the
upside<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.530> quirky<00:00:49.950> thing<00:00:50.129> about<00:00:50.309> Photoshop

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
upside one quirky thing about Photoshop

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.389 
upside one quirky thing about Photoshop
is<00:00:51.000> sometimes<00:00:51.360> it'll<00:00:51.570> it'll<00:00:52.140> display<00:00:52.949> an

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
is sometimes it'll it'll display an

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.580 
is sometimes it'll it'll display an
index<00:00:53.730> separation<00:00:54.300> pretty<00:00:54.510> grainy<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.050> that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
index separation pretty grainy and that

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.020 
index separation pretty grainy and that
is<00:00:55.770> really<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.039> display<00:00:56.520> problem<00:00:56.940> of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
is really the display problem of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.029 
is really the display problem of
photoshop<00:00:57.510> if<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.780> zoom<00:00:57.840> out<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.559> more<00:00:58.770> notch

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
photoshop if you zoom out one more notch

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.069 
photoshop if you zoom out one more notch
it<00:00:59.370> cleans<00:00:59.640> things<00:00:59.879> up<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.539> only<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
it cleans things up this is only the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.170 
it cleans things up this is only the
display<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.859> photoshop<00:01:02.399> because<00:01:03.090> you're

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
display in photoshop because you're

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.579 
display in photoshop because you're
going<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.539> getting<00:01:03.629> dot<00:01:04.019> gain<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.500> your

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
going to be getting dot gain and your

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.929 
going to be getting dot gain and your
dots<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.159> grow<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> little<00:01:05.580> bit<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
dots are going to grow a little bit and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.609 
dots are going to grow a little bit and
it's<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> be<00:01:06.360> pretty<00:01:06.479> cool<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.439> with

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it's going to be pretty cool so with

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.190 
it's going to be pretty cool so with
index<00:01:07.979> separations<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.420> good<00:01:09.659> news<00:01:09.930> is

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
index separations the good news is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.289 
index separations the good news is
they're<00:01:10.500> easy<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.950> print<00:01:11.250> they're<00:01:11.790> easy<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
they're easy to print they're easy to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.030 
they're easy to print they're easy to
separate<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.990> because<00:01:13.710> you're<00:01:13.890> actually

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
separate and because you're actually

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.770 
separate and because you're actually
going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> pull<00:01:14.580> colors<00:01:14.939> from<00:01:15.150> your<00:01:15.330> design

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
going to pull colors from your design

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.899 
going to pull colors from your design
and<00:01:16.080> not<00:01:16.650> let<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.860> program<00:01:17.340> determine<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and not let the program determine the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
and not let the program determine the
color<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.450> simulated<00:01:18.720> process<00:01:19.470> with

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
color is like simulated process with

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.990 
color is like simulated process with
indexing<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.280> design<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.820> would

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
indexing in this design like I would

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.240 
indexing in this design like I would
pull<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> red<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.810> blue<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.409> yellows<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.979> I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
pull the red the blue the yellows that I

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.920 
pull the red the blue the yellows that I
would<00:01:23.400> pull<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.759> actual<00:01:24.150> specific<00:01:24.750> color

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
would pull the actual specific color

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.960 
would pull the actual specific color
from<00:01:25.170> my<00:01:25.290> design<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.860> pick<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.400> that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
from my design and pick it and that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.340 
from my design and pick it and that
means<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.330> I'm<00:01:27.420> trying<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:27.840> Pantone

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
means if I'm trying to do Pantone

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.800 
means if I'm trying to do Pantone
matches<00:01:28.829> very<00:01:29.280> critical<00:01:29.850> images<00:01:30.299> indexing

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
matches very critical images indexing

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.569 
matches very critical images indexing
works<00:01:30.990> very<00:01:31.200> well<00:01:31.290> because<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.250> will<00:01:32.340> let<00:01:32.460> you

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
works very well because it will let you

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.560 
works very well because it will let you
nail<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.850> color<00:01:33.150> because<00:01:33.360> you're<00:01:33.479> actually

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
nail the color because you're actually

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.300 
nail the color because you're actually
going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> select<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> exact<00:01:34.890> color<00:01:35.070> from

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
going to select the exact color from

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.789 
going to select the exact color from
your<00:01:35.430> design<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.570> indexing<00:01:37.110> works<00:01:37.290> well<00:01:37.500> there

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
your design so indexing works well there

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.670 
your design so indexing works well there
the<00:01:38.670> other<00:01:38.790> thing<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.020> pixel

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
the other thing is because it's a pixel

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.490 
the other thing is because it's a pixel
and<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.700> not<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> halftone<00:01:42.630> dot<00:01:42.960> there's<00:01:43.350> no

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and it's not a halftone dot there's no

Marais<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:44.070> screen<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.060> one<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
Marais on your screen so one of the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.359 
Marais on your screen so one of the
claims<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.930> fame<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.380> indexing<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.009> there's<00:01:47.220> no

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
claims to fame of indexing is there's no

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.889 
claims to fame of indexing is there's no
Marais<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.000> little<00:01:48.119> tiny<00:01:48.270> square<00:01:48.659> dots

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
Marais it's just little tiny square dots

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.069 
Marais it's just little tiny square dots
now<00:01:49.740> these<00:01:49.860> dots<00:01:50.130> are<00:01:50.250> pretty<00:01:50.430> small<00:01:50.790> too<00:01:51.090> so

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
now these dots are pretty small too so

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.450 
now these dots are pretty small too so
they're<00:01:52.229> easy<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.560> print<00:01:52.770> gnome<00:01:53.189> array

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
they're easy to print gnome array

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
they're easy to print gnome array
indexing<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.149> widely<00:01:54.450> used<00:01:54.659> for<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.500> lot<00:01:55.860> of

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
indexing is widely used for a lot of

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.350 
indexing is widely used for a lot of
your<00:01:56.040> surfing<00:01:56.430> designs<00:01:56.759> because<00:01:56.969> not<00:01:57.329> only

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
your surfing designs because not only

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.240 
your surfing designs because not only
will<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.780> make<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.990> design<00:01:58.350> photo<00:01:58.829> realistic

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
will it make a design photo realistic

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.219 
will it make a design photo realistic
but<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.700> will<00:01:59.790> also<00:01:59.969> make<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> design<00:02:00.750> very<00:02:01.049> high

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
but it will also make a design very high

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.620 
but it will also make a design very high
contrast<00:02:01.799> as<00:02:02.040> an<00:02:02.579> example<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.149> could<00:02:03.329> take<00:02:03.479> this

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
contrast as an example I could take this

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.929

air show image that is kind of cartoony
and<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.149> could<00:02:06.329> pick<00:02:06.509> only<00:02:06.780> three<00:02:07.110> colors<00:02:07.530> and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
and I could pick only three colors and

it may not look like the original what
I'm<00:02:09.959> done<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.500> could<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> real<00:02:11.069> kind<00:02:11.580> of

kind of a look now the downside of

the<00:03:51.180> under<00:03:51.359> base<00:03:51.509> is<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.780> one<00:03:51.900> that<00:03:52.019> needs<00:03:52.079> to

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
the under base is the one that needs to

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.899 
the under base is the one that needs to
be<00:03:52.259> tweaked<00:03:52.650> as<00:03:52.829> an<00:03:52.919> example<00:03:53.310> here<00:03:53.669> we<00:03:53.759> have

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
be tweaked as an example here we have

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.059 
be tweaked as an example here we have
the<00:03:54.030> under<00:03:54.299> base<00:03:54.449> on<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.780> black<00:03:55.079> shirt<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:55.709> I

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
the under base on a black shirt and I

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.110 
the under base on a black shirt and I
think<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.370> under<00:03:56.549> base<00:03:56.669> could<00:03:56.879> be<00:03:56.939> a<00:03:56.970> little

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
think the under base could be a little

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.539 
think the under base could be a little
stronger<00:03:57.780> under<00:03:58.199> the<00:03:58.290> blue<00:03:58.560> now<00:03:59.280> in<00:03:59.459> a

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
stronger under the blue now in a

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.339 
stronger under the blue now in a
simulated<00:04:00.060> process<00:04:00.599> routine<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:00.930> could<00:04:01.199> take<00:04:01.319> a

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
simulated process routine I could take a

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.050 
simulated process routine I could take a
tone<00:04:01.590> curve<00:04:01.889> to<00:04:02.009> this<00:04:02.159> but<00:04:02.370> because<00:04:02.729> this<00:04:02.879> is

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
tone curve to this but because this is

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.899 
tone curve to this but because this is
indexed<00:04:03.629> I<00:04:03.810> am<00:04:03.989> stuck<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.769> so<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.489> hybrid

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
indexed I am stuck and so the hybrid

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.569 
indexed I am stuck and so the hybrid
routine<00:04:06.329> allows<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.409> to<00:04:07.650> do<00:04:07.859> a<00:04:07.889> halftone

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
routine allows you to do a halftone

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.520 
routine allows you to do a halftone
under<00:04:09.060> base<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.569> you<00:04:09.720> can<00:04:09.870> then<00:04:09.959> tweak<00:04:10.349> with

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
under base that you can then tweak with

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.920 
under base that you can then tweak with
a<00:04:10.590> tone<00:04:10.859> curve<00:04:11.189> and<00:04:11.459> indexing<00:04:12.389> for<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.629> colors

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
a tone curve and indexing for the colors

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.479 
a tone curve and indexing for the colors
because<00:04:13.229> indexing<00:04:13.650> does<00:04:13.859> give<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.189> fairly

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
because indexing does give you fairly

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.670 
because indexing does give you fairly
bright<00:04:14.819> prints<00:04:15.209> so<00:04:15.780> this<00:04:15.959> is<00:04:15.989> indexed<00:04:16.530> color

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
bright prints so this is indexed color

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.219 
bright prints so this is indexed color
here's<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.609> quirky<00:04:17.970> thing<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.329> must<00:04:18.780> check

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
here's the quirky thing you must check

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.430 
here's the quirky thing you must check
before<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.620> run<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:19.859> routine<00:04:20.269> you<00:04:21.269> must<00:04:21.630> look

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
before you run a routine you must look

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.440 
before you run a routine you must look

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
DPI now 225 is pretty fine that is a
