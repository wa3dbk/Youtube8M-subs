00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
curl pattern so if the curl pattern is

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.960 
curl pattern so if the curl pattern is
going<00:01:36.930> back<00:01:37.280> then<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.369> want<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.579> make<00:01:38.700> sure

that you roll the hair going back get

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.210 
that you roll the hair going back get
that<00:01:46.950> end
