00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.670

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.310
 it will appear as soon as you run 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 maynkravt example I run at Mycroft 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.869
 I got a pig I thought why 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.740
 would not be called a walking, let the bacon 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.590
 in more detail 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.020
 this is a pet that binds 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.690
 to you and he only your mind will walk with 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.329
 you are now by no means forever 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.610
 lost die nothing with him never 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.590
 will not happen besides the fact that he 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.440
 default nyashnye you can still 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.449
 change doing it in every way we press 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.000
 with a stick in his hand, right-click 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.739
 him and see here the next menu we 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.930
 can that here we can change it 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.120
 for example, let us have a zombie 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.079
 why not you can do so that we have 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.449
 iron Golem 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.659
 for those who love hardcore 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.479
 make yourself a bat inhabitant and even 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.570
 endermen even a sweater around here was 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.020
 or silverfish this little rat 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.270
 or lpg spider that's a twist and sometimes 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.250
 he will talk to you friends that 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.140
 actually very cool if you 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.479
 choose a specific skin 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.549
 Well, that is, for example, this rpd spider with 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.590
 why did you speak the country with me 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.360
 In fact, you can walk on such small ones 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.000
 creeper we scare our friends with this 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.670
 creeper but you can also change his name 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.890
 the name can either be removed completely or 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.710
 do something like a creeper 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.450
 here is such a name itself bit all of it 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.880
 now the name is creepers he will also 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.250
 walking with you is generally pretty cool 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.560
 fashion dress and it can not be well, I 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.290
 I think the shelf is easy to find to make 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.390
 change it to suit you 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.549
 Well, you can even make an ocelot from his 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.149
 small I will not show all but 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.670
 generally 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.200
 even gusta flying is generally cool 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.079
 looks like 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.210
 friends and another snowman here's a snowman 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.039
 name creeper why not friends why 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.679
 There is also no way to change it with 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.090
 using different foods but not just food 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.190
 for example, see we have a daytime 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.769
 meat we are so right on it 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.540
 mice with rotten meat and he became a zombie then 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.120
 there is all depends on the subject 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.400
 to which it refers iron for example 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.800
 he is busy with the iron golem and so on 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.720
 except he's just so cute 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.810
 here goes with you and you can ask yourself 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.760
 on the head yes it looks enough 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.950
 strange but nevertheless so it can 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.290
 transport and show off and in front 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.599
