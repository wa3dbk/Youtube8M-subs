right<00:00:01.850> basically<00:00:02.850> of<00:00:03.179> cornea<00:00:03.840> project<00:00:04.380> box

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
right basically of cornea project box

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.000 
right basically of cornea project box
here<00:00:05.490> there<00:00:06.450> have<00:00:06.569> put<00:00:06.839> two<00:00:09.290> little<00:00:10.290> terminals

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
here there have put two little terminals

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.340 
here there have put two little terminals
on<00:00:11.809> I've<00:00:12.809> got<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> battery<00:00:13.650> year<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.820> which<00:00:15.120> I

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
on I've got a battery year of which I

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.420 
on I've got a battery year of which I
took<00:00:16.350> out<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.770> GPS<00:00:17.220> system<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.820> broken<00:00:19.430> ID

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
took out of a GPS system that broken ID

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.529 
took out of a GPS system that broken ID
soldered<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.510> charging<00:00:22.350> circuit<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:24.300> just

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
soldered the charging circuit and I just

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.420 
soldered the charging circuit and I just
hooked<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.960> up<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.410> battery

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
hooked it up to the battery

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.990 
hooked it up to the battery
direct<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:29.400> same<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.029> nakiye<00:00:30.449> battery

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
direct the same with this nakiye battery

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.889 
direct the same with this nakiye battery
and<00:00:33.000> now<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> battery<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:35.899> it

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and now this is on the battery here it

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.500 
and now this is on the battery here it
seemed<00:00:37.140> not<00:00:37.320> much<00:00:37.829> too<00:00:38.040> much<00:00:38.219> hassle<00:00:38.480> so<00:00:39.480> I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
seemed not much too much hassle so I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.190 
seemed not much too much hassle so I
just<00:00:39.840> took<00:00:39.989> dump<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> person<00:00:40.860> monitors

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
just took dump to the person monitors

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.520 
just took dump to the person monitors
now<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.770> never<00:00:44.190> even<00:00:44.340> considered<00:00:44.670> putting

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
now what I never even considered putting

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.000 
now what I never even considered putting
diodes<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.800> them<00:00:47.120> so<00:00:48.140> I'm<00:00:49.140> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.500> now<00:00:49.710> is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
diodes on them so I'm going to do now is

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.110 
diodes on them so I'm going to do now is
put<00:00:50.969> diodes<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:55.010> basically<00:00:56.010> make<00:00:56.760> him<00:00:56.969> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
put diodes on and basically make him a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.720 
put diodes on and basically make him a
lot<00:00:57.300> safer<00:00:57.600> because<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.559> I've<00:00:58.800> sinned<00:00:59.579> them

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
lot safer because that I've sinned them

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.130 
lot safer because that I've sinned them
when<00:00:59.969> they<00:01:00.149> actually<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.809> explode<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:03.140> they

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
when they actually do explode and they

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.520 
when they actually do explode and they
do<00:01:04.199> go<00:01:04.589> with<00:01:04.890> quite<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> bang<00:01:05.960> but<00:01:06.960> before<00:01:07.350> do

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
do go with quite a bang but before do

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.200 
do go with quite a bang but before do
that<00:01:07.710> I'll<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.130> show<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> voltage<00:01:08.700> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
that I'll just show you the voltage of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.920 
that I'll just show you the voltage of
where<00:01:10.049> I've<00:01:10.200> got<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.710> from<00:01:10.890> these<00:01:11.580> three

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
where I've got just from these three

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.399 
where I've got just from these three
batteries<00:01:14.000> right<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.270> voltage<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.229> get

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
batteries right the voltage so I can get

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.530 
batteries right the voltage so I can get
from<00:01:16.619> these<00:01:16.799> are<00:01:17.189> batteries<00:01:17.700> are<00:01:20.540> thirteen

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
from these are batteries are thirteen

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.280 
from these are batteries are thirteen
point<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.549> five<00:01:24.409> point<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:25.680> four<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:27.290> okay

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
point one five point one four and okay

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.890 
point one five point one four and okay
and<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.310> run<00:01:29.520> basically<00:01:30.329> anything<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and you can run basically anything you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.450 
and you can run basically anything you
can<00:01:31.170> run<00:01:31.320> off<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.560> car<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:32.100> them<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:34.250> it<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
can run off a car on them and like it is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.870 
can run off a car on them and like it is
uh<00:01:36.470> I<00:01:37.470> think<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.950> averages<00:01:38.490> ahead<00:01:38.820> attacked

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
uh I think the averages ahead attacked

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.469 
uh I think the averages ahead attacked
one<00:01:41.880> point<00:01:42.600> four<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:44.450> powers<00:01:47.180> she's<00:01:48.180> great

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
one point four and powers she's great

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.490 
one point four and powers she's great
now<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.990> make<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.200> safer<00:01:50.720> I'm<00:01:51.720> gonna<00:01:51.960> work<00:01:52.229> put

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
now to make it safer I'm gonna work put

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.800 
now to make it safer I'm gonna work put
three<00:01:53.100> diodes<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:56.210> make<00:01:57.210> sure<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.689> we

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
three diodes on it and make sure that we

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.580 
three diodes on it and make sure that we
don't<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.200> any<00:01:59.119> voltage<00:02:00.119> seepage<00:02:01.049> back

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
don't get any voltage seepage back

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.210 
don't get any voltage seepage back
towards<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.759> batteries<00:02:05.000> I've<00:02:06.000> recovered

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
towards you the batteries I've recovered

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.359 
towards you the batteries I've recovered
three<00:02:08.220> diodes

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
three diodes

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.490 
three diodes
from<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:10.000> circuit<00:02:10.539> board<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:10.989> had<00:02:11.110> lying<00:02:11.379> around

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
from a circuit board I had lying around

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.960 
from a circuit board I had lying around
and<00:02:13.049> I'm<00:02:14.049> gonna<00:02:14.200> put<00:02:14.470> these<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.890> line<00:02:16.680> here

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and I'm gonna put these in line here

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.780 
and I'm gonna put these in line here
here<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.239> here<00:02:19.659> and<00:02:21.599> I<00:02:22.599> think<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:23.049> all<00:02:23.349> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
here and here and I think that all the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.449 
here and here and I think that all the
stop<00:02:24.790> many<00:02:25.030> problems<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.989> which<00:02:26.409> may<00:02:27.250> have

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
stop many problems of which may have

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:34.949 
stop many problems of which may have
occurred<00:02:29.519> so<00:02:30.519> I'll<00:02:30.670> do<00:02:30.879> that<00:02:30.909> name<00:02:33.510> Ralph<00:02:34.510> but

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
occurred so I'll do that name Ralph but

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.080 
occurred so I'll do that name Ralph but
all<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.260> yet<00:02:35.500> Diane's<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.280> which<00:02:36.459> i<00:02:36.640> think<00:02:36.849> is

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
all the yet Diane's in which i think is

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.050 
all the yet Diane's in which i think is
a<00:02:37.120> quick<00:02:37.510> manner<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:41.250> am<00:02:42.250> getting<00:02:42.730> a

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
a quick manner and I am getting a

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.349 
a quick manner and I am getting a
reading<00:02:43.709> when<00:02:44.709> I<00:02:44.739> would<00:02:45.010> do<00:02:45.220> put<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.760> the

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
reading when I would do put the the

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.089 
reading when I would do put the the
probes<00:02:46.660> in<00:02:48.720> now<00:02:49.720> we<00:02:49.780> are<00:02:50.200> getting<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.620> voltage

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
probes in now we are getting a voltage

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.839 
probes in now we are getting a voltage
drop<00:02:51.489> of<00:02:51.730> point<00:02:52.690> six<00:02:53.069> of<00:02:54.069> which<00:02:54.310> we<00:02:54.609> would

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
drop of point six of which we would

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:02.369 
drop of point six of which we would
expect<00:02:58.470> running<00:02:59.470> diodes<00:02:59.950> in<00:03:00.190> there<00:03:01.379> so

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
expect running diodes in there so

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.270 
expect running diodes in there so
forgetting<00:03:02.799> that<00:03:03.040> twelve<00:03:03.430> point<00:03:03.819> one<00:03:04.530> for<00:03:05.530> now

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.649 

so<00:03:09.280> I'm<00:03:09.879> just<00:03:10.000> going<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.239> pull<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.599> back

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
so I'm just going to pull this back

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.099 
so I'm just going to pull this back
together<00:03:11.019> again<00:03:11.409> and<00:03:11.879> I<00:03:12.879> feel<00:03:13.510> safer<00:03:14.079> that

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
together again and I feel safer that

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:19.190 
together again and I feel safer that
it's<00:03:14.349> not<00:03:14.530> gonna<00:03:14.680> go<00:03:15.459> up<00:03:16.180> in<00:03:16.359> flames

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.509 

so<00:03:20.200> I'm<00:03:20.260> just<00:03:20.349> going<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.620> took<00:03:20.769> it<00:03:20.950> all<00:03:21.069> in<00:03:21.280> and

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
so I'm just going to took it all in and

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:28.050 
so I'm just going to took it all in and
then<00:03:22.829> close<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:23.889> box<00:03:24.130> up<00:03:26.190> Ron<00:03:27.190> she<00:03:27.609> can<00:03:27.760> put<00:03:28.030> a

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
then close the box up Ron she can put a

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.259 
then close the box up Ron she can put a
bit<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.540> insulation<00:03:29.169> tape<00:03:29.650> around<00:03:30.069> that<00:03:30.790> diode

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
bit of insulation tape around that diode

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:40.010 
bit of insulation tape around that diode
that<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:32.349> word<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:33.099> that<00:03:34.000> diode<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:35.280> then

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:48.430 

we<00:03:40.650> get<00:03:40.890> like<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.130> decent<00:03:41.640> reading<00:03:42.000> off<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:46.970> 12

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
we get like a decent reading off this 12

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.810 
we get like a decent reading off this 12
116<00:03:50.750> okay<00:03:51.780> maybe<00:03:52.530> free<00:03:52.890> charged<00:03:53.310> up<00:03:53.520> a<00:03:53.640> bit

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
116 okay maybe free charged up a bit

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.220 
116 okay maybe free charged up a bit
more<00:03:54.000> will<00:03:54.300> get<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.660> bit<00:03:54.870> more<00:03:55.080> out<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.620> but<00:03:56.220> I

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
more will get a bit more out of it but I

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.570 
more will get a bit more out of it but I
dropped<00:03:58.230> with<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.380> installation<00:03:59.070> type<00:03:59.310> on

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
dropped with the installation type on

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.270 
dropped with the installation type on
I'm<00:04:00.300> going<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.600> put<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.800> all<00:04:01.890> back<00:04:02.100> together

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
I'm going to put it all back together

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.110 
I'm going to put it all back together
again

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
again

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.640 
again
and<00:04:05.840> fit<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.870> lot<00:04:07.200> safer<00:04:08.990> it's<00:04:09.990> all<00:04:10.170> been<00:04:10.380> put

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
and fit a lot safer it's all been put

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.420 
and fit a lot safer it's all been put
back<00:04:10.860> together<00:04:11.190> again<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:13.130> I'm<00:04:14.130> going<00:04:14.340> to

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
back together again and I'm going to

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.930 
back together again and I'm going to
charge<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:15.090> there<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.920> see<00:04:16.920> how<00:04:17.130> are<00:04:17.460> you<00:04:17.730> we

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
charge this there and see how are you we

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.250 
charge this there and see how are you we
actually<00:04:18.060> can<00:04:18.780> charge<00:04:19.200> this<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:20.630> do<00:04:21.630> know<00:04:22.020> that

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
actually can charge this I do know that

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.960 
actually can charge this I do know that
there's<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.620> year<00:04:22.830> point<00:04:23.130> six<00:04:23.490> voltage<00:04:24.450> drop

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
there's a year point six voltage drop

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.140 
there's a year point six voltage drop
through<00:04:26.970> each<00:04:27.270> diode<00:04:28.220> so<00:04:31.670> hopefully<00:04:32.670> we<00:04:32.940> can

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
through each diode so hopefully we can

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.500 
through each diode so hopefully we can
get<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.390> back<00:04:33.570> up<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.870> being<00:04:34.230> at<00:04:34.800> least<00:04:35.510> twelve

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
get it back up to being at least twelve

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.030 
get it back up to being at least twelve
point<00:04:36.810> five<00:04:37.080> or<00:04:38.030> thereabouts
