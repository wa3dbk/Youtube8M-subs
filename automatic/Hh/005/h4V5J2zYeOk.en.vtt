00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
being blue to headphones but they turned

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.460 
being blue to headphones but they turned
out<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.370> be<00:00:54.520> pretty<00:00:55.059> light<00:00:55.270> if<00:00:56.080> you're<00:00:56.290> gonna

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
period of time the light weight is

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.770 
period of time the light weight is
definitely<00:01:00.280> gonna<00:01:00.460> be<00:01:00.820> in<00:01:01.059> importance<00:01:01.540> to<00:01:01.660> you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
really soft so again they should offer

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.580 
really soft so again they should offer
good<00:01:06.070> comfort<00:01:06.550> for<00:01:06.880> long<00:01:06.940> periods<00:01:07.540> of<00:01:07.720> usage

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
so connecting these bluetooth headphones

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.930 
so connecting these bluetooth headphones
wasn't<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.140> problem<00:01:11.500> I<00:01:12.040> kicked<00:01:12.340> him<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.550> a<00:01:12.670> Mac

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
wasn't a problem I kicked him to a Mac

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.420 
wasn't a problem I kicked him to a Mac
and<00:01:13.150> also<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.750> me<00:01:13.840> iPhone<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.680> do<00:01:14.860> have<00:01:14.890> NFC

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
and also to me iPhone the do have NFC

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.610 
and also to me iPhone the do have NFC
built-in<00:01:16.090> which<00:01:16.390> helps<00:01:16.960> connect<00:01:17.409> the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
built-in which helps connect the

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.649 
built-in which helps connect the
headphones<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.760> a<00:01:18.790> device<00:01:19.120> a<00:01:19.150> lot<00:01:19.420> quicker

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
headphones to a device a lot quicker

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.720 
headphones to a device a lot quicker
these<00:01:20.409> headphones<00:01:20.620> also<00:01:21.040> do<00:01:21.370> come<00:01:21.610> where

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
these headphones also do come where

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.730 
these headphones also do come where
while<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.480> is<00:01:22.600> pretty<00:01:22.810> good<00:01:23.050> if<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.560> ever

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
while this is pretty good if you ever

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.170 
while this is pretty good if you ever
won't<00:01:23.980> run<00:01:24.130> out<00:01:24.220> of<00:01:24.250> a<00:01:24.370> battery<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:24.970> you<00:01:25.000> need

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
won't run out of a battery and you need

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.520 
won't run out of a battery and you need
to<00:01:25.240> still<00:01:25.420> use<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.659> headphones<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.290> don't

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
to still use the headphones you don't

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.660 
to still use the headphones you don't
have<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:26.680> wait<00:01:26.800> for<00:01:26.950> them<00:01:27.040> to<00:01:27.100> be<00:01:27.190> charged<00:01:27.520> up

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
have to wait for them to be charged up

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.010 
have to wait for them to be charged up
that's<00:01:28.030> pretty<00:01:28.270> good<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.510> can<00:01:28.540> use<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:28.840> white

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
that's pretty good you can use the white

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.750 
that's pretty good you can use the white
if<00:01:29.170> need<00:01:29.380> be<00:01:29.409> and<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:30.100> wire<00:01:30.250> will<00:01:30.430> probably

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
if need be and the wire will probably

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.010 
if need be and the wire will probably
give<00:01:30.880> you<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.030> little<00:01:31.180> bit<00:01:31.360> better<00:01:31.540> audio

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
give you a little bit better audio

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.840 
give you a little bit better audio
quality<00:01:32.230> though<00:01:33.010> I<00:01:33.040> can't<00:01:33.340> imagine<00:01:33.460> I'll<00:01:33.820> be

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
quality though I can't imagine I'll be

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.060 
quality though I can't imagine I'll be
using<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.180> wire<00:01:34.330> too<00:01:34.750> often<00:01:35.080> so<00:01:35.800> now<00:01:35.890> let's

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
using the wire too often so now let's

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.560 
using the wire too often so now let's
have<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.190> look<00:01:36.310> at<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.430> buttons<00:01:36.760> and<00:01:36.970> parts<00:01:37.420> on
