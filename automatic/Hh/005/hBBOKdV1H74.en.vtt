it's an optical illusion you can
actually<00:00:42.250> see<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.820> time<00:00:43.030> now<00:00:43.570> we<00:00:43.780> are<00:00:43.900> hard<00:00:44.110> to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
actually see the time now we are hard to

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.590 
actually see the time now we are hard to
do<00:00:44.409> here<00:00:44.830> on<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.370> screen<00:00:45.580> with<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.150> lighting

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
you're for problems seeing the optical

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.430 
you're for problems seeing the optical
illusion<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.850> just<00:00:52.089> touch<00:00:52.330> the<00:00:52.570> B<00:00:52.750> quadrant

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
illusion you just touch the B quadrant

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.710 
illusion you just touch the B quadrant
on<00:00:53.589> the<00:00:53.739> screen<00:00:54.070> and<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.940> time<00:00:55.180> shows<00:00:55.390> up<00:00:55.540> it's

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
on the screen and the time shows up it's

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.200 
on the screen and the time shows up it's
now<00:00:55.839> 554<00:00:56.769> so<00:00:57.339> we<00:00:57.610> want<00:00:57.790> to<00:00:57.850> show<00:00:57.940> you<00:00:58.030> some

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.789 
now 554 so we want to show you some
other<00:00:58.269> functions<00:00:58.809> here<00:00:58.989> it<00:00:59.229> also<00:00:59.379> has<00:00:59.650> the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:00:59.799 
other functions here it also has the

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:01.350 
other functions here it also has the
date<00:01:00.010> I'm<00:01:00.190> going<00:01:00.250> to<00:01:00.400> touch<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.790> upper<00:01:01.089> right

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
date I'm going to touch the upper right

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.109 
date I'm going to touch the upper right
hand<00:01:01.570> corner<00:01:02.190> 12-9<00:01:03.190> december<00:01:03.699> nine<00:01:03.850> that's

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
hand corner 12-9 december nine that's

hand corner 12-9 december nine that's
today's<00:01:04.449> date<00:01:04.780> so<00:01:05.290> basically<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.190> screen<00:01:06.460> is

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
today's date so basically the screen is

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.120 
today's date so basically the screen is
divided<00:01:07.150> into<00:01:07.330> four<00:01:07.600> quadrants<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.830> sea

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
divided into four quadrants the sea

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.100 
divided into four quadrants the sea
quadrant<00:01:09.640> over<00:01:09.760> here<00:01:09.940> is<00:01:10.000> a<00:01:10.030> light<00:01:10.330> real<00:01:10.840> hard

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
quadrant over here is a light real hard

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.420 
quadrant over here is a light real hard
to<00:01:11.260> see<00:01:11.440> because<00:01:11.619> there's<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:12.010> lot<00:01:12.040> of<00:01:12.130> light<00:01:12.400> in

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
to see because there's a lot of light in

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.219 
to see because there's a lot of light in
the<00:01:12.700> room<00:01:12.729> but<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.119> has<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.270> backlight<00:01:13.840> on<00:01:13.869> it

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
the room but it has a backlight on it

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.469 
the room but it has a backlight on it
and<00:01:14.380> then<00:01:15.039> in<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.430> upper<00:01:15.820> left-hand<00:01:16.240> quadrant

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
and then in the upper left-hand quadrant

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.510 
and then in the upper left-hand quadrant
what<00:01:17.049> would<00:01:17.170> their<00:01:17.439> calling<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.890> D<00:01:18.159> button

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
what would their calling the D button

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.670 
what would their calling the D button

might<00:01:33.460> be<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.700> little<00:01:33.820> bit<00:01:34.000> easier<00:01:34.149> to<00:01:34.329> see<00:01:34.420> the

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
might be a little bit easier to see the

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.630 
might be a little bit easier to see the
optical<00:01:35.109> illusion<00:01:35.140> stare<00:01:35.979> at<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.189> screen<00:01:36.369> all

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
optical illusion stare at the screen all

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.190 
optical illusion stare at the screen all
the<00:01:36.700> way<00:01:36.880> over<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.299> left<00:01:37.390> just<00:01:37.719> stare<00:01:38.109> at

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
the way over to the left just stare at

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.080 
the way over to the left just stare at
that<00:01:38.320> pattern<00:01:38.770> do<00:01:39.189> numbers<00:01:39.490> come<00:01:39.729> out<00:01:39.820> at<00:01:39.999> you

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
that pattern do numbers come out at you

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.029 
that pattern do numbers come out at you
can<00:01:40.299> you<00:01:40.390> see<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.719> time<00:01:40.960> that's<00:01:41.619> what<00:01:41.799> you<00:01:41.920> can

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
can you see the time that's what you can

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.289 
can you see the time that's what you can
do<00:01:42.100> with<00:01:42.219> the<00:01:42.310> watch<00:01:42.460> if<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:42.789> keep<00:01:42.999> staring

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
do with the watch if you keep staring

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.289 
do with the watch if you keep staring
will<00:01:43.719> reveal<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.229> did<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.890> get<00:01:45.039> 12<00:01:45.340> 47<00:01:45.670> then

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
will reveal it did you get 12 47 then

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.239 
will reveal it did you get 12 47 then
you<00:01:46.570> got<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:46.929> right<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:47.590> that's<00:01:47.859> the<00:01:48.009> way<00:01:48.100> this

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
you got it right so that's the way this

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:49.679 
you got it right so that's the way this
watch<00:01:48.490> works<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:48.969> pretty<00:01:49.240> cool<00:01:49.450> optical

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
watch works a pretty cool optical

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.139 
watch works a pretty cool optical
illusion<00:01:50.469> so<00:01:50.799> these<00:01:50.890> tokyoflash<00:01:51.369> watches

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
illusion so these tokyoflash watches

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.459 
illusion so these tokyoflash watches
really<00:01:52.450> make<00:01:52.569> a<00:01:52.600> great<00:01:52.929> gift<00:01:53.079> when<00:01:53.380> you're

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
really make a great gift when you're

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.260 
really make a great gift when you're
looking<00:01:53.679> for<00:01:53.740> something<00:01:54.340> different<00:01:54.850> that

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
looking for something different that

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.429 
looking for something different that
you're<00:01:55.390> not<00:01:55.479> going<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.719> see<00:01:55.899> all<00:01:56.020> over<00:01:56.289> these

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
you're not going to see all over these

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.319 
you're not going to see all over these
are<00:01:56.619> limited-edition<00:01:56.850> they<00:01:57.850> do<00:01:57.909> come<00:01:58.299> from

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
are limited-edition they do come from

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.480 
are limited-edition they do come from
Japan<00:01:58.630> they<00:01:59.590> do<00:01:59.649> get<00:02:00.100> pretty<00:02:00.249> quickly

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
Japan they do get pretty quickly

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.859 
Japan they do get pretty quickly
though<00:02:00.640> so<00:02:00.939> that<00:02:01.090> was<00:02:01.240> good<00:02:01.359> about<00:02:01.479> five

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
though so that was good about five

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.870 
though so that was good about five
businesses<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.710> can<00:02:02.829> get<00:02:02.979> it<00:02:03.130> and<00:02:03.280> what's

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
businesses you can get it and what's

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.160 
businesses you can get it and what's
neat<00:02:04.060> about<00:02:04.090> this<00:02:04.299> is<00:02:04.479> that<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.869> was<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:04.990> real

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
neat about this is that it was a real

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.719 
neat about this is that it was a real
engineering<00:02:05.679> challenge<00:02:06.189> they<00:02:06.340> talked<00:02:06.549> about

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
engineering challenge they talked about

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.040 
engineering challenge they talked about
on<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.909> website<00:02:07.299> here<00:02:07.509> in<00:02:07.569> well<00:02:07.719> but<00:02:07.869> linked

segments required to make this most
complex<00:02:12.280> watch<00:02:12.610> took<00:02:13.180> them<00:02:13.300> 12<00:02:13.569> months<00:02:13.840> of

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
complex watch took them 12 months of

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.720 
complex watch took them 12 months of
research<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.740> sells<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.400> about<00:02:15.520> one

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
research to do it sells for about one

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.430 
research to do it sells for about one
hundred<00:02:15.790> ninety<00:02:16.270> nine<00:02:16.420> dollars<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.019> not<00:02:17.230> bad

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
hundred ninety nine dollars so not bad

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.000 
hundred ninety nine dollars so not bad
for<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.860> really<00:02:18.129> pretty<00:02:18.430> fancy<00:02:18.849> watch<00:02:19.030> with<00:02:19.299> a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
for a really pretty fancy watch with a

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.220 
for a really pretty fancy watch with a
the<00:02:20.159> very<00:02:20.340> interesting<00:02:20.970> design<00:02:21.239> element<00:02:21.750> and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
the very interesting design element and

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.750 
the very interesting design element and
all<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.650> specifications<00:02:22.980> over<00:02:23.549> here<00:02:23.730> a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
all the specifications over here a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.059 
all the specifications over here a
little<00:02:23.909> bit<00:02:24.030> heavy<00:02:24.269> about<00:02:24.510> 160<00:02:25.230> grams<00:02:25.470> is

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
little bit heavy about 160 grams is

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.979 
little bit heavy about 160 grams is
water<00:02:26.370> resistant<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:26.939> about<00:02:27.150> ninety<00:02:27.510> six<00:02:27.750> feet

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
water resistant to about ninety six feet

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.110 
water resistant to about ninety six feet
so<00:02:28.230> that's<00:02:28.409> pretty<00:02:28.650> good<00:02:28.829> time<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.610> always<00:02:29.790> on

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
so that's pretty good time is always on

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.000 
so that's pretty good time is always on
and<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.659> your<00:02:30.780> eyes<00:02:30.959> can<00:02:31.260> be<00:02:31.439> trained<00:02:31.739> you'll

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
and if your eyes can be trained you'll

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.920 
and if your eyes can be trained you'll
see<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.489> not<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.150> press<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.750> B

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
see it if not you just press in the B

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.020 
see it if not you just press in the B
button<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.709> will<00:02:34.739> show<00:02:35.040> up<00:02:35.069> there<00:02:35.459> the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
button and it will show up there the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.190 
button and it will show up there the
other<00:02:36.150> neat<00:02:36.329> thing<00:02:36.480> about<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.810> was<00:02:36.840> how<00:02:37.049> it

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
other neat thing about it was how it

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.259 
other neat thing about it was how it
came<00:02:37.349> about<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:38.069> was<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> contest<00:02:38.879> they<00:02:39.060> had

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
came about this was a contest they had

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.030 
came about this was a contest they had
and<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:39.870> one<00:02:40.019> was<00:02:40.140> picked<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.709> then<00:02:40.950> they

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
and this one was picked and then they

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.619 
and this one was picked and then they
developed<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.579> so<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.760> pretty<00:02:42.000> neat<00:02:42.180> way<00:02:42.420> that

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
developed it so a pretty neat way that

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.930 
developed it so a pretty neat way that
they<00:02:42.750> actually<00:02:43.019> build<00:02:43.319> these<00:02:43.470> watches<00:02:44.040> back

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
they actually build these watches back

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.580 
they actually build these watches back
showing<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.420> optical<00:02:45.810> illusion<00:02:46.140> watch<00:02:46.319> again

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
showing the optical illusion watch again

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.349 
showing the optical illusion watch again
so<00:02:46.799> it's<00:02:47.159> got<00:02:47.370> an<00:02:47.459> interesting<00:02:47.700> look<00:02:48.000> for<00:02:48.209> it's

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
so it's got an interesting look for it's

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.059 
so it's got an interesting look for it's
obviously<00:02:48.690> not<00:02:48.810> for<00:02:49.200> everyone<00:02:49.409> to<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.739> very

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
obviously not for everyone to be very

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.649 
obviously not for everyone to be very
large<00:02:50.280> for<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> woman<00:02:50.939> this<00:02:51.030> would<00:02:51.269> really<00:02:51.540> only

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
large for a woman this would really only

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.440 
large for a woman this would really only
be<00:02:51.930> worn<00:02:52.109> by<00:02:52.260> mamus<00:02:52.709> it's<00:02:52.859> a<00:02:52.920> large<00:02:53.099> size<00:02:53.459> but

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
be worn by mamus it's a large size but

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.180 
be worn by mamus it's a large size but
join<00:02:54.659> it<00:02:54.780> here<00:02:54.989> it's<00:02:55.170> stainless<00:02:55.470> steel<00:02:55.890> both

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
join it here it's stainless steel both
