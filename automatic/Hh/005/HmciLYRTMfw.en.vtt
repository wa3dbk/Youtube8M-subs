00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.900 
the gift of the unrepentant
is<00:02:55.330> abhorrent<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.900> guard

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.809 

many<00:02:59.420> people<00:02:59.630> think<00:03:00.050> that<00:03:00.520> King

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.120 

was<00:03:04.390> unrepentant<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:05.260> sin<00:03:05.819> which<00:03:06.819> is<00:03:06.999> why<00:03:07.209> God

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
was unrepentant of sin which is why God

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.630 
was unrepentant of sin which is why God
rejected<00:03:09.060> his<00:03:09.240> offering<00:03:09.720> not

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
rejected his offering not

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.750 
rejected his offering not
as<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:11.030> was<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.540> grain<00:03:12.230> offering<00:03:12.740> but<00:03:13.370> because

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
as it was a grain offering but because

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.059 
as it was a grain offering but because
Cain<00:03:14.060> was<00:03:14.330> unrepentant<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:15.170> sin

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.270 

can<00:03:20.730> we<00:03:20.939> afford<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.629> have<00:03:21.749> God<00:03:22.170> reject<00:03:22.980> that

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
can we afford to have God reject that

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.730 
can we afford to have God reject that
which<00:03:23.489> we<00:03:23.700> do

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.260 

but<00:03:28.250> so<00:03:28.460> many<00:03:28.580> people<00:03:29.000> do<00:03:29.180> because

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
but so many people do because

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.760 
but so many people do because
they<00:03:31.780> allows<00:03:32.170> sin<00:03:32.710> on<00:03:32.980> their<00:03:33.880> lives<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.770> they

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
they allows sin on their lives and they

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.560 
they allows sin on their lives and they
allow<00:03:36.070> their<00:03:36.310> sin<00:03:36.670> against<00:03:37.030> their<00:03:37.180> brother<00:03:37.390> or

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
allow their sin against their brother or

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:44.640 
allow their sin against their brother or
sister<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.970> persist

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.309 

and<00:03:44.769> making<00:03:45.579> peace<00:03:45.819> is<00:03:46.060> not<00:03:46.269> strictly<00:03:46.720> saying

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
and making peace is not strictly saying

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.309 
and making peace is not strictly saying
I'm<00:03:47.620> sorry<00:03:48.150> but<00:03:49.150> it's<00:03:49.299> correcting<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.930> damage

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
I'm sorry but it's correcting the damage

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.990 
I'm sorry but it's correcting the damage

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.920 

many<00:03:56.960> people<00:03:57.350> don't<00:03:57.530> want<00:03:57.860> to<00:03:58.150> accept<00:03:59.150> God's

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930

standard<00:04:00.470> of<00:04:00.590> holiness

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.820 

and<00:04:03.470> God<00:04:04.100> understands<00:04:04.760> where<00:04:05.030> you're<00:04:05.210> at

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.780 

because<00:04:08.580> if<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.820> don't<00:04:08.970> accept<00:04:09.420> it

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.910

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.140 

once<00:04:37.450> we've<00:04:37.750> had<00:04:37.990> repentance

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
once we've had repentance

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.100 
once we've had repentance
and<00:04:40.800> Reconciliation<00:04:42.390> revival<00:04:43.390> is<00:04:43.480> a<00:04:43.510> natural
