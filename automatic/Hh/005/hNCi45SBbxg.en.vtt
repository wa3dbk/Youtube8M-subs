00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.549
 cause two friends to start in maya 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.060
 you have nothing 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.790
 very, very big things 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.420
 your clicks 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.420
 you have to get out of the water 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.050
 shit shit that's why we're about 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.050
 new from minecraft 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.910
 it's hard 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.629
 As you know, we die once a night 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.550
 those criteria come from me those zombies 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.160
 and the truth that I can not stand that's 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.870
 that paralysis 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.870
 because these are passed 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.310
 haiti things so tared 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.110
 today we are in a new episode 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.110
 from minecraft 09 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.860
 trying to be able to overcome the limits of 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.860
 Minecraft 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.860
 I'm pretty 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.200
 but we're never going to find it in this 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.380
 world 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.520
 you have to take something yes because if you do not get 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.520
 nothing you will not find anything 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.310
 and later these birds with their visits 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.149
 as he taught us they know that the main thing 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.869
 to get many things is a wood 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:45.990
 the wood always serves and never never and 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.990
 I never discard wood for something when fart 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.400
 well then we will continue with others 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:57.170

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:17.019
