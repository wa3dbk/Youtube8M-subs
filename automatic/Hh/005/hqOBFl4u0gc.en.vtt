00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.260
 Beschi 

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:10.910
 beautiful all guys here go 97 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.690
 remains in the queue by itself welcome to this 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.849
 new video 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.390
 today I am a cook in a black gameplay 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.890
 ops 2 a game played with a weapon 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.380
 a submachine gun to be precise 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.349
 really very particular that is called 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.810
 who with cqb or shea comic cubes like 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.279
 prefer the pronunciation this 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.470
 machine gun is a submachine gun 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.739
 semiautomatic that shoots in bursts like 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.570
 you can see six hits each 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.490
 however it can become really devastating 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.320
 an advice that I give you immediately for 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.390
 use it and press the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.340
 trigger practically consecutively 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.110
 becomes a kind of weapon between 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.600
 almost automatic quotes because they do not 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.310
 fire and quickly a wrong one of fire 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.430
 really very high you see it seems almost 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.530
 an automatic rifle when it disappeared 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.050
 quickly with the button for example 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.510
 of the player1 the trigger precisely the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.290
 really a very very thing 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.720
 essential to make the best use 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.970
 this weapon immediately showed the game 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.539
 that a game is actually played on with 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.130
 this weapon with a mode really 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.649
 very particular that is called 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.249
 new mode station introduced 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.899
 from the treyarch and on the carli map 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.939
 load a map of the most open of the 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.859
 game is one of the most loved too but 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.840
 even more hate for what reason you 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.579
 I say this because first of all often 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.560
 maybe we happen to be on the street 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.469
 to be killed by a sniper that camper 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.119
 in those structures in blico form where 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.619
 you put the snipers just check the 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.840
 head as you see these few eyelashes 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.850
 before many times it happens to die from 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.770
 there a few streaks and therefore hate each other 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.119
 this map for that though a 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.490
 I advise you to succeed in 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.439
 wander around the perimeter of the map in 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.569
 so as to shake these snai for i 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.429
 campers that are there or in other areas 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.109
 of the map and take them from behind one 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.310
 time you take rewards like 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.619
 see what he had in this game 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.959
 cold indeed so many kg in fact 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.849
 this game very few that the con 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.529
 the weapon but many indeed those 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:03.200
 reward valid rewards that stands 

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:04.700
 using were the all star who 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.399
 travels that don't know it is a species 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.649
 of reaper but much more powerful bmw between is 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.569
 much like that i really sparaco rockets 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.480
 devastating used the medium vito the 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.780
 which is a machine-gun one that yes 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.459
 commands and then uses vicani that su 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.140
 this map is not fundamental I would have 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.209
 could have put it jean but i hadn't 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.050
 in time to change the rewards first 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.510
 of the game I played with the phrase of 16 17 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.950
 that I greet you now I will show you 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.870
 first or two tips 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.489
 I want three on this location mode 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.440
 which is just as new as I told you before 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.349
 in practice it consists of a kind of 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.599
 headquarters the location exposes 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.150
 rai in various points of the map always 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.190
 generated not randomly but with a 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.380
 precise order 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.579
 as long as you are the first if you are i 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.280
 first you to conquer this 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.319
 you will take 200 points or 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.700
 if the enemies will conquer you 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.010
 centered kill all friends 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.470
 then take another 200 points then 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.910
 one thing I recommend is to take the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.010
 station then off all your 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.959
 team mates to go out make them 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.569
 conquer enemies entering first 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.180
 then kill them all to make 200 points 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.769
 in fact if on youtube you see there are 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.940
 really good gameplay especially 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.280
 on this mode 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.600
 meanwhile you see my seven feeds with 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.180
 praise stark really a reward 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.620
 devastating to very high damage 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.109
 compared to the shelter of love we trike a 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.700
 sometimes he often made these markers 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.500
 really devastating part this with 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.150
 Shrapnel clicking all the others 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.639
 in fact I killed a lot 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.410
 kill then used the screw also 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.290
 this is a very good reward like that 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.730
 the mv 2 strafing that many of 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.799
 you know it is really a lot 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.920
 strong you can not command it 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.660
 however one can only aim and shoot at 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.489
 both normal machine gun and i 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.799
 boys then those four rockets that 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.079
 launches that are just as devastating 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.900
 then up to the k9 unit you are going to i 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.370
 Dogs see the ancient pull that they are not 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.109
 they did me a lot in this game 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.880
 because they hear an open map they have me 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.799
 only found out campers who were gods 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.810
 buildings therefore a technique that there 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:06.349
 I recommend using it once 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.150
 you took the roadster and dogs with rate 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.669
 first dogs then created the immediately to the log 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.700
 star is the beatle is in fact the dogs though 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.530
 while you 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.360
 love would be killing as you see in the 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.109
 clip of those who buy inside 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.600
 of buildings 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.280
 so so that they if they sing 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.100
 they kill dogs if they answer out 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.020
 your bombardments die from there 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.020
 your loves from your dress in 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.970
 this case really a map in my opinion 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.280
 that you can use a lot to do 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.810
 gameplay as I finish by 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.460
 take to draw my rewards 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.139
 after one of your total 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.600
 however i hope this gameplay will 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.580
 both enjoyed a good game 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.110
 now I was trying a lot for 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.850
 play in this period indeed 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.510
 this year of the few gamplays I had 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.979
 because it's really very little time 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.050
 anyway i hope you will appreciate this 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.030
 my effort to bring you gameplay maybe 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.520
 not with the usual weapons tasks as pdv 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.979
 mmc but with weapons a little different way from 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.479
 good to see a little all they said 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.150
 still the accessories he was 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.710
 using in this with this class 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.540
 with this weapon the first was a long barrel 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.310
 which allows you to have more 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.040
 carried or the damage of bullets 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.389
 of distance and kill for example in 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.070
 these cases, snipers who bought 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.080
 You see in this structure in front of co 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.789
 with long barrel it has much more flow rates 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.280
 therefore the damage of the priests from distances 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.990
 major really very comfortable then son 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.630
 I used the viewfinder and the viewfinder landed 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.789
 in fact, I really like the dq cqb noemi 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.380
 preferred to send using this 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.630
 laser sight that still enough 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.060
 comfortable and I see advice if you are not 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.180
 abbas in short with the metal of the weapon 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.210
 in all well defined greetings all the 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.800
 team that played with me and nothing 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.539
 spray guys this video is there 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.430

 you haven't done it yet join the 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.320
 channel for new videos of black ops between 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.060
 which recommended classes do not recommend e 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.479
 various video wastes this video there is 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.820
 liked

 we see you next guys only 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.280
 between andrè of 97 of the contrast mines

 beautiful 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.440
 mozilla the division directive was 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.440
 completed
