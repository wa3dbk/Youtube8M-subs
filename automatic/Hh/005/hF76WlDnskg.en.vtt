00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 it's about fifteen hundred presses in the case of the country 663 are still standing our 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.750
 province of Cordoba 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.129
 but besides talking 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.310
 what are the species where they live where they grow 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.609
 what chemical compounds do they have and the activities 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.650
 It also involves a lot of the history of us putting the use they have had 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.929
 in the last five thousand years 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:26.829
 and we saw in phase also the one feared by our American leaks 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.409
 from the Aztecs and the Mayans in Central America 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.570
 even how stupid was it or is it 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.070
 in Paraguay and Argentina 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.429
 we must also collaborate on 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:39.190
 So we have to be 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.640
 they are novel 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.030
 regarding works at the first hour written 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.500
 about medicinal plants 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.820
 the world the southern cone 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.670
 finally in a talk that 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.360
 let's hope it was at least at least people were here almost 2 now 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.340
 listening 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.400
 about a natural resource 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.290
 What is it 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.770
 Novelé formal that is talked about every day in daily television 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.080
 as are other crops 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.770
 but of this group of plants that has a huge value 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.020
 first the medicine because there is 80% of the people who went through a manufacturing plant 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.050
 the second huge value is that at the source 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.170
 from where the chemical compounds that make up our formal medicines 6 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.170
 pins 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.500
 fit 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.900
 analytically they occur but many of them have their origin 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.960
 in the plants that go from the irina with the acetylsalicylic acid of the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.920
 Cortex 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.300
 of the willows 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.640
 lavin cristina or taxol that exists between the yew crust 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.860
 s peratta there is a huge amount of examples where day by day they show 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.420
 the value of this natural resource 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.660
 Finally 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.260
 We emphasized the need to 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.170
 change some styles developed in the use of natural resources 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.000
 some intervention styles 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.450
 and also some proposal on how to improve regional economies on 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.550
 own mountain environment which is where the greatest amount of 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.380
 of these 600 pesetas from Córdoba 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.190
 improving local production by cultivating native plants 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.219
 near urban centers to improve 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.679
 the scale of production and the quality of the products 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:19.279
 Hector Guero very well the idea of ​​the expected and Sinhalese trees where the 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.529
 agent now starts again 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.449
 although he never moved away from the one that appeared as 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:26.419
 a resource 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:31.269
 when trying to use the word and without antecedents I want to approach to be 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.389
 optimists 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:34.160
 good are those are very cautious 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.259
 the folk medicine 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.059
 was born together with man 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.609
 was born first by trial and error 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:41.809
 there is a part 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.350
 what more mythical religious 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.170
 that this society is just a lot of the genesis and continues to maintain 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.360
 and the other question that is of necessity as you well tell the people many in 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.629
 second not because of fashion but because of necessity because it does not have 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.779
 he does not have money for medicines 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.789
 the plants and they were made 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:05.479
 precautions that we always raise by right handed has been of recipes of the 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.909
 senators to a point 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.529
 the Havana precautions of meaning that plants have a lot of 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:13.329
 chemical compounds 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.069
 what interactions with each other 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.529
 the amount varies not only 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:20.089
 already in the year but of 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:21.619
 during the day hours 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:24.449
 they do not always understand the property they have 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.829
 these chemical compounds which have ignited activities that generate 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.129
 so the subject of herbal medicine 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.199
 you should be careful to use what these prove 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:36.219
 and in effect have 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:37.919
 precautions 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.179
 manizales cúcuta 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:44.629
 the adductor on the subject of the use of the bunge arena 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.920
 hence the regulatory body whoever wants 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.940
 to the stock and wanted to continue buying or good comes growth in the 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.659
 find some tree 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.970
 with this only affect national in mind that in the nba 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.309
 the pri that controls and controls and films with very clear protocols 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:06.879
 which are the medicinal species are very few they take it accepted by the 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.559
 Anmat that the body that legislate 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:12.649
 but they are over the counter so people 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:15.099
 or the collections directly jova 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.699
 between knows what 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.249
 Plants are purchased from a pharmacy to a supermarket 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.040
 whiskey humor so that's over the counter there's no control 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.210
 specific about that 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.020
 according to the 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.150
 alak of quality of life 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.979
 and other data attributes that have a good document 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.029
 and there is a little bit for which it is required beyond the 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:39.259
 some names 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.080
 the sun 4 5 in st 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.080
 we can annotate titles 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:51.240
 g some of those companies exotic aznar flora on Friday that the northern area 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.670
 the truth that it is a subject 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.759
 quite challenging still to move faster 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.300
 because people are still using the plant without any control 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.889
 for example the kilo something that did not use vermouth a long time ago and 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.189
 now many more 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:09.139
 put an exotic style plant 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.370
 but they do assume that the ten lives 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.370
 they are so valid is one of their great hobbies 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.150
 it's a happy day it was the interests of the Sonorans a lot of time 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:26.619
 tranquilizer ellison are directives and also have so proven in addition to 

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:28.580
 others more than has the kilo 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.009
 own sepi quantity of goods more known course 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.020
 so that 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.059
 we can say that this land was chosen the network 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:37.860
 i 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.650
 each of them 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.349
 it has been exaggerated 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.200
 It has many chemical compounds 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.930
 many of them of ages 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.259
 and many of them their potential and others without the caution in omitting them 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.469
 many medicinal plants 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:54.330
 they are in high toxic doses 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.100
 p the poppy planting very interesting because of the latex of the fruit 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:00.569
 of the soul for the t 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:03.000
 takes out a potent alkaloid 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.999
 medicinal than morphine 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:06.180
 although it has a 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.190
 very wide use to calm pain and against cancer but at the same time 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.260
 in deadly high doses
