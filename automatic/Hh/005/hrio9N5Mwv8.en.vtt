00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.800
 they start 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.460
 now it's back to the beginning I was 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.820
 really busy but in any case he 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.820
 it can 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.570
 what came out last year that 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:13.009
 a new brand is all complete 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:14.659
 german production and we produce 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.070
 are created 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.950
 and it's our little power next to it 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.119
 can be max and there when halfway up 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.469
 a bit on the design 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.469
 So the most important thing we were at 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.700
 handlebars holding the press above all because 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.899
 we many bankers simply in the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.759
 past are prohibited 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.799
 I wanted to make sure that they were 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.179
 the widest possible pad 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.770
 and above all the upper rank one 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.280
 stronger than normal handlebars and 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.280
 stood by it 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.740
 does not usually count and counts 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.890
 This seems a thicker here 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.780
 material chosen 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.270
 also have as I said if the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.799
 completely made in germany what 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.830
 unique award good 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.240
 currently an unsuspected prevented 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.039
 also that we at the welds 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.479
 really work very clean and there 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.729
 no sharp edges arise or 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.729
 otherwise any splendid places 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.660
 and 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.630
 placed are the course we 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.250
 use where no lax one 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.260
 Powder coating it is almost a 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.140
 thin plastic plating and that makes 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.510
 The handlebars are much more resistant to 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.310
 against bat than as now government 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:37.390
 The end does not drain 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:41.110
 and that 's the stuff on and 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.940
 stole 25 doctorate of 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:48.660
 keep this stall for the used 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:55.410
