tomorrow we have a very fast race car so

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.770 
tomorrow we have a very fast race car so
now<00:02:26.220> we're<00:02:26.370> just<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:27.209> trying<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.510> make<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.750> go

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
now we're just just trying to make it go

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.060 
now we're just just trying to make it go
a<00:02:27.870> little<00:02:28.080> bit<00:02:28.260> better<00:02:28.440> what<00:02:28.650> are<00:02:28.680> they<00:02:28.830> doing

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
a little bit better what are they doing

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.130 
a little bit better what are they doing
right<00:02:29.280> now

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
right now

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.110 
right now
so<00:02:31.140> these<00:02:31.650> are<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.980> scales<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.580> put<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.880> car

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
so these are the scales we put the car

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.960 
so these are the scales we put the car
on<00:02:33.150> scales<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.140> we<00:02:34.470> weigh<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.280> car<00:02:35.520> on<00:02:35.790> each

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
on scales and we weigh the car on each

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.479 
on scales and we weigh the car on each
corner<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:37.020> tells<00:02:37.320> us<00:02:37.530> gives<00:02:38.070> us<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.340> a

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
corner and that tells us gives us just a

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.190 
corner and that tells us gives us just a
lot<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.790> information<00:02:39.360> about<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.750> setup<00:02:39.989> of

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
lot of information about the setup of

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.800 
lot of information about the setup of
the<00:02:40.290> car<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:42.000> looks<00:02:42.300> like<00:02:42.390> they're

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
the car and it looks like they're

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.540 
the car and it looks like they're
they're<00:02:43.110> just<00:02:43.320> finalizing<00:02:43.770> what<00:02:44.070> springs

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
they're just finalizing what springs

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.140 
they're just finalizing what springs
shocks<00:02:44.670> no<00:02:45.239> sway<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:46.190> sway<00:02:47.190> bars<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.910> some<00:02:48.090> of

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
the shocks that we're gonna go into this

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.340 
the shocks that we're gonna go into this
final<00:02:50.730> practice<00:02:51.000> with<00:02:51.420> okay<00:02:51.750> say<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.230> have
