00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
we also got a world be free but there

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.620

are<00:01:11.070> none<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.400> him<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.939> auction<00:01:12.090> block<00:01:12.360> so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
are none of him on the auction block so

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.000 
are none of him on the auction block so
I<00:01:12.659> don't<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:12.930> what<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.140> over<00:01:13.350> all<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:13.830> I

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
I don't know what is over all this but I

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.640 
I don't know what is over all this but I
think<00:01:14.610> his<00:01:14.700> old<00:01:14.880> card<00:01:15.119> was<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> silver<00:01:15.960> card<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
think his old card was a silver card so

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.170 
think his old card was a silver card so
I'm<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.890> gonna<00:01:17.009> assume<00:01:17.189> anything<00:01:17.460> too

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180
