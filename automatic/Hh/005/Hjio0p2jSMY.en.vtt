00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
more against their face then then

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.430 
more against their face then then

against their shoulder like a Western

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.949 
against their shoulder like a Western
rifle<00:02:23.829> so<00:02:24.130> when<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.880> recall<00:02:25.269> actually<00:02:25.570> went

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
rifle so when the recall actually went

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.819 
rifle so when the recall actually went
back<00:02:26.140> this<00:02:26.440> way<00:02:27.810> it's<00:02:28.810> very<00:02:29.079> difficult<00:02:29.560> I

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
back this way it's very difficult I

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.199 
back this way it's very difficult I
don't<00:02:30.100> I<00:02:30.250> don't<00:02:30.310> quite<00:02:30.519> get<00:02:30.700> how<00:02:30.850> they<00:02:31.000> did

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
don't I don't quite get how they did

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:42.090 
don't I don't quite get how they did
this<00:02:39.359> so<00:02:40.359> it's<00:02:40.600> different<00:02:41.109> there's<00:02:42.010> different

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
this so it's different there's different

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.000 
this so it's different there's different
types<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.850> threats<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:44.260> first<00:02:44.500> one<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.859> you

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
types of threats the first one is you

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.500 
types of threats the first one is you
show<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.400> anything<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:45.730> pushed<00:02:46.120> your<00:02:46.299> thumb

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
show that anything you pushed your thumb

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.350 
show that anything you pushed your thumb
open<00:02:46.870> right<00:02:47.079> that's<00:02:48.070> a<00:02:48.190> threat

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
open right that's a threat

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.500 
open right that's a threat
so<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.689> first<00:02:49.959> threat<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:51.430> here<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.939> just

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
so the first threat it's here I just

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:05.250 
so the first threat it's here I just
push<00:02:53.319> open<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.709> blade<00:02:54.040> with<00:02:54.220> my<00:03:04.260> stingrays

he says shot ski shark skin here's a
simple<00:03:08.950> guard<00:03:10.110> there's<00:03:11.110> three<00:03:11.409> purposes<00:03:11.829> to

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
simple guard there's three purposes to

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.990 
simple guard there's three purposes to
the<00:03:12.280> guard<00:03:12.519> basically<00:03:13.150> one<00:03:13.810> is<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:14.079> protect

fingers off and the third is actually to

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.069 
fingers off and the third is actually to
add<00:03:24.310> balance<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.239> blade<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.720> give<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:25.989> the

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
add balance to the blade to give it the

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.750 
add balance to the blade to give it the
kind<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.349> balance<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:26.769> want<00:03:27.040> this<00:03:27.579> is<00:03:27.730> a

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
kind of balance you want this is a

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.360 
kind of balance you want this is a
relatively<00:03:28.269> short<00:03:28.629> sword<00:03:29.139> for<00:03:29.409> me<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.739> the

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
relatively short sword for me and the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.309 
relatively short sword for me and the
advantages<00:03:30.909> of<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.420> short<00:03:31.659> sword<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.200> it's

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
advantages of a short sword is that it's

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.500 
advantages of a short sword is that it's
quicker<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.739> it<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.400> can<00:03:33.579> it's<00:03:33.819> more<00:03:34.060> agile

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
quicker to it you can it's more agile

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.629 
quicker to it you can it's more agile
and<00:03:34.780> fighting<00:03:35.200> but<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.859> disadvantage<00:03:36.519> is

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
and fighting but the disadvantage is

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.849 
and fighting but the disadvantage is
this<00:03:36.819> range<00:03:37.180> is<00:03:37.450> shorter<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.319> someone<00:03:38.620> in<00:03:38.739> for

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
this range is shorter so someone in for

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.640 
this range is shorter so someone in for
longer<00:03:39.250> sword<00:03:39.549> can<00:03:39.760> can<00:03:40.120> stay<00:03:40.389> off<00:03:40.599> cut<00:03:41.440> your

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
longer sword can can stay off cut your

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.360 
longer sword can can stay off cut your
finger<00:03:41.950> fast

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:04:00.300 

what<00:03:45.370> if<00:03:58.139> you<00:03:59.139> don't<00:03:59.349> focus<00:03:59.530> on<00:03:59.949> what<00:04:00.160> we're

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
what if you don't focus on what we're
