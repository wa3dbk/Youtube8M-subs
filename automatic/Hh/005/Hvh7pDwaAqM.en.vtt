it<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.479> try<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.140> figured<00:01:07.830> why<00:01:08.010> not<00:01:08.040> try<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.520> now

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it a try so figured why not try it now

it a try so figured why not try it now
and<00:01:11.720> got<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.869> went<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.439> alone<00:01:13.710> not<00:01:14.310> because

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and got I went in here alone not because

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
and got I went in here alone not because
I<00:01:14.670> didn't<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:14.909> any<00:01:15.060> friends<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.840> because<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
I didn't have any friends but because I

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.109 
I didn't have any friends but because I
just<00:01:16.830> wanted<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> give<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> solo<00:01:17.790> try

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
just wanted to give it a solo try

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.550 
just wanted to give it a solo try
instead<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.689> having<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.170> people<00:01:19.439> together

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
instead of having to get people together

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.070 
instead of having to get people together
and<00:01:19.890> say<00:01:20.490> okay<00:01:20.759> what's<00:01:20.909> good<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> try<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.659> just

want<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.439> my<00:01:22.500> first<00:01:22.740> taste<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> now

that's<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> first<00:01:24.210> time<00:01:24.299> I've<00:01:24.509> ever<00:01:24.540> given<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that's the first time I've ever given it

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.530 
that's the first time I've ever given it
a<00:01:25.170> try<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> probably<00:01:27.270> end

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
a try so it's going to probably end

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.830 
a try so it's going to probably end
quickly<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.290> fact<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.619> does<00:01:28.860> end<00:01:29.100> quickly<00:01:29.840> so

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
quickly in fact it does end quickly so

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.480 
quickly in fact it does end quickly so
this<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.320> remnant<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.790> probably<00:01:33.479> see

when<00:02:11.650> they're<00:02:11.770> pretty<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.280> don't<00:02:13.060> take<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.270> lot

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
when they're pretty a don't take a lot

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.260 
when they're pretty a don't take a lot
of<00:02:13.510> ammo<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.760> can<00:02:15.850> see<00:02:15.940> there<00:02:16.090> are<00:02:16.150> other

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
of ammo as you can see there are other

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.170 
of ammo as you can see there are other
non<00:02:16.780> shielded<00:02:17.500> ones<00:02:17.740> who<00:02:18.100> pack<00:02:18.760> more<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
non shielded ones who pack more of a

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.660 
non shielded ones who pack more of a
punch<00:02:19.210> I<00:02:19.900> think<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.740> shielded<00:02:21.160> ones<00:02:21.370> are<00:02:21.550> more

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
punch I think the shielded ones are more

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.070 
punch I think the shielded ones are more
close<00:02:21.970> quarters<00:02:22.420> because<00:02:22.630> they<00:02:22.810> have<00:02:22.930> these

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
close quarters because they have these

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.610 
close quarters because they have these
kind<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.680> axes<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.730> weapons<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.510> very<00:02:26.230> weird

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
kind of axes and weapons that very weird

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.640 
kind of axes and weapons that very weird
but<00:02:27.130> they<00:02:27.250> also<00:02:27.459> die<00:02:27.820> easier<00:02:28.300> so<00:02:28.690> there's<00:02:29.590> a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
but they also die easier so there's a

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.470 
but they also die easier so there's a
you<00:02:30.070> know<00:02:30.160> lots<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.610> playing<00:02:30.880> field<00:02:31.150> here

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
you can see there are many many levels

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.080 
you can see there are many many levels

regenerating<00:04:07.450> which<00:04:07.600> is<00:04:07.840> good<00:04:08.140> because<00:04:08.680> I'll

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
regenerating which is good because I'll

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.190 
regenerating which is good because I'll
had<00:04:09.640> half<00:04:09.910> a<00:04:10.060> bar<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.480> now<00:04:10.570> it's<00:04:10.750> back<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.049> a

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
had half a bar and now it's back to a

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.380 
had half a bar and now it's back to a
stable<00:04:11.470> here<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.340> learn<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:13.120> you<00:04:13.180> have<00:04:13.269> to

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
stable here I learn that you have to

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.250 
stable here I learn that you have to
hold<00:04:13.570> X<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:14.530> pay<00:04:14.829> for<00:04:15.700> opening<00:04:16.419> doors<00:04:16.660> and

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
hold X to pay for opening doors and

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.560 
hold X to pay for opening doors and
paying<00:04:18.039> for<00:04:18.190> ammo<00:04:18.549> which<00:04:18.880> is<00:04:19.060> also<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.390> real

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
paying for ammo which is also a real

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.990 
paying for ammo which is also a real
time<00:04:20.320> waster<00:04:20.859> especially<00:04:21.549> if<00:04:21.609> you<00:04:21.700> were<00:04:21.880> like

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
time waster especially if you were like

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.430 
time waster especially if you were like
me<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.240> you<00:04:22.390> didn't<00:04:22.599> know<00:04:22.720> that

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
me and you didn't know that

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.120 
me and you didn't know that
so<00:04:24.440> then<00:04:24.590> I<00:04:24.620> go<00:04:24.710> over<00:04:24.860> here<00:04:25.160> with<00:04:25.340> my<00:04:25.460> 25<00:04:26.030> points

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
so then I go over here with my 25 points

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.450 
so then I go over here with my 25 points
and<00:04:28.870> learned<00:04:29.870> that<00:04:30.260> looking<00:04:30.890> for<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.130> ammo

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
and learned that looking for the ammo

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.690 
and learned that looking for the ammo
and<00:04:31.960> there<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.290> is<00:04:33.440> but<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:33.890> need<00:04:34.130> 25<00:04:34.220> more

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
and there it is but I need 25 more

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.390 
and there it is but I need 25 more
points<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.680> new<00:04:36.800> wave<00:04:36.980> was<00:04:37.130> about<00:04:37.280> to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
points and the new wave was about to

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.830 
points and the new wave was about to
begin<00:04:37.670> so<00:04:37.850> I<00:04:37.880> realized<00:04:38.210> maybe<00:04:38.390> I<00:04:38.540> can<00:04:38.690> get<00:04:38.780> a

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
begin so I realized maybe I can get a

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.220 
begin so I realized maybe I can get a
kill<00:04:39.140> or<00:04:39.320> two<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.890> then<00:04:40.130> buying<00:04:41.000> new<00:04:41.510> ammo<00:04:41.900> so

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
kill or two and then buying new ammo so

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.550 
kill or two and then buying new ammo so
I<00:04:42.260> get<00:04:42.440> my<00:04:42.530> kill<00:04:42.860> get<00:04:43.670> another<00:04:43.910> kill<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:45.440> I

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
I get my kill get another kill and I

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.530 
I get my kill get another kill and I
think<00:04:46.160> I<00:04:46.250> right<00:04:46.640> here<00:04:46.790> about<00:04:46.940> here<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:47.180> decided

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
think I right here about here I decided

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.680 
think I right here about here I decided
to<00:04:47.810> go<00:04:48.350> for<00:04:48.650> smashing<00:04:49.370> someone<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.060> it

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
to go for smashing someone and it

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.180 
to go for smashing someone and it
doesn't<00:04:51.020> work<00:04:51.140> you<00:04:51.170> can't<00:04:51.560> kill<00:04:51.770> people<00:04:52.070> by

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
doesn't work you can't kill people by

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.870 
doesn't work you can't kill people by
running<00:04:52.520> into<00:04:52.610> him<00:04:52.970> so<00:04:53.950> that<00:04:54.950> was<00:04:55.070> a<00:04:55.100> drag<00:04:55.430> but

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
running into him so that was a drag but

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.280
