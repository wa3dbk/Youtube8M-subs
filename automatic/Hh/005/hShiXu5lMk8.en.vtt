00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.490
 hello everyone here is more to monetti 

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:08.559
 welcome to a new tutorial that in 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.799
 this occasion is to form axes 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.080
 rusty silver eggs and golden eggs 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.580
 for that they need the armor of 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.070
 hunter that can be bought 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.290
 directly in the armory is quite 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.740
 cheap and this armor gives us the 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.630
 soldier skill that will allow us 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.750
 catch fish more easily because 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.559
 for this method we need to have a 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.989
 large amount of fish and as it is called 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.820
 gastronomic something like that seems to be more 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.450
 gastronomic fish then we have to 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.600
 go to form these fish and it's done in the 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.790
 diaz dunes map so first you 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.399
 I'm going to show you how to get these fish 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.590
 on that map it may be low range of 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.630
 high range but this map the one that has 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.399
 the highest percentage I think a 15 percent 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.590
 a hundred chance of the 3 coming out 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.450
 in the fishing area 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.120
 but if you have a large amount 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.850
 of these fish in your inventory it 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.210
 you can skip this part of the tutorial 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.290
 so we do not need the map but if 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.570
 we are going to find cold drinks 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.970
 because you have to save money and we 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.970
 we go directly to zone 4 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.820
 we have to go up there in zone 4 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.680
 from the fishing point of this fish or 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.680
 of this gourmet tuna 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.810
 there we come to zone 4 we have to 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.670
 eliminate the herbivores that are here 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.630
 so they do not bother 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.340
 think 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.960
 I'm going with my super short sword of fire 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.210
 that finally I could improve it when it came out 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.729
 the mouse silvery and stripes 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.990
 golden and there those big fish that see 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.420
 there they have thorns that 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.479
 they excel that is the fish or the tuna 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.610
 gourmet we can take up to 5 in the 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.740
 inventory so when they capture 5 the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.350
 idea is that they leave the map of 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.500
 collection and return to the village is 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.530
 gourmet tuna like that is called if you do not see 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.399
 the big fish in water can pass to the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.310
 another map and re-enter that way 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.019
 the fish that appear in the 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.480
 fishing area so if you do not see tuna 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:20.950
 gourmet leave the area go back to 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.900
 enter and see if there is or there is not in this if 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.400
 there is or there are no new fish in the area 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.170
 fishing and you can see back that there is one 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.380
 sticks out on the corner in the water like this 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.650
 that they can continue fishing there 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.959
 weight is the first part 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.689
 Now let's go through the second part when 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.209
 let's have several gourmet fish the 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:43.239
 idea is to go on a collecting mission 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.939
 anybody gives the same here we go to 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.549
 the autumn steppe and in the inventory 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:52.890
 they must fill must carry the amount 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.890
 maximum of gourmet species that is 5 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.330
 let's see then here they are at a 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.680
 gourmet we take five and we're going to 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.140
 The mission 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.980
 then it will depend on the item that 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.849
 we want to form what we must do for 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.310
 example if we need rusty axes 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.920
 if when eating these five to Tunisia we 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.900
 they give two axes after we can leave 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.810
 the mission normally and stay with 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.549
 that ax if we look for eggs when we 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.950
 come out a golden egg or two eggs 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.109
 golden ones we can finish the mission is 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.510
 law of foreign objects of a rusty ax 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:33.459
 when we eat tuna 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.459
 here gives us an electric saying 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.310
 another rusty ax 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.300
 pieces to audi rock and gives us each one 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.620
 said elective as he gave us 2 up 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.630
 rusty after you have to 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.790
 wait only and finish the mission 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.350
 to keep the items here we have 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.690
 again 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.920
 it gives us an electric bug 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.920
 then silver 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.439
 there gives us a golden egg usually 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.540
 when he gives me a golden egg I finish 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.999
 the mission so five fish 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.799
 gourmet for a golden egg is worth the 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:16.209
 pity besides that is this mission is done 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.479
 super fast 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.880
 I do not know if they can see the inventory gave me 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.740
 a silver egg and a golden egg like that 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.229
 I have to wait for the end of the 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.720
 minutes take the harp tickets and finish 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.530
 the mission I hope you liked this 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:36.449
 small tutorial on how to form eggs and 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.449
 rusty ax see you soon bye
