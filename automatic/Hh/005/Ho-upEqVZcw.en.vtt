 for something very concrete that justifies 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.959
 a whole trip the manuscript of pedro 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.959

 two copies one was in library 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.200
 Spanish national and simply 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.060
 disappeared but here suspects that in 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.840
 actually it was about the same copy it 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.790

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.360
 that when seen before me the 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.360
 manuscript 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.210
 I thought that my whole trip has a lot 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.569
 sense 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:37.120

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.120
