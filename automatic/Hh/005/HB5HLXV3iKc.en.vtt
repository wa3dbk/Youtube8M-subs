00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
I mean that's what she did growing up

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.300 
I mean that's what she did growing up
that's<00:00:25.279> what<00:00:25.550> she's<00:00:25.730> still<00:00:26.000> doing<00:00:26.180> today<00:00:26.450> and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
that's what she's still doing today and

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.819 
that's what she's still doing today and
because<00:00:28.310> of<00:00:28.340> that<00:00:28.550> reason<00:00:28.869> Aaron<00:00:29.869> needs<00:00:30.200> to<00:00:30.710> be

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
because of that reason Aaron needs to be

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.910 
because of that reason Aaron needs to be
explosive<00:00:31.640> and<00:00:32.140> Aaron<00:00:33.140> likes<00:00:33.320> to<00:00:33.530> work<00:00:33.710> on

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
explosive and Aaron likes to work on

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.900 
explosive and Aaron likes to work on
angles<00:00:34.460> cuz<00:00:34.790> it'll<00:00:35.090> just<00:00:35.810> feel<00:00:36.020> better<00:00:36.290> on<00:00:36.910> the

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
angles cuz it'll just feel better on the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.560 
angles cuz it'll just feel better on the
shoulders<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:38.660> it<00:00:39.470> helps<00:00:39.950> her<00:00:40.160> wid<00:00:41.120> her

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.590 
performance
so<00:00:42.829> I'm<00:00:43.100> gonna<00:00:43.219> let<00:00:43.399> her<00:00:43.519> take<00:00:43.730> it<00:00:43.850> away<00:00:43.940> as<00:00:44.359> she

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
so I'm gonna let her take it away as she

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.380 
so I'm gonna let her take it away as she
talks<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.170> you<00:00:45.260> about<00:00:45.440> doing<00:00:46.390> explosive

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
presses on the Hammer Strength machine

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.509 
presses on the Hammer Strength machine
well<00:00:50.929> I<00:00:51.109> love<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.559> Harris<00:00:51.890> sync<00:00:52.129> machine

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
well I love the Harris sync machine

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.669 
well I love the Harris sync machine
because<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:52.879> can<00:00:53.179> train<00:00:53.449> unilaterally<00:00:54.230> and

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
because you can train unilaterally and

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.919 
because you can train unilaterally and
that<00:00:55.160> helps<00:00:55.429> me<00:00:55.609> for<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:55.910> shot<00:00:56.179> because<00:00:56.510> I<00:00:56.780> go

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
that helps me for the shot because I go

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.319 
that helps me for the shot because I go
one<00:00:57.440> arm<00:00:57.620> at<00:00:57.739> a<00:00:57.829> time<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:58.339> this<00:00:58.879> arm<00:00:59.179> is

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
one arm at a time and this arm is

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.029 
one arm at a time and this arm is
usually<00:00:59.749> a<00:00:59.780> little<00:00:59.929> bit<00:01:00.140> weaker<00:01:00.499> so<00:01:00.739> I<00:01:00.800> make

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
usually a little bit weaker so I make

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.759 
usually a little bit weaker so I make
sure<00:01:01.070> I<00:01:01.309> let<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.480> weaker<00:01:02.809> side<00:01:03.050> dictate<00:01:03.589> how

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
sure I let the weaker side dictate how

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.530 
sure I let the weaker side dictate how
much<00:01:03.980> weight<00:01:04.250> that<00:01:04.280> I'm<00:01:04.550> going<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.850> do<00:01:05.089> so<00:01:05.480> I

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
much weight that I'm going to do so I

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.690 
much weight that I'm going to do so I
usually<00:01:05.930> start<00:01:06.170> with<00:01:06.260> a<00:01:06.380> plate<00:01:06.680> after<00:01:07.310> really

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
usually start with a plate after really

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.670 
usually start with a plate after really
good<00:01:07.880> warm-up<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.600> it's<00:01:09.140> an<00:01:09.320> explosive

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
good warm-up and it's an explosive

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.550 
good warm-up and it's an explosive
movement<00:01:10.250> I<00:01:10.460> love<00:01:11.120> working<00:01:11.420> with<00:01:12.020> machines

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
movement I love working with machines

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.950 
movement I love working with machines
for<00:01:12.950> this<00:01:13.130> reason<00:01:13.550> because<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.390> forces<00:01:14.720> you<00:01:14.930> to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
for this reason because it forces you to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.540 
for this reason because it forces you to
stabilize<00:01:15.290> do<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:15.800> have<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:15.980> bench<00:01:16.280> that

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
stabilize do you have a bench that

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.880 
stabilize do you have a bench that
you're<00:01:16.730> sitting<00:01:16.940> against<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:18.620> can't

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
you're sitting against and you can't

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.010 
you're sitting against and you can't
really<00:01:19.160> you<00:01:19.820> can<00:01:19.970> cheat<00:01:20.210> but<00:01:20.450> you<00:01:20.540> can't<00:01:20.750> cheat

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
really you can cheat but you can't cheat

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.470 
really you can cheat but you can't cheat
too<00:01:21.290> much<00:01:21.470> so<00:01:21.770> it<00:01:22.250> really<00:01:22.520> keeps<00:01:22.790> it<00:01:23.030> focused

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
too much so it really keeps it focused

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.500 
too much so it really keeps it focused
on<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.140> upper<00:01:24.440> PEC<00:01:24.730> absolutely<00:01:25.730> yeah<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.060> love

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.220 
which is the incline press so Aaron's
gonna<00:01:42.650> show<00:01:42.950> do<00:01:43.760> a<00:01:43.790> little<00:01:44.000> demo<00:01:44.330> for<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:44.840> with

up<00:02:08.830> notice<00:02:09.490> how<00:02:09.670> she's<00:02:09.970> exploding<00:02:10.869> okay<00:02:14.670> very

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
up notice how she's exploding okay very

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.600 
up notice how she's exploding okay very
nice<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.210> tempos<00:02:16.630> faster<00:02:17.290> on<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.920> concentric

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
nice the tempos faster on the concentric

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.150 
nice the tempos faster on the concentric
and<00:02:18.790> as<00:02:19.390> she<00:02:19.600> controls<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.500> slows<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.130> down

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
and as she controls it and slows it down

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.440 
and as she controls it and slows it down
on<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.910> descent<00:02:22.360> of<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:23.200> lip<00:02:23.500> but<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:25.000> doing

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
on the descent of the lip but in doing

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.010 
on the descent of the lip but in doing
that<00:02:25.710> it's<00:02:26.710> getting<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.970> harness<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.870> lot

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
that it's getting you to harness a lot

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.530 
that it's getting you to harness a lot
of<00:02:29.140> power<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.590> lot<00:02:29.710> of<00:02:29.920> energy<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.670> it's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
of power a lot of energy and it's

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.810 
of power a lot of energy and it's
something<00:02:32.320> that<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.530> can't<00:02:32.830> do<00:02:33.070> very<00:02:33.280> safely

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
something that you can't do very safely

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.970 
something that you can't do very safely
with<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> dumbbell<00:02:34.360> yeah<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.290> mean<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.710> do<00:02:35.830> that

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
with a dumbbell yeah I mean you do that

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.740 
with a dumbbell yeah I mean you do that
with<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.130> dumbbell<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.790> continues<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.600> fly

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
with a dumbbell and it continues to fly

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.310 
with a dumbbell and it continues to fly
the<00:02:37.810> way<00:02:38.080> yeah<00:02:38.820> right<00:02:39.820> wouldn't<00:02:40.420> be<00:02:40.600> good

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
the way yeah right wouldn't be good

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.380 
the way yeah right wouldn't be good
so<00:02:41.740> yeah<00:02:41.950> highly<00:02:42.400> recommend<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.240> that's

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
so yeah highly recommend it and that's

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.790 
so yeah highly recommend it and that's
that's<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.080> other<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.320> know<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.440> thing

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
that's the other you know that thing

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.010 
that's the other you know that thing
that<00:02:45.070> hammer<00:02:45.760> strength<00:02:46.090> provides<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.840> that

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
that hammer strength provides is that

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.530 
that hammer strength provides is that
independent<00:02:47.350> movement<00:02:48.220> which<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.209> cool

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
independent movement which is so cool

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.500 
independent movement which is so cool
I'm<00:02:49.959> so<00:02:50.170> glad<00:02:50.350> that<00:02:50.590> Aaron<00:02:50.950> brought<00:02:51.790> up<00:02:52.060> you

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
I'm so glad that Aaron brought up you

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.300 
I'm so glad that Aaron brought up you
know<00:02:52.540> sticking<00:02:53.260> with<00:02:53.440> weights<00:02:53.709> that<00:02:54.100> she

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
know sticking with weights that she

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.060 
know sticking with weights that she
knows<00:02:54.520> her<00:02:54.760> weak<00:02:55.030> side<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:56.200> know<00:02:56.320> can<00:02:56.800> hang

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
knows her weak side you know can hang

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.850 
knows her weak side you know can hang
because<00:02:57.850> it's<00:02:58.420> easy<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.990> you<00:02:59.170> know<00:02:59.200> pile<00:02:59.650> on

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
because it's easy to you know pile on

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.230 
because it's easy to you know pile on
some<00:03:00.070> weight<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.610> know<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.910> strong

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
some weight that you know that strong

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.270 
some weight that you know that strong
side<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:01.660> lot<00:03:02.080> of<00:03:02.200> us<00:03:02.290> are<00:03:02.470> righties<00:03:02.890> I'm

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
side a lot of us are righties I'm

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.900 
side a lot of us are righties I'm
actually<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.760> lefty<00:03:04.180> but<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.890> know<00:03:06.010> we<00:03:06.280> have<00:03:06.880> a

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
actually a lefty but you know we have a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.440 
actually a lefty but you know we have a
tendency<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.720> push<00:03:08.470> too<00:03:09.010> hard<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.640> then<00:03:10.270> all

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
tendency to push too hard and then all

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.910 
tendency to push too hard and then all
of<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.660> sudden<00:03:10.690> maybe<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.380> would<00:03:11.470> get<00:03:11.560> injured

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
of a sudden maybe it would get injured

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.370 
of a sudden maybe it would get injured
on<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.220> weak<00:03:12.370> side<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:13.000> definitely<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.019> it's

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
on the weak side so definitely and it's

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.870 
on the weak side so definitely and it's
nice<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.739> bring<00:03:14.890> up<00:03:15.070> both<00:03:15.250> sides<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:15.850> that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
nice to bring up both sides so that

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.940 
nice to bring up both sides so that
they're<00:03:16.180> even<00:03:16.510> when<00:03:17.380> I<00:03:17.410> first<00:03:17.680> started

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
they're even when I first started

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.830 
they're even when I first started
competing<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.640> looked<00:03:19.030> at<00:03:19.150> pictures<00:03:19.300> and<00:03:19.540> my

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
competing I looked at pictures and my

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.229 
competing I looked at pictures and my
right<00:03:20.050> side<00:03:20.290> was<00:03:20.320> very<00:03:20.620> strong<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.459> more

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
right side was very strong and more

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.020 
right side was very strong and more
muscle<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.750> left<00:03:23.019> side<00:03:23.580> yeah<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:24.820> it's

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
muscle to the left side yeah so it's

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.090 
muscle to the left side yeah so it's
taken<00:03:25.360> a<00:03:25.420> number<00:03:25.570> of<00:03:25.810> years<00:03:26.050> but<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.290> can<00:03:26.650> even

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
taken a number of years but you can even

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.910 
taken a number of years but you can even
out<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:28.200> discrepancies<00:03:29.200> in<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.440> symmetry

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
out the discrepancies in the symmetry

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.270 
out the discrepancies in the symmetry
and<00:03:30.780> really<00:03:31.780> for<00:03:32.170> injury<00:03:32.440> prevention<00:03:32.620> you

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
and really for injury prevention you

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.490 
and really for injury prevention you
can't<00:03:33.519> do<00:03:33.640> that<00:03:33.790> yeah<00:03:34.120> no<00:03:34.420> absolutely<00:03:34.630> having

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
can't do that yeah no absolutely having

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.650 
can't do that yeah no absolutely having
that<00:03:35.650> balance<00:03:35.890> top<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.670> bottom<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.239> left<00:03:37.300> to

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
that balance top to bottom and left to

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.199 
that balance top to bottom and left to
right<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.470> just<00:03:38.920> super<00:03:39.550> important<00:03:40.000> especially

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
right is just super important especially

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.500 
right is just super important especially
as<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.720> figure<00:03:41.350> competitor<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:42.250> as<00:03:42.730> an<00:03:42.880> athlete

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
as a figure competitor and as an athlete

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.170 
as a figure competitor and as an athlete
so<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.530> it's<00:03:44.680> easy<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.100> become<00:03:45.250> dominant<00:03:46.060> on

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
so and it's easy to become dominant on

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.820 
so and it's easy to become dominant on
one<00:03:46.390> side<00:03:46.750> as<00:03:47.050> an<00:03:47.380> app
