00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
nature not all of them exactly the same

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.010 
nature not all of them exactly the same
so<00:01:16.530> i've<00:01:16.619> actually<00:01:16.740> got<00:01:17.009> around<00:01:17.299> six<00:01:18.299> or<00:01:18.450> seven

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
we've got to code in which is a bit of a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.340 
we've got to code in which is a bit of a
monster<00:01:38.250> hunter<00:01:38.610> clownish<00:01:39.119> soul<00:01:40.049> sacrifice

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
which is obviously everyone's aware of

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.350 
which is obviously everyone's aware of
again<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.439> heavy<00:01:43.680> action<00:01:44.070> orientated<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
again it's heavy action orientated as is

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.660 
again it's heavy action orientated as is
to<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:46.619> there<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.860> plenty<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.399> sort<00:01:47.640> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
to get in but there is plenty of sort of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.830 
to get in but there is plenty of sort of
upgrading<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.450> leveling<00:01:49.200> up<00:01:49.439> etc<00:01:50.570> now<00:01:51.570> I'm

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
upgrading and leveling up etc now I'm

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.539 
upgrading and leveling up etc now I'm
this<00:01:52.619> jaya<00:01:53.220> 3<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.880> more<00:01:54.180> traditional<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:55.110> guess

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
this jaya 3 is more traditional I guess

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.639 
this jaya 3 is more traditional I guess
RPG<00:01:56.549> territory<00:01:57.149> haven't<00:01:57.840> played<00:01:58.049> an<00:01:58.200> awful

ace<00:02:04.380> coming<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:05.009> that's<00:02:05.759> them<00:02:06.090> again<00:02:06.479> more

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
that's all so it's pretty similar to

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.130 
that's all so it's pretty similar to
ticketing<00:02:11.970> elope<00:02:12.180> they<00:02:12.390> would<00:02:12.540> say<00:02:12.720> to

ticketing elope they would say to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.760 
ticketing elope they would say to
condense<00:02:13.440> def

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
condense def

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.100 
condense def
you<00:02:13.860> bet<00:02:14.010> again<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:15.030> then<00:02:15.750> you've<00:02:15.900> got<00:02:16.020> of

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
you bet again and then you've got of

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.820
