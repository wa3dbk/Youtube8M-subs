00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 tomorrow is the world day of breastfeeding 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.810
 feed the baby with breast milk until the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.450
 the six months 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.469
 help prevent several diseases but to 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.099
 some mothers 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.320
 this care goes beyond the city of Julia already 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.810
 got used to the new meal there 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.880
 just over two weeks and baby food 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.070
 Crumpled fruit entered the menu 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.320
 but the mother ensures that breast milk 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.529
 will not be forgotten 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.119
 Until she leaves, I'll go until 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.279
 when she wants 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.680
 the suggestion of breastfeeding for longer 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.020
 came from the family there is no doubt I think 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.690
 who needs to want to want is the most 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.600
 important and she wanted this from 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.430
 during the six months of pregnancy 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.739
 the first months of the year and had only 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.390
 breast milk with the complementary period 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.390
 including it is recommended by physicians 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.969
 so that it is the only food in the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.239
 child within this time limit 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.789
 help not only in training the child but also 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.609
 also favors the mother's health to 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.379
 woman there is a natural evolution of the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.299
 uterine cavity then decrease the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.299
 bleeding reduce the risk of anemia 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.090

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.939
 protection from breastmilk 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.070
 then it is important in terms of even 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.560
 public health because it was during the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.830
