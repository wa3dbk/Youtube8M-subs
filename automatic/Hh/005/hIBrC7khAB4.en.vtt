00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello friends with you gestures i suggest 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.759
 continue to take masters in the British 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.259
 Fri-Sau primary classes and today we 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.480
 let's talk about valent a.t. 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.429
 this third level support which 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.190
 to a large extent, logically continues our 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.410
 previous review universal pit 2 bdr 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.480
 what has changed the process of tank 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.369
 evolution so to speak is given to us 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.170
 choice of three types of weapons and 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.000
 a lot of these guns only two 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.869
 type ninety four millimeters 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.449
 land mines 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.490
 barely a six-pound quickfire and i 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.009
 tried to upgrade 6 pounds 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.809
 mk4 guns since the flight path 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.530
 high-explosive projectile but I just 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.899
 depressing 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.550
 I must say that now we no longer have 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.680
 that speed as in the previous version 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.860
 Now we can accelerate to the maximum 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.930
 up to 24 kilometers ahead however the reverse 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.629
 we have clearly added and already 12 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.300
 kilometers along with all that balance 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.000
 The level has grown up to 5, that is, an option 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.039
 meet in battle square-1 increased breakthrough 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.050
 our gun 110 millimeters so not 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.809
 scorn to buy a dozen three gold 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.800
 armor-piercing subcaliber yes and pierce and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.640
 increase to one hundred eighty 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.339
 millimeters 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.900
 we put the grid of horns and drives from the modules and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.570
 let's go to battle well that the province is perfect 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.950
 a place to take the master while i 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.680
 I move to the position I want to tell 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.430
 you about the presence of our amazing took 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.570
 we already have 60 millimeters true 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.400
 worthless armor and here instead of this 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.909
 the part is right at right angles which 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.030
 This lower armor sheet is worried 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:37.049
 the board we have here on the perimeter 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.509
 let's say so too 60 and rear aft 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.960
 part is also less than 60 millimeters of armor 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.960
 but amazing near the whole cabin all 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.840
 absolutely that is here has here 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.490
 14 millimeters and at the same time excellent 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.720
 size in order to fall on it 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.820
 just not really aiming 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.770
 so having met such a valentine in battle 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.219
 don't bother drink right on this 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.549
 felling 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.290
 She wants to cheer this way very much 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.420
 Well 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.850
 how wrong do I think 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.400
 yes because there must be some kind of frontal 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.899
 part strengthened 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.090
 here but there is a small moment which I 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.290
 I can share later, already in Rome's 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.500
 did too I had a contract 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.570
 with enemy artillery and as you can see 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.060
 how good is the contract 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.760
 they don't touch me i hit exactly 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.070
 masked guns 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.960
 say well, it's not the last episode of Th 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:32.630
 which will be in this sort of battle on this 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:35.959
 more back later but what is with this 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.709
 needle with which we shoot our 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.650
 armor piercing 75 we have damage and 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.450
 breaking through 110 and constantly managing 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.270
 get to hit some kind of mask guns 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.060
 some module there it is french 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.510
 friend for reno bs lives too long 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.140
 That is right so that is not disclosed to their 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.800
 agreements from being forced to kill him 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.080
 so as soon as he appears all in 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.930
 general here so here you have seen three 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:11.090
 57 pgs shots on arte and some 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.600
 Critical module calls and no damage at all 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.310
 but it is certainly a hurry but in general 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.400
 nothing remains to do so 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.840
 rate of fire like standing in the bushes 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.780
 vyselivat all that moves and begin 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.989
 Damage ammunition we allow 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:31.010
 again don't follow accuracy 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.690
 follow the data of lupim shoot 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.130
 so send trassir and for 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.620
 other than me now by the way i 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.830
 I am doing a standard point where usually 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.530
 there principle likes to stand well at least 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.519
 those who are older those who are already there a little bit 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.769
 at least played 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.310
 novices novices usually 30 there are not 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:53.750
 worth look small there straight 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.290
 a piece shows our kruzak here or and 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.000
 quietly starting to shoot that is 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.120
 you can not worry well, of course those 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.920
 who are afraid of messing up their statistics on 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.200
 hit percentage is not worth doing 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.450
 Do you extort one hundred percent crew 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.790
 for sure you can somehow better 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.410
 already fall and for me it's like not 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.079
 quite critical so I always 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:20.329
 try here with such guns are satisfied 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:25.580
 automatic turn all cotton there 3gp 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:27.530
 I took the last but it's nice to have a beating 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.990
 of course nothing much like that 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.560
 going on all interesting somewhere like 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.990
 usually in the province someone climbs 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.360
 first someone climbs then as a rule 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.620
 everyone’s nerves can't stand everything 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.419
 somewhere to move here and in the end side 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.830
 who stood the most and more 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.740
 all sat down however the rules and 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.990
 wins because where is where 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.650
 here don't move everywhere you start 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:58.520
 notice here a chinese hat sticks out 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.970
 there he drank fuck too with instantly 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.970
 will take away 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.070
 Well, too, mushrooms povylazili quickly 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.980
 that's what you climbed incomprehensibly 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.260
 quickly begins to crawl away but 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:15.720
 it's late at night 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:18.090
 took the flash drive account 10 all for the goods 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.610
 which we see here is quite modest 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.420
 300 but nevertheless I got here those 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.980
 I had something without light 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.860
 on board three frags 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:32.820
 but this is not the final so I run a little 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.130
 forward and noteworthy again on 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.530
 this valentine I did not notice anything 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.510
 there may be those who like to fan in 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.200
 such sandboxes can certainly find 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.030
 something for yourself in this support 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.590
 interesting yes to bend there too 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.430
 statistics all raise there or else 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.800
 because well, many people 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.020
 shake artist there is one usually 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:00.150
 makes numbers 2 of the level of technology or already 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:02.010
 4 who at night as it is convenient here to be with 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.110
 very promising for those who took here 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.170
 he looks out for dad there I don’t know 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.750
 maybe he is there instead of meteorologists weather 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:12.960
 any peeps so measures not 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.570
 I know what he does there, but he too 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.890
 goes to the hangar but we all stayed 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.500
 most of me already have 6 frags 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:24.090
 here's a valentine there, too, hid 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.100
 Apparently the whole game stood for this 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.960
 Well, although not a fact can also be gender and 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.290
 here somewhere, too, shot back 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.900
 in any case, and now our 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:37.910
 already and captures the base 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:41.540
 I understand that Potter 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.220
 what I do not know air mattress 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.690
 its size 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:49.490
 you are nothing at all 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.240
 left on this mattress to do as already 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:57.680
 heading towards the enemies and here 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.660
 blessings still I succeed dumb in my own way 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.960
 classmate 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.880
 you can even tell a fellow man 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.580
 another depressing statistics on 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.530
 hitting and all this is the temptation of temptation 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.300
 the fact that you have almost a machine with 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.640
 which you can walk without stopping and 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.980
 nevertheless 1176 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.940
 of the experience were eight hundred damage and 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.880
 6 frags 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.740
 Here is such a British Valentine for me 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.050
 this is probably just a passing tank 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.550
 Well, principled lovers think 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.840
 it will be quite comfortable not only in 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.730
 sandbox but on some 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.410
