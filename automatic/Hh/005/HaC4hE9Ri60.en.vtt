00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.560
 Then I would like to play slap playing with a guitar this time. It is also called a chopper. 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.350
 It is a popular way of playing if it was originally done on the basis, but 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:18.820
 You can do it at all with a guitar, so it's a fun playing method, so let's challenge by all means. 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.590
 First, there are three techniques for slap. 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.290
 First of all, let's master the two operations of thumbing, pull, and pull-up in this first animation. 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.360
 First, from the thumping. 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.180
 To go. 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.460
 Using the thumb · · · The thumb is the name of thumb, so the thumbing is the same name. 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:53.160
 I play the open string of 6 strings with my thumb, but as a feeling, I do not play it like playing 6 strings with a pick, 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.850
 I tried to put my thumb on the 5 strings, 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.060
 In the meantime, it sounds like you have scraped the six strings and if you play it you will hear a good sound. 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:11.790
 So you can see if you look closely, but my thumb is always on the 5th string. 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.150
 When playing six strings, stop at five strings. 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:25.640
 So, at other times, for example, when playing 5 strings, stop with 4 strings. 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.540
 It is very easy to do, but I think it's very difficult for the first person to do it. 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.510
 First of all, the sound does not sound beautifully. 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.390
 So, the procedure I mentioned earlier is what to do when the sound does not sound beautifully. 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.850
 I'm trying to stop my thumb on the 5th string if I want to make the 6th string open. 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.720
 So, in the meantime, the six strings have faded. 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.270
 In this way ... 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.340
 I would like you to play in this sense. 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.699
 Because I can't play well if I think I'll put it on the 6th string. 

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:08.789
 I'm stuck, or I'm overdone. 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.489
 Also, no sound was heard. 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.599
 It's like this. 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.700
 This is a bad example. 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.839
 So, let's practice as many times as you can play 6 strings cleanly. 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.590
 Next, pull. 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.559
 In my case, I basically use my index finger to pull. 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:36.260
 I do not pull it. 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.260
 For example, let's pull an open four-string string with your index finger. 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:50.379
 I'm only really pulling. 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.969
 Like this four-string with your index finger. 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:05.599
 Pull it and slap a string on the fingerboard to create a percussive sound. 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.599
 So it's amazing how easy it is to do this, 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.329
 In fact, it is very difficult when combined with thumping. 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.269
 Lastly, let's do a phrase a bit. 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.230
 3 frets of 6 strings are index finger. 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:31.239
 So, go to the 5th fret of 4 strings with your little finger and with such an octave ... 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:38.239
 Let's repeat thumping and pulling. 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.449
 People who can do this for the first time are really awesome. 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.599
 I have a talent for slap. 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.279
 However, most people don't put the movement in a compact way at all, and there is no sound at all. 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.760
 I think that the rhythm also gets messy. 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.499
 For the time being, basically, the movement is compact anyway. 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:04.019
 When you thump and pull next time. 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.879
 It looks like you're ready to pull when you're thumping. 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:09.879
 I can pull it already. 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.400
 So, I can do the thumbing apart. 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.149
 Thumb it, pull it, thumb it, pull it, 

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:23.070
 It seems that you are doing thumping, pulling, and so on. 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.880
 Let's be able to do each movement in a series of flows. 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.880
 Thumping, pulling, thumping, pulling. 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.030
 For now, if you can do this, please move on to the second video.
