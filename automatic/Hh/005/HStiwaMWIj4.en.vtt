00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.790
 hello you tube I am pablo watercress two and today I am going to make a comparison between two 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.440
 good games the dragon volcano budokai tenkaichi 3 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.189
 and the bolze dragon that in cádiz chitac team 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.949
 first of all we will start by comparing the stories of the two games 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.660
 the tenca and cheetah dragon that no longer has a very short history 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.660
 it's just up to the saga abulia some alternative stories 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.570
 you also have to go with your character for a map defeating the enemies and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.409
 I do not like that much 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.149
 but the good thing about the story of the dragon bolze that in I cited that they are no longer 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.830
 the alternative stories 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.170
 as for example that hunosa went badly joins you to fight against the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.010
 space warriors and instead of dying piccolo to save cohan 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.290
 dies the sae was going to man 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.290
 well there are also some other alternative stories 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.640
 now the history of the dragon bolze taboo what dictate caiz chi 3 the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.170
 history of the bolze dragon tamudo keith in cádiz cyprus for example is 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.230
 better because it's longer are all the sagas from the warriors of the 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.180
 space 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.630
 there are also some movies that have made dragon wolf eta 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.720
 as for example the fight against culer thing that does not come out in the chitac tentadero 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.000
 team also goes out when they fight broli when broli wins when you have 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.390
 to win and all the things that I could not even see because I did not have 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.010
 time and more 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.960
 let's go the story of the dragon bolze taboo plays and have cai chi 3 is better 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.800
 that the dragon dump tenkaichi tag team 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.240
 now play the combats of each game combos and all those things 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.470
 first the dragon bolze that in cai appointment team 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.330
 the best of the ten cate and cheetah they create are the combats they have very good graphics 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.710
 the same combos of the dragon taboo bolze touches and have falls and 3 but for 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.670
 example the ten cate and chita team in the same fight can fight four 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.540
 characters at the same time two are team 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.640
 You can choose how you want your ally to fight if he fights in concentration 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.480
 Norman divided 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.970
 Now the combats of the volcano dragon budokai tenkaichi 3 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.789
 in the dragon bolze tabu play and have cai chi 3 you can fight alone or with a 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.899
 relay team maximum of five players per team you can also 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.069
 make a team but with a level of strength you get more or less up to 15 points or 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.910
 more and you're choosing until your characters together have reached 15 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.499
 power points 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:16.319
 by the way 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.049
 one thing that I have not said yet the tente and cheetah believe they have no 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.200
 martial arts tournament instead the dragon bolze taboo what they dictate 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.579
 chi 3 has world martial arts tournament tournament cell tournament 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.329
 court tournament of the beyond and I think that some more than right now I do not 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.169
 agreement 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.939
 now we will compare the characters 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.349
 Tente and cheetah have very few characters and they separate us according to 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.069
 what year are they like for example as they put it in the budokai volley dragon 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.749
 tenkaichi 3 goku start goku half eye with end 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:51.949
 On the other hand, in Cádiz he mentions that not only separates vegeta explorador 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:56.199
 Well here ends this comparison between these two good games the dragon 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:03:00.499
 bolze tamudo keith in cádiz and 3 and the dragon wolfe that in caí appointment team 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.900
