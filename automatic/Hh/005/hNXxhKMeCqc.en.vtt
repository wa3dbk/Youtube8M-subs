advantage and use and a physical

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.709 
advantage and use and a physical
attacking<00:01:59.040> move<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.360> not<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.540> I'm

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
attacking move so it's not like I'm

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.630 
attacking move so it's not like I'm
forced<00:02:01.170> too<00:02:01.439> much<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.979> switch<00:02:02.219> out<00:02:02.399> that's

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
forced too much to switch out that's

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.700 
forced too much to switch out that's
what<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:03.000> about<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.420> set<00:02:03.659> although<00:02:04.560> he
