00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.830
 while the first thing I 'm going 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.180
 come make it bleed deliver a ball 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.880
 on my face the one I really like 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.720
 of these times it's the stella lily of 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.010
 at beneficial 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.790
 can I sum it up because I 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.370
 find it like a little smell 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.320
 mentouri his wife quite fresh on 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.570
 the face anyway after her pretty 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.920
 reese and their puppet stif leaves her 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.800
 at call girl who is my favorite brother 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.120
 that's how it is and I apply everywhere 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.680
 with my fingers then after that I have 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.780
 always faded with my fingers because 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.960
 that it's really secret the result the 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.059
 more natural and I find but by 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.920
 example so with this base there in 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.690
 underneath it's still so white 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.790
 rest we lose it a little dry 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.920
 after that I take back my corrector 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.570
 I like it a lot but it's 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.489
 my new collector from Max 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.589
 and the prohon way is just perfect 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.239
 perfect and then I really use them 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.440
 for all knows what I like I do not have 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.590
 need to take a dispute for 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.230
 my dark circles for my imperfections but 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.480
 to the kind sheep in my face then that 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.070
 keep it super good it's natural 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.900
 really really learns really 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.350
 a lot there is always too much in 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.430
 the pump 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.280
 unless you really have a lot 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.440
 of things to camouflage even me who is 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.270
 relatively a lot the game never does 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.200
 to finish small firefighters 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.650
 rant this country but this is a 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.900
 detail 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.070
 after that I tell myself I always follow me 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.440
 and student furniture because I like 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.880
 know about more cast iron is everywhere and 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.680
 Then I just hide the face 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.910
 with master bungle jam master jay memory pl 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.990
 is a little by the fact that every time 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.220
 I put it I think I really 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.690
 the door but hey she's fine 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.150
 addressing the gorges of countries that 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.200
 generait take mans fine arts where 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.870
 the left is beneficial because I 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.730
 restarted at and is and that's how 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.320
 then turn off rakhimov she uses 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.000
 more because I could really tan 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.070
 sting my skin is less beautiful because 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.810
 when I'm not tanning but my 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.640
 skin is less pretty name we see more the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.050
 imperfections then I find that it's 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.420
 really more beautiful with a bro ar me 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.319
 because it does not make them stand out and 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.599
 I really had a lot 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.860
 besides that I try to determine it 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.540
 although I like it a lot because he 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.019
 has been a long time since I was going so 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.910
 here we are 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.879
 after that I called my shadow my blog 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.370

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.860
 is ginger lee it's at mac just too much 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.870
 too voguing perfect the perfect what 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.159
 comes back to several people because 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.629
 I saw people with a size not 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.859
 can speak more than moir then not 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.049
 all the same hair color and 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.730
 eyes that was very very polite too 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.709
 because I was going to fall there because 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.099
 I think I gave a little 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.239
 little too much or thrown out body and that I 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.560
 have to take care of my eyebrows these people 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.079
 like that that I like most to do in 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.640
 my makeup now and I have 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.959
 restarted using this gel for 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.219
 mac in eyebrows is not 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.420
 available right now their part that 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:51.249
 upgrades are struggling to become 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.060
 permanent is not what is too good 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.709
 it's going too well 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.629
 yes I really slowly because at 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.579
 hallway to the trend is a little bit 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.920
 go for it but I really like it a lot 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.209
 the dark eyebrows the debo reprieve 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.230
 of ethnicity I think it was really 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.939
 beautiful 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.959
 after that I will not resume these gels for 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.969
 eyebrows and geese ticket a 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.159

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.920
 that she would act anastasia's concern 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.099

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.650

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.549
 badly but a real sleep you know 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.260
 this step surely if you opt 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.629
 my videos since the last three 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.430
 years it's the proportion of 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.670
 claim that one finds one's parents 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.870
 it's a monster all the bags and 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.760
 makeup kits 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.230
 it just makes lobsters 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.999
 your because they really like each other 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.319
 a long time and it's perfect if you have 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:38.529
 eye shadows a little better than 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.409
 me 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:43.450
 the eyelids not right after that I 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:46.299
 have take the body and to all thomas 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.769
 store a june but prefer the high 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.159
 level but this favorite theme since 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.919
 always 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.659
 then apply on my eyelid 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.609
 it's the quartet the words from your home 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.480
 wish I liked a lot but I 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.180
 took the cross that was still a 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.700
 little top so my old bridge in earlier 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.560
 was early it's just our other 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.340
 especially says above 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.120
 map to Toulouse and that I do it that 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.669
 still enough evry center in English 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.739
 we are my mobile eyelid 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.139
 after that I bought some said embroiderer 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.459
 it's the brother or there 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.840
 once again in the hollow of my 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.030
 eye for whom it gives a small aspect 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.370
 a little more cruel because I do not like 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.039
 it just colors 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.330
 I find it's too much that I too 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.370
 I take the loire and darker who 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.379
 was like a little bit early again 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.270
 I apply myself to a colleague more I 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.710
 come dimmed because I did not have the 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.930
 proper brushes really because 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.629
 I was washing and it's in 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.219
 drying up my proofs that I'm putting 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:45.069
 the colour beige 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:46.389
 I think you 're dull yeah but 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.599
 maybe earlier this week 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.069
 always in this quartet the in the corner 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.650
 internal of my eye the more I took the 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:57.400
 cross that was like bluish in the bottom 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.930
 of my eye and then I apply tired after that 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.979
 I did not understand anything but sure 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.169
 always it's really safe 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.120
 pharmacy you have not yet how 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.960
 that because we do not know anything anymore 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.330
 did not know Tuesday 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.210
 it makes all the difference then 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.750
 lately I started using the 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.449
 fund 6 years old and scare I'm like 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.800
 3,4 on earth but I like it a lot 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.020
 I find that mascara that although 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.949
 meanwhile m several layers what 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.330
 I do not find it more moderate at 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.699
 country like China to yellow apply 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.349
 this gloss them from vauxhall and if I 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.520
 do not abuse me 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.469
 because it's an ad and samantha 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.750
 between any class you 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:36.310
 want the kit a little named I advise 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.349
 strongly boxing clubs oms and the 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.529
 the best in the world while there you go 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.310
 that's all for makeup 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:43.569
 I really like everything that is at most 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.509
 high for next fall winter 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.279
 carrasso was so and for my hair 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.529
 let's throw a little lazy for them 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.669
 hair there jesus let air dry 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.020
 just because you are a lot 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.089
 too hot for anything in 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.740
 my apartment 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:59.229
 m after that I never knew how to commit 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.520
 like the abs in hand I opted for my 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.080
 favorite player and then a sweater that 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.789
 I really like that's how I do you 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.219
 represents and this a little more everything to 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.569
 the time I say is to take me a 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:08.169
 long what was long that 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.939
 I had not done 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.080
 then I will try this nail polish there since 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:15.599
 a moment but it never made me 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.599
 really to give a polish 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.410
 I see some of my others all the 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.910
 mine things I found he's going 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.590
 to be in the information bar of the bo 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.660
 like but I do almost always 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.910
 it's just a very dark gray that's 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.320
 really really worth it so here I am the 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.360
 lose all the angles you go I'm going out 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.919
 the first layer but I always do 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.030
 always left even though it's rather 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.200
 at Easter because I think it makes 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:39.919
 really a nicer finish like them 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.919
 nothing and it is reliable 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:54.370
 it must be acoss yes in needham so much 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.110
 that's the result I really like 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.700
 a lot what gives it because 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.200
 that it's really perfect for this 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.240
 autumn and this winter for my childhood 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.550

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.100
