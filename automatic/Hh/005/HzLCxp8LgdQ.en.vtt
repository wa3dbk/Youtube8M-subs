section of this review is build quality
now<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:41.120> this<00:02:41.960> section<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.770> actually<00:02:43.130> did<00:02:43.490> very

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
now in this section it actually did very

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.110 
now in this section it actually did very
well<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:43.970> was<00:02:44.210> expecting<00:02:45.310> not<00:02:46.310> very<00:02:46.670> good

well I was expecting not very good
results<00:02:47.630> but<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:49.520> feels<00:02:50.000> extremely<00:02:50.450> solid<00:02:51.290> i

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
results but it feels extremely solid i

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.160 
results but it feels extremely solid i
clawed<00:02:52.070> sennheisers<00:02:52.730> job<00:02:52.970> with<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.660> it

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170

audio<00:03:13.730> quality<00:03:13.910> now<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:14.720> tested<00:03:15.320> these<00:03:15.560> with<00:03:16.370> a

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
audio quality now I tested these with a

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.280 
audio quality now I tested these with a
mobile<00:03:17.000> device<00:03:17.510> my<00:03:17.870> iphone<00:03:18.290> 4s<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:20.450> tested

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
mobile device my iphone 4s and I tested

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.820 
mobile device my iphone 4s and I tested
it<00:03:21.410> with<00:03:21.680> my<00:03:22.040> fiio<00:03:22.700> e5<00:03:23.390> headphone<00:03:24.350> amplifier

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
it with my fiio e5 headphone amplifier

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.660 
it with my fiio e5 headphone amplifier
and<00:03:25.570> i<00:03:26.570> found<00:03:27.200> out<00:03:27.350> that<00:03:27.410> these<00:03:27.920> do<00:03:28.190> not<00:03:28.220> need

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
and i found out that these do not need

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.850 
and i found out that these do not need
an<00:03:28.880> amplifier<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.540> drive<00:03:29.780> them<00:03:30.050> you<00:03:30.260> all<00:03:30.709> you

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
an amplifier to drive them you all you

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.220 
an amplifier to drive them you all you
need<00:03:30.890> is<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> mobile<00:03:31.610> device<00:03:31.940> so<00:03:32.239> your<00:03:32.750> iPhone

except for really funds with really bad
audio<00:03:41.269> output<00:03:41.870> like<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.140> blackberry<00:03:42.650> or

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
audio output like a blackberry or

iPod of something do with suffice for
these<00:03:55.670> headphones<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:56.750> don't<00:03:56.959> need<00:03:57.110> an

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
these headphones you don't need an

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.729 
these headphones you don't need an
amplifier<00:03:58.459> for<00:03:58.610> this<00:03:58.820> but<00:03:59.420> if<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.530> really

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
amplifier for this but if you really

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.370 
amplifier for this but if you really
want<00:04:01.070> to<00:04:01.160> eat<00:04:01.790> cat<00:04:02.090> doesn't<00:04:02.390> prove<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:03.019> little

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
want to eat cat doesn't prove a little

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.840 
want to eat cat doesn't prove a little
bit<00:04:03.560> but<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:05.030> really<00:04:05.269> don't<00:04:05.510> need<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:06.850> when

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
bit but you really don't need it so when

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.289 
bit but you really don't need it so when
I<00:04:07.940> tested<00:04:08.209> these<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.600> found<00:04:09.080> us<00:04:10.010> as<00:04:10.549> expected

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
I tested these I found us as expected

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.910 
I tested these I found us as expected
the<00:04:11.510> mids<00:04:12.110> and<00:04:12.230> highs<00:04:12.400> were<00:04:14.230> astounding<00:04:15.230> the
