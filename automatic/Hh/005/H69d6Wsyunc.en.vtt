little contraption I built using

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.580 
little contraption I built using
trapdoors<00:00:22.180> everyone<00:00:23.140> was<00:00:23.230> thinking<00:00:23.350> of<00:00:23.560> a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
trapdoors everyone was thinking of a

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.830 
trapdoors everyone was thinking of a
drawbridge<00:00:24.130> but<00:00:24.550> um<00:00:24.730> you<00:00:25.330> guys<00:00:25.450> remember<00:00:25.690> that

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
drawbridge but um you guys remember that

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.810 
drawbridge but um you guys remember that
old-school<00:00:26.380> trap<00:00:26.890> where<00:00:27.130> you<00:00:27.250> would<00:00:27.430> lure<00:00:27.670> the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
old-school trap where you would lure the

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.400 
old-school trap where you would lure the
monsters<00:00:28.330> jump<00:00:28.540> on<00:00:28.690> the<00:00:28.810> ladders<00:00:29.200> and<00:00:29.350> they

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
monsters jump on the ladders and they

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.230 
monsters jump on the ladders and they
would<00:00:29.529> fall<00:00:29.710> into<00:00:29.830> the<00:00:29.980> water<00:00:30.060> that's<00:00:31.060> what

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
would fall into the water that's what

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.880 
would fall into the water that's what
kind<00:00:31.510> of<00:00:31.570> what<00:00:31.660> I<00:00:31.720> was<00:00:31.810> going<00:00:31.990> for<00:00:32.140> like<00:00:32.440> you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
kind of what I was going for like you

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.770 
kind of what I was going for like you
lure<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.309> monsters<00:00:33.790> like<00:00:34.030> right<00:00:34.300> here<00:00:34.510> run

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
lure the monsters like right here run

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.810 
lure the monsters like right here run
over<00:00:34.930> it<00:00:35.170> and<00:00:35.680> then<00:00:35.800> jump<00:00:36.100> back<00:00:36.190> on<00:00:36.489> and<00:00:36.790> then

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
over it and then jump back on and then

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.190 
over it and then jump back on and then
there's<00:00:37.090> pressure<00:00:37.300> plates<00:00:37.570> on<00:00:37.690> both<00:00:37.870> sides

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
there's pressure plates on both sides

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.619 
there's pressure plates on both sides
that<00:00:38.470> way<00:00:38.590> if<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.280> monster<00:00:39.640> still<00:00:39.910> alive<00:00:40.239> or

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
that way if the monster still alive or

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.900 
that way if the monster still alive or
if<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.590> pressure<00:00:41.920> plates<00:00:42.160> close<00:00:42.460> too<00:00:42.699> soon

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
if the pressure plates close too soon

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.540 
if the pressure plates close too soon
you<00:00:43.300> still<00:00:43.510> have<00:00:43.629> these<00:00:43.780> ones<00:00:44.080> these<00:00:44.860> pressure

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
you still have these ones these pressure

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.950 
you still have these ones these pressure
plates<00:00:45.850> but<00:00:46.000> you<00:00:46.150> can<00:00:46.300> make<00:00:46.360> it<00:00:46.540> one<00:00:46.690> higher

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
plates but you can make it one higher

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.079 
plates but you can make it one higher
basically<00:00:47.949> there's<00:00:48.129> redstone<00:00:48.610> going<00:00:48.909> all

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
basically there's redstone going all

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.210 
basically there's redstone going all
around<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.809> then<00:00:50.290> there's<00:00:50.470> two<00:00:50.650> ladders<00:00:50.890> on

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
around and then there's two ladders on

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.649 
around and then there's two ladders on
these<00:00:51.400> two<00:00:51.640> will<00:00:51.879> block<00:00:52.150> when<00:00:52.390> it's<00:00:52.479> pressure

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
these two will block when it's pressure

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.619 
these two will block when it's pressure
plates<00:00:52.900> on<00:00:53.019> the<00:00:53.080> top<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.530> then<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:55.449> have<00:00:55.600> your

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
plates on the top and then you have your

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.960 
plates on the top and then you have your
basic<00:00:56.019> mob<00:00:56.500> grinder<00:00:56.830> down<00:00:57.250> there<00:00:57.309> like<00:00:57.729> it

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
basic mob grinder down there like it

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.689 
basic mob grinder down there like it
leads<00:00:58.330> into<00:00:58.479> water<00:00:58.930> and<00:00:59.290> then<00:00:59.589> I'll<00:01:00.430> go<00:01:00.550> the

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
leads into water and then I'll go the

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.790 
leads into water and then I'll go the
other<00:01:00.729> way<00:01:00.940> until<00:01:01.390> you<00:01:01.510> see<00:01:02.199> I<00:01:02.229> got<00:01:02.409> this<00:01:02.440> cool

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
other way until you see I got this cool

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.219 
other way until you see I got this cool
wool<00:01:03.220> house<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:03.820> trans<00:01:04.059> thingamajiggy<00:01:04.360> and

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
wool house and trans thingamajiggy and

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.780 
wool house and trans thingamajiggy and
then<00:01:06.130> also<00:01:06.580> I<00:01:06.880> have<00:01:07.000> an<00:01:07.090> item<00:01:07.450> switch<00:01:07.720> control

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
then also I have an item switch control

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.660 
then also I have an item switch control
which<00:01:09.790> is<00:01:10.030> just<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.479> random<00:01:11.080> thing<00:01:11.310> come<00:01:12.310> on<00:01:12.430> get

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
which is just a random thing come on get

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.750 
which is just a random thing come on get
up<00:01:12.930> alright<00:01:13.930> let<00:01:14.110> me<00:01:14.140> break<00:01:14.409> this<00:01:14.440> flaw<00:01:14.890> see

up alright let me break this flaw see

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.850 
up alright let me break this flaw see
there's<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.150> mob<00:01:16.540> grinder<00:01:16.810> right<00:01:17.110> here<00:01:17.350> mobs

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
there's a mob grinder right here mobs

there's a mob grinder right here mobs
come<00:01:18.190> in<00:01:18.369> get<00:01:19.030> grinded<00:01:19.509> up<00:01:19.600> by<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:19.810> lava<00:01:20.170> the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
come in get grinded up by a lava the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.340 
come in get grinded up by a lava the
trap<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.579> stuff<00:01:21.939> flows<00:01:22.270> down<00:01:22.539> here<00:01:22.899> wait<00:01:23.200> I'll
