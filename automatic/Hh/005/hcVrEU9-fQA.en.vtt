00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
for this tutorial I'm going to make a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.480 
for this tutorial I'm going to make a
skirt<00:00:19.830> very<00:00:20.100> small<00:00:20.400> girl<00:00:20.840> and<00:00:21.840> she<00:00:22.350> has<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> 26

skirt very small girl and she has a 26

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.910 
skirt very small girl and she has a 26
inch<00:00:23.760> waist<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.570> your<00:00:24.750> fabric<00:00:25.080> should<00:00:25.769> be

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
inch waist and your fabric should be

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.669 
inch waist and your fabric should be
two-and-a-half<00:00:26.550> times<00:00:28.369> that<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.609> width<00:00:30.000> so

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
two-and-a-half times that in width so

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.530 
two-and-a-half times that in width so
two-and-a-half<00:00:31.679> times<00:00:31.920> her<00:00:32.369> 26<00:00:33.000> inch<00:00:33.210> waist

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
two-and-a-half times her 26 inch waist

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.389 
two-and-a-half times her 26 inch waist
it's<00:00:34.079> 65<00:00:35.040> inches<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.450> I'm<00:00:36.660> gonna<00:00:36.750> take<00:00:37.079> 65<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
it's 65 inches so I'm gonna take 65 and

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.780 
it's 65 inches so I'm gonna take 65 and
divide<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.030> by<00:00:39.090> two<00:00:39.649> that<00:00:40.649> gives<00:00:40.860> me<00:00:41.040> 32<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
divide that by two that gives me 32 and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.910 
divide that by two that gives me 32 and
a<00:00:41.850> half<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.540> means<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.840> need<00:00:42.899> two<00:00:43.290> pieces

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
a half so that means I need two pieces

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.299 
a half so that means I need two pieces
of<00:00:44.190> fabric<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.360> are<00:00:45.629> 32<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> half<00:00:46.739> inches

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
of fabric that are 32 and a half inches

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.360 
of fabric that are 32 and a half inches
wide<00:00:47.809> for<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> length<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.770> length<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.190> going

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
wide for the length the length is going

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.790 
wide for the length the length is going
to<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.550> custom<00:00:51.120> however<00:00:51.449> however<00:00:51.960> long<00:00:52.410> that

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
to be custom however however long that

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.250

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
her knee and that gave me 10 inches and

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.509 
her knee and that gave me 10 inches and
so<00:01:03.359> whatever<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:04.199> measurement<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:05.070> you're

that<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.340> seam<00:01:08.640> allowances<00:01:11.210> then<00:01:12.210> you're

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that for seam allowances then you're

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.170 
that for seam allowances then you're
going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.689> need<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.500> measure<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.520> elastic

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.420 
going to need to measure for the elastic
and<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.259> way<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.439> do<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.040> take<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
around okay now our next step is to flip

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.760 
around okay now our next step is to flip
the<00:03:37.060> fabric<00:03:37.240> so<00:03:37.630> that<00:03:37.780> your<00:03:37.900> pen<00:03:38.200> den<00:03:38.410> is<00:03:38.590> down

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
here and we're gonna start working on

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.160 
here and we're gonna start working on

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
before we're gonna flip this down about

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.130 
before we're gonna flip this down about
a<00:03:46.300> quarter<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.690> an<00:03:46.840> inch<00:03:46.990> and<00:03:47.440> iron<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.520> down<00:03:49.140> do

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
a quarter of an inch and iron it down do

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.330 
a quarter of an inch and iron it down do
this<00:03:50.350> all<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.890> way<00:03:51.010> around<00:03:52.830> okay<00:03:53.830> our<00:03:54.310> next

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
this all the way around okay our next

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.820 
this all the way around okay our next
step<00:03:54.970> is<00:03:55.180> going<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.660> be<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:56.710> make<00:03:56.860> this<00:03:58.830> casing

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
step is going to be to make this casing

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.550 
step is going to be to make this casing
for<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.100> elastic<00:04:00.940> waistband<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.110> what<00:04:02.290> we<00:04:02.410> do

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
for the elastic waistband so what we do

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.880 
for the elastic waistband so what we do
now<00:04:02.860> is<00:04:03.040> we're<00:04:03.250> going<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.930> flip<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.350> top<00:04:05.590> part

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
now is we're going to flip the top part

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.430 
now is we're going to flip the top part
down<00:04:05.950> I'm<00:04:06.580> using<00:04:07.000> half<00:04:07.330> inch<00:04:07.510> elastic<00:04:08.080> so<00:04:08.410> I

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
down I'm using half inch elastic so I

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.220 
down I'm using half inch elastic so I
probably<00:04:08.710> want<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:09.010> make<00:04:09.190> this<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:10.900> fold

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
probably want to make this this fold

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.930 
probably want to make this this fold
about<00:04:11.500> three-quarters<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.190> an<00:04:12.400> inch<00:04:12.460> to<00:04:12.670> one

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
about three-quarters of an inch to one

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.570 
about three-quarters of an inch to one
inch<00:04:13.560> it's<00:04:14.560> just<00:04:14.710> gonna<00:04:14.830> depend<00:04:15.130> on<00:04:15.250> what<00:04:15.310> size

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
inch it's just gonna depend on what size

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.520 
inch it's just gonna depend on what size
elastic<00:04:15.850> you<00:04:16.270> use<00:04:16.480> you<00:04:16.690> want<00:04:16.900> it<00:04:17.020> to<00:04:17.230> be<00:04:17.350> big

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
enough that you can move the elastic

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.849 
enough that you can move the elastic
through<00:04:19.239> here<00:04:19.630> but<00:04:20.109> you<00:04:20.260> don't<00:04:20.500> want<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.710> leave

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
through here but you don't want to leave

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.190 
through here but you don't want to leave

it make it so big that the elastic can
slip<00:04:23.440> or<00:04:23.590> move<00:04:23.710> around<00:04:23.950> so<00:04:24.790> iron<00:04:25.750> down<00:04:26.140> this

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380
