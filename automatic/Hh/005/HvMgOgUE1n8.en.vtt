 8 teams is the 40 degrees 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.230
 the clock 30 degrees is just a quick spin, which is twenty minutes 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.430
 I do not know that, but for that walter device the manual catches the area 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.820
 see is also old by in other words outdoor was 30 degrees if you know 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.360

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.179
 they need more opposition intensive and wash 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.950
 then have 12 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.290
 indoor sports yes there is of course 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.720
 really leko points slightly less intensive 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.790
 slightly shorter 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.910
 well again we become the wallet and then another 13 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.109
 the sports shoes 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.810
 yes that is a special program 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.650
 he does that because he will do it exactly as soon as you get one on each side 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.420
 sneakers come to sit there are more I do not say that they close booked 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.420
 not and what to think 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.139
 look tricky here but also get the ad I wrote a bit 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.889
 when then with this button you can still guess what intention for a later 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:38.319
 it was rather strong little extra a column is you want a pump I scissors 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.319
 let them really rinse those soap scraps and remove them 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.689
 can of course also be able to iron well 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.709
 then it is possible then he had nothing less to melbourne 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.819
 it's damp, renkum is a bit easier 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.239
 and if you also like the temperature 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.560
 If you want to change something, you can also adjust the thermometer with an easy one 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.480
 and if you also want to adjust the rev counter yourself, it is possible on it 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.980
 wash this button you also do not see it rotate fourteen hundred a week 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.749
 say 800 oene and then these machines are completely adjusted as in your own you 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.749
 would like to wait 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:20.860
 this machine also has delayed start time and easy clock 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.020
 the button can be up to 24 hours away from HD traffic only want seven hours 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.400
 let run your energy during off-peak hours so let these young people 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.819
 think along again 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.819
 9 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.989
 japan gives this machine i buy time because it made strong to win the kilo 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.019
 to wash with you that it was less good then it is also what we quickly finished 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.159
 look but normally the program is a new and 56 minutes and lost ecotuin 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.419
 a little less than an hour 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.430
 38 points 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.430
 and that's how bad the wallet gets 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.859
 to leave the sea on the left it has become the furrow 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.789
 with you the music 2 there is the hand wash and on the right it holds the 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.419
 fabric softener the sea plates of course 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.209
 in the measures 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.889
 briefly with jesse the cleaner the inside a disaster then this puddle remains 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.169
 was leaking in the west 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.990
 yes and to keep this boy in top condition does a little month against it 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.419
 schedule such alarms off bottom all 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.949
 and from then on you see a right that stated they wanted to tackle once 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.650
 turn over alcohol to leave of course along with a suit you are also unworthy of 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.400
 make the german bild a point 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.919
 4 and it's laundry 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:40.819
 capiau 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.270
 because then this boy will always miss them 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.419
 top condition yes look how you can do this for the extra accessories below 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.449
 on the page as for example art a bullet through its sphere 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.040
 the participants 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.850
 Put the load meter for your dictator dusts for example the thinnest 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.229

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.659
 You can put it in nicely and then he talks in the washing machine 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:13.659
 the fed our office continued maintenance two years in advance 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.800
 if the hose hit the leak that no later it turned out that he could run the 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.289
 polanski attorneys were required for maintenance 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.949
 and who can read additional guarantees in our store that you do not 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.999
 the annual cost in a bud is going to get the connecting piece between dry
