00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.520 
and you think it's going to run any
throws<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.880> pop<00:03:42.060> passes<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.660> tight<00:03:42.900> end<00:03:43.170> and

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
throws the pop passes the tight end and

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.320 
throws the pop passes the tight end and
you<00:03:44.070> know<00:03:44.220> things<00:03:44.490> like<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:44.880> they're<00:03:45.180> so

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
you know things like that they're so

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.810 
you know things like that they're so
patient<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.020> I<00:03:46.440> can<00:03:47.160> say<00:03:47.280> they<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:47.580> fit

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
patient and I can say they just fit

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.140 
patient and I can say they just fit
their<00:03:48.030> personnel<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.790> guess<00:03:51.000> they

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
their personnel and I guess they

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.949 
their personnel and I guess they
recruited<00:03:51.630> that<00:03:51.720> personnel<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.560> don't<00:03:53.280> think

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
recruited that personnel I don't think

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.030 
recruited that personnel I don't think
coach<00:03:54.959> Snyder<00:03:55.170> wants<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.590> run<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.740> spread

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
coach Snyder wants to run the spread

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.820 
coach Snyder wants to run the spread
