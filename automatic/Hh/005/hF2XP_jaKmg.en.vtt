bow direction and bow arm movement in

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.790 
bow direction and bow arm movement in
previous<00:00:13.809> segments<00:00:14.410> we<00:00:14.620> touched<00:00:15.580> upon

said that it was very important to curl
our<00:00:23.439> fingers<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:25.029> the<00:00:25.180> bow<00:00:25.359> arm<00:00:25.689> and<00:00:26.099> then<00:00:27.099> we

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
our fingers on the bow arm and then we

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.220 
our fingers on the bow arm and then we
also<00:00:27.460> said<00:00:27.820> it<00:00:27.939> was<00:00:28.029> very<00:00:28.090> important<00:00:28.779> to<00:00:28.960> stay

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
also said it was very important to stay

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.960 
also said it was very important to stay
in<00:00:29.500> Lane<00:00:30.250> two

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
in Lane two

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.280 
in Lane two
like<00:00:31.720> this<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:33.820> something<00:00:34.390> else<00:00:34.600> very

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
like this but something else very

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.069 
like this but something else very
important<00:00:36.070> in<00:00:36.250> order<00:00:36.760> for<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.329> bow<00:00:37.480> not<00:00:37.809> to

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
important in order for the bow not to

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.639 
important in order for the bow not to
slide<00:00:38.530> you<00:00:39.250> know<00:00:39.399> like<00:00:39.670> this<00:00:40.620> because<00:00:41.620> that

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
slide you know like this because that

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.100 
slide you know like this because that
won't<00:00:42.100> give<00:00:42.250> you<00:00:42.340> a<00:00:42.370> good<00:00:42.520> sound<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.750> very

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
won't give you a good sound the very

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.139 
won't give you a good sound the very
important<00:00:44.739> thing<00:00:45.010> that<00:00:45.039> you<00:00:45.340> also<00:00:45.640> have<00:00:46.000> to

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
important thing that you also have to

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.270 
important thing that you also have to
think<00:00:46.329> about<00:00:46.629> besides<00:00:46.870> staying<00:00:47.590> in<00:00:47.770> Lane<00:00:47.980> two

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
think about besides staying in Lane two

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.450 
think about besides staying in Lane two
is<00:00:48.750> how<00:00:49.750> your<00:00:50.170> bow<00:00:50.500> arm<00:00:51.460> is<00:00:52.050> moving<00:00:53.100> down<00:00:54.100> and

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
is how your bow arm is moving down and

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.410 
is how your bow arm is moving down and
how<00:00:55.449> is<00:00:55.629> it<00:00:55.660> moving<00:00:55.960> up<00:00:56.410> I<00:00:57.190> like<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:58.030> think<00:00:58.329> of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
how is it moving up I like to think of

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.000 
how is it moving up I like to think of
it<00:00:58.629> like<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.960> when<00:01:01.960> your<00:01:02.199> bow<00:01:02.410> is<00:01:02.710> at<00:01:02.859> the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
it like this when your bow is at the

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.070 
it like this when your bow is at the
Frog<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.600> sort<00:01:05.019> of<00:01:05.140> make<00:01:05.440> a<00:01:05.710> little<00:01:06.399> triangle

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
Frog you sort of make a little triangle

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.609 
Frog you sort of make a little triangle
with<00:01:08.080> your<00:01:08.289> arm<00:01:08.619> and<00:01:09.840> your<00:01:10.840> body<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.470> your

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
with your arm and your body and your

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.389 
with your arm and your body and your
instrument<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:12.569> then<00:01:13.800> when<00:01:14.800> you<00:01:14.979> pull<00:01:15.250> the

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
instrument and then when you pull the

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.639 
instrument and then when you pull the
bow<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:18.250> stop<00:01:18.849> at<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.149> middle<00:01:19.420> you're<00:01:20.140> making

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
bow and stop at the middle you're making

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:26.609 
bow and stop at the middle you're making
a<00:01:20.770> square<00:01:22.289> four<00:01:23.289> sides<00:01:23.679> right<00:01:24.640> here<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:25.619> then

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
a square four sides right here and then

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.740 
a square four sides right here and then
when<00:01:27.130> you<00:01:27.250> reach<00:01:27.459> the<00:01:27.729> tip<00:01:30.270> you're<00:01:31.270> making<00:01:31.660> a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
when you reach the tip you're making a

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.050 
when you reach the tip you're making a
big<00:01:32.020> triangle<00:01:33.179> so<00:01:34.179> it's<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.569> small<00:01:34.929> triangle

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
big triangle so it's the small triangle

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.919 
big triangle so it's the small triangle
to<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.209> square<00:01:37.569> to<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.319> big<00:01:38.590> triangle<00:01:38.950> and

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
to the square to the big triangle and

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.059 
to the square to the big triangle and
that<00:01:40.929> will<00:01:41.890> give<00:01:42.190> you<00:01:42.459> a<00:01:42.729> beautiful<00:01:44.069> straight

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
that will give you a beautiful straight

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:46.889 
that will give you a beautiful straight
bow<00:01:45.340> as<00:01:45.640> well<00:01:45.670> as<00:01:46.149> thinking<00:01:46.450> about<00:01:46.720> these

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
bow as well as thinking about these

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:59.410 
bow as well as thinking about these
other<00:01:47.140> things<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:48.130> here<00:01:48.429> it<00:01:48.520> is

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.560 

okay<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.479> those<00:02:00.900> are<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> shapes<00:02:01.650> of<00:02:02.330> your<00:02:03.330> arm

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
okay so those are the shapes of your arm

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.899 
okay so those are the shapes of your arm
that<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.680> important<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.549> when<00:02:05.759> you're

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
that is important to know when you're

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.559 
that is important to know when you're
doing<00:02:06.090> bow<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:07.399> direction<00:02:08.399> there's<00:02:09.209> also

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
doing bow a direction there's also

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.510 
doing bow a direction there's also
something<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.319> need<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.709> think<00:02:10.950> about<00:02:11.099> in

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
something you need to think about in

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.750 
something you need to think about in
terms<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.360> your<00:02:12.510> elbow<00:02:13.080> your<00:02:13.680> elbow<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.489> going

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
terms of your elbow your elbow is going

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.820 
terms of your elbow your elbow is going
to<00:02:14.910> pull<00:02:15.180> back<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:19.230> when<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.620> get<00:02:19.770> to

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
to pull back and that when you get to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.190 
to pull back and that when you get to
the<00:02:20.100> middle<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.000> then<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:21.780> going<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.959> pull

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
the middle and then it's going to pull

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.320 
the middle and then it's going to pull
forward<00:02:24.140> or<00:02:25.140> push<00:02:25.500> forward<00:02:25.970> when<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.090> get<00:02:27.209> to

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
forward or push forward when you get to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.900 
forward or push forward when you get to
the<00:02:27.480> tip<00:02:27.690> when<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.860> go<00:02:29.010> back<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.670> middle

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
the tip when you go back to the middle

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.509 
the tip when you go back to the middle
on<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.090> up<00:02:30.239> bow<00:02:30.540> your<00:02:31.500> elbow<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.130> going<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.370> go

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
on the up bow your elbow is going to go

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.949 
on the up bow your elbow is going to go
back<00:02:32.790> again<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:35.220> then<00:02:36.090> when<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.390> get<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
back again and then when you get to the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.890 
back again and then when you get to the
Frog<00:02:37.410> it's<00:02:37.860> going<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.730> come<00:02:39.000> forward<00:02:41.569> all<00:02:42.569> of

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
Frog it's going to come forward all of

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.780 
Frog it's going to come forward all of
these<00:02:43.080> things<00:02:43.470> work<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:44.040> conjunction<00:02:44.310> with

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
these things work in conjunction with

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.150 
these things work in conjunction with
each<00:02:44.940> other<00:02:45.299> but<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:46.080> is<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.380> good<00:02:46.739> idea<00:02:46.860> to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
each other but it is a good idea to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.250 
each other but it is a good idea to
practice<00:02:47.370> all<00:02:47.790> these<00:02:48.060> steps<00:02:48.360> separately<00:02:49.019> and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
practice all these steps separately and

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.559 
practice all these steps separately and
then<00:02:49.890> when<00:02:50.220> you're<00:02:50.519> comfortable<00:02:50.850> with<00:02:51.269> one

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
then when you're comfortable with one
