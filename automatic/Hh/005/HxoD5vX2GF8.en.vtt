with that shield set my 3d asses are
here<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.840> some<00:02:04.500> zelda<00:02:04.710> wii<00:02:04.920> u<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.790> items

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
here and some zelda wii u and we items

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.540 
here and some zelda wii u and we items
actually<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:07.530> i<00:02:07.560> think<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.950> goal<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.399> what<00:02:08.520> i

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
actually so i think the goal of what i

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.219 
actually so i think the goal of what i
would<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.030> do<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.390> make<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:09.780> into<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
would like to do is make this into a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.170 
would like to do is make this into a
zelda<00:02:10.770> wall<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.730> would<00:02:11.819> only<00:02:12.000> be

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
zelda wall and that would only be

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.350 
zelda wall and that would only be
appropriate<00:02:12.629> if<00:02:12.720> i<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> zelda

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
appropriate if i have a zelda

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.300 
appropriate if i have a zelda
all<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.540> have<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> Mario<00:02:14.290> wall<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.830> it's<00:02:15.070> nearly

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
all to have a Mario wall and it's nearly

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.760 
all to have a Mario wall and it's nearly
there<00:02:15.580> already<00:02:16.290> what<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.500> will<00:02:17.650> basically

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
there already what that will basically

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.070 
there already what that will basically
entail<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.430> moving<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:18.730> Zelda<00:02:19.240> Legend<00:02:19.630> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
entail is moving this Zelda Legend the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.570 
entail is moving this Zelda Legend the
history<00:02:20.470> poster<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.980> think<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.340> will

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
history poster I think that will

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.220 
history poster I think that will
probably<00:02:21.790> go<00:02:22.030> in<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.240> middle<00:02:22.510> over<00:02:22.780> here<00:02:23.080> and

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
probably go in the middle over here and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.530 
probably go in the middle over here and
then<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.890> big<00:02:24.160> 25th<00:02:24.640> anniversary<00:02:25.180> poster

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
then that big 25th anniversary poster

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.770 
then that big 25th anniversary poster
will<00:02:25.690> likely<00:02:25.930> being<00:02:26.290> moved<00:02:26.620> over<00:02:27.460> here<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:28.240> it

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
will likely being moved over here and it

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.180 
will likely being moved over here and it
will<00:02:28.810> definitely<00:02:29.320> fit<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.680> pretty<00:02:29.890> well<00:02:30.010> in

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
will definitely fit in pretty well in

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.580 
will definitely fit in pretty well in
that<00:02:30.280> Zelda<00:02:30.640> little<00:02:30.880> corner<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.260> Mario

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
that Zelda little corner so the Mario

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.050 
that Zelda little corner so the Mario
history<00:02:32.890> poster<00:02:33.220> will<00:02:33.310> probably<00:02:33.610> also<00:02:33.760> go<00:02:33.970> in

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
history poster will probably also go in

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.670 
history poster will probably also go in
the<00:02:34.150> middle<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.930> means<00:02:35.170> i<00:02:35.290> need<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.500> put

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
the middle and that means i need to put

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.650 
the middle and that means i need to put
up<00:02:35.830> two<00:02:36.040> other<00:02:36.190> Mario<00:02:36.460> posters<00:02:36.880> on<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.330> wall
