00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
looks like that goes along here and then

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.770 
looks like that goes along here and then
when<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.070> flip<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> out<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.939> other<00:01:27.030> way<00:01:27.180> I'll

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
when we flip it out the other way I'll

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.960 
when we flip it out the other way I'll
show<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.259> already<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.650> done<00:01:28.970> it's

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
show you what I already have done it's

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.380 
show you what I already have done it's
going<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.180> wind<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.570> looking<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:32.450> this

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.480 

see<00:01:38.390> where<00:01:38.570> you've<00:01:38.689> pinned<00:01:39.110> all<00:01:40.070> of<00:01:40.100> them<00:01:40.310> down

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
see where you've pinned all of them down

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.929 
see where you've pinned all of them down
here<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.689> then<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.930> outside<00:01:42.640> will<00:01:43.640> look<00:01:43.789> like

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
here and then the outside will look like

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.109 
here and then the outside will look like
this<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:44.689> you<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.619> term<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.159> this<00:01:46.429> is<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:46.640> it

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
this so you the term of this is that it

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.169 
this so you the term of this is that it
retains<00:01:47.719> the<00:01:48.380> original<00:01:48.740> hem<00:01:49.549> on<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.880> bottom

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
retains the original hem on the bottom

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.690 
retains the original hem on the bottom
so<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.659> doesn't<00:01:50.990> have<00:01:51.140> that<00:01:51.289> homemade<00:01:51.799> look<00:01:52.159> at

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
so it doesn't have that homemade look at

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.559 
so it doesn't have that homemade look at
the<00:01:52.850> bottom<00:01:53.060> where<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:53.240> can<00:01:53.360> tell<00:01:53.539> that

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
the bottom where you can tell that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.359 
the bottom where you can tell that
somebody<00:01:53.929> is<00:01:54.140> hemmed<00:01:54.439> their<00:01:54.740> own<00:01:54.860> pants<00:01:55.250> but

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
somebody is hemmed their own pants but

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.630 
somebody is hemmed their own pants but

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
it's got that tight and slightly worn

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.940 
it's got that tight and slightly worn
bottom<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.479> then<00:01:59.960> you'll<00:02:00.079> just<00:02:00.229> see<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.469> little

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950
