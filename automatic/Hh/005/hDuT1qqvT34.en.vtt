Edison's<00:00:27.210> invention<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> phonograph

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
Edison's invention of the phonograph

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.800 
Edison's invention of the phonograph
this<00:00:29.220> was<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> breakthrough<00:00:29.820> but<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.539> still

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
this was a breakthrough but it still

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.269 
this was a breakthrough but it still
required<00:00:31.170> all<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.470> musicians<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:32.160> play

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
required all the musicians to play

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.819 
required all the musicians to play
perfectly<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:33.030> together<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:34.350> couldn't<00:00:34.649> back

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
perfectly all together you couldn't back

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.500 
perfectly all together you couldn't back
up<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.399> couldn't<00:00:35.640> edit<00:00:35.820> specific
