00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
so um one thing i did was this is the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.030 
so um one thing i did was this is the
Santa<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.340> used<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.150> his<00:01:43.110> face<00:01:43.710> just

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
Santa that I used and his face just

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.310 
Santa that I used and his face just
looked<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.460> little<00:01:44.670> bit<00:01:44.880> small<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:46.049> just

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
looked a little bit small so I just

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.469 
looked a little bit small so I just
punched<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.340> bigger<00:01:47.549> faces

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
punched out one of the bigger faces

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.280 
punched out one of the bigger faces
that's<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> die-cuts<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:51.780> sucked<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
that's in the die-cuts and I sucked the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.800 
that's in the die-cuts and I sucked the
bigger<00:01:52.860> face<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.399> there<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.119> don't<00:01:54.720> know<00:01:54.780> I

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
bigger face on there so I don't know I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.240 
bigger face on there so I don't know I
just<00:01:54.990> thought<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.470> looked<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.740> little<00:01:55.890> bit<00:01:56.100> more

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
just thought it looked a little bit more

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.340 
just thought it looked a little bit more
proportion<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.710> inside<00:02:00.350> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
proportion so that is the inside and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.030 
proportion so that is the inside and
then<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.250> put<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:03.500> yeah<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.530> made<00:02:04.829> with

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
then I just put this yeah I made with

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.540 
then I just put this yeah I made with
love<00:02:05.280> hundred<00:02:05.729> percent<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.689> back<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.550> so

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
love hundred percent on the back here so

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.900 
love hundred percent on the back here so

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.050 
this right here is like the punch outs
and<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.510> just<00:04:07.230> punched<00:04:07.440> out<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:07.950> bigger<00:04:08.250> drum

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
and I just punched out this bigger drum

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.330 
and I just punched out this bigger drum
and<00:04:09.390> then<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:10.260> smaller<00:04:10.560> one<00:04:10.830> with<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.130> doggie

and then the smaller one with the doggie

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.320

on<00:04:11.700> top<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.800> then<00:04:13.800> this<00:04:14.310> right<00:04:14.790> here<00:04:15.180> I

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
on top of it and then this right here I

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.090 
on top of it and then this right here I
thought<00:04:15.930> she<00:04:16.169> looked<00:04:16.380> like<00:04:16.440> she<00:04:16.680> was<00:04:16.770> being<00:04:16.980> a

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
thought she looked like she was being a

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.550 
thought she looked like she was being a
little<00:04:17.130> shy<00:04:17.669> so<00:04:18.630> if<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.870> look<00:04:19.020> under<00:04:19.320> there<00:04:19.440> at

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
little shy so if you look under there at

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.500 
little shy so if you look under there at
her<00:04:19.680> face<00:04:19.950> she<00:04:20.280> kind<00:04:20.520> of<00:04:20.609> looks<00:04:20.850> like<00:04:21.000> she<00:04:21.390> is

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
her face she kind of looks like she is

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.640 
her face she kind of looks like she is
and<00:04:21.900> so<00:04:22.080> that's<00:04:22.289> why<00:04:22.470> she's<00:04:22.710> kind<00:04:22.979> of<00:04:23.100> hidden

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
and so that's why she's kind of hidden

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.999 
and so that's why she's kind of hidden
and<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:25.300> really<00:04:25.900> like<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.229> ball<00:04:26.440> with<00:04:26.740> the

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
wasn't quite sure what I was going to do

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.279 
wasn't quite sure what I was going to do
with<00:05:06.550> them<00:05:07.050> but<00:05:09.300> this<00:05:10.300> is<00:05:10.539> what<00:05:10.720> I<00:05:10.750> did<00:05:11.050> and

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
with them but this is what I did and

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.909 
with them but this is what I did and
this<00:05:11.500> is<00:05:11.740> using<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.970> tilter<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.960> tilde

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
this is using the tilter the tilde

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.600 
this is using the tilter the tilde
corner<00:05:15.490> shop<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:17.560> this<00:05:17.770> is<00:05:17.979> how<00:05:18.190> it<00:05:18.340> turned

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
corner shop and so this is how it turned

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.860 
corner shop and so this is how it turned
out<00:05:18.789> here<00:05:19.510> and<00:05:20.039> what<00:05:21.039> I<00:05:21.070> did<00:05:21.370> was<00:05:21.400> I<00:05:21.910> went<00:05:22.630> ahead

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
out here and what I did was I went ahead

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.409 
out here and what I did was I went ahead
and<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:23.380> put<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:23.889> paper<00:05:24.130> down<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.820> put<00:05:25.180> these

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
down looking Bentley and I actually

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.360 
down looking Bentley and I actually
glued<00:05:30.849> this<00:05:31.090> down<00:05:31.389> so<00:05:32.110> it<00:05:32.440> looked<00:05:33.010> perfect

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
glued this down so it looked perfect

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.450 
glued this down so it looked perfect
like<00:05:33.820> that<00:05:34.150> and<00:05:34.510> then<00:05:35.139> I<00:05:35.260> took<00:05:35.320> my<00:05:35.800> exacto

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460

like that and then I took my exacto
knife<00:05:36.669> and<00:05:36.880> I<00:05:36.940> just<00:05:37.180> sliced<00:05:37.510> it<00:05:37.870> right<00:05:38.139> down

knife and I just sliced it right down
the<00:05:38.410> middle<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:39.010> because<00:05:39.970> i<00:05:40.000> did<00:05:40.240> want<00:05:40.449> it<00:05:40.539> to
