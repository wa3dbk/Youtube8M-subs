00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.040 
and hopefully we'll be able to play some
some<00:00:29.460> games<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> only<00:00:30.779> one<00:00:30.869> we've<00:00:31.019> got

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
some games it's the only one we've got

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.870 
some games it's the only one we've got
installed<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.560> there

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
installed on there

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.190 
installed on there
actually<00:00:33.390> I've<00:00:33.450> got<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> new<00:00:34.050> earth

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
actually I've got here is a new earth

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.190 
actually I've got here is a new earth
installed<00:00:34.620> as<00:00:34.710> well<00:00:34.860> might<00:00:35.100> forego<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:36.200> it's

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
installed as well might forego that it's

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.690 
installed as well might forego that it's
not<00:00:37.350> very<00:00:37.559> graphically<00:00:37.950> intensive<00:00:38.309> either<00:00:38.579> is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
not very graphically intensive either is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.160 
not very graphically intensive either is
it<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.030> think<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.450> should<00:00:39.600> probably<00:00:39.719> install

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
it I think we should probably install

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
it I think we should probably install
something<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:41.450> Crysis<00:00:42.450> maybe<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.649> give

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
something like Crysis maybe just give

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.650 
something like Crysis maybe just give
these<00:00:44.309> babies<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> run<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.149> their<00:00:45.239> money

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
these babies a run for their money

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.470 
these babies a run for their money

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
download speed is like ridiculous I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.690 
download speed is like ridiculous I
uploaded<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.079> video<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.590> minute<00:00:49.890> ago<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.309> gig
