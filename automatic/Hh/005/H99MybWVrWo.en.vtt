everything be 16 pixels and although

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.620 
everything be 16 pixels and although
it's<00:01:05.100> useful<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.939> kind<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.390> you're

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
it's useful it kind of like you're

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.380 
it's useful it kind of like you're
basically<00:01:07.020> stripping<00:01:07.619> away<00:01:07.740> any<00:01:08.390> default

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
basically stripping away any default

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.899 
basically stripping away any default
style<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.110> making<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.729> author

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
style and making you know you the author

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.850 
style and making you know you the author
reapply<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.869> explicitly<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:15.020> think<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
reapply it explicitly I think it's a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.710 
reapply it explicitly I think it's a
sometimes<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.610> little<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:17.939> too<00:01:18.180> much<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
sometimes a little bit too much and it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.300 
sometimes a little bit too much and it
adds<00:01:18.869> effort<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.590> me<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.180> there<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> cool<00:01:22.310> new

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
adds effort to me so there is a cool new

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.999 
adds effort to me so there is a cool new
CSS<00:01:23.880> reset<00:01:24.330> that's<00:01:24.570> pretty<00:01:24.810> popular<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.530> it's

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
CSS reset that's pretty popular and it's

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.609 
CSS reset that's pretty popular and it's
called<00:01:26.720> normalized<00:01:28.130> CSS<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:30.320> look<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> I

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
called normalized CSS and look at that I

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.700 
called normalized CSS and look at that I
don't<00:01:31.740> even<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.369> comes<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> CDF

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
don't even see that it comes up in a CDF

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.679 
don't even see that it comes up in a CDF
through<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.770> CDN<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.640> let<00:01:36.240> me<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.360> show<00:01:36.659> you

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
through a CDN but let me just show you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.170 
through a CDN but let me just show you
normalize<00:01:37.500> CSS<00:01:39.079> well<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.290> kind<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:41.180> speaks

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
normalize CSS well it kind of speaks

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
normalize CSS well it kind of speaks
right<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.899> what<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.290> saying<00:01:43.530> over<00:01:43.799> here<00:01:44.130> is

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
right to what I'm saying over here is

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.800 
right to what I'm saying over here is
that<00:01:45.170> it's<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.320> bit<00:01:46.560> too<00:01:46.590> other<00:01:47.549> CSS<00:01:48.180> resets<00:01:48.659> are

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
that it's a bit too other CSS resets are

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.749 
that it's a bit too other CSS resets are
a<00:01:48.840> bit<00:01:49.020> too<00:01:49.170> extreme<00:01:49.470> resetting<00:01:50.189> everything

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
a bit too extreme resetting everything

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.510 
a bit too extreme resetting everything
for<00:01:51.030> me<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.549> kind<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.640> keeps

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
for me and this one kind of keeps

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.450 
for me and this one kind of keeps
certain<00:01:56.520> styles<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.360> are<00:01:57.540> considered

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
certain styles that are considered

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.280 
certain styles that are considered
useful<00:01:59.460> right<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.299> that's<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.630> subjective

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
useful right so that's the subjective

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.510 
useful right so that's the subjective
term<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:02.939> D<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.810> author<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.520> normalized

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
term you know D the author of normalized

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.440 
term you know D the author of normalized
that<00:02:05.700> CS<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> subjective<00:02:06.689> view<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.590> what's

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
that CS is a subjective view on what's

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.050 
that CS is a subjective view on what's
useful<00:02:09.649> but<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.370> does<00:02:11.550> some

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
useful but but I think that it does some

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.760 
useful but but I think that it does some
good<00:02:12.239> stuff<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.470> know

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
good stuff like you know

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.040 
good stuff like you know

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
here if you go to once you google it and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.940

if you click on the demo this is what

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.160 
if you click on the demo this is what
it's<00:02:23.430> basically<00:02:23.640> preserving<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:24.960> like

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
it's basically preserving like I like

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.690 
it's basically preserving like I like
this<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.470> like<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.770> fact<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.340> headers

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
this I like the fact that the headers

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.140 
this I like the fact that the headers
are<00:02:27.150> still<00:02:28.190> they<00:02:29.190> still<00:02:29.250> have<00:02:29.550> some<00:02:29.730> relative

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
are still they still have some relative

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.350 
are still they still have some relative

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
options here first I could take this

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.230 
options here first I could take this
file<00:02:58.130> well<00:02:59.130> here<00:02:59.340> I'm<00:02:59.430> looking<00:02:59.580> at<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.910> demo

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
file well here I'm looking at the demo

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.730 
file well here I'm looking at the demo
I'm<00:03:00.360> just<00:03:00.480> gonna<00:03:00.600> look<00:03:00.840> at<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.080> source<00:03:01.410> and

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
I'm just gonna look at the source and

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.890 
I'm just gonna look at the source and
here<00:03:02.700> is<00:03:02.880> his<00:03:04.580> URL<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.910> if<00:03:06.300> you're<00:03:06.450> using<00:03:06.660> like

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
here is his URL and if you're using like

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.620 
here is his URL and if you're using like
Chrome<00:03:07.260> or<00:03:07.650> Firefox<00:03:08.000> it'll<00:03:09.000> actually<00:03:09.150> link<00:03:09.570> to

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
Chrome or Firefox it'll actually link to

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.040 
Chrome or Firefox it'll actually link to
it<00:03:09.810> when<00:03:09.960> you<00:03:10.050> click<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.500> here<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.240> click

it when you click it here it is I click

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.620 
it when you click it here it is I click
Save<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.920> then<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.280> could<00:03:14.490> just<00:03:14.520> pop<00:03:15.390> that

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
Save and then I could just pop that

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.920 
Save and then I could just pop that
right<00:03:15.660> into<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.290> folder<00:03:16.740> that<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:16.950> have<00:03:17.930> where

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
right into the folder that I have where

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.020 
right into the folder that I have where
I<00:03:18.959> have<00:03:19.140> my<00:03:19.320> own<00:03:19.500> folder<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.220> just<00:03:20.459> copy<00:03:20.700> this

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
I have my own folder and just copy this

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.260 
I have my own folder and just copy this
and<00:03:21.950> here<00:03:22.950> would<00:03:23.100> be<00:03:23.250> one<00:03:23.459> way<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.820> doing<00:03:24.000> it

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
and here would be one way of doing it

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.170 
and here would be one way of doing it
right<00:03:24.840> I'm<00:03:25.110> just<00:03:25.290> adding<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:26.010> file<00:03:26.670> directly

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
right I'm just adding the file directly

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.890 
right I'm just adding the file directly
to<00:03:27.450> mine<00:03:27.660> from<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:28.080> downloaded<00:03:28.650> version<00:03:28.950> but

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
to mine from a downloaded version but

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.810 
to mine from a downloaded version but
because<00:03:30.900> normalise<00:03:31.380> is<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.620> pretty<00:03:31.950> popular

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
because normalise is a pretty popular

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.420 
because normalise is a pretty popular
one<00:03:33.240> I<00:03:33.270> bet<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.630> we<00:03:33.930> could<00:03:34.110> CD<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.160> let's<00:03:35.340> see

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
one I bet you we could CD and let's see

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:43.400 
one I bet you we could CD and let's see
if<00:03:35.459> we<00:03:35.610> find<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:36.030> somewhere<00:03:41.660> well<00:03:42.660> anyway<00:03:43.020> I'm

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
if we find it somewhere well anyway I'm

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.010 
if we find it somewhere well anyway I'm
sure<00:03:43.770> if<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.220> dig<00:03:44.400> around<00:03:44.630> you<00:03:45.630> may<00:03:45.780> be<00:03:45.840> able

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
sure if you dig around you may be able

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.670 
sure if you dig around you may be able
to<00:03:46.200> find<00:03:46.560> some<00:03:47.660> somebody<00:03:48.660> hosting<00:03:49.500> this<00:03:49.620> thing

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
to find some somebody hosting this thing

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.890 
to find some somebody hosting this thing
on<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.010> CDN<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:50.820> could<00:03:50.970> link<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.420> directly

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
on a CDN that you could link to directly

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.060 
on a CDN that you could link to directly
although<00:03:53.420> depending<00:03:54.420> on<00:03:54.510> what<00:03:54.660> CDN<00:03:55.140> it<00:03:55.350> is<00:03:55.500> you

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
although depending on what CDN it is you

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.650 
although depending on what CDN it is you
should<00:03:56.100> be<00:03:56.459> careful<00:03:56.910> right<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.150> mean<00:03:57.390> if<00:03:57.510> it's

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
should be careful right I mean if it's

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.800 
should be careful right I mean if it's
like<00:03:57.780> Google<00:03:58.110> or<00:03:58.740> Microsoft<00:03:59.000> or<00:04:00.000> me<00:04:00.450> maybe

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
like Google or Microsoft or me maybe

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.020 
like Google or Microsoft or me maybe
even<00:04:01.050> jQuery<00:04:01.530> or<00:04:01.709> something<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.880> could

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
even jQuery or something you could

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.250 
even jQuery or something you could
probably<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.690> know<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:03.840> could<00:04:04.050> feel<00:04:04.230> a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
probably you know you could feel a

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.480 
probably you know you could feel a
little<00:04:04.380> more<00:04:04.680> secure<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:05.130> it's<00:04:05.370> always

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
little more secure that it's always

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.040 
little more secure that it's always
gonna<00:04:05.670> be<00:04:05.970> there<00:04:06.180> but<00:04:06.390> if<00:04:06.540> someone's<00:04:06.900> just

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
gonna be there but if someone's just

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.350 
gonna be there but if someone's just
posting<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.680> on<00:04:07.770> there<00:04:08.040> do<00:04:08.459> their<00:04:08.640> private

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
posting it on there do their private

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.060 
posting it on there do their private
site<00:04:09.800> I<00:04:11.450> don't<00:04:12.450> know<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:13.080> don't<00:04:13.260> know<00:04:13.440> what

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
site I don't know you don't know what

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.250 
site I don't know you don't know what
their<00:04:14.670> if<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.420> know<00:04:15.510> today<00:04:15.959> it<00:04:16.109> could<00:04:16.200> be

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
their if you know today it could be

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.140 
their if you know today it could be
there<00:04:16.500> tomorrow<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.950> could<00:04:17.070> be<00:04:17.130> gone<00:04:17.370> so<00:04:17.850> if

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
there tomorrow it could be gone so if

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.780
