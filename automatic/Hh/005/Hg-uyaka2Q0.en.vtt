reject many of those positions very

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.600

I'll talk to you about the positioning
the<00:00:40.269> femurs<00:00:40.899> these<00:00:41.769> long<00:00:42.190> bones<00:00:42.219> that<00:00:43.030> go<00:00:43.059> from

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
the femurs these long bones that go from

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.950 
the femurs these long bones that go from
the<00:00:43.449> pelvis<00:00:43.929> to<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.170> knee<00:00:45.269> are<00:00:46.269> almost

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
the pelvis to the knee are almost

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.430 
the pelvis to the knee are almost
perfectly<00:00:47.500> parallel<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.510> kneecaps<00:00:50.050> these

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
perfectly parallel the kneecaps these

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.500 
perfectly parallel the kneecaps these
little<00:00:50.769> round<00:00:51.129> things<00:00:51.519> that<00:00:51.789> look<00:00:51.969> like<00:00:51.999> beans

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
little round things that look like beans

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.650 
little round things that look like beans
down<00:00:53.050> here<00:00:53.530> are<00:00:54.370> very<00:00:54.670> close<00:00:55.030> to<00:00:55.269> being<00:00:55.420> in<00:00:55.539> the

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
down here are very close to being in the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.079 
down here are very close to being in the
middle<00:00:55.929> of<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.140> bone<00:00:56.350> that's<00:00:57.190> what<00:00:57.460> we<00:00:57.609> want

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
middle of the bone that's what we want

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.329 
middle of the bone that's what we want
the<00:00:58.809> next<00:00:59.079> thing<00:00:59.260> is<00:00:59.409> we<00:00:59.559> want<00:00:59.769> the<00:00:59.890> pelvis<00:01:00.309> to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
the next thing is we want the pelvis to

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.660 
the next thing is we want the pelvis to
be<00:01:00.670> level<00:01:01.149> so<00:01:02.140> if<00:01:02.469> you<00:01:02.859> look<00:01:03.069> at<00:01:03.219> these<00:01:03.339> holes

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
be level so if you look at these holes

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.810 
be level so if you look at these holes
these<00:01:04.030> are<00:01:04.330> called<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.690> obturator<00:01:05.050> foramen

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
these are called the obturator foramen

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.160 
these are called the obturator foramen
they're<00:01:06.820> not<00:01:07.060> perfect<00:01:07.690> but<00:01:07.810> they're<00:01:07.990> very

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
they're not perfect but they're very

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.740 
they're not perfect but they're very
close<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.860> being<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.189> same<00:01:09.430> size<00:01:09.729> so<00:01:10.720> that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
close to being the same size so that

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.870 
close to being the same size so that
means<00:01:11.140> we've<00:01:11.350> got<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.710> pelvis<00:01:12.130> very<00:01:12.369> close<00:01:12.700> to

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
means we've got the pelvis very close to

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.710 
means we've got the pelvis very close to
being<00:01:13.060> level<00:01:13.479> so<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.500> legs<00:01:14.799> are<00:01:15.040> parallel<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
being level so the legs are parallel the

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.990 
being level so the legs are parallel the
kneecaps<00:01:17.229> are<00:01:17.439> in<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.680> middle<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.250> the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
kneecaps are in the middle and the

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.080 
kneecaps are in the middle and the
pelvis<00:01:19.479> is<00:01:19.659> close<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.140> being<00:01:20.320> flat<00:01:20.619> and<00:01:20.950> we<00:01:21.909> get

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
pelvis is close to being flat and we get

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.620 
pelvis is close to being flat and we get
an<00:01:22.210> excellent<00:01:22.659> ofa<00:01:23.200> grade<00:01:23.729> now<00:01:24.729> let's<00:01:25.210> go<00:01:25.390> on

see how flat this head is and it's flat
over<00:01:39.850> here<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:40.509> should<00:01:41.289> be<00:01:41.469> at<00:01:41.590> least<00:01:41.619> halfway

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
over here it should be at least halfway

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.389 
over here it should be at least halfway
inside<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.090> cup<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.619> we're<00:01:44.829> not<00:01:44.979> inside

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
inside the cup but we're not inside

inside the cup but we're not inside
halfway<00:01:46.030> this<00:01:46.930> one<00:01:47.229> might<00:01:47.560> make<00:01:47.590> it<00:01:48.009> halfway

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
halfway this one might make it halfway

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.620 
halfway this one might make it halfway
but<00:01:48.490> it's<00:01:48.820> barely<00:01:49.450> on<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.719> edge<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.939> then<00:01:51.939> we

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
but it's barely on the edge and then we

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.480 
but it's barely on the edge and then we
look<00:01:52.869> at<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.079> picture<00:01:53.439> itself<00:01:53.799> and<00:01:54.219> you<00:01:54.280> look

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.190 
well is the pelvis level wow this
obturator<00:02:11.710> framing<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:12.550> huge<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.240> this<00:02:13.990> one

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
obturator framing is huge and this one

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.830 
obturator framing is huge and this one
is<00:02:14.290> much<00:02:14.500> smaller<00:02:15.090> okay<00:02:16.090> well<00:02:16.270> let's<00:02:16.450> look<00:02:16.540> at

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
is much smaller okay well let's look at

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.880 
is much smaller okay well let's look at
the<00:02:16.930> kneecaps

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
the kneecaps

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.970 
the kneecaps
this<00:02:18.850> patella<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.930> outside<00:02:20.410> see<00:02:20.830> that

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
this patella is to the outside see that

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.130 
this patella is to the outside see that
round<00:02:21.190> thing<00:02:21.490> right<00:02:21.730> there<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.660> then<00:02:22.959> this

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
round thing right there and then this

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.010 
round thing right there and then this
patella<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.010> outside<00:02:24.490> see<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.720> and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
patella is to the outside see that and

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.380 
patella is to the outside see that and
then<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.740> course<00:02:26.770> this<00:02:27.100> leg<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.580> shorter<00:02:28.060> than

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
then of course this leg is shorter than

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.720 
then of course this leg is shorter than
the<00:02:28.450> other<00:02:28.600> leg<00:02:29.020> you<00:02:29.290> can<00:02:29.470> see<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:29.950> but

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
the other leg you can see that but

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.850 
the other leg you can see that but
that's<00:02:31.180> because<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:31.810> leg<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.260> up<00:02:32.290> too<00:02:32.650> high

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
that's because this leg is up too high

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.480 
that's because this leg is up too high
