00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
detail so this has a mirrored surface on

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.160 
detail so this has a mirrored surface on
the<00:01:34.650> outside<00:01:35.220> here<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.600> rather<00:01:36.810> an

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the outside here and rather an

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.289 
the outside here and rather an
unusual-looking<00:01:37.939> pac-man<00:01:38.939> character<00:01:39.600> there

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
unusual-looking pac-man character there

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.149 
unusual-looking pac-man character there
and<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.509> take<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.500> look<00:01:43.770> at<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.399> go<00:01:45.649> so<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and just take a look at it can go so it

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.679 
and just take a look at it can go so it
looks<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:48.090> put<00:01:48.329> your<00:01:49.820> little<00:01:50.820> device<00:01:51.299> in

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.230 
there and then you can get the mirrored
version<00:01:57.770> all<00:01:58.770> around<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.369> outside<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.180> you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
version all around the outside so you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.889 
version all around the outside so you
