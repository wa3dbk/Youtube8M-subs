they leave or what they're doing there
in<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.830> first<00:00:25.920> place<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.970> basically<00:00:27.240> like

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
in the first place it's basically like

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.580 
in the first place it's basically like
an<00:00:27.510> ordinary<00:00:27.689> pub<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:32.989> God<00:00:33.989> does<00:00:34.170> at<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.380> body

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
an ordinary pub and God does at the body

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.340 
an ordinary pub and God does at the body
says<00:00:34.860> I've<00:00:35.010> cut<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> light<00:00:35.460> ales<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
says I've cut the light ales and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.500 
says I've cut the light ales and
dry-roasted<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.850> barman<00:00:39.090> says<00:00:39.210> anything

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
dry-roasted and the barman says anything

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.569 
dry-roasted and the barman says anything
for<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.870> Holy<00:00:40.050> Spirit<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.800> God<00:00:41.250> says<00:00:41.430> no

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
for the Holy Spirit and the God says no

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.580 
for the Holy Spirit and the God says no
he's<00:00:41.760> ineffable<00:00:42.210> he's<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> manifestation<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
conceptual entity and involves his book

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.270 
conceptual entity and involves his book
just<00:00:46.110> orange<00:00:46.440> juice<00:00:46.469> yeah<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> Holy

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
just orange juice yeah and then the Holy

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.590 
just orange juice yeah and then the Holy
Spirit<00:00:53.370> goes<00:00:53.820> off<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> player<00:00:54.270> game<00:00:54.480> of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
version of dandy and you have to get

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.899 
version of dandy and you have to get
three<00:01:07.380> balls<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> Magic<00:01:08.189> Man<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> light

three balls in the Magic Man to light

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.030 
three balls in the Magic Man to light

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.469 

okay<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:16.189> God<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.460> recognizes<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> barman

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
okay and God then recognizes the barman

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.330 
okay and God then recognizes the barman
it<00:01:18.570> says<00:01:18.689> you're<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> Verna<00:01:19.530> Heisenberg<00:01:20.159> are

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it says you're a Verna Heisenberg are

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.039 
it says you're a Verna Heisenberg are
neither<00:01:20.520> German<00:01:20.939> scientist<00:01:21.420> inventor<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.930> the

neither German scientist inventor of the
uncertainty<00:01:22.530> theorem<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.250> Heisenberg<00:01:23.610> says

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
uncertainty theorem and Heisenberg says

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.200 
uncertainty theorem and Heisenberg says
yeah<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.540> right<00:01:25.220> imagine<00:01:26.220> imagine<00:01:26.490> that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
yeah that is right imagine imagine that

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.330 
yeah that is right imagine imagine that
me<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.900> German<00:01:28.350> scientist<00:01:28.860> should<00:01:29.100> embrace

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
me the German scientist should embrace

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.580 
me the German scientist should embrace
uncertainty<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.479> explicit<00:01:30.840> irony<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.439> not

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
uncertainty the explicit irony is not

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.700 
uncertainty the explicit irony is not
lost<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:32.009> me

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.310 

God<00:01:35.710> said<00:01:35.950> yeah<00:01:36.160> yeah<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:39.840> Heisenberg<00:01:40.840> said

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
God said yeah yeah and Heisenberg said

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.260 
God said yeah yeah and Heisenberg said
yeah<00:01:41.470> as<00:01:41.620> a<00:01:41.650> young<00:01:41.920> man<00:01:42.070> I<00:01:42.130> crave<00:01:42.580> precision<00:01:43.150> in

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
yeah as a young man I crave precision in

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.970 
yeah as a young man I crave precision in
all<00:01:43.390> things<00:01:43.660> I<00:01:43.900> wanted<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.350> know<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.650> smallest

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
all things I wanted to know the smallest

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.950 
all things I wanted to know the smallest
thing<00:01:45.280> in<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.460> night<00:01:45.640> known<00:01:46.060> universe<00:01:46.510> it's<00:01:46.900> a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
thing in the night known universe it's a

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.140 
thing in the night known universe it's a
particle<00:01:47.410> very<00:01:48.070> difficult<00:01:48.550> to<00:01:48.700> measure<00:01:49.030> the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
particle very difficult to measure the

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.300 
particle very difficult to measure the
particle<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:50.440> measure<00:01:50.620> it<00:01:50.800> you<00:01:50.890> must<00:01:51.040> shine

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
particle to measure it you must shine

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.490 
particle to measure it you must shine
light<00:01:51.610> upon<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.030> but<00:01:52.390> by<00:01:52.600> shining<00:01:52.960> light<00:01:53.110> upon

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
light upon it but by shining light upon

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.720 
light upon it but by shining light upon
it<00:01:53.590> you<00:01:53.620> distorts<00:01:54.160> the<00:01:54.250> image<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.640> the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
it you distorts the image of the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.340 
it you distorts the image of the
particle<00:01:55.150> making<00:01:55.480> it<00:01:55.570> impossible<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:56.110> take<00:01:56.230> an

particle making it impossible to take an
accurate<00:01:56.710> reading

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
accurate reading

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.800 
accurate reading
I<00:01:57.220> used<00:01:57.640> smaller<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.270> smaller<00:01:58.570> and<00:01:58.750> smaller

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
I used smaller and smaller and smaller

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.990 
I used smaller and smaller and smaller
amounts<00:01:59.230> of<00:01:59.500> light<00:01:59.680> but<00:02:00.040> still<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.430> no<00:02:00.550> avail

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
amounts of light but still to no avail

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.120 
amounts of light but still to no avail
eventually<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.660> used<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.170> smallest<00:02:02.620> amount<00:02:02.980> of

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
eventually I used the smallest amount of

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.400 
eventually I used the smallest amount of
light<00:02:03.310> known<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.700> man<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.360> glovebox<00:02:04.720> light<00:02:05.200> of

light known to man the glovebox light of

light known to man the glovebox light of
a<00:02:05.530> 1974<00:02:06.520> Austin<00:02:06.940> maxi<00:02:15.210> still<00:02:16.210> too<00:02:16.780> much<00:02:16.930> light

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
a 1974 Austin maxi still too much light

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.800 
a 1974 Austin maxi still too much light
maybe<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.460> refracted<00:02:18.970> also<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.240> desert<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.720> the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
maybe it refracted also a desert of the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.700 
maybe it refracted also a desert of the
Midlands<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.810> laminated<00:02:23.380> covered

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710

Midlands it's a laminated covered
dummkopf<00:02:26.070> God<00:02:27.070> said<00:02:27.340> yeah<00:02:27.550> shut<00:02:27.880> up<00:02:27.940> mate<00:02:28.210> this

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
dummkopf God said yeah shut up mate this

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.280 
dummkopf God said yeah shut up mate this
trip<00:02:28.570> is<00:02:28.690> wrong<00:02:30.540> we<00:02:31.540> weren't<00:02:31.720> real<00:02:31.870> strippers
