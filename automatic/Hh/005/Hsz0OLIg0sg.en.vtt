00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello people welcome here in the middle 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.930
 the nature and nice that you again 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.030
 turned on and I think it's great 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.650
 that you are upset by my euphoria and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.200
 Do not let joy in life frighten you 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.429
 and look in again and again 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.010
 as mentioned in the last video 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.900
 Today it's about the tabs and I want to 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.000
 Just imagine a few tabs 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.769
 Build yourself exactly what they say 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.869
 because of the dimensions and we will be the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.180
 Just look and yes should be easy 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.029
 give a small decision-making aid and 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.560
 So far you have been advised in which she yes 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.000
 an interim from the last video too 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.829
 This is a lot happened I was 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.260
 At the hairdresser of my wife I like it a lot 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.969
 well, I am quite happy with it 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.100
 my face she has me very well 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.079
 I have to advise that I was there 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.390
 say it's quite sporty something 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.770
 smart as many light critically me 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.390
 I'll be in the woods soon 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.789
 march there and have me physically 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.079
 Press and that meant there is now 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.610
 just from his mother then it will be 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.629
 sometimes it does not get any younger 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.850
 or and yes that came out of it and me 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.650
 was even rewarded for that 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.970
 Harpstedt was very cheap and has it 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.310
 Of course I also own a consultant 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.080
 a bit haaks in and has it for me 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 Here is a super beckham from the main or 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.840
 how does that mean? 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.869
 I'm also the joy but just 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.850
 because people I've indulged and the as 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.110
 I with that you have indulged in the circle 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.000
 the under the table and then I get 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.880
 but one on top of it here so one 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.159
 Nice thing the super material it feels 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.570
 Being very good is a top quality 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.310
 say it and it will be my new one 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.600
 Hygienic bag for my trekking tours 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.630
 it can work that way 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.850
 just like that in the sense care times 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.189
 listen again here in the nature 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.329
 the birds and what I say now 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.770
 it's about the tabs and there you go 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.560
 So with the luggage I have today 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.659
 following day this critical army 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.790
 shelter schied also basha called me 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.979
 can always recommend it 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.430
 is my favorite top top quality 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.890
 easy to build good size from the weight 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.899
 something heavy 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.819
 next here this multipurpose plane 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.379
 that is also called basha I am 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.740
 curious how it comes out afterwards 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.900
 very easy 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.840
 very narrow and the craft lesson in each 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.060
 pants jacket or backpack with 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.430
 as a third hammer here the multipurpose 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.320
 plan in flecktarn very robust 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.930
 material very big for two 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.330
 persons suitable here outside with fixed 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.080
 milan loop naturally goes say 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.080
 it's the construction 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.790
 so i have all three tops now 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.069
 set up with a light construction 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.480
 Variant because if for example in the evening 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.739
 is on the way or it comes 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.720
 then it must be rain 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.130
 go quickly by the hand and I have to 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.099
 say there is a lot with all three 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.150
 easy very fast but because of me 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.040
 you toujours now in a row 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.660
 I could build up the wonderful 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.069
 determine differences 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.100
 I want you just now times 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.700
 communicate there we come to the multipurpose 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.660
 plane washers from mintek are the dimensions 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.010
 260 x 170 weight 4 139 grams and now 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.230
 I also understand why one thing 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.150
 Multipurpose tarp is in my eyes 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.799
 it's less a tab so less so 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.430
 suitable for a week long right 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.100
 close 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.390
 it's too delicate for me if I do that 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.620
 I would always have to assemble and disassemble 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.360
 Remember that sooner or later 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.170
 I travel and it would be easy for me 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.910
 including much too small but this one 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.830
 multi-purpose tarpaulin can be like the name 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.019
 says it used for several things 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.220
 I would plan this as a backup 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.480
 take in my backpack 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.700
 even if I have several 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.920
 would be on the way and only those take so far 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.750
 to cover luggage quickly 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.700
 example when the rain comes, says 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.370
 plan on it and then just here 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.459
 build proper shelter here resp 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.620
 after many buttons and loops 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.820
 and you can do it so wonderful if you are 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.769
 with backpack still running around the 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.410
 backpack around for example and 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.209
 so take it as rain protection so I 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.660
 think that he's there 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.660
 goes there and as emergency hardware it 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.049
 next to it also recommended to come 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.799
 we to the big one is on mass 300 x 200 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:22.580
 cm weight 1100 grams advantage very big 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.770
 and so it is also a great did it 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.169
 can be easily credited it has beautiful 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.120
 loops and loops enough space and 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.100
 slept to stow his luggage 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.479
 possibly also for a couple you could 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.220
 underneath it 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.260
 you can sit under it great cooking 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.430
 So stay longer if it is 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.169
 should rain once 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.850
 And of course that's the question 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.430
 I first have to test this day 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.889
 also endure a longer rain 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.930
 rain for several days 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.150
 yes as I said that you can first 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.030
 otherwise i would do this 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.490
 So it would take even further 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.949
 recommend 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.370
 Last but not least, the British Army 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:03.250
 Separate street 220 x 250 weight 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.430
 kilograms of medium suture with silicone 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.259
 sealed and what should I say yes 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.330
 i can get this baschar to 100 percent 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:13.090
 recommend this is the best for me 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.740
 What's there is there at all 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.199
 Nothing I have no objection, the long 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.419
 Tested during rain at lightning in storm 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:23.380
 at all possible we street bags 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:26.020
 including gale force and it has 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.610
 So that's the best thing 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.860
 you can get on the market 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.180
 critical michelle is what i do 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.650
 Nevertheless, if you want to recommend here 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.110
 are in the middle hurry at one 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.880
 it's always off easy and exciting 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.409
 with the herring when the wind of this 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.250
 he comes something is caught 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:43.599
 and then do not talk so much yes what 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.430
 Finally, there is still to say it 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.400
 are of course several tabs for 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.319
 example what many use is sdd 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.569
 cup three meters by 3 meters so one 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:54.669
 very big degree and the weight is 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:57.400
 nevertheless only 790 grams 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.710
 the advantages it is so easy and easy 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.729
 This detail is even with accessories 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.070
 delivered 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.449
 I had to have a last course 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.690
 Participants in that had it 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:11.250
 also from the quality I have to say 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:13.659
 good is okay does not come to his 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.880
 political opponents diverged but 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:18.729
 It's all right for me personally 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.620
 this detail would be too big so when 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.930
 Since I have such a huge plan 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.830
 and then everything flies around and you 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.139
 always has to be exactly 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.639
 think what builds 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.969
 some can do that quickly but for me 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:34.000
 It would be just too big for me 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:36.370
 another variant would be here for example 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.469
 Of course, this bw poncho is also one 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.599
 good solution you can just as poncho 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:42.940
 use and all star as I said it is 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:45.370
 just a poncho no pure did he is 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.840
 also very heavy but still full 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:52.060
 suitable for a yes be final 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.919
 said so you get something for his 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.539
 money one can buy good quality though 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.159
 you have something cheaper buys one has 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:00.250
 of course certain losses 

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:03.099
 but if used properly 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.360
 It is also very good and just too 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:05.030
 for beginners or people who are now 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.820
 not so 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:10.760
 Extremely much outside are like me there 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:13.100
 even such a multi-purpose plane or so 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.470
 stain trantow completely sufficient and 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.660
 Great to use outside because of it 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.340
 Yes people I got my biggest trouble with the 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.320
 given video I hope there was something for 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.720
 you while I hope I could you 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.950
 help a bit with your decision 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.020
 maybe if you look for one now 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.950
 new tab looking and you just there 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.020
 help 

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.520
 and yes, I always stay tuned 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.500

 I will tell you then 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.520
 in the scene, I would be happy if

 take thumb up give new 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:45.160
 Subscribers are welcome 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:47.510
 people take care of you 

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.520
 outsider role good tension of what 

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.710
 I'm not quite sure yet 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.330
 is a topic you 

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.330
 have made her like she did
