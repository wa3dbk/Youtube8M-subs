00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:34.320
 the understatement Jacob has with the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.129
 No, you have your time 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.050

 It's let the really cool 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.270
 the guidance is just pretty complex 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.270
 but also somehow catchy 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.130
 delicious or fritz kola 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.130

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:47.980
 intense songwriter's faces that 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.980

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.080

 few songs recorded for example 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.740
