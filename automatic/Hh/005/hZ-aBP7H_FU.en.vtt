00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.020
 It's okay with this video. 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.460
 I decided to tell you how it is 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.910
 the guide feed 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.410
 It 's not all the way out, after all. 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.540
 as people plan mainly 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.160
 when it comes to baby 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.310
 something that I adopted in my 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.529
 philosophy is to have a baby and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.930
 walking with a bad garbage job 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.810
 sure this is not a daughter doing 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.980
 noise down here 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:36.870
 so what I say is is at first 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.570
 I wanted to adopt his method w 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.910
 but there was an unforeseen 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.579
 At first I was accepting super well. 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:50.430
 then there was a crisis and a child in 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.590
 one that is not a crisis I think the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.020
 crisis is not the right word she got a 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.809
 refusing time there was a strike this for 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.920
 there and at the beginning the power is 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.129
 complementary 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.350
 I started with the fruits and I started 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.280
 using the shield method 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.350
 but she started to stay until a strike 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.920
 I did not even want to take it later, anyway. 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.380
 no type of fruit 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.020
 so I then started adopting the method 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.210
 potato mashed nefro had but same 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.240
 Way did not work out 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.549
 we then started with the beginning of 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.700
 supplementary feeding was six 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:38.930
 months we stayed b 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.759
 we stayed with the two weeks 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.409
 I stayed for a couple of weeks without giving 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.310
 no food for her alone. 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.799
 milk only breast milk then after 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.570
 days I saw that she noticed the began to have 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.000
 again an interest for the commendation 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.979
 so I started again with 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.270
 vw to close the vegetables and the vegetables 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:06.990
 huh daughter right there and then after that 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.590
 there was 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.890
 on strike for her business and started 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.650
 offer the vegetables in the form of potatoes 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.430
 she began to accept and then defeat 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:25.940
 hours 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.940
 that 's how her feeding is there 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.390
 but I'm still using a method 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.870
 old w to present every time a new 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.180
 food for her for example to me today 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.930
 I'm going to put a pod in the food 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.910
 Wash it so I pick it up. 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.519
 the kitchen is to leave a point mach 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:56.700
 the baby and then I do it there too. 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:58.110
 I'll take it and put it and she'll do it 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.069
 natural form 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.470
 then she explores a new food eats in 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.720
 a next time she went with the same 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.630
 I put it on the potato I put it on 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.620
 The Pope 's acceptance is being very 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.470
 better then I 'm using the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.870
 method lw answer no question 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.299
 as embarrassment fundag the table 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.700
 is being used rw method associated 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.459
 how the potato method is being very 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.350
 cool is being easy now but not 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:35.850
 At first I had a lot of trouble. 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:38.910
 so now it's so much that I've been a while 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.280
 past facebook but this time I think 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.489
 which was paramount because the power is to give 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.470
 this support for her and now she's 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.930
 eating super well all that I put 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.459
 on paper she eats how the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.370
 potato preparation 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.739
 I have the apple crudely automation 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.019
 so you know meticulously because I know 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.319
 that she can eat some 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.660
 Food in size fairly janÃ© 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.329
 cool, I do not need to go any further 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.780
 very very 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:11.549
 so it's all gone purpose 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.180
 so I use what they are doing 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.709
 I'm using beard as I'm taking 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.389
 the potato 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:24.569
 we are and it is an olive oil sea salt 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.720
 because for the possible and pro ii has 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:33.599
 properties better than salt 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:36.270
 refined ne and garlic onion garlic poro 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:39.360
 onion chives using this to 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.610
 ensure to season and has aiea 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.690
 actively eaten from everything he offered 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.990
 is eating 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:57.800
 I 'm giving potato sweet potato potatoes 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:05:08.699
 carrot pumpkin turnip convict flower ne 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:12.320
 broccoli planet cassava at last I think 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:15.330
 everything is a little eating and 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.030
 acceptance as I said 'you're cool 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.050
 I have opted and continue choosing not to offer 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.870
 the juice to it by the high rate of 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.729
 fructose which is present in the south 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.949
 I play in and so the great risk of 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.930
 contracting diabetes I actually got 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:38.669
 It's bete in adulthood so I'll leave it 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:45.320
 for your well after lunch and then she 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:48.539
 and dinner right and eating well 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.060
 taking nothing but for 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:55.919
 cause I'm still free 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:06:04.680
 demand and have as it will join 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:07.409
 here at the hotel I rice for her and that's it 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.289
 basically corresponded mostly to 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:13.710
 about feeding her 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:16.610
 Ok, kiss me all the way to the next video. 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.610
 bye
