that's the case and number one is

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
width of the ball to the outside so he

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.080 
width of the ball to the outside so he
is<00:01:32.110> not<00:01:32.350> going<00:01:32.770> remember<00:01:33.250> our<00:01:33.370> corners<00:01:33.790> coming
