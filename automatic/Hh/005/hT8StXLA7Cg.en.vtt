00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
here I had to do a lot of modifying and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.030 
here I had to do a lot of modifying and
I<00:01:02.500> wasn't<00:01:03.010> expecting<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:03.579> and<00:01:04.800> you<00:01:05.800> can<00:01:05.890> see

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
I wasn't expecting that and you can see

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.440 
I wasn't expecting that and you can see
I<00:01:06.070> did<00:01:06.369> what<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.759> pedals<00:01:07.060> right<00:01:07.210> here<00:01:07.360> to

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
I did what the pedals right here to

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.260 
I did what the pedals right here to
prevent<00:01:07.720> this<00:01:08.200> pedal<00:01:09.040> re<00:01:09.670> here<00:01:09.940> from<00:01:10.090> hitting

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
prevent this pedal re here from hitting

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.060 
prevent this pedal re here from hitting
the<00:01:10.360> engine<00:01:10.810> right<00:01:10.900> here<00:01:11.110> so<00:01:11.380> is<00:01:11.500> that<00:01:11.619> Elias

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
the engine right here so is that Elias

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.749 
the engine right here so is that Elias
side<00:01:12.280> right<00:01:12.490> here<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:13.390> other<00:01:13.509> side<00:01:13.780> er

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
side right here the other side er

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.749 
side right here the other side er
the<00:01:15.759> same<00:01:15.970> thing<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:18.100> could<00:01:18.250> hit<00:01:18.490> right<00:01:18.729> here

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
the same thing it could hit right here

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.270 
the same thing it could hit right here
so<00:01:19.720> I<00:01:19.750> was<00:01:19.990> like<00:01:20.110> geez<00:01:20.470> got<00:01:20.649> that<00:01:20.860> skin<00:01:21.130> off<00:01:21.250> the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
so I was like geez got that skin off the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.760 
so I was like geez got that skin off the
pedals<00:01:21.700> right<00:01:21.759> there<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:23.259> down<00:01:23.440> underneath

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
pedals right there and down underneath

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.990 
pedals right there and down underneath
here<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:26.110> piece<00:01:26.410> right<00:01:26.649> here<00:01:26.710> is<00:01:27.220> made<00:01:27.850> out

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
here this piece right here is made out

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.440 
here this piece right here is made out
of<00:01:28.030> cast<00:01:28.300> iron<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:29.140> it's<00:01:30.130> designed<00:01:30.759> to<00:01:31.119> hold

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
of cast iron and it's designed to hold

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.850 
of cast iron and it's designed to hold
this<00:01:31.630> engine<00:01:31.990> on<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.350> go<00:01:32.470> right<00:01:32.649> under<00:01:32.830> the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
this engine on and go right under the

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.109 
this engine on and go right under the
frame<00:01:33.100> right<00:01:33.250> here<00:01:33.280> he<00:01:33.490> is<00:01:33.580> you<00:01:33.729> can<00:01:33.759> see<00:01:34.030> right

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
frame right here he is you can see right

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.590 
frame right here he is you can see right
here<00:01:34.179> I<00:01:34.570> had<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.380> modify<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.940> hole<00:01:37.149> right<00:01:37.360> here

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
here I had to modify the hole right here

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.330 
here I had to modify the hole right here
because<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:38.050> screw<00:01:38.350> wouldn't<00:01:38.950> clear<00:01:39.160> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
because the screw wouldn't clear the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.630 
because the screw wouldn't clear the
frame<00:01:39.610> right<00:01:39.820> here<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.869> I<00:01:41.170> had<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:41.590> mill<00:01:42.490> out

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
frame right here so I had to mill out

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.100 
frame right here so I had to mill out
the<00:01:42.789> hole<00:01:42.940> just<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.270> little<00:01:43.479> bit<00:01:43.600> further<00:01:43.899> this

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
the hole just a little bit further this

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.080 
the hole just a little bit further this
way<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:45.039> get<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.250> screw<00:01:45.460> coming<00:01:45.759> down<00:01:45.880> over

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
way to get the screw coming down over

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.600 
way to get the screw coming down over
here<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:47.020> then<00:01:47.289> I<00:01:47.409> had<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.710> cut<00:01:47.920> sections<00:01:48.490> of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
here and then I had to cut sections of

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.580 
here and then I had to cut sections of
the<00:01:48.670> holes<00:01:48.880> right<00:01:49.060> here<00:01:49.179> underneath<00:01:49.929> I<00:01:50.320> don't

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
the holes right here underneath I don't

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.650 
the holes right here underneath I don't
know<00:01:50.679> if<00:01:50.740> you<00:01:50.830> can<00:01:50.979> see<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:52.030> sections<00:01:52.509> right

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
know if you can see the sections right

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.089 
know if you can see the sections right
here<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:53.170> had<00:01:53.500> to

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
here I had to

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.749 
here I had to
plasma<00:01:54.910> cut<00:01:55.119> them<00:01:55.239> out<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.720> get<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> hold<00:01:56.440> of<00:01:56.530> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
plasma cut them out to get a hold of the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.790 
plasma cut them out to get a hold of the
screws<00:01:57.759> these<00:01:58.539> that's<00:01:59.080> holding<00:01:59.440> on<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.709> in

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800

screws these that's holding on the in
Egypt<00:02:00.160> so<00:02:01.119> I<00:02:01.149> had<00:02:01.660> to<00:02:01.780> modify<00:02:02.289> that<00:02:02.649> so<00:02:03.069> I<00:02:03.099> can

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
Egypt so I had to modify that so I can

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.589 
Egypt so I had to modify that so I can
get<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.640> whole<00:02:03.789> of<00:02:03.819> the<00:02:04.000> screws<00:02:04.270> without

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
having to take off this whole engine to

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.040 
having to take off this whole engine to
get<00:02:06.849> underneath<00:02:07.090> right<00:02:07.390> here<00:02:07.660> to<00:02:07.810> get<00:02:07.929> to<00:02:08.020> the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
in there I use a piece of inner tube I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.770 
in there I use a piece of inner tube I
cut<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.849> seemed<00:02:28.060> right<00:02:28.209> here<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.390> should've

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
cut and it seemed right here I should've

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.070 
cut and it seemed right here I should've
did<00:02:28.900> right<00:02:29.080> here<00:02:29.200> but<00:02:29.379> other<00:02:29.950> than<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.160> it's

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
did right here but other than that it's

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.380 
did right here but other than that it's
well<00:02:32.620> it's<00:02:33.250> pretty<00:02:33.460> much<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.640> good<00:02:33.910> engine<00:02:34.240> I

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
well it's pretty much a good engine I

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.150 
well it's pretty much a good engine I
mean<00:02:34.510> Isis<00:02:34.780> fired<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.170> up<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.770> runs<00:02:35.890> pretty

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
mean Isis fired it up so it runs pretty
