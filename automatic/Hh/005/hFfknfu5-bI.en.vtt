 is the maximum lines laurita all 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.960
 against the sea ​​and now let's see what 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.660

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.700
 unpublished video of how it started badly in 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.230
 south and ideas are going to see inside 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.270
 a little while but first I thank the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.560
 people from bahamonde katyn / we wanted 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.240

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.590
 phones and also the facebook we are going to 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.109
 see what happened between maggie and 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.939
 moliniers in this program pity that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.120
 do not scratch with maliban and that in some 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.980
 also dancing paraguay what 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.160
 good 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.400
 the dancer I think it has a bearing 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.860
 more media right now does not have life 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.500
 who have life right now is 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.230
 coach was a class the life loves and 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.210
 is to make a program take photos 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.989
 understood is a life more than famous and 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.840
 I would like to do it burn burn floor 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.750
 we put them here in this dance hall 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.410
 beloved giant and laurita fernandez a 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.610
 dancing he passes the Saudi cloth and 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.090
 right now it's very strong 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.010
 laporte put voice calls and bravi who 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.710
 happens the transport will tilt there with 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.280
 dancing is nothing bad good wants better 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.720
 dancer 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.720
 at a glance you can see that 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.410
 good to see I'll try to tone me 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.140
 monochrome just like him I do not get a 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:35.720
 Real fight with Jorge Moliner does not help me 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.850
 absolutely nothing else right now 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.560
 Jorge del Ahora has a casting 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.290
 of seven hundred people even exists 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.360
 you clear that two were left because you 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.340
 Laura seems better than Mali as 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.280
 dancer we do not talk about why it's more 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.409
 ductile 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.200
 well there was what happened between 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.670
 They do not moliners ávila and maggie bravi 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.110
 but let's hear what he says 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.509
 Now that is going to go to Paraguay 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.159
 to compete with be in the dance of 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.080
 that country where maggie was not because 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.680
 he did not want to not accept end he had jobs 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.720
 here also in the theater of the program 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.700
 tele in your program on the cable has 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.010
 several things then he got off but if 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.480
 millers are going and the pretty one already started 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.540
 the most listened war the hour what 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.220
 he says is that yes I know you do not see him but I 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.590
 I found out you saw on twitter because they say 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.750
 fight to hit 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.420
 and as I said it began to tackle a 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.269
 attack Jorge because there was nothing I saw a 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.430
 his mom and to dance with mine and me 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.069
 so little did you hear me I talked to 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.900
 Jorge who told me that he said he in 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.650
 no time came out to attack mine 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.829
 tell 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.830
 I did not choose more and why did this happen? 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.020
 I'm this, he gave 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.730
 your reasons will be for not having 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.890
 called to go back to work with her 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.720
 with him and that Jorge had gone to 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.030
 attack her and want to do a bit of 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.780
 noise so that all this is known 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.630
 trip of him and others 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.190
 what were you companion of during 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.270
 all year also joined a 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.230
 reality that you would also see with people 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.270
 put yourself in those attitudes holds another 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.230
 stage of my career the truth is that I 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.510
 in those things 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.459
 in those little ones 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.959
 to me personally I do not think it's 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.670
 well I think it would have been good 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.340
 that gives you a hand in the xerez and goes a 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.480
 little the game for the feel better 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.480
 dancer that magee 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.010
 I came out of a dreamy casting Jorge 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.930
 I also went to the casting and dreamer and 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.019
 I do not stay 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.810
 fingers and I do not stay as a dreamer in a 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.319
 while they are going to see how he entered more and brave and 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.989
 from the south to fame directly in 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.739
 his career but before let's hear the 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.019
 magdalena we were national the 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.519
 grimaldi this they told us as liniers 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.719
 that you already said do not get or from 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:55.760
 interest already I but I speak or avila I saw it 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.760
 bmw side that you thought 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.280
 nothing has separated us here was to speak 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.280
 from the hole 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.880
 I 'm not going to talk right now 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.739
 arrived that happens they need pledge and they have 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.650
 that you look for me there are thousands of ways 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.500
 of looking for press says that it bothered him that 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.699
 you said this happens to say the little ball 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.590
 then he says it bothered him that you've 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.540
 said that you were not going to 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.190
 answer that you are in another stage as 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.910
 who sees you a little bit enlarged good 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.770
 look at the one that came out attacking me was the worst 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.190
 would have been that I put myself from the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.870
 choto side and well you know what to see and 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.860
 start answering you with all the 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.530
 things that I could answer but not what 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.300
 because I really do not add anything 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:51.470
 tear so that I will not come with 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.910

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.380

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.660
 what they are doing honestly not 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.280
 I understand from where I add hopefully 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.350
 sume from somewhere to me 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.080
 personally I do not add anywhere 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.280
 fight me with you and ccoo jorgé if you 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.080
 it seems that it is enlarged, it is not 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.940
 demand I am in another moment of my 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.020
 race that I'm going to fight with you 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.449
 who I do not even go dancing 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.169
 paraguay for here are really 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.199
 I'm looking for press and not the 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:23.830
 of success guys no I came out of a 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:26.409
 dreamer casting jorge also went to 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.999
 dreaming casting and it was not what 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.710
 happens that maybe they saw me instead of more 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:31.479
 dreamers pasta gave me more pasta 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.830
 of girls like to be in the media 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:37.870
 I do not know I do not have it to be like 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.270
 dreamer not that really and to stay 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.849
 like in one of the 22 guys who were going to 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.249
 be next to marcelo so like 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.800
 figure I'm not going to Paraguay and hopefully 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:51.729
 jorgito you stay in Paraguay because of 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.219
 I really feel like a station one 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:58.259
 dancer here there are dancers in 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:58.259
 paraguay because it happens to you with your country 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.430
 never come back from Paraguay 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.570
 the line chooses an Argentine dancer 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.130
 having so many Paraguayan dancers that 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.030
 they surely dance as well as 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.440
 British that does not exist 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.230
 let's agree one thing she said here that 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.580
 this is he was talking to her this 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.410
 is this is the one that is the one 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.550
 manager of the reducer of the dancing of 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:30.590
 paraguay and let's say you had violent but 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.300
 reached a point of negotiations 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.540
 where she of course had to lower the 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.070
 first called here online so 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.930
 as they could not with me and they were for 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.770
 the floors are very clear and this is what 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.200
 what's going on 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:47.960
 obviously there are no forests of 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.060
 Paraguay needs a little kiss for all 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.160
 well let's continue with this topic and 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.890
 let's see how maggie ripped into ideas 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.630
 from the south the first steps of the mag and in 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.639
 that company in a little while nothing but 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.229
 Now I tell them to Maria Moliner room 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:01.520
 right now everyone who understands the center 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.249
 commercial of san martín to only 10 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.329
 blocks 

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:05.329
 crossing the general peace avenue
