00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello to all the youtube channel with more 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.609
 subscribers in italy is fa vj e 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.379
 although I have not seen if video it 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.230
 I know of fame given the enormous resonance 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.269
 who has on the web now about honeycombs j 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.920
 I read very often that talking about 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.049
 video games and having this great 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.180
 following is leading the youth towards 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.960
 useless superficial things like note e 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.910
 videogames 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.320
 today therefore we talk about video games between 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.090
 the other you really asked me into 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.560
 so many try to understand 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.090
 which actually the weight of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.090
 video games have on our lives 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.710
 what we will talk about today is taken from 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.760
 three articles published on space 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.440
 psychology point com 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.790
 I leave the link in description two 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.770
 have been enrolled by the doctor 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.750
 arianna gianotti and one was written 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.460
 from doctor daniela zacchi and if you 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.020
 He went to read the articles of 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.030
 you will find psychology space 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.750
 also links to original searches in 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.880
 English 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.950
 however I would say to start immediately with 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.059
 a very recent experiment is 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.140
 published in the journal 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.030
 pediatrics 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.309
 then in September this year 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.960
 cool fresh and was made by andrew 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.960
 pre crisis 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.950
 zibÃ¬ risks okay is a researcher of 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.080
 oxford the unpronounceable surname and what 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.520
 did this guy took 5 thousand 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.200
 boys divided them into different groups 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.660
 based on the amount of time that 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.220
 they were playing videogames from scratch 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.810
 hours to more than three hours a day 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.880
 now before I tell you results 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.740
 think about it for yourself if you have 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.790
 got the best results ie in 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.979
 meaning from a psychological point of view 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.780
 the result is better who plays 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.880
 more than three hours a day or who doesn't 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.500
 neither of them plays at all 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.909
 actually the best scores have them 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.590
 kept those kids playing in 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.180
 videogames but for a period of time 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.580
 less than 1 hour a day 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.020
 ok but what does it mean better results 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.180
 what they turned out to be 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.100
 better than others in general 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.990
 turned out to be more sociable more 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.970
 satisfied with their life and less 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.220
 hyperactive then kids up to an hour 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.470
 per day you have positive effects evening 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.119
 play more and more then increase 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.250
 the time you spend in front of video games 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.450
 the negative effects are starting to happen 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.920
 see but other searches have 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.930
 proved that however the effects do not 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.640
 they are only psychological but from use 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.160
 excessive videogames can 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.470
 derive fatigue insomnia problems 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.570
 at the sight of seizures and obesity e 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.980
 all related risks as problems 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.140
 cardiovascular etc. 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.209
 ok these results however only concern 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.739
 the time spent playing actually 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.450
 important to distinguish also various types 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.459
 of video games for example according to one 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.260
 longitudinal study ie that lasted 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.329
 a long time 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.950
 exposure to messages of violence 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.300
 it produces violence and we are talking about 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.190
 exposure alone, that is, only seeing 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.200
 acts of violence have also been coined 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.390
 the expression weapon effect for 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.340
 rewrite the fact that only seeing 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.000
 a weapon increases the aggressiveness of the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.530
 people 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.660
 this would open discussions among other things 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.250
 interesting on freedom and law 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.050
 to keep weapons at home and on 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.520
 responsibility of each of us because 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.350
 see guys as much as we do 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.060
 we want to strive to believe that we 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.820
 we are the only ones responsible for ours 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.190
 behavior actually psychology from 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.200
 long time shown how often this 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.270
 what we do is influenced if not 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.010
 even directly caused by 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.780
 circumstances but I don't want to 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.590
 go too far off topic and go back to 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.700
 video games 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.070
 if we said that exposure alone 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.840
 to acts of violence it makes us become more 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.610
 Violent try to think what happens 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.650
 when you are yourself in video games 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.900
 to do that violence ok ok ok ok 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.880
 let's shake dinner but then play the 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.140
 video games only make you become obese 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.880
 violent diseases 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.560
 no as long as we learn to play a 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.600
 adequate time and we already have this 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.060
 that is, seen not exceed one hour a day 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.830
 and play the right games but what they are 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.690
 the right games first of all are 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.820
 absolutely recommended those that 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.770
 stimulate brain activities such as the 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.820
 classic tetris the various brain training 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.050
 that you find around 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.489
 obviously it would be better if you want 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.200
 you only played brain training 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.120
 made by psychologists and educators 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.860
 professional but not wanting to be 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.690
 too much tax goes well more or less 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.220
 then all are very recommended games 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.110
 multiplayer because they allow 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.730
 exchange opinions advice allow 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.560
 also to feel part of a group e 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.270
 this is an absolutely positive thing 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.890
 then the thematic games because they allow 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.810
 to increase their skills in 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.100
 certain areas but to be honest 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.989
 even car games can 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.180
 be useful for developing skills 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.550
 meaning motor and space in short, kids 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.950
 in short, vj is not selling 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.720
 drug to anyone or anyway not up 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.760
 youtube then I don't know if in real life 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.380
 a drug dealer but I don't think so 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.459
 does not represent a danger for 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.690
 the new generations 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.280
 indeed I congratulate them all 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.500
 to have succeeded 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.570
 which has video games so I'm not the 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.400
 demon can be used and indeed if 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.169
 used correctly can also be 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.919
 useful for our personality is the 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.870
 our development 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.910
 but you have to be careful that they remain alone 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.010
 a pastime and therefore not occupying 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.840
 too much of your day is that they are 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.790
 maybe even smart video games in 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.390
 able to stimulate creativity and 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.820
 your skills 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.600
 in short, you guys play but do it in 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.039
 appropriate way 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.419

 Hello
