about this product is you can create
different<00:00:17.910> types<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.600> curl<00:00:18.840> with<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.590> have

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
different types of curl with it we have

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.099 
different types of curl with it we have
three<00:00:20.130> temperatures<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.630> appliance

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
three temperatures on this appliance

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.060 
three temperatures on this appliance
first<00:00:22.949> temperature<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:24.470> 190<00:00:25.470> degrees

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
first temperature is 190 degrees

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.900 
first temperature is 190 degrees
your<00:00:26.430> second<00:00:26.849> temperature<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.980> 210<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
your second temperature is 210 and the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.380 
your second temperature is 210 and the
highest<00:00:30.300> temperature<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.369> 230<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:33.180> you've<00:00:33.270> got

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
highest temperature is 230 so you've got

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.299 
highest temperature is 230 so you've got
three<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.870> choose<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:34.950> you've<00:00:35.130> got

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
three to choose from so if you've got

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.560 
three to choose from so if you've got
hair<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:36.180> fine<00:00:36.630> or<00:00:37.110> over<00:00:37.469> colored<00:00:37.980> or

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
hair it's really fine or over colored or

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.970 
hair it's really fine or over colored or
just<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.840> quite<00:00:40.020> delicate<00:00:40.260> hair<00:00:40.710> then<00:00:40.950> you

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
just really quite delicate hair then you

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.010 
just really quite delicate hair then you
would<00:00:41.219> choose<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.489> lower<00:00:41.850> setting<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.540> if

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
would choose the lower setting and if

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.779 
would choose the lower setting and if
you've<00:00:43.200> got<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.559> quite<00:00:43.920> coarse<00:00:44.340> hair<00:00:44.579> you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
you've got really quite coarse hair you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.819 
you've got really quite coarse hair you
can<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> higher<00:00:45.570> setting<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.440> second

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
can go to the higher setting the second

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.220 
can go to the higher setting the second
button<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> timer<00:00:48.570> setting

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
button we have here is a timer setting

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.360 
button we have here is a timer setting
and<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:50.370> takes<00:00:50.789> us<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.239> 8<00:00:51.780> seconds<00:00:52.590> 10

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and this takes us from 8 seconds 10

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.200 
and this takes us from 8 seconds 10
seconds<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.510> 12<00:00:54.989> seconds<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.820> basically<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
seconds or 12 seconds and basically the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
seconds or 12 seconds and basically the
lower<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.660> setting<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.289> looser<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> curl

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
lower the setting the looser the curl

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430 
lower the setting the looser the curl
the<00:00:59.520> higher<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.030> setting<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.660> 12<00:01:00.930> seconds

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the higher the setting up to 12 seconds

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.260 
the higher the setting up to 12 seconds
but<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> tighter<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.000> curl<00:01:03.030> will

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
but all I see the tighter the curl will

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.329 
but all I see the tighter the curl will
be<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.750> more<00:01:04.019> formed<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> curl<00:01:04.860> will<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
be or more formed the curl will be the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.740 
be or more formed the curl will be the
final<00:01:05.729> button<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
final button we have here is a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.140 
final button we have here is a
directional<00:01:07.680> setting<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:08.850> about

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
directional setting this is all about

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.510 
directional setting this is all about
which<00:01:09.390> direction<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.170> curl<00:01:10.380> goes<00:01:10.650> into<00:01:11.159> so

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
which direction the curl goes into so

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.580 
which direction the curl goes into so
you've<00:01:11.670> got<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> right-hand<00:01:12.750> side<00:01:13.110> which<00:01:13.470> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you've got a right-hand side which is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.719 
you've got a right-hand side which is
going<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.860> take<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.310> one<00:01:14.490> direction

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you've got a left hand side which takes

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.890 
you've got a left hand side which takes
it<00:01:17.310> into<00:01:17.460> another<00:01:17.670> direction<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.720> also

I'm<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> turn<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.829> first

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
I'm going to turn that on to the first

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.600 
I'm going to turn that on to the first
temperature<00:01:54.060> I've<00:01:54.390> set<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.869> at<00:01:55.170> 10<00:01:55.770> seconds

temperature I've set this at 10 seconds

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.030 
temperature I've set this at 10 seconds
here<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.240> also<00:01:57.420> switched<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.229> over<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.740> L

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
here and also switched it over to L

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.999 
here and also switched it over to L
which<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.460> left<00:01:59.850> hand<00:02:00.119> side<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:01.020> side<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.829> the

chamber<00:02:04.619> has<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.310> facing<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.450> head<00:02:06.689> you

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
chamber has to be facing the head you

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.559 
chamber has to be facing the head you
then<00:02:07.350> take<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.649> section<00:02:08.340> place<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.970> straight

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
then take the section place it straight

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.930 
then take the section place it straight
across<00:02:10.039> inside<00:02:11.039> and

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
down when you clamp down you need to let

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.190 
down when you clamp down you need to let
go<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.730> you're<00:02:14.910> going<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.150> hear<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.750> rolling

four beats when you're working with ten

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.100 
four beats when you're working with ten
seconds<00:02:52.800> when<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:53.820> release<00:02:54.150> make<00:02:54.780> sure<00:02:54.990> you

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
seconds when you release make sure you

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.440 
seconds when you release make sure you
open<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.650> up<00:02:55.740> fully<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.370> allow<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.120> curl<00:02:57.420> to

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.270 

well<00:03:12.599> what<00:03:13.110> I'd<00:03:13.230> like<00:03:13.379> to<00:03:13.590> show<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.829> is<00:03:14.250> that

well what I'd like to show you is that

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.720 
well what I'd like to show you is that
this<00:03:14.760> product<00:03:15.120> has<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.959> sensor<00:03:16.469> built<00:03:17.069> into<00:03:17.340> it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
this product has a sensor built into it

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.390 
this product has a sensor built into it
so<00:03:18.299> if<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.629> if<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.079> actual<00:03:19.469> section<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.189> too

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
so if the if the actual section is too

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.819 
so if the if the actual section is too
thick<00:03:20.730> or<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.180> tangled<00:03:21.780> or<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.379> don't<00:03:22.560> put

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
thick or it's tangled or you don't put

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.209 
thick or it's tangled or you don't put
it<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:23.069> properly<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.909> you<00:03:24.450> close<00:03:24.840> down<00:03:25.319> to

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:26.219 
it in properly and you close down to

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.339 
it in properly and you close down to
allow<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:27.209> curl<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.719> go<00:03:27.840> into<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.140> chamber

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
allow the curl to go into the chamber

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.250 
allow the curl to go into the chamber
the<00:03:29.129> sensor<00:03:29.670> tells<00:03:29.939> this<00:03:30.120> something<00:03:30.599> wrong<00:03:30.840> so

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
the sensor tells this something wrong so

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.020 
the sensor tells this something wrong so
it<00:03:31.379> stops<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.189> gives<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.579> bleeping

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
it stops and it gives you a bleeping

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.000 
it stops and it gives you a bleeping
sound<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:34.109> I'm<00:03:34.200> going<00:03:34.349> to<00:03:34.409> show<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.709> what<00:03:34.980> I

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
sound and I'm going to show you what I

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.099 
sound and I'm going to show you what I
mean<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.549> you<00:03:35.640> stick<00:03:35.939> it<00:03:36.030> there<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.569> can<00:03:36.750> hear

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
mean so you stick it there you can hear

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.530 
mean so you stick it there you can hear
the<00:03:37.500> bleeping<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.340> won't<00:03:38.549> actually<00:03:38.760> take<00:03:39.060> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
the bleeping it won't actually take the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.059 
the bleeping it won't actually take the
hair<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:39.930> because<00:03:40.260> there's<00:03:40.409> too<00:03:40.620> much<00:03:40.799> hair

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
so I'm going to just continue working my

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.350 
so I'm going to just continue working my
