00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hi everyone, it's a phoenix 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.410
 today new short videos ci 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.080
 will be shorter than the other has deprived 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.030
 the first video besides everything 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.059
 simply because the time of claude 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.430
 I really have a connection 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.960
 so suddenly I make two formats 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.210
 long almost today we get 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.570
 find either a video on the mode 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.189
 solo campaign so you have to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.500
 destroy there the two towers of wizards 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.040
 downstairs and the two towers of darche and in 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.140
 down for no big candles in 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.059
 connecting lives that's very important 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.370
 then you send your blue giant 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.539
 there will be bombs how you go the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.460
 see like that in a gameplay you 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.329
 described after I have lots of things 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.960
 to tell you you're pestering the wall for 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.640
 access the anti - aircraft defenses me 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.789
 I did because the fame fame and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.559
 had fun are known there you see 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.300
 I see all the giants because 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.739
 I was crazy I will not use 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.710
 so because I did not want to 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.630
 once the anti-aircraft towers 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.400
 destroyed 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:17.189
 you send your bones and their careful 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.110
 risks because you want on 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.850
 the giants is normally low hager 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.009
 if you have 200 troops 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.060
 I advise you to do cap pile of 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.250
 bricks 415 bricks 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.750
 how did you say I got 2.2 g 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.439
 years younger than me 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.860
 five archers less than me and 5 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.509
 barbaric less than me that's it 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.180
 it was for the first corner 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.250
 gameplay because dead to 1/10 then 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.460
 so the article 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.649
 as I told you I already have one in 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.390
 road the second he will not delay the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.079
 Lack 600,000 so it will still 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.079
 empty I think 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.040
 so maybe there will be no video 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.470
 it's okay so the 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.740
 next videos will be posted finally 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.009
 this one would probably be Saturday or 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.209
 Sunday 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.700
 caen Saturday but now the videos 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.920
 it will be Sunday that's what I 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.690
 wanted to say Sunday's videos 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.780
 because like that I listen to the week 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.760

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.280

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.340
 moment it is the good bordelais s is

 complained of a potting soil everywhere this is the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.050
 worse it's horrible but well done 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.980
 as we can 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.900

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.590
 but I think I 'm doing a tutorial 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:46.640
 quickly done on pig attacks 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.410
 but ok so good to small apart on 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.190
 the very good kebabs I had them 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.209
 level 5 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.840
 oh yeah the team upgraded 5 rice 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:59.410
 without messing up terrorism it's 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.410
 really may 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.160
 it's crazy about everything so there maybe nothing 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.150
 little bugs but it's okay it's 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.730
 the picture and the bastille and 930 oh yes the 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.440
 kebabs level 5 would be good that this 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.780
 will be on that it will be a kebab post 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.550
 euros I would say you're there a recipe 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.860
 cooking are bullshit not his 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.540
 wable tea base but it's a mix so 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.440
 I called Rennes you way 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.110
 hard as a dish that you see your brief 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:34.020
 a mixture of eliminate by that it will be 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.250
 earth and air not the same thing so I 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.520
 think you already know the 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.110
 technique I think I have them I 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.280
 do not see videos 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.990
 of them was so you will see this is the 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.730
 next video of but if you saw 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.030
 my previous video my first video 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.790
 so on which I had put you 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.130
 pest attacks and a moment I 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.820
 you 're better at currency attacks 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.110
 but these low attacks and my technique 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.680
 the first video I would not say I 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.170
 wanted to tell you but I prayed to 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.520
 comment anyway I did not know 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.910
 what would you say how much I was a little 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.120
 panic 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.740
 but it's good here you like it 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.140
 can see when are you pestering them 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:21.990
 two wall of the con there as I come from 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:25.650
 do what I did you try ptg 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:29.220
 I think I will still Many boxes 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.560
 brics and in short that we do not care 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.350
 put all your giant bombard you 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.000
 you bomb you bomb giant and 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.920
 you make room for a dragon 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.060
 the dragons is very important because 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.530
 that it's going to cost us the rest is 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.540
 to help you have more defense 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.390
 antiaircraft in the village of course or 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:50.670
 send it will also be worth my lab 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:53.400
 eight levels 8 6 passes I hope to have 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.130
 really the iv level and super dragons 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.800
 astier and wizards level also this 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:02.730
 which costs 7 million 5.4 for that when 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:10.710
 even super expensive but finally leaves so 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:13.050
 that's what I wanted you 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.730
 also say the next video this will be 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.710
 next Sunday that I think I have 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:22.280
 already said the gameplay it is beautiful it is 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.900
 fresh mani khel 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.530

 talk about it but not by taste 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:03.120
