about is the effects section on the
radius<00:03:45.030> 1000<00:03:45.690> we<00:03:45.780> have<00:03:45.900> nine<00:03:46.110> onboard<00:03:46.860> effects

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
radius 1000 we have nine onboard effects

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.100 
radius 1000 we have nine onboard effects
there's<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.970> couple<00:03:48.180> different<00:03:48.300> ways<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.960> use

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
them we have flanger echo transformer

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.850 
them we have flanger echo transformer
skid<00:03:53.820> hold<00:03:54.810> if<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.260> want<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.470> lock<00:03:55.590> in<00:03:55.830> your

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
favorite effect phase for flange pan and

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.800 
favorite effect phase for flange pan and
reverse<00:04:00.690> let's<00:04:01.500> start<00:04:01.770> with<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:01.980> flanger<00:04:02.810> so

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
reverse let's start with the flanger so

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.960 
reverse let's start with the flanger so
typical<00:04:04.440> flanger<00:04:04.860> there's<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.430> couple<00:04:05.700> ways<00:04:05.820> to

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
typical flanger there's a couple ways to

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.970 
typical flanger there's a couple ways to
control<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:06.660> again<00:04:07.080> personalizing<00:04:07.860> your

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
control this again personalizing your

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.210 
control this again personalizing your
sound<00:04:08.250> we<00:04:08.970> have<00:04:09.180> our<00:04:09.360> parameter<00:04:09.870> knobs<00:04:10.220> this

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
sound we have our parameter knobs this

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.320 
sound we have our parameter knobs this
is<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:11.610> milliseconds<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:14.060> here<00:04:15.060> wet

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
is the milliseconds and this is here wet

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.300 
is the milliseconds and this is here wet
dry<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:16.230> I<00:04:16.260> can<00:04:16.470> actually<00:04:16.650> just<00:04:16.980> like<00:04:17.160> on<00:04:17.280> a

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
dry so I can actually just like on a

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.880 
dry so I can actually just like on a
large<00:04:17.550> PA<00:04:17.850> console<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.630> recording<00:04:19.290> console<00:04:19.710> I

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
large PA console a recording console I

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.970 
large PA console a recording console I
can<00:04:20.340> use<00:04:20.730> barely<00:04:21.150> any<00:04:21.300> effect<00:04:21.690> or<00:04:21.960> I<00:04:22.500> can<00:04:22.830> use<00:04:22.950> a

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
can use barely any effect or I can use a

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.080 
can use barely any effect or I can use a
lot<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.460> effect<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:24.120> can<00:04:24.780> customize<00:04:25.760> out<00:04:26.760> quick

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
lot of effect I can customize out quick

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.940 
lot of effect I can customize out quick
I<00:04:27.210> want<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.690> go<00:04:27.930> maybe<00:04:28.320> in<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.560> background

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:53.860 
that's three in the morning on New
Year's<00:06:44.590> right<00:06:44.800> now<00:06:44.950> no<00:06:45.460> kidding

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.510 

so<00:06:54.380> now<00:06:54.500> we've<00:06:54.650> got<00:06:54.800> three<00:06:55.010> loops<00:06:55.250> in<00:06:55.400> there

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
so now we've got three loops in there

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.370 
so now we've got three loops in there
we're<00:06:55.760> good<00:06:55.880> to<00:06:56.000> go<00:06:56.389> we<00:06:56.630> can<00:06:56.780> actually<00:06:57.139> bounce

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
we're good to go we can actually bounce

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.250 
we're good to go we can actually bounce
between<00:06:57.620> the<00:06:57.980> loops<00:06:58.720> we<00:06:59.720> can<00:06:59.840> also<00:06:59.990> do

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
between the loops we can also do

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.500 
between the loops we can also do
something<00:07:00.530> really<00:07:00.830> really<00:07:01.190> cool<00:07:01.520> we<00:07:02.270> can<00:07:02.389> put

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
something really really cool we can put

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.480 
something really really cool we can put
in<00:07:02.660> sample<00:07:03.080> mode<00:07:03.370> and<00:07:04.750> play<00:07:05.750> the<00:07:05.990> loop<00:07:06.220> on<00:07:07.220> top

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
in sample mode and play the loop on top

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.610 
in sample mode and play the loop on top
of<00:07:07.669> the<00:07:07.729> music<00:07:08.090> now<00:07:08.960> what's<00:07:09.139> really<00:07:09.290> cool

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
of the music now what's really cool

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.900 
of the music now what's really cool
about<00:07:09.680> this<00:07:10.100> is<00:07:10.360> why<00:07:11.360> the<00:07:11.419> loops<00:07:11.720> play<00:07:12.910> that's

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910 
about this is why the loops play that's

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:19.589 
about this is why the loops play that's
my<00:07:14.120> loop<00:07:14.350> that's<00:07:15.350> my<00:07:15.620> CD

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:21.570 

so<00:07:20.139> I<00:07:20.199> can<00:07:20.319> have<00:07:20.439> multiple<00:07:20.830> things<00:07:21.159> going<00:07:21.309> on

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 
so I can have multiple things going on

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.540 
so I can have multiple things going on
at<00:07:21.729> once<00:07:21.909> which<00:07:22.179> is<00:07:22.210> pretty<00:07:22.479> cool<00:07:23.490> now<00:07:24.490> the

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 
at once which is pretty cool now the

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.059 
at once which is pretty cool now the
other<00:07:24.729> cool<00:07:25.119> thing<00:07:25.360> about<00:07:25.389> this<00:07:25.599> is<00:07:26.020> a<00:07:26.199> lot<00:07:26.830> of

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:27.069 
other cool thing about this is a lot of

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:29.760 
other cool thing about this is a lot of
units<00:07:27.429> have<00:07:27.599> samplers<00:07:28.599> out<00:07:28.779> there<00:07:28.959> on<00:07:29.409> this<00:07:29.589> I

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:29.770 
units have samplers out there on this I

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.320 
units have samplers out there on this I
can<00:07:29.949> actually<00:07:29.979> pop<00:07:30.459> the<00:07:30.490> CD<00:07:30.909> out<00:07:30.999> while<00:07:31.270> I'm

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:31.330 
can actually pop the CD out while I'm

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.909 
can actually pop the CD out while I'm
playing<00:07:31.509> the<00:07:31.659> sample<00:07:32.050> the<00:07:32.559> other<00:07:32.679> thing

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 
playing the sample the other thing

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:35.239 
playing the sample the other thing
that's<00:07:33.039> cool<00:07:33.339> is<00:07:33.909> I've<00:07:34.240> pitched<00:07:34.509> control<00:07:34.959> and

00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:35.249 
that's cool is I've pitched control and

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:37.499 
that's cool is I've pitched control and
volume<00:07:36.249> for<00:07:36.279> my<00:07:36.639> sample<00:07:36.909> so<00:07:37.209> I<00:07:37.240> can<00:07:37.389> actually

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:37.509 
volume for my sample so I can actually

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:40.980 
volume for my sample so I can actually
turn<00:07:37.899> my<00:07:38.110> sample<00:07:38.559> up<00:07:38.679> and<00:07:38.860> down<00:07:39.179> or<00:07:40.179> adjust<00:07:40.749> a

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990 
turn my sample up and down or adjust a

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.089 
turn my sample up and down or adjust a
speed<00:07:41.289> it's<00:07:42.219> my<00:07:42.369> pitch<00:07:42.639> and<00:07:43.050> that's<00:07:44.050> my<00:07:44.349> volume

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:45.099 
speed it's my pitch and that's my volume

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:47.339 
speed it's my pitch and that's my volume
right<00:07:45.249> there<00:07:45.520> so<00:07:46.360> I<00:07:46.389> have<00:07:46.569> total<00:07:46.869> control<00:07:47.020> over

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:47.349 
right there so I have total control over

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:50.909 
right there so I have total control over
my<00:07:47.469> sample<00:07:47.860> just<00:07:48.069> like<00:07:48.219> I<00:07:48.339> would<00:07:48.399> a<00:07:48.550> CD
