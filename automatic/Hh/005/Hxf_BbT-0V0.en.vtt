00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
I send out already traditionally I've

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.360

been<00:00:42.690> sending<00:00:42.930> out<00:00:43.140> packs<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.890> stuff<00:00:44.070> with

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
been sending out packs and stuff with

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180 
been sending out packs and stuff with
random<00:00:45.180> extras<00:00:45.629> from<00:00:45.840> custom<00:00:46.350> print<00:00:46.620> orders

random extras from custom print orders

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.490

and<00:00:47.550> stuff<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.870> figured<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.379> have

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
and stuff like that but I figured I have

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.229 
and stuff like that but I figured I have
plenty<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.010> stickers<00:00:50.460> from<00:00:50.579> other<00:00:50.820> artists

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
plenty of stickers from other artists

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.910 
plenty of stickers from other artists
that<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.629> also<00:00:51.809> feature<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.469> those<00:00:52.649> packs

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
that I can also feature in those packs

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.189 
that I can also feature in those packs
so<00:00:53.520> I'll<00:00:54.090> probably<00:00:54.300> end<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.629> doing<00:00:54.870> probably<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
so I'll probably end up doing probably a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.770 
so I'll probably end up doing probably a
10<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.559> 10<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.280> 10<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> custom<00:00:57.239> sticker

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
10 to 10 so 10 of the custom sticker

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.139 
10 to 10 so 10 of the custom sticker
extra<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.980> also<00:00:59.399> test<00:00:59.670> out<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.399 
week so i can guarantee they'll send out
pretty<00:01:37.500> efficiently<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:39.030> i<00:01:39.299> don't<00:01:39.450> end<00:01:39.930> up

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409

it that you didn't know that's what I'm
starting<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.180> that's<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.750> will<00:02:12.810> be

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
starting it as that's what it will be

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.500 
starting it as that's what it will be
forever

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
forever

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.440 
forever
or<00:02:13.959> until<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.739> make<00:02:15.099> a<00:02:15.129> pretty<00:02:15.549> big<00:02:15.909> adjustment

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
or until I make a pretty big adjustment

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.780 
or until I make a pretty big adjustment
around<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.560> I've<00:02:17.709> opened<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.040> p.o<00:02:18.280> box<00:02:18.340> and

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
around that so I've opened a p.o box and

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.759 
around that so I've opened a p.o box and
if<00:02:18.879> you<00:02:19.000> have<00:02:19.180> any<00:02:19.209> curiosity<00:02:20.079> about<00:02:20.500> how<00:02:20.709> to

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
if you have any curiosity about how to

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.530 
if you have any curiosity about how to
address<00:02:20.920> an<00:02:21.340> envelope<00:02:21.459> I've<00:02:21.879> set<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.209> out<00:02:22.329> here

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
address an envelope I've set it out here

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.539 
address an envelope I've set it out here
so<00:02:22.750> there's<00:02:22.930> no<00:02:23.079> way<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.260> mess<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.220> up<00:02:24.280> as

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
so there's no way to mess that up as

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.460 
so there's no way to mess that up as
well<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.780> i'll<00:02:25.900> link<00:02:26.079> that<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.439> the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
well but i'll link that in the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.710 
well but i'll link that in the
description<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.430> address<00:02:27.939> itself<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:28.420> unique

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
description the address itself so unique

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.990 
description the address itself so unique
either<00:02:28.959> copy<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.500> paste<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.920> or<00:02:30.099> if<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.879> ever

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
either copy and paste it or if it ever

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.089 
either copy and paste it or if it ever
changes<00:02:31.750> it'll<00:02:32.049> be<00:02:32.170> updated<00:02:32.620> there<00:02:32.829> so

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
changes it'll be updated there so

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.430 
changes it'll be updated there so
there's<00:02:33.459> no<00:02:33.640> fact<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.750> it's<00:02:34.900> like<00:02:34.989> embedded

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
there's no fact that it's like embedded

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.990 
there's no fact that it's like embedded
in<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.650> video<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.280> there's<00:02:36.519> no<00:02:36.670> way<00:02:36.790> for<00:02:36.849> me

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
in the video and there's no way for me

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.300 
in the video and there's no way for me
to<00:02:37.090> change<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.569> in<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:38.200> future<00:02:38.379> so<00:02:39.099> that's

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
to change it in the future so that's

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.729 
to change it in the future so that's
just<00:02:39.640> kind<00:02:39.849> of<00:02:39.879> a<00:02:39.970> sure<00:02:40.180> safe<00:02:40.450> way<00:02:40.659> to<00:02:40.690> do<00:02:40.959> it<00:02:41.140> if

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
just kind of a sure safe way to do it if

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.039 
just kind of a sure safe way to do it if
you<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:42.069> any<00:02:42.220> questions<00:02:42.790> about<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.810> process
