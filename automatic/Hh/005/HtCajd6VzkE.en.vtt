00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
jump on a trampoline so we went to this

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.470 
jump on a trampoline so we went to this
extreme<00:00:16.770> air<00:00:17.070> park<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.789> ended<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.180> being

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
extreme air park and it ended up being

the<00:00:18.750> most<00:00:18.779> fun<00:00:19.230> ever<00:00:19.500> because<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.310> was<00:00:20.430> just<00:00:20.460> a

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the most fun ever because it was just a

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.460 
the most fun ever because it was just a
room<00:00:20.910> full<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.270> trampolines<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:22.140> had<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
room full of trampolines we had the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.200

entire place to ourselves

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.000 
entire place to ourselves
so<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.570> were<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.689> doing<00:00:24.900> flips<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.590> jumping

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
trampoline but of course Terry and I

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.130 
trampoline but of course Terry and I
broke<00:00:41.460> rules<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.239> we're<00:00:42.360> badasses<00:00:42.780> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
broke rules because we're badasses and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.750 
broke rules because we're badasses and
revving<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.710> were<00:00:43.800> leaving<00:00:43.980> another<00:00:44.489> group<00:00:44.730> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
revving we were leaving another group of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.639 
revving we were leaving another group of
people<00:00:44.910> came<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:45.899> ended<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.530> getting

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
people came in and they ended up getting

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.410 
people came in and they ended up getting
in<00:00:46.860> trouble<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.340> breaking<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.730> rules<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
in trouble for breaking the rules so

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.510 
in trouble for breaking the rules so
that<00:00:49.050> sucks<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.590> them<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.129> didn't<00:00:50.340> suck

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
that sucks for them but it didn't suck

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.529
