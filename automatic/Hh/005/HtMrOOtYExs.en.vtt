 Translated by MegamanHxH 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.070
 What ... 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.000
 What is going on here? 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.000
 Princess "Luna"? 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.150
 What is going on here? 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.100
 "Luna" ... 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 "Denki"? Is Anth is ok? 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 I'm sorry ... I did not mean that 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 I'd like to take it with magic 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 I did not mean to break it 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 You can barely tie your tape, dear 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Your magic has not yet reached its level 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.500
 Now, tell me you little skilled 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.000
 Is this your worst fear? 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Or you feel that your destiny 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Have you taken? 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Woefully, that skilled "Unicorn" full of magical powers like you 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Have a horn that does not work properly 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Princess "Luna"? 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.500
 Are you "Knight Moon Moon"? 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.000
 At night, when I find in the dreams of a skilled full of troubles 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.500
 I connect to their memories or nightmares, hoping to teach them 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.000
 But I'm scared 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 That your condition 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.500
 Your past is not enough yet 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.500
 And your future, not for me 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.000
 This world belongs to my sister 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.500
 But it is not here to happen 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Does this place exist 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Between fiction and reality? 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 he is 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 World of "Celestia"? 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 The world where dreams come into play 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.500
 I brought you here because you have a bright mind, it will prosper over time 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.000
 I deeply regret that you have forgotten your abilities, and feel that you are cursed by your destiny 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 I will not let those fears penetrate into you 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.500
 We have a lot in common 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.000
 Both of us feel that they misunderstood us 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.500
 You, with your inverse horn 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.500
 And I, the night worshiper 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.500
 We can not see our world as other magicians see it 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 I do not want you to end up with the same inevitability that you've encountered before 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.500
 I thought the magicians could not see him 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.000
 You have been blessed with an exceptional gift 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 But, in order to see it, I must go deeper 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 I will take you to my story 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Prepare to see "Equestria" as it was a thousand years ago 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 You have plenty to wait for "Dinky Doo" 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 And you are on a journey to find out who you really are
