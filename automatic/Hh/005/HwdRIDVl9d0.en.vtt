connection<00:00:43.140> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.739> sucks<00:00:43.950> up<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
connection kind of sucks up here so it

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.510 
connection kind of sucks up here so it
would<00:00:45.780> say<00:00:45.960> three<00:00:46.260> hours<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.680> download<00:00:46.829> now

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
would say three hours to download now

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.680 
would say three hours to download now
and<00:00:47.989> then<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.379> got<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> point<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.820> where<00:00:50.969> it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and then in got to the point to where it

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.930 
and then in got to the point to where it
would<00:00:52.020> stop<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:54.480> whole<00:00:55.140> procedure<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
would stop the whole procedure is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.790 
would stop the whole procedure is
entirely

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.330 

so<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.780> downloads<00:01:05.199> wouldn't<00:01:05.530> finish<00:01:05.680> nothing

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
so the downloads wouldn't finish nothing

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.040 
so the downloads wouldn't finish nothing
