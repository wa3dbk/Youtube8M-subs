00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
my gosh but I don't think it to come to

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.310 
my gosh but I don't think it to come to
that<00:04:18.130> though<00:04:18.790> you<00:04:19.600> accept<00:04:20.350> my<00:04:20.650> challenge<00:04:22.320> but

that though you accept my challenge but
basically<00:04:23.860> Andrea<00:04:24.490> making<00:04:25.150> all<00:04:25.330> these

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
basically Andrea making all these

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.270 
basically Andrea making all these
circuits<00:04:25.960> just<00:04:26.110> like<00:04:26.230> crashed<00:04:26.590> humor<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:29.380> the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
circuits just like crashed humor and the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.350 
circuits just like crashed humor and the
loading<00:04:30.610> time<00:04:30.790> is<00:04:31.150> very<00:04:31.510> very<00:04:31.960> like<00:04:33.240> take<00:04:34.240> it

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
loading time is very very like take it

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.040 
loading time is very very like take it
