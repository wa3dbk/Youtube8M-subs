kind<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.189> external<00:00:26.400> monitor<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.029> these<00:00:27.150> aren't

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
kind of external monitor so these aren't

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.240 
kind of external monitor so these aren't
a<00:00:27.420> bad<00:00:27.539> option<00:00:27.779> they're<00:00:28.529> about<00:00:28.740> 50<00:00:28.890> bucks

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
a bad option they're about 50 bucks

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.370 
a bad option they're about 50 bucks
however<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.300> problem<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.080> when<00:00:31.230> you're

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
however the problem is is when you're

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.110 
however the problem is is when you're
not<00:00:31.560> near<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> power<00:00:32.070> supply<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.610> internal

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
not near a power supply the internal

not near a power supply the internal
batteries<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.630> these<00:00:33.750> don't<00:00:34.020> last<00:00:34.170> very<00:00:34.290> long

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
batteries on these don't last very long

batteries on these don't last very long
at<00:00:34.739> least<00:00:34.770> mine<00:00:35.100> didn't<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.969> needed<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.360> way

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
at least mine didn't so I needed a way

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.330 
at least mine didn't so I needed a way
to<00:00:36.510> power<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.110> thing<00:00:37.350> if<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.980> was<00:00:38.100> out<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
to power the thing if I was out in a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.280 
to power the thing if I was out in a
field<00:00:38.579> or<00:00:38.820> something<00:00:38.850> about<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.809> year<00:00:40.020> ago<00:00:40.050> I

saw on DSLR film news blog that he

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.830 
saw on DSLR film news blog that he
started<00:00:43.590> using<00:00:43.770> one<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.040> these<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.670> a

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
started using one of these this is a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.330 
started using one of these this is a
about<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.989> twenty<00:00:46.379> dollar<00:00:46.410> rechargeable

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
about a twenty dollar rechargeable

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.040 
about a twenty dollar rechargeable
lithium-ion<00:00:47.910> battery<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.690> puts<00:00:48.899> out<00:00:49.020> about

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
lithium-ion battery that puts out about

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.160 
lithium-ion battery that puts out about
10<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> 12<00:00:49.710> volts<00:00:49.850> which<00:00:50.850> guess<00:00:51.329> what<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.809> about

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
10 to 12 volts which guess what is about

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.750 
10 to 12 volts which guess what is about
the<00:00:52.320> same<00:00:52.530> amount<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:53.070> power<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.340> need<00:00:53.550> for

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the same amount of power you need for

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.939 
the same amount of power you need for
one<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.940> these<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.960> I've<00:00:55.170> been<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.710> try

monitor that way you have to have this

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.219 
monitor that way you have to have this
all<00:01:34.710> those<00:01:35.060> expensive<00:01:36.060> SD<00:01:36.390> monitors<00:01:36.840> use<00:01:37.020> that

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
all those expensive SD monitors use that

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.499 
all those expensive SD monitors use that
connector<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:37.890> that's<00:01:38.070> very<00:01:38.130> important<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
connector so that's very important and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
connector so that's very important and
finally<00:01:39.810> met<00:01:39.960> your<00:01:39.990> power<00:01:40.320> supply<00:01:40.560> here<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
will plug into the wall so you can

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.810 
will plug into the wall so you can
charge<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.350> thing<00:01:43.590> plug<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.640> into<00:01:44.759> your

battery flip the switch this green LED
comes<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.119> which<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.420> interesting<00:01:48.899> because

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
comes on which is interesting because

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.050 
comes on which is interesting because
it's<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> power<00:01:49.829> supply<00:01:50.130> itself<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.970> not

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
it's on the power supply itself and not

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.330 
it's on the power supply itself and not
the<00:01:51.210> battery<00:01:51.420> however<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.710> don't<00:01:52.890> lose<00:01:53.040> this

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the battery however so don't lose this

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.330 
the battery however so don't lose this
because<00:01:53.670> you'll<00:01:53.820> need<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.210> charge<00:01:55.340> your

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
because you'll need it to charge your

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.670 
because you'll need it to charge your
battery<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.540> when<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.110> green<00:01:58.320> light<00:01:58.469> goes

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
battery and when that green light goes

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.289 
battery and when that green light goes
off<00:01:58.829> you'll<00:01:59.070> know<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.490> fully<00:01:59.880> charged

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
off you'll know that it's fully charged

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.219 
off you'll know that it's fully charged
so<00:02:01.049> once<00:02:01.350> that's<00:02:01.590> done<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.670> charged<00:02:03.420> go<00:02:04.110> ahead

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
so once that's done and charged go ahead

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.980 
so once that's done and charged go ahead
