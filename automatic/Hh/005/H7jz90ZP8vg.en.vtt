best<00:02:49.910> they<00:02:50.150> thought<00:02:50.420> well<00:02:50.870> above<00:02:51.200> their<00:02:51.350> way

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.990 

that's<00:03:01.740> been<00:03:01.950> such<00:03:02.220> an<00:03:02.370> aggressive<00:03:02.610> fish

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
throw out then these are a few different

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.640 
throw out then these are a few different
types<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.690> littles<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.080> can<00:03:07.200> use<00:03:07.410> for

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
types of littles that you can use for

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.470 
types of littles that you can use for
ice<00:03:07.770> tell<00:03:08.040> us<00:03:08.160> about<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.459> yeah<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:09.120> one<00:03:09.300> here

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
ice tell us about it yeah this one here

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.070 
ice tell us about it yeah this one here
is<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.569> buzzbait

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
is a buzzbait

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.990 
is a buzzbait
this<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.440> more<00:03:11.069> of<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.280> surface<00:03:11.490> law<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.880> will

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
this is more of a surface law it will

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.210 
this is more of a surface law it will
run<00:03:12.209> him<00:03:12.360> along<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.690> surface<00:03:13.130> sort<00:03:14.130> of

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
run him along the surface sort of

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.510 
run him along the surface sort of
creating<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.819> wake<00:03:15.030> coming<00:03:15.480> off<00:03:15.600> him<00:03:15.720> it's<00:03:16.230> more

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
creating a wake coming off him it's more

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.310 
creating a wake coming off him it's more
yeah<00:03:17.520> it<00:03:17.880> instincts<00:03:18.390> an<00:03:18.510> aggressive<00:03:19.080> attack

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
yeah it instincts an aggressive attack

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
yeah it instincts an aggressive attack
from<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.740> bass<00:03:19.890> yeah

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
from the bass yeah

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.460 
from the bass yeah
similar<00:03:20.820> thing<00:03:21.000> with<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.300> spinner<00:03:22.050> bait<00:03:22.260> here

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
similar thing with the spinner bait here

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.100 
similar thing with the spinner bait here
yeah<00:03:23.310> it's<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.090> let<00:03:24.240> that<00:03:24.270> sink<00:03:24.630> down<00:03:24.840> and

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
yeah it's you can let that sink down and

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.020 
yeah it's you can let that sink down and
bring<00:03:25.260> him<00:03:25.350> using<00:03:25.740> that<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:25.860> variety<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.640> depths

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
bring him using that a variety of depths

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.720 
bring him using that a variety of depths
yep<00:03:27.270> right<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.690> then<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:27.959> move<00:03:28.170> over<00:03:28.440> here<00:03:28.620> to

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
yep right and then we move over here to

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.620 
yep right and then we move over here to
services<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:29.850> is<00:03:29.970> what<00:03:30.090> we're<00:03:30.239> fishing<00:03:30.510> with

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
services this is what we're fishing with

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.540 
services this is what we're fishing with
today<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:31.110> little<00:03:31.590> soft<00:03:31.830> shell<00:03:32.040> Sakata

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
today a little soft shell Sakata

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.520 
today a little soft shell Sakata
so<00:03:32.760> he'll<00:03:32.910> just<00:03:33.120> float<00:03:33.300> along<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.660> surface<00:03:33.840> we

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
so he'll just float along the surface we

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.350 
so he'll just float along the surface we
can<00:03:34.680> twitch<00:03:34.950> him<00:03:35.160> or<00:03:35.370> walk<00:03:35.730> him<00:03:35.880> however<00:03:36.239> we

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
can twitch him or walk him however we

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.530 
can twitch him or walk him however we
sort<00:03:36.570> of<00:03:36.660> one<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.020> then<00:03:37.950> we<00:03:38.070> come<00:03:38.250> up<00:03:38.370> here

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
sort of one and then we come up here

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.240 
sort of one and then we come up here
this<00:03:39.540> one<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> semi<00:03:40.200> 65<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:40.980> that's<00:03:41.160> your

this one is a semi 65 so that's your

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.880 
this one is a semi 65 so that's your
pencil<00:03:41.610> Sol<00:03:41.850> lure<00:03:42.120> another<00:03:42.510> surface<00:03:42.959> law<00:03:43.290> we

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
pencil Sol lure another surface law we

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.800 
pencil Sol lure another surface law we
this<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.310> walk<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.760> dog<00:03:44.910> style<00:03:45.180> or<00:03:45.420> so<00:03:45.630> he'll

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
this is a walk the dog style or so he'll

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.030 
this is a walk the dog style or so he'll
just<00:03:46.019> sort<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.230> dance<00:03:46.470> from<00:03:46.680> side<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:46.920> side

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
just sort of dance from side to side

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.280 
just sort of dance from side to side
look<00:03:47.550> like<00:03:47.730> an<00:03:47.850> injured<00:03:48.060> bait<00:03:48.239> fish<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.810> we

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
look like an injured bait fish and we

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.530 
look like an injured bait fish and we
can<00:03:49.440> go<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:50.100> shallow<00:03:50.370> driver<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:51.239> this<00:03:51.390> is

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
can go to a shallow driver so this is

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.420 
can go to a shallow driver so this is
just<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.930> know<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.500> nice<00:03:52.680> shallow<00:03:52.980> area

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
just you know in a nice shallow area

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.729 
just you know in a nice shallow area
maybe<00:03:53.970> as<00:03:54.269> you're<00:03:54.930> getting<00:03:55.200> on<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.560> day

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
maybe as you're getting on to the day

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.530 
maybe as you're getting on to the day
you're<00:03:56.250> moving<00:03:56.640> out<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:56.790> your<00:03:56.880> surface<00:03:57.300> lures

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
you're moving out of your surface lures

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.930 
you're moving out of your surface lures
in<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.750> morning<00:03:58.080> more<00:03:58.410> into<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.769> shallow<00:03:59.580> diver

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
in the morning more into a shallow diver

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.430 
in the morning more into a shallow diver
and<00:04:00.390> with<00:04:00.540> these<00:04:00.750> they're<00:04:00.989> really<00:04:01.260> good

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
and with these they're really good

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.530 
and with these they're really good
because<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:01.830> can<00:04:01.980> get<00:04:02.160> lures<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.850> vary<00:04:03.239> in

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
because you can get lures that vary in

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.410 
because you can get lures that vary in
bed<00:04:03.810> size<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.739> can<00:04:04.950> affect<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.519> action

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
bed size so that can affect that action

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.420 
bed size so that can affect that action
as<00:04:06.600> well<00:04:06.810> as<00:04:06.930> how<00:04:07.110> deep<00:04:07.350> they<00:04:07.500> divert<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:08.040> really

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
as well as how deep they divert a really

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.110 
as well as how deep they divert a really
good<00:04:08.610> type<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:08.940> lure<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.390> we<00:04:09.630> also<00:04:09.810> do<00:04:10.170> use<00:04:10.410> a

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
good type of lure and we also do use a

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.710 
good type of lure and we also do use a
deeper<00:04:12.120> depth<00:04:12.329> bluer<00:04:13.049> as<00:04:13.290> well<00:04:14.540> it's<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.600> good

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
deeper depth bluer as well it's a good

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.120 
deeper depth bluer as well it's a good
thing<00:04:15.780> about<00:04:16.019> these<00:04:16.260> soft<00:04:16.530> shells<00:04:16.739> card<00:04:16.979> is

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
thing about these soft shells card is

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.490 
thing about these soft shells card is
they<00:04:17.280> lean<00:04:17.549> really<00:04:17.910> lie<00:04:18.060> so<00:04:18.510> it's<00:04:19.140> not<00:04:19.290> making

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
they lean really lie so it's not making

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.870 
they lean really lie so it's not making
a<00:04:19.590> big<00:04:19.739> impact<00:04:20.040> on<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.310> surface<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:20.790> it's

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
a big impact on the surface and it's

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.410 
a big impact on the surface and it's
more<00:04:21.090> realistic

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:46.250 

you

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.450 

when<00:04:47.260> you're<00:04:47.380> casting<00:04:47.830> we're<00:04:48.010> about<00:04:48.250> to

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
when you're casting we're about to

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.820 
when you're casting we're about to
Natrona<00:04:48.790> iron<00:04:49.060> bright<00:04:49.389> generally<00:04:50.350> even<00:04:50.560> in

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
Natrona iron bright generally even in

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.650 
Natrona iron bright generally even in
this<00:04:50.919> sort<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.250> water<00:04:51.430> most<00:04:51.790> vast<00:04:52.180> water<00:04:52.449> we're

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
this sort of water most vast water we're

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.360
