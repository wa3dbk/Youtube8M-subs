00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.399
 with you with your viewers what 

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:38.649
 last and what comes for cycling 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.600
 of colombia that is projected very well already 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.479
 this year there are moments that we remember 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.789
 here in colombia as the moments in 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.949
 those who gives I do not fight herrera when we saw 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.019
 to víctor hugo peña with that shirt 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.120
 yellow as today of you of these 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.819
 moments has been a very 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.440
 nice because sometimes it has 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:01:00.089
 been a contact first with the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.089
 resistance boys 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.640
 fortunately they already have the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.119
 technology to be able to enter more 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.909
 continuously what he does but if 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.119
 us as commentators on a channel 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.640
 of television because from a distance already and 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.740
 to be able to comment on what they are doing 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.440
 we are always very excited today 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.990
 starting with this very good anecdote of 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.180
 víctor hugo peña and others what they leave 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.380
 adding on the road as santiago 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.080
 botero como 4 mauricio soler etcetera no 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.660
 about these last two cyclists and 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.610
 they wanted to ask because I know that you 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.710
 he was in that narrative in which he won 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.390
 santiago botero in thiago then the truth 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.960
 I was in a very moment 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.729
 Strong is a man who has demonstrated 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.940
 forever 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.399
 not only body strength because 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.429
 is a machine the truth was one of the 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.369
 better gifted athletes that has had 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.649
 Colombia regarding as his 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.069
 physical constitution and everything but the great 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.810
 will and the way he too 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.690
 I had that inspiration to become 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.610
 someone prominent especially when 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.680
 we talk not only about climbing mountains 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.920
 and to be mountain beverages but 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.290
 also behave but recently I saw 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.810
 santiago already in another perspective of his 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.150
 life and its projection in the the 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.090
 cycling and if you feel feels 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.720
 good python or green alba we have seen in 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.970
 fullness and good now see us also of 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.989
 one side and the other as we see how we have 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.489
 changed a little 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.160
 o'connor who can tell us about 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.709
 Mauricio Soler year to Mauricio I want it 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.780
 very much very much only that always 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.910
 I said he was a very good boy and 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.099
 good in general the circuits all 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.269
 they have that way they are all very good 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.560
 they are but extraordinary people not for 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.300
 to meditate other sports but 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.319
 forgive me and the cyclists are the 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.019
 better characters than I have known 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.049
 and when you say or read was one of them 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:15.389
 but also more good than any other 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:18.810
 with a clear spirit with one with an ace 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:22.379
 let's say it was almost a bit like a 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.540
 child who did not know of many evils 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.959
 then it is that better in races began 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.370
 to live a little more extreme not since 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.250
 people are watching you who 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.569
 you're here for there but, but 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.430
 Mauritius is always this resource of the 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.169
 circumstances write in career and 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.099
 when he taught us what can be in 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:47.040
 the mountains because for me it was a 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.560
 enormous joy was a boy who had 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.799
 A little bit of fear at the beginning is 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.040
 aggressive can do it 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:59.099
 fortunately he could do it now what 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.829
 that he also does with his life because he knew 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.199
 he closes his throat thinking about the 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.400
 way he is now facing his 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.409
 life as he has to live 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.510
 Well, it gives me great pleasure too 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.290
 have at some time been part of their 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.090
 great success when when he was 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.039
 mixed up and level 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.940
 journalistic for georgina some 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:24.190
 anecdote especially one of my best 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.350
 anecdotes as a journalist because it was the 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.229
 the first time I had to go on a tour 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.690
 because I knew three words of French 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.660
 when I got into a taxi to try 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.500
 get to the opening to the prologue of that 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.330
 year that was in sugar let's you is very 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.440
 famous but then hardly 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.990
 there was the map and I got on the taxi and the 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.520
 taxi driver who very nicely was going 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.410
 teaching the odd word in 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.960
 French because I did not have much 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.850
 vocabulary I do not know how the man said 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.889
 but he got into the journey of 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.389
 prologue and when I realized it then 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:03.070
 a cyclist had thrown us then 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.900
 Well I went crazy like I said 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.610
 the gentleman because something we had done wrong 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.840
 because we were where we did not feel 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.730
 have been up 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.070
 kindly a real policeman does not 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.310
 Fuck from the place where we were 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.110
 happening and somehow then 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.639
 find a way to turn 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.250
 will come to where I had to pick up 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.800
 my accreditation but it was a scare 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.630
 older but after that little 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.630
 direct participation in the tour of 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.460
 france what is that moment what is that 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.050
 race that we can not miss for 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.370

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.470
 most beautiful moments that will have the 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.080
 career 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.100
