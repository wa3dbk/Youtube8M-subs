00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.949
 hi everyone is sky before at 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.960
 score it's going well today for at 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.180
 new sniper gameplay and this time 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.770
 ci on world at war sees the scrum 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.289
 general to change a little bit mixed up 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.669
 general or sniper springfield for a 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.260
 quite classic class of any 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.360
 way the games like that we did not 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.809
 necessarily enormously the choice is to 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.000
 say the opposing force and impact 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.949
 heavy if my translation is good there 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.600
 heavy impact sees the little 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.730
 classic configuration for the sniper 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.079
 on world at war is a game that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.059
 Frankly I appreciate everything 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.890
 especially that I think you 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.190
 know if you followed me from a small 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.870
 moment 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.120
 so here I could not help but 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.070
 to switch on bands at war on low this 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.079
 little backtracking it's true that 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.640
 I have done since the release of ghost I 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.589
 take a little longer during 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.149
 almost a month and a half two months that 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.950
 videos on ghost and that's it for 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.470
 come back a little bit back make a 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.539
 little bit here is a little come back for 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.550
 the origins and it's still really 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.850
 very good to go back to 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.610
 better come back better forward 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.459
 and so inevitably that's a little break 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.890
 of ghost is a little back on these 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.929
 giants who make so much fun and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.880
 it is true that often low I am asked 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.619
 what is your favorite call of duty and me 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.119
 even I wanted to ask the question there is 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.009
 a few days she is your call of 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.959
 favorite duty and I was told but their 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.039
 roof what's yours is very 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.709
 difficult to answer it is very 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.860
 hard to say what is his call of 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.270
 favorite duty because actually that 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.160
 in fact a lot it's true that for the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.959
 people who arrived on black 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.479
 ops two have not necessarily known 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.340
 the era of call of old stocking 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.170
 so it's very difficult it's a lot 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.140
 easier in the sense that they have 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.060
 less 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.729
 less known period so that's the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.870
 choice is more restricted but I'm here 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.790
 since call of duty 4 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.010
 actually it makes call of it 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.840
 in fact that I play well and that's 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.970
 very difficult because every call of 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.430
 corresponds to a period each call of 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.470
 corresponds to a state of mind to some 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.180
 thing there is always something 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.280
 behind that and it's hard to 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.620
 choose which one we prefer but when 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.020
 even I think that I have to 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.180
 to make the choice if I had to choose a 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.560
 only call of 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.989
 I think it might be related 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.860
 war that's hard to say but I 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.750
 think it would be at world at war 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.390
 why then it's true that gold world 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.400
 at war today so for people 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.540
 who will ask is that if I 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.830
 take world at war is what it's worth 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.680
 the shot is what my luck that thing 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.239
 to take a little bit of that to me 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.239
 character and play on xbox 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.440
 I did not cross hackers because I 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.989
 do not really remember hackers 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.330
 of which cleac'h on xbox one could say 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.700
 that it's almost done on ps3 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.310
 I crossed a few but 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.920
 frankly it's still a step 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.220
 a lot I think kids are here 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.810
 10 year old who liked to dock on Thursday 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.239
 10 years because we heard it with the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.280
 voice of the hackers me I see that I 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.100
 find a sin I'm a piquette 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.180
 that's short, it was in English at 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.640
 but I think that in France it was 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.620
 this is good actually 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.060
 little assholes who liked well together 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.980
 the game is getting less and less 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.180
 I imagine they are caught is not 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.860
 pies and by their parents anyway 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.870
 that's all I hope they are 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.709
 done well slam the mouth and there are some 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.410
 less and less so it's a lot 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.060
 more and more playable and we see it because 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.680
 that also there are a few more people 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.060
 that before actually hackers by 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.959
 so people are resuming their taste for playing 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.299
 on world at war 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.100
 so it's nice I make you 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.860
 really if you never have players 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.180
 oratory zii play here will play on 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.280
 rhÃ´ne at war 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.200
 it's a colossus like cock 4 this is it 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.760
 to say basic basic home and that's 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.049
 that I like that is why if 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.120
 I had to choose my favorite club 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.489
 that would be either 4.4 or roanne to thouars 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.340
 in simplicity and that's what is 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.480
 good simplicity not full of stuff 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.950
 it is true that it is good to have the 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.600
 choice is good to create its 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.190
 classes and I think the creation of 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.019
 classes on call of duty ghost done 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.010
 some of the best ice creations 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.319
 of all call of 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.480
 and it's good to have the choice 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.999
 in the sense simplicity is also 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.469
 present because it is true that there is 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:15.969
 not a lot of things we would like 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.590
 to be able to do a few more things 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.000
 there are a lot of things that would be nice to 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.009
 set on on world at war 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.690
 frankly I dream of a world at war 2 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:28.960
 you imagine their dreams world at war 2 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.509
 that is to say the basic the bases the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.710
 simplicity we love that for which 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.449
 Colloquium has become popular 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.160
 today is that the developers 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.139
 I have the impression tend to forget 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.110
 why the series became famous 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.000
 why it was so hard and why they 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.229
 have removed all of this so eventually 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.789
 why today its map of less 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.199
 than before because all the reasons 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.150
 for which the call of was 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.030
 popular he is gradually withdrawing 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.520
 so obviously something that is obvious the 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.380
 gold success by a little bit then 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.240
 actually when I say by a little 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.180
 effect no success is always my 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.650
 time but compared to 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.750
 it's a bit of a balance to say that bath 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.099
 is mounted but today it goes down 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.310
 a bit because that's precisely it 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.810
 withdraw it's a shame I think 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.360
 how do they do to not hear him that 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.090
 the whole community is screaming back in 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.590
 back we want to go back on 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.270
 times of world at war over the ages 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.729
 of caucade not everyone I know 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.659
 excuse you're upset not chic already share 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.220
 commented with people they equip themselves 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:27.009
 thomas same but I like not 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.830
 everyone but have the choice 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.419
 could also choose from this 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.470
 that we like that is to say that to have 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.150
 the choice in creating classes 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.889
 have a choice in the trumps 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.349
 have a choice in killstreaks 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.360
 have a choice in a lot of things 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.650
 except in what a lot of people 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.440
 ask that is to say some 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.270
 simplicity and I think I got 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.849
 damn melee in there but everything 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.680
 that to say that I love world at war 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:53.800
 because there is no stuff 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.599
 no dead here is today 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.580
 we do a lot of games to assist with 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.219
 viewfinder sights that detect 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.009
 explosive targets that when you pass 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:07.060
 above that you sat explodes this mark that 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:09.190
 all this is super super assisted say 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.259
 that we do everything so that even if you have 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.669
 evil even if you're bad you can 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:14.560
 to be good here is that the new ones 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.630
 colosse today is normal 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.159
 a call of this is a game for all ages 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.469
 so it's done to seduce even the 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.419
 people who are bad and today on 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:24.279
 all the people who are bad and that's 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.510
 for that people who I do not say that 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.610
 I'm good at what but the people who 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.580
 like the challenge of the 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.560
 difficulty and simplicity leave 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.180
 finally and return to the old 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.289
 call of to regain emotions 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.990
 that they had before 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.130
 and they are there they are I say not 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.080
 intact but they are still 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.820
 present and we can see it 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.779
 frankly go mostly colossi 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.310
 you will see that there is always 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:47.380
 world always people who are there in 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.789
 saying why would I go somewhere else then 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.650
 I'm having fun here here I am 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:54.039
 think his part of this principle there in 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.180
 anyway here after the open lobby mw2 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.339
 that I did yesterday I went to do 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.139
 some parts on the canvas and I 'm 

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:59.650
 I'm really pleased I can you 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:01.029
 guarantee it 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.500
 the connection was on my side because 

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:04.659
 that actually the problem of these games 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.550
 there if you have not a good that to forget 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:08.680
 because you're really going to shoot you 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.240
 hair but in any case if you have the
