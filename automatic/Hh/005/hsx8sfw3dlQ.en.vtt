 United States 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.750
 so georges was not enough 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.750
 what will be the strategy of the Iranians 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.070
 be careful if according to m 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.049
 the screen well played that 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.869
 to say we call here 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:26.869
 it is true that we can count on the need now 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.389
 for those who love each other 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.139

 at forest fires onf to canton in ohio 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.589
 it is not easy 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:38.069
 how to succeed 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.069
 thirty seconds of play yet 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.879
 while they had not had time to take advantage of the position 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.169
 United States 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.509
 if you look at the stadiums 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.919
 andrÃ© reckon that there is not much that separates these two 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.919
 teams indeed neither of the two teams in the locker room 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.490
 we can plant a little bit of time 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.479
 it's a people without a hitch 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.419
 we can find a place for pedestrians 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.210
 this is the text of more than 50 years 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.270

 anthony bensalah said m 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:04.419
 he will also be his own account 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.419
 the rsa socle at this point 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.080
 the unsustainable himself 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.419
 weekend 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.830
 with the ball 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.830

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.319
 like to art 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.870
 but this support 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.969
 we follow this distortion 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:01.330
 bemba who was on the beach or on this page 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
 christine power 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.539
 terms 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.849
 he intercepted in time 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:20.849
 crossed the median line 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:29.159
 when they want to pass the long-promised line we fill them with afp 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.860
 serious attempt 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.680
 the company entered 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.020
 a minute of silence in a second quarter 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.589
 the united states down 

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:49.589
 more than four points

 Gerard his wish 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:09.039
 poet his hothouse touch that it shows 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.669
 with such negotiations before halftime 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.449
 the support is 6 euros 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.550
 the answer is negative 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.520
