00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.000
 motorcycle minsk my name is Eugene and 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.690
 so at the request of my subscriber dmitri 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.620
 Zhukov 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.800
 he asked me to explain to him more precisely 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.090
 show how to connect wiring from 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.230
 Ignition to a woman and not so here I am now in 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.380
 BM program 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.960
 I will point at to at these at 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.140
 screenshots and so here is the generator after all 421 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.960
 so I signed here the terminals of the coils 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.050
 ignition is for lighting uwata 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.230
 turn signals, etc. 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.640
 brake lights so here we see the ignition 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.969
 here's the cream for 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.260
 it turns out for it should go 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.309
 wiring right now I will show the reel there 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.820
 two types of reels 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.710
 b300 there are a few wedges true honestly 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.510
 saying still did not understand why they 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.450
 are needed 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:11.700
 but soon I'll figure it out and write it down 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:16.100
 as if the video review of the woman is not washing and 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:20.009
 who need it, my old equipment as it 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.920
 on request if subscribers need to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.970
 Well, I'll take off 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:30.090
 so here we have it here we have mass 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:34.490
 goes besides directly attached to 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:39.390
 motorcycle frame or some other 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.979
 equipment is shorter there is a picture 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.520
 or something like that 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:49.140
 bugs well in short it is to the mass completely to 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.040
 vehicle frame and here at 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.090
 us terminal z here it is the terminal which 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.270
 not the same 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.509
 I do not know the visa as I tried 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.759
 connect the ignition wire but it is not 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.619
 it works I do not know what it is 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:11.760
 cream and it turns out this is the first bobbin 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:16.739
 which will now show 2 2 with 1 terminal 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:21.150
 there you will not miss anymore means from the terminal 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:26.280

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.250
 reels in general and everything I can 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:36.180
