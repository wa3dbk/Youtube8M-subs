for this episode I read that the physics
engine<00:01:12.380> was<00:01:12.710> completely<00:01:13.190> different<00:01:13.610> but

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
engine was completely different but

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.840 
engine was completely different but

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680

just don't feel like an old silent game
like<00:01:30.950> I<00:01:31.190> was<00:01:31.400> told<00:01:31.670> they<00:01:31.850> were<00:01:31.909> going<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.450> so

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
like I was told they were going to so

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.170 
like I was told they were going to so
since<00:01:33.680> I<00:01:33.799> was<00:01:33.830> expecting<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.549> controls<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:35.060> be

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
since I was expecting the controls to be

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.330 
since I was expecting the controls to be
different<00:01:35.690> and<00:01:35.840> play<00:01:36.140> like<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:36.590> older<00:01:37.070> games

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
different and play like the older games

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.880 
different and play like the older games
I<00:01:37.640> was<00:01:38.119> a<00:01:38.180> little<00:01:38.479> disappointed<00:01:39.110> but<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:39.560> was

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
I was a little disappointed but I was

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.530 
I was a little disappointed but I was
able<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.190> get<00:01:40.400> used<00:01:40.549> to<00:01:40.640> these<00:01:40.790> controls<00:01:41.270> and

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
able to get used to these controls and

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.050 
able to get used to these controls and
my<00:01:42.200> favorite<00:01:42.470> part<00:01:42.680> of<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:42.950> game<00:01:42.979> has<00:01:43.549> to<00:01:43.880> be

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
my favorite part of the game has to be

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.750 
my favorite part of the game has to be
the<00:01:44.240> music<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:45.530> only<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:46.400> right<00:01:46.640> in

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
the music and that only is it right in

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.310 
the music and that only is it right in
line<00:01:46.909> with<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.210> quality<00:01:47.540> that<00:01:47.570> you'd<00:01:47.840> expect

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
line with the quality that you'd expect

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.920 
line with the quality that you'd expect
but<00:01:48.650> it<00:01:48.920> also<00:01:49.130> manages<00:01:49.549> to<00:01:50.060> still<00:01:50.390> give<00:01:50.720> a

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
but it also manages to still give a

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.020 
but it also manages to still give a
Genesis<00:01:51.590> type<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:52.040> feel<00:01:52.280> there's

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
Genesis type of a feel there's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.149 
Genesis type of a feel there's
definitely<00:01:53.510> some<00:01:53.750> notes<00:01:54.020> or<00:01:54.290> some<00:01:54.500> tones<00:01:54.799> that

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
definitely some notes or some tones that

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.440 
definitely some notes or some tones that
feel<00:01:55.340> like<00:01:55.430> they<00:01:55.580> came<00:01:55.760> straight<00:01:56.180> from<00:01:56.360> the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
feel like they came straight from the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.840

in<00:02:14.580> addition<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.900> traditional<00:02:16.500> gameplay

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
in addition to the traditional gameplay

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.710 
in addition to the traditional gameplay
mechanics<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:17.700> game<00:02:17.910> are<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.180> Sonic

and Tails can actually combine to make

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.660 
and Tails can actually combine to make
different<00:02:21.870> abilities<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.920> can<00:02:23.100> fly<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> bit

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
different abilities so you can fly a bit

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.880 
different abilities so you can fly a bit
have<00:02:24.330> kind<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.810> super<00:02:25.080> spin<00:02:25.320> attack<00:02:25.440> and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
have kind of a super spin attack and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.550 
have kind of a super spin attack and
also<00:02:25.980> swim<00:02:26.640> which<00:02:27.420> was<00:02:27.600> nice<00:02:27.750> because<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.200> hate

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
also swim which was nice because I hate

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.290 
also swim which was nice because I hate
the<00:02:28.740> water<00:02:28.950> levels<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.490> there's<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.700> lot<00:02:30.270> of

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
the water levels and there's a lot of

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.180 
the water levels and there's a lot of
water<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:31.290> one<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.650> sections<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:32.130> this

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
water in one of the sections in this

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.630 
water in one of the sections in this
game

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
game

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.140 
game
now<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.780> functions<00:02:34.620> work<00:02:35.400> well<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.060> don't

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
now the functions work well but I don't

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.820 
now the functions work well but I don't
think<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.570> they're<00:02:36.690> necessarily

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
think that they're necessarily

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.380 
think that they're necessarily
incorporated<00:02:37.830> all<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.100> well<00:02:38.280> too<00:02:39.090> often

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
incorporated all that well too often

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.000 
incorporated all that well too often
they<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.570> break<00:02:39.840> up<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.140> flow<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.740> level

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
they do break up the flow of the level

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.860 
they do break up the flow of the level
and<00:02:41.310> there's<00:02:41.790> probably<00:02:42.180> some<00:02:42.390> times<00:02:42.600> you're

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
and there's probably some times you're

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.660 
and there's probably some times you're
going<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.260> blame<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.620> mechanic<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:44.340> egg

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
going to blame this mechanic on egg

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.760 
going to blame this mechanic on egg
death<00:02:44.940> or<00:02:45.180> two<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.750> even<00:02:46.410> though<00:02:46.500> this<00:02:46.590> game

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
death or two and even though this game

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.310 
death or two and even though this game
does<00:02:47.070> have<00:02:47.340> some<00:02:47.610> cheap<00:02:47.880> deaths<00:02:48.240> there<00:02:49.110> are

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
does have some cheap deaths there are

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.200 
does have some cheap deaths there are
definitely<00:02:49.920> some<00:02:50.130> sections<00:02:50.580> where<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.000> game

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
definitely some sections where the game

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.150 
definitely some sections where the game
requires<00:02:51.660> just<00:02:52.260> skill<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.680> get<00:02:52.830> through<00:02:53.070> it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
requires just skill to get through it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.550 
requires just skill to get through it
and<00:02:53.430> when<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.030> finally<00:02:54.240> do<00:02:54.660> advance<00:02:54.990> it<00:02:55.260> feels

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
and when you finally do advance it feels

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.830 
and when you finally do advance it feels
really<00:02:55.980> satisfying<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.450> times<00:02:57.660> were

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
really satisfying and the times were

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.870 
really satisfying and the times were
they<00:02:57.990> nailed<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.830> type<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.490> balance

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
they nailed this type of a balance

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.700 
they nailed this type of a balance
really<00:03:00.210> do<00:03:00.480> give<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.840> an<00:03:00.930> old-school<00:03:01.200> Sonic
