Hey everyone, Jason here

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.559
today I'm going to show you this custom LEGO
model I've built of a hand playing a piano

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:15.549
It's currently being

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.060
operated by this nine volt motor

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.960
which I'll take off for now

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.369
when the motors isn't attached

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.390
it can be operated manually using the crank
on the side

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.860
so let's take a closer look at what's
going on here

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.990
we'll start with the hand

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.580
as you can see each finger

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.110
is attached to a LEGO technic beam

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.830
which is connected to a crank shaft that
runs through the base of the stand

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.360
and as you turn the crank

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.230
the fingers move up and down

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.870
next we'll take a look at the piano
section

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.950
which is quite reasonably scaled

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.450
and all the keys move up and down including the black ones

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.660
the action's actually reasonably accurate

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.880
especially considering it's all constructed out of LEGO eventually I may add

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.600
some sensors and electronics to produce sound

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.780
but at the moment it just makes
beautiful LEGO music

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.090
I have a little model here to show you how the keys work

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.230
there is a technic axle that runs through the back that all the white keys

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.830
pivot on

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.100
also one that all the black keys pivot on

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.430
each of the keys just rests on one of
these technic springs

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.549
and underneath each one is also a

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.590
LEGO rubber tire to provide some
dampening

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.040
and when you put it all together

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.880
it's actually quite simple

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.870
I guess that's about it

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.850
be sure to check out some of the other videos

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.020
on my channel

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.680
and if you'd like to see

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.970
photos of this model or all of the LEGO
models that I've made you can check out my

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.159
photo stream on flickr

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.009
you can also find instructions for many of
the models I've built on my website

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.489
and also be sure to check out

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.339
my marble maze project on LEGO CUUSOO

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.619
and support it if you like it

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:20.180
links to all of those can be found in the
description

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.619
thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed
it

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:23.090
see you next time
