 more energetic about playing along 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.530
 I always find the live acts much loud 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.510
 popping 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.460
 yes it is because of the interaction nature 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.070

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.700
 just sit differently as theo linssen 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.250

 guinea pig what we put together yes it actually is 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.640
 more a given of what is the most 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.680
 good troop sounds that attracts so 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.060

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.390

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.240

 also the we also never hurt ordinary 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.050
 with each other and that there is a theme 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.180
 devices that we have cleared 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.430

 chop the sole or I put you on water myself 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.550
 that it works together and turns it over 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.530

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.360
 from those themselves or who make a scarf 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.670
 intentionally sent to plates 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.030
 and add textual things to it 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:28.420
 and leave that man for three months 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.420
