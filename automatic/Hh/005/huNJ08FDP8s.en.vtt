00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
tanks to store it so as far as I know

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.020 
tanks to store it so as far as I know
there<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.379> no<00:01:01.770> set<00:01:02.039> schedule<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.640> when<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.879> is

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030

released<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.049> year-round<00:01:04.350> beer<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
released but it is year-round beer so I

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.480 
released but it is year-round beer so I
guess<00:01:07.110> they<00:01:07.320> make<00:01:07.500> enough<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.040> last<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.460> know

a<00:01:08.610> couple<00:01:08.700> months<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:09.540> they'll<00:01:09.659> make

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.940 
first port brewing i'm going to try i
was<00:01:54.180> blown<00:01:54.390> away<00:01:54.450> by<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.290> couldn't<00:01:55.799> even

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
was blown away by it I couldn't even

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.380 
was blown away by it I couldn't even
believe<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.310> was<00:01:56.490> ten<00:01:56.670> percent<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.270> that's

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
believe it was ten percent and that's

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.149 
believe it was ten percent and that's
one<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.110> big<00:01:58.229> characteristics<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.009> this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
one of the big characteristics of this

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.190 
one of the big characteristics of this
but<00:01:59.399> I'll<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.700> into<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.969> how<00:02:00.329> they<00:02:00.509> kind<00:02:01.140> of

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
but I'll get into that how they kind of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.190 
but I'll get into that how they kind of
do<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.500> with<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.829> one<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.850> was<00:02:03.180> brewed<00:02:03.719> for

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
do that with this one it was brewed for

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.859 
do that with this one it was brewed for
the<00:02:04.259> port<00:02:04.860> brewing<00:02:05.040> 15th<00:02:05.549> anniversary<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the port brewing 15th anniversary it

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.680 
the port brewing 15th anniversary it
uses<00:02:07.079> 15<00:02:07.860> different<00:02:08.369> varieties<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.000> hops<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
uses 15 different varieties of hops and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.470 
uses 15 different varieties of hops and
it's<00:02:10.379> hopped<00:02:10.800> during<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.459> boil<00:02:11.670> every<00:02:12.060> 15

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
it's hopped during a boil every 15

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.610 
it's hopped during a boil every 15
minutes

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
minutes

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.490 
minutes
so<00:02:14.620> you're<00:02:14.980> going<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.129> get<00:02:15.250> huge<00:02:15.760> hop<00:02:16.060> aroma<00:02:16.750> as

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
so you're going to get huge hop aroma as

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.559 
so you're going to get huge hop aroma as
well<00:02:17.799> as<00:02:18.040> hop<00:02:18.370> bitterness<00:02:18.609> because<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.420> the

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
well as hop bitterness because of the

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.319 
well as hop bitterness because of the
every<00:02:19.840> 15<00:02:20.230> minutes<00:02:20.640> basically<00:02:21.640> how<00:02:21.939> when

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
every 15 minutes basically how when

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.170 
every 15 minutes basically how when
beers<00:02:22.599> made<00:02:23.189> bittering<00:02:24.189> hops<00:02:24.219> are<00:02:24.609> added<00:02:24.640> in

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
beers made bittering hops are added in

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.670 
beers made bittering hops are added in
the<00:02:25.239> first<00:02:25.659> part<00:02:25.959> of<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.109> boil<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.590> then

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
the first part of the boil and then

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.220 
the first part of the boil and then
boiled<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.430> longest<00:02:27.879> the<00:02:28.000> longer<00:02:28.359> a<00:02:28.569> hop<00:02:28.989> is

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
boiled the longest the longer a hop is

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.319 
boiled the longest the longer a hop is
boiled<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.159> more<00:02:30.340> bitter<00:02:30.579> comes<00:02:30.969> out<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.269> the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
boiled the more bitter comes out of the

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.390 
boiled the more bitter comes out of the
actual<00:02:31.659> hop<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.170> shorter<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:32.620> boiled<00:02:32.889> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
actual hop the shorter it's boiled the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.520 
actual hop the shorter it's boiled the
more<00:02:33.609> aroma<00:02:33.909> and<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.239> more<00:02:34.420> actual<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.409> know

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
more aroma and the more actual you know

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.110 
more aroma and the more actual you know
taste<00:02:36.159> of<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.519> hop<00:02:36.670> you're<00:02:36.819> going<00:02:36.939> to<00:02:37.030> get

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
taste of the hop you're going to get

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.030 
taste of the hop you're going to get
rather<00:02:37.329> than<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.689> bitterness<00:02:38.019> from<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.439> so

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
rather than the bitterness from it so

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.069 
rather than the bitterness from it so
that's<00:02:39.219> what<00:02:39.340> they<00:02:39.430> do<00:02:39.689> kind<00:02:40.689> of<00:02:40.780> like<00:02:40.870> what

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
kind of a perfect example of how an IPA

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.420 
kind of a perfect example of how an IPA
can<00:06:18.960> actually<00:06:19.320> come<00:06:19.530> together<00:06:19.680> you<00:06:20.310> know

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
can actually come together you know

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.360 
can actually come together you know
really<00:06:20.700> high<00:06:21.030> ibus<00:06:21.660> it's<00:06:21.900> probably<00:06:22.320> I<00:06:22.620> don't

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
really high ibus it's probably I don't

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.400 
really high ibus it's probably I don't
you<00:06:23.700> know<00:06:23.729> all<00:06:23.910> the<00:06:24.030> top<00:06:24.210> of<00:06:24.270> my<00:06:24.360> head<00:06:24.419> I<00:06:24.900> don't

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
you know all the top of my head I don't

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.659 
you know all the top of my head I don't
know<00:06:25.590> but<00:06:25.770> it's<00:06:25.889> probably<00:06:26.070> close<00:06:26.370> to<00:06:26.400> a

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
know but it's probably close to a

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.290 
know but it's probably close to a
hundred<00:06:27.030> I<00:06:27.240> to<00:06:27.300> use<00:06:27.570> I<00:06:27.750> would<00:06:27.870> imagine<00:06:28.050> and<00:06:29.300> to

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
hundred I to use I would imagine and to

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.510 
hundred I to use I would imagine and to
get<00:06:30.450> something<00:06:30.840> like<00:06:30.960> 100<00:06:31.350> IV<00:06:31.620> use<00:06:31.860> and<00:06:32.220> manage

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
get something like 100 IV use and manage

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.279 
get something like 100 IV use and manage
to<00:06:32.760> make<00:06:32.880> it<00:06:32.910> you<00:06:33.180> know<00:06:33.210> not<00:06:33.539> overly<00:06:34.050> bitter

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
to make it you know not overly bitter

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.890 
to make it you know not overly bitter
and<00:06:34.530> overpowering<00:06:35.220> is<00:06:35.550> take<00:06:35.940> it<00:06:36.120> takes<00:06:36.570> a<00:06:36.660> fine

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
and overpowering is take it takes a fine

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.900 
and overpowering is take it takes a fine
hand<00:06:37.200> they<00:06:38.160> really<00:06:38.370> know<00:06:38.490> what<00:06:38.520> they're<00:06:38.669> doing

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
hand they really know what they're doing
