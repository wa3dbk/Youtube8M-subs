like I'm going to show you how to do it

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.980 
like I'm going to show you how to do it
on<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:01.469> flat<00:02:02.429> link<00:02:02.640> oval<00:02:03.000> cable<00:02:03.359> chain<00:02:03.600> here

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.240 

so<00:02:08.720> what<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.750> did<00:02:09.990> was<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.229> start<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
so what I did was just start with a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.190 
so what I did was just start with a
piece<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:13.760> faux<00:02:14.760> leather<00:02:14.790> cord<00:02:15.450> much

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
piece of the faux leather cord much

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.820 
piece of the faux leather cord much
longer<00:02:16.590> than<00:02:16.980> what<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.160> thought<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.400> would<00:02:17.610> need

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
longer than what I thought I would need

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.910 
longer than what I thought I would need
so<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.010> wouldn't<00:02:20.280> run<00:02:20.400> out<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:22.470> then

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
so that I wouldn't run out and then

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.640 
so that I wouldn't run out and then
determine<00:02:23.459> how<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.970> want<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.360> use<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.900> how

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
determine how you want to use it and how

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.710 
determine how you want to use it and how
long<00:02:25.890> your<00:02:26.580> pieces<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:26.970> chain<00:02:27.270> will<00:02:27.420> be<00:02:27.450> and

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
long your pieces of chain will be and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.449 
long your pieces of chain will be and
how<00:02:27.870> many<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.739> want<00:02:28.950> for<00:02:29.430> how<00:02:29.700> wide<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:31.459> then

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
how many you want for how wide and then

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.449 
how many you want for how wide and then
just<00:02:33.440> you're<00:02:34.440> going<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.709> start<00:02:35.100> by<00:02:35.160> going

on this one I went I had these long
pieces<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.570> chain<00:02:54.900> here<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:56.190> went<00:02:56.400> through

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
pieces of chain here and I went through

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.940 
pieces of chain here and I went through
one<00:02:57.120> where<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.660> wanted<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.260> be<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:58.739> one

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
one where I wanted it to be on this one

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.740 
one where I wanted it to be on this one
I<00:02:59.190> went<00:02:59.730> through<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.940> top<00:03:00.120> on<00:03:00.330> all<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.600> them

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
I went through the top on all of them

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.690 
I went through the top on all of them
except<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.260> did<00:03:01.440> have<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:02.760> couple<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.630> Link's

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
except I did have a couple of Link's

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.490 
except I did have a couple of Link's
extending<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.000> middle<00:03:06.300> piece<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:07.080> use<00:03:07.260> her

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
extending on the middle piece to use her

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.250 
extending on the middle piece to use her
to<00:03:07.530> connect<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:09.660> make<00:03:09.989> sure<00:03:10.230> that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
want to be when you start and pull it

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.360 
want to be when you start and pull it
down<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.780> end<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.709> want<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.890> leave<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.100> tail

down to the end you want to leave a tail

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.039 
down to the end you want to leave a tail
so<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:24.030> doesn't<00:03:24.299> fly<00:03:24.420> off<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.750> end<00:03:24.900> you

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.860 
leaving make sure that you grab the cord
and<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.950> pull<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.670> through<00:03:41.700> your<00:03:42.120> fingers<00:03:42.540> all

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
and you pull it through your fingers all

and you pull it through your fingers all
the<00:03:42.930> way<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.620> end<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.030> know<00:03:45.180> it's

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
the way to the end so that you know it's

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.750 
the way to the end so that you know it's
not<00:03:45.480> twisted<00:03:46.370> depending<00:03:47.370> on<00:03:47.459> how<00:03:47.549> much<00:03:47.700> room

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
not twisted depending on how much room

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.940 
not twisted depending on how much room
you<00:03:48.030> have<00:03:48.390> it's<00:03:48.810> twisted<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:49.500> might<00:03:49.650> have<00:03:49.829> to

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
you have it's twisted you might have to

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.759 
you have it's twisted you might have to
pull<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.250> out<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.670> put<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.030> back<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.329> again

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
pull it out and put it back in again

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.780 
pull it out and put it back in again
because<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.890> might<00:03:53.040> not<00:03:53.130> be<00:03:53.190> able<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.489> get<00:03:53.670> it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
because you might not be able to get it

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.930 
because you might not be able to get it
to<00:03:53.910> spin<00:03:54.390> around<00:03:54.510> very<00:03:54.900> well<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:56.280> now<00:03:56.549> the

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
to spin around very well and now the

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.759 
to spin around very well and now the
next<00:03:57.239> part<00:03:57.390> is<00:03:57.600> very<00:03:57.780> important<00:03:58.260> because<00:03:58.440> when

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
next part is very important because when

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.770 
next part is very important because when
you're<00:03:58.859> going<00:03:59.100> through<00:03:59.609> your<00:03:59.970> chain<00:04:00.420> links

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
you're going through your chain links

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.180 
you're going through your chain links
you<00:04:00.930> want<00:04:01.049> to<00:04:01.200> make<00:04:01.320> sure<00:04:01.500> that<00:04:01.680> you're<00:04:01.920> going

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
you want to make sure that you're going

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.410 
you want to make sure that you're going
through<00:04:02.220> them<00:04:02.549> all<00:04:02.730> in<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:02.970> same<00:04:03.120> direction

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
through them all in the same direction

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.099 
through them all in the same direction
so<00:04:03.810> they<00:04:04.650> will<00:04:04.799> stagger<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:06.180> know<00:04:06.269> 45<00:04:06.780> degrees

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
so they will stagger you know 45 degrees

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.599 
so they will stagger you know 45 degrees
point<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.560> left<00:04:07.680> pointed<00:04:08.070> right<00:04:08.220> pointed

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
point to the left pointed right pointed

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:09.920 
point to the left pointed right pointed
left<00:04:08.700> pointed<00:04:09.090> right<00:04:09.209> but<00:04:09.420> they<00:04:09.540> all<00:04:09.690> need<00:04:09.900> to

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
left pointed right but they all need to

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.259 
left pointed right but they all need to
go<00:04:10.260> in<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.890> same<00:04:11.040> direction<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.970> it's

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
go in the same direction it's it's

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.270 
go in the same direction it's it's
easier<00:04:12.630> to<00:04:12.750> see<00:04:12.930> on<00:04:13.049> this<00:04:13.200> one<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.980> way<00:04:14.100> that

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
easier to see on this one the way that

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.879 
easier to see on this one the way that
they<00:04:14.430> they'll<00:04:15.329> all<00:04:15.510> point<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:16.260> way<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.650> then

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
they they'll all point that way and then

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.380 
they they'll all point that way and then
they'll<00:04:17.040> all<00:04:17.160> point<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.609> way

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
they'll all point that way

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.890 
they'll all point that way
and<00:04:20.620> if<00:04:21.620> your<00:04:21.980> chain<00:04:22.850> has<00:04:23.060> more<00:04:23.330> room<00:04:23.600> you

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
and if your chain has more room you

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.690 
and if your chain has more room you
might<00:04:24.200> be<00:04:24.350> able<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.560> get<00:04:24.770> your<00:04:25.010> cord<00:04:25.460> through

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
might be able to get your cord through

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.910 
might be able to get your cord through
more<00:04:25.850> than<00:04:25.880> one<00:04:26.000> at<00:04:26.240> a<00:04:26.300> time<00:04:26.510> if<00:04:26.960> it's<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.680> little

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
more than one at a time if it's a little

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.660 
more than one at a time if it's a little
bit<00:04:28.040> more<00:04:28.220> snug<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.760> might<00:04:28.940> need<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.180> pull

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
bit more snug you might need to pull

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.420 
bit more snug you might need to pull
through<00:04:31.690> one<00:04:32.690> link<00:04:32.960> at<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.140> time<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:34.040> you<00:04:34.400> can

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
through one link at a time and you can

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.600 
through one link at a time and you can
pull<00:04:34.760> through<00:04:35.030> a<00:04:35.060> few<00:04:35.390> inches<00:04:35.540> and<00:04:36.340> then<00:04:37.340> keep

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
pull through a few inches and then keep

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.320 
pull through a few inches and then keep
working<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:40.220> just<00:04:40.280> make<00:04:40.640> sure<00:04:40.670> that<00:04:40.910> they're

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
working and just make sure that they're

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.540 
working and just make sure that they're
all<00:04:41.450> going<00:04:42.320> through<00:04:42.470> and<00:04:42.800> facing<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.370> same

all going through and facing the same

all going through and facing the same
way

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.530 

and<00:04:56.980> once<00:04:57.250> you<00:04:57.430> get<00:04:57.580> through<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.990> last<00:04:59.260> link

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
and once you get through the last link

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.770 
and once you get through the last link
go<00:05:01.540> ahead<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:01.810> grab<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.980> links<00:05:03.400> firmly<00:05:04.210> so

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
go ahead and grab the links firmly so

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.990 
go ahead and grab the links firmly so
that<00:05:04.830> they<00:05:05.830> stay<00:05:06.070> together<00:05:06.250> when<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.730> pull

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
that they stay together when you pull

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.810 
that they stay together when you pull
your<00:05:07.290> cord<00:05:08.290> through<00:05:12.390> and<00:05:13.390> you<00:05:13.660> can<00:05:14.700> pull<00:05:15.700> it

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
your cord through and you can pull it

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.540 
your cord through and you can pull it
really<00:05:15.970> tight<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:17.350> condense<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:18.040> links<00:05:18.340> down

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
really tight to condense the links down

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.940 
really tight to condense the links down
they'll<00:05:19.000> lay<00:05:19.210> flat<00:05:19.600> and<00:05:19.900> so<00:05:20.320> they'll<00:05:20.560> condense

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
they'll lay flat and so they'll condense

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.070 
they'll lay flat and so they'll condense
really<00:05:21.250> close<00:05:21.460> together<00:05:21.720> like<00:05:22.720> I<00:05:22.810> did<00:05:22.960> with

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
really close together like I did with

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.900 
really close together like I did with
these<00:05:23.260> with<00:05:23.710> this<00:05:23.860> one<00:05:24.100> I<00:05:24.310> did<00:05:24.490> leave<00:05:24.670> a<00:05:24.700> little

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
these with this one I did leave a little

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.000 
these with this one I did leave a little
bit<00:05:25.090> of<00:05:25.210> room<00:05:25.360> so<00:05:25.390> that<00:05:25.690> it<00:05:25.720> wasn't<00:05:26.470> totally

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
bit of room so that it wasn't totally

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.400 
bit of room so that it wasn't totally
squished<00:05:27.970> in<00:05:28.210> as<00:05:28.360> low<00:05:28.540> as<00:05:28.690> as<00:05:28.900> small<00:05:29.200> as<00:05:29.320> it

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
squished in as low as as small as it

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.250 
squished in as low as as small as it
could<00:05:29.590> be<00:05:29.790> so<00:05:30.790> you<00:05:30.850> can<00:05:31.300> decide<00:05:31.630> that<00:05:31.660> too<00:05:32.080> on

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
could be so you can decide that too on

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.150 
could be so you can decide that too on
how<00:05:33.390> close<00:05:34.390> you<00:05:34.630> want<00:05:34.780> your<00:05:35.020> chains<00:05:35.470> to<00:05:35.800> lay

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
how close you want your chains to lay

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.580 
how close you want your chains to lay
together<00:05:36.340> and<00:05:37.090> then<00:05:38.050> you're<00:05:38.200> going<00:05:38.320> to<00:05:38.380> just

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
together and then you're going to just

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.970 
together and then you're going to just
flip<00:05:38.860> it<00:05:38.950> over<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:40.360> go<00:05:41.290> back<00:05:41.320> through<00:05:41.860> the

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
flip it over and go back through the

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:49.230 
flip it over and go back through the
other<00:05:42.100> way<00:05:45.060> you<00:05:46.060> can<00:05:46.210> see<00:05:46.390> that<00:05:46.920> this<00:05:47.920> time<00:05:48.240> the

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
other way you can see that this time the

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.080 
other way you can see that this time the
links<00:05:49.840> are<00:05:49.960> laying<00:05:50.200> the<00:05:50.530> other<00:05:50.650> way<00:05:50.770> them<00:05:51.090> this

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
links are laying the other way them this

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.250 
links are laying the other way them this
one<00:05:52.270> they're<00:05:52.420> going<00:05:52.540> to<00:05:52.630> the<00:05:52.810> left<00:05:52.990> on<00:05:53.170> this

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
one they're going to the left on this

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.560 
one they're going to the left on this
one<00:05:53.440> they're<00:05:53.560> going<00:05:53.650> to<00:05:53.710> go<00:05:53.830> to<00:05:53.890> the<00:05:54.040> right<00:05:54.570> and

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
one they're going to go to the right and

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:09.659 
one they're going to go to the right and
again<00:05:55.960> you'll<00:05:56.140> just<00:05:56.320> go<00:05:57.930> all<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:58.990> way<00:05:59.200> through

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.089 

and<00:06:10.479> make<00:06:10.719> sure<00:06:10.930> as<00:06:11.050> you're<00:06:11.229> going<00:06:11.710> through

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
and make sure as you're going through

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.980 
and make sure as you're going through
your<00:06:12.129> links<00:06:12.580> that<00:06:12.729> you<00:06:12.879> pull<00:06:13.419> the<00:06:13.539> rest<00:06:13.689> of<00:06:13.900> the

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
your links that you pull the rest of the

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.040 
your links that you pull the rest of the
chain<00:06:14.229> down<00:06:14.439> so<00:06:14.740> that<00:06:14.919> the<00:06:15.849> next<00:06:16.090> link<00:06:16.389> sits

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
chain down so that the next link sits

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.989 
chain down so that the next link sits
below<00:06:18.389> your<00:06:19.389> cord<00:06:19.689> there<00:06:20.520> that<00:06:21.520> will<00:06:21.669> help<00:06:21.789> it

00:06:21.989 --> 00:06:21.999 
below your cord there that will help it

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:30.629 
below your cord there that will help it
lay<00:06:22.120> flat<00:06:22.150> when<00:06:22.449> it's<00:06:22.810> all<00:06:22.960> done<00:06:29.219> and<00:06:30.219> on<00:06:30.430> this

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
lay flat when it's all done and on this

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.749 
lay flat when it's all done and on this
kind<00:06:31.150> of<00:06:31.330> chain<00:06:31.629> where<00:06:32.169> your<00:06:32.319> holes<00:06:32.590> are<00:06:32.919> oval

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
kind of chain where your holes are oval

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:38.070 
kind of chain where your holes are oval
I<00:06:33.969> have<00:06:34.779> the<00:06:35.050> cord<00:06:35.560> laying<00:06:36.270> flat<00:06:37.270> along<00:06:37.930> the

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
I have the cord laying flat along the

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.200 
I have the cord laying flat along the
length<00:06:38.590> of<00:06:38.740> the<00:06:38.830> chain<00:06:39.069> you<00:06:39.699> can<00:06:39.819> also<00:06:39.969> see

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
length of the chain you can also see

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.779 
length of the chain you can also see
that<00:06:40.360> on<00:06:40.479> the<00:06:40.569> roller<00:06:40.779> chain<00:06:41.110> where<00:06:41.949> the<00:06:42.279> links

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:42.789 
that on the roller chain where the links

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.709 
that on the roller chain where the links
are<00:06:42.909> round<00:06:43.180> and<00:06:43.539> there<00:06:44.229> is<00:06:44.439> less<00:06:44.680> room<00:06:45.719> along

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:46.719 
are round and there is less room along

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:50.129 
are round and there is less room along
the<00:06:46.930> length<00:06:47.139> I<00:06:47.409> have<00:06:47.889> the<00:06:48.180> suede<00:06:49.180> going

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139 
the length I have the suede going

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.249 
the length I have the suede going
through<00:06:50.699> vertically<00:06:51.699> through<00:06:52.029> that<00:06:52.180> hole<00:06:52.389> so

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:53.259 
through vertically through that hole so

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:54.450 
through vertically through that hole so
it<00:06:53.349> gives<00:06:53.529> it<00:06:53.650> a<00:06:53.680> different<00:06:53.860> look<00:06:54.039> that<00:06:54.310> way

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
it gives it a different look that way

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.909 
it gives it a different look that way
too

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
too

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.879 
too
all<00:06:56.919> right<00:06:57.389> so<00:06:58.389> you<00:06:58.479> can<00:06:58.659> see<00:06:58.870> you're<00:06:59.620> starting

00:06:59.879 --> 00:06:59.889 
all right so you can see you're starting

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.230 
all right so you can see you're starting
to<00:07:00.159> get<00:07:00.310> that<00:07:00.939> woven<00:07:02.460> look<00:07:03.460> and<00:07:03.759> all<00:07:03.969> you<00:07:04.120> would

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
to get that woven look and all you would

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.629 
to get that woven look and all you would
do<00:07:04.389> is<00:07:04.599> keep<00:07:05.110> flipping<00:07:05.500> it<00:07:05.589> over<00:07:05.680> and<00:07:05.860> working

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 
do is keep flipping it over and working

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.730 
do is keep flipping it over and working
it<00:07:06.729> back<00:07:06.909> and<00:07:06.939> forth<00:07:07.300> through<00:07:08.199> the<00:07:08.259> links<00:07:08.650> in

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740 
it back and forth through the links in

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.249 
it back and forth through the links in
your<00:07:08.889> chain<00:07:09.069> and<00:07:09.330> then<00:07:10.330> all<00:07:10.479> I<00:07:10.509> did<00:07:10.810> to<00:07:10.960> finish

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:11.259 
your chain and then all I did to finish

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:12.959 
your chain and then all I did to finish
this<00:07:11.439> off<00:07:11.650> was<00:07:11.919> I<00:07:11.949> flipped<00:07:12.400> it<00:07:12.550> to<00:07:12.580> the<00:07:12.789> back

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:12.969 
this off was I flipped it to the back

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:18.529 
this off was I flipped it to the back
and<00:07:13.680> I<00:07:14.680> am<00:07:14.919> I<00:07:15.270> skipped<00:07:16.270> the<00:07:16.449> first<00:07:16.659> link<00:07:16.900> and<00:07:17.199> I

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 
and I am I skipped the first link and I

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:24.719 
and I am I skipped the first link and I
took<00:07:19.539> my<00:07:19.779> cord<00:07:20.050> through<00:07:20.289> the<00:07:20.379> next<00:07:20.680> link<00:07:23.490> and<00:07:24.490> I

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:24.729 
took my cord through the next link and I

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:26.790 
took my cord through the next link and I
pulled<00:07:25.000> it<00:07:25.149> down<00:07:25.180> and<00:07:25.719> added<00:07:26.259> just<00:07:26.439> a<00:07:26.560> dab<00:07:26.770> of

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 
pulled it down and added just a dab of

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.490 
pulled it down and added just a dab of
e6000<00:07:27.759> glue<00:07:27.789> here<00:07:28.180> and<00:07:28.389> tightened<00:07:29.139> it<00:07:29.289> and

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:29.500 
e6000 glue here and tightened it and

e6000 glue here and tightened it and
then<00:07:29.979> I<00:07:30.009> did<00:07:30.219> a<00:07:30.250> couple<00:07:30.460> more<00:07:30.699> lengths<00:07:31.120> in<00:07:31.330> the

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:31.539 
then I did a couple more lengths in the

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:34.019 
then I did a couple more lengths in the
same<00:07:31.779> way<00:07:32.020> so<00:07:32.919> you<00:07:33.009> can<00:07:33.189> see<00:07:33.370> that<00:07:33.550> it<00:07:33.789> does

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:34.029 
same way so you can see that it does

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:37.110 
same way so you can see that it does
double<00:07:34.419> back<00:07:34.599> about<00:07:35.139> half<00:07:35.349> way<00:07:35.589> and<00:07:36.120> it's

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 
double back about half way and it's

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.579 
double back about half way and it's
glued<00:07:37.389> down<00:07:37.599> nice<00:07:37.810> and<00:07:37.839> tight<00:07:38.050> and<00:07:38.319> it's<00:07:38.439> not

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:38.589 
glued down nice and tight and it's not

00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:43.619 
glued down nice and tight and it's not
going<00:07:38.860> anywhere<00:07:40.500> and<00:07:41.500> you<00:07:41.649> can<00:07:42.060> use<00:07:43.060> these

00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:43.629 
going anywhere and you can use these

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:47.309 
going anywhere and you can use these
woven<00:07:43.990> pieces<00:07:44.469> for<00:07:46.080> anything<00:07:47.080> you<00:07:47.169> can

00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:47.319 
woven pieces for anything you can

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:50.459 
woven pieces for anything you can
imagine<00:07:47.560> it's<00:07:48.399> very<00:07:48.460> versatile<00:07:49.120> and<00:07:50.110> that's

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:50.469 
imagine it's very versatile and that's

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:59.330 
imagine it's very versatile and that's
how<00:07:50.620> you<00:07:50.680> do<00:07:50.830> it
