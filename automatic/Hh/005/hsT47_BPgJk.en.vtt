00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.899
 eternity can be a curse 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.190
 with everything you have suffered 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.000

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.590
 its reason for being 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.399

 logan wanted to return the favor 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.010
 compensate you for the life that I 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.010
 you went back 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.040

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.200

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.520
 my past 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.610
