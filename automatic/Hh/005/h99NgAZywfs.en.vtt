00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
what kind of guys it's not a player and

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.940 
what kind of guys it's not a player and
today<00:00:09.660> I'm<00:00:09.870> gonna<00:00:09.990> show<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.260> how<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.530> destroy

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
today I'm gonna show you how to destroy

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.549 
today I'm gonna show you how to destroy
the<00:00:11.099> Trinity<00:00:11.490> rocket<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.179> gory<00:00:12.750> ghost<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.259> is

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
the Trinity rocket in gory ghost this is

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.609 
the Trinity rocket in gory ghost this is
a<00:00:13.830> seven<00:00:14.370> kill<00:00:14.670> streak<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.480> allows<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.470> to

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
a seven kill streak that allows you to

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.890 
a seven kill streak that allows you to
shoot<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.400> pre<00:00:17.789> rockets<00:00:18.210> out<00:00:18.420> before<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
shoot to pre rockets out before the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.630 
shoot to pre rockets out before the
missile<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.470> then<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.949> shoot<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> actual

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
missile and then you shoot the actual

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.970 
missile and then you shoot the actual
proper<00:00:21.060> missile<00:00:21.420> down<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.930> essentially<00:00:22.800> get

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
proper missile down and essentially get

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.560 
proper missile down and essentially get
three<00:00:23.279> rockets<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.029> thing<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.300> it

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
three rockets out of this thing and it

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.450 
three rockets out of this thing and it
can<00:00:24.779> be<00:00:24.990> very<00:00:25.289> very<00:00:25.680> dangerous<00:00:25.980> at<00:00:26.430> times

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
can be very very dangerous at times

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.220 
can be very very dangerous at times
sometimes<00:00:27.420> they<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.689> be<00:00:27.779> weak<00:00:27.990> but

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
sometimes they can be weak but

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.990 
sometimes they can be weak but
nonetheless<00:00:28.439> three<00:00:28.980> missiles<00:00:29.369> coming<00:00:29.640> after

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
nonetheless three missiles coming after

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.049 
nonetheless three missiles coming after
you<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> pretty<00:00:31.289> easy<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.309> die<00:00:32.520> by<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
you can be a pretty easy to die by and

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.970 
you can be a pretty easy to die by and
I'm<00:00:33.480> gonna<00:00:33.600> show<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.809> how<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> avoid<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.860> or

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
I'm gonna show you how to avoid it or

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.220 
I'm gonna show you how to avoid it or
destroy<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.550> or<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.940> survive<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.840> actual

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
destroy it or I survive the actual

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.619 
destroy it or I survive the actual
Trinity<00:00:37.680> rocket<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.640> I've<00:00:38.730> gone<00:00:38.879> into<00:00:39.030> private

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
Trinity rocket so I've gone into private

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
Trinity rocket so I've gone into private
match<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.050> I've<00:00:40.170> tested<00:00:40.649> out<00:00:40.770> every<00:00:41.520> single

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
match and I've tested out every single

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.700 
match and I've tested out every single
possibility<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.809> how<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> destroy<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.649> thing

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
possibility of how to destroy this thing

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.250 
possibility of how to destroy this thing
or<00:00:44.100> avoid<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.700> unlike<00:00:45.570> black<00:00:45.809> ops<00:00:46.020> 2<00:00:46.230> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
or avoid it unlike black ops 2 you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.650 
or avoid it unlike black ops 2 you
cannot<00:00:46.680> shoot<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.399> won't<00:00:47.550> work<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.090> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
cannot shoot it that won't work and you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.110 
cannot shoot it that won't work and you
can't<00:00:49.050> EMP<00:00:49.620> grenade<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.090> use

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
can't EMP grenade it but you can use

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
can't EMP grenade it but you can use
trophy<00:00:51.870> systems<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.680> really<00:00:53.070> cool<00:00:53.340> now

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
trophy systems which is really cool now

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.920 
trophy systems which is really cool now
this<00:00:53.460> first<00:00:53.820> hit<00:00:54.149> we're<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.660> kind<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
this first hit we're just kind of a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
this first hit we're just kind of a
mediocre<00:00:55.620> way<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.949> defending<00:00:56.610> yourself<00:00:56.820> from

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
mediocre way of defending yourself from

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.729 
mediocre way of defending yourself from
it<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> best<00:00:58.050> tip<00:00:58.320> which<00:00:58.469> I'm<00:00:58.590> gonna

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it it's not the best tip which I'm gonna

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.160 
it it's not the best tip which I'm gonna
get<00:00:58.949> onto<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.850> second<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.809> use<00:01:00.840> two

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
get onto in a second you can use two

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.080 
get onto in a second you can use two
trophy<00:01:01.590> systems<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.550> need<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.969> use

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
trophy systems now you do need to use

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.329 
trophy systems now you do need to use
two<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.199> serious<00:01:04.860> guy<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
two if you have a serious guy with a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.980 
two if you have a serious guy with a
vendetta<00:01:05.760> after<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.450> wants<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> shoot

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
vendetta after you that wants to shoot

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050 
vendetta after you that wants to shoot
all<00:01:07.229> three<00:01:07.260> missiles<00:01:08.070> after<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.939> only

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
all three missiles after you and only

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.170 
all three missiles after you and only
you<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.200> could<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.920> use<00:01:11.670> two

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
you then what you could do is use two

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.149 
you then what you could do is use two
trophy<00:01:12.600> system<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:13.170> each<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.979> block

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
trophy system because each one can block

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
trophy system because each one can block
two<00:01:14.460> projectiles<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.299> obviously<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
two projectiles and obviously the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.590 
two projectiles and obviously the
Trinity<00:01:16.710> rocket<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.220> three<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.180> where<00:01:18.360> that'll

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
Trinity rocket is three so where that'll

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.050 
Trinity rocket is three so where that'll
make<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.259> perfectly<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.790> left

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
make it perfectly so you have one left

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.469 
make it perfectly so you have one left
over

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
over

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.899 
over
and<00:01:21.630> also<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.470> glitch<00:01:22.740> way<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.979> could<00:01:23.369> use

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and also the glitch way you could use

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
and also the glitch way you could use
the<00:01:24.420> trophy<00:01:24.659> system<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.170> block<00:01:25.500> one

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
the trophy system to block one

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.350 
the trophy system to block one
projectile<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:26.700> pick<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.270> then

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
projectile and then pick up and then

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.210 
projectile and then pick up and then
plant<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.659> down<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.320> replenish<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> doesn't

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
plant it down so replenish it doesn't

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.399 
plant it down so replenish it doesn't
work<00:01:29.400> anymore<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.030> once<00:01:30.540> once<00:01:30.780> gone<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.290> gone

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
work anymore so once once gone it's gone

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.859 
work anymore so once once gone it's gone
and<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.640> use<00:01:32.790> two<00:01:33.000> trophy<00:01:33.299> systems<00:01:33.659> if

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and so you can use two trophy systems if

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.840 
and so you can use two trophy systems if
you<00:01:33.900> would<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.430> use<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
you would like but you have to use the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.270 
you would like but you have to use the
perks<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.540> get<00:01:36.689> extra<00:01:37.200> tactical<00:01:37.680> grenades<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
perks to get extra tactical grenades and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.490 
perks to get extra tactical grenades and
this<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.180> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.509> waste<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.930> attachments

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
this is kind of a waste of attachments

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.719 
this is kind of a waste of attachments
and<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.979> run<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> two<00:01:41.430> trophy

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and you have to run the two trophy

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.880 
and you have to run the two trophy
system<00:01:41.880> themself<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.869> kind<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.409> very<00:01:43.649> long

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
system themself it's kind of a very long

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.499 
system themself it's kind of a very long
process<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.340> take<00:01:44.610> them<00:01:44.820> both<00:01:44.970> out<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
process to take them both out so this

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.990 
process to take them both out so this
isn't<00:01:45.899> really<00:01:46.079> recommended<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.369> at<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> very

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
isn't really recommended but at the very

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.850 
isn't really recommended but at the very
very<00:01:48.090> good<00:01:48.689> tip<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.140> would<00:01:49.200> recommend<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
very good tip I would recommend to you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.200 
very good tip I would recommend to you
that<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.040> lot<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.280> people<00:01:50.490> don't<00:01:50.610> actually<00:01:50.790> know

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that a lot of people don't actually know

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.020 
that a lot of people don't actually know
is<00:01:51.420> possible<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.619> night<00:01:53.009> out<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.520> thing<00:01:53.759> is

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
is possible is a night out this thing is

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.999 
is possible is a night out this thing is
absolutely<00:01:54.600> amazing<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.740> think<00:01:55.890> that's

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
absolutely amazing I think that's

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.039 
absolutely amazing I think that's
probably<00:01:56.189> one<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.820> most<00:01:57.180> underrated

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
probably one of the most underrated

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.770 
probably one of the most underrated
things<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.490> use<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.119> cod<00:02:00.360> ghosts'

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
things that you can use in cod ghosts'

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.200 
things that you can use in cod ghosts'
and<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.229> absolutely<00:02:01.439> love<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:03.090> the

and I absolutely love it so what the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.030 
and I absolutely love it so what the
night<00:02:03.360> out<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.079> didn't<00:02:04.320> know<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
night out is if you didn't know is a

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.639 
night out is if you didn't know is a
support<00:02:05.640> streak<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.570> blocks<00:02:06.840> projectiles

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
support streak and it blocks projectiles

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.529 
support streak and it blocks projectiles
coming<00:02:08.129> at<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.520> at<00:02:08.670> basically<00:02:08.940> follows<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
coming at you at basically follows you

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.809 
coming at you at basically follows you
around<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.679> also<00:02:10.890> provides<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.489> little<00:02:11.700> bit

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
around and it also provides a little bit

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.790 
around and it also provides a little bit
of<00:02:11.910> radar<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:12.599> what<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.110> can<00:02:13.319> do

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
of radar but what you can do

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.010 
of radar but what you can do
is<00:02:13.890> use<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.760> block<00:02:15.120> them<00:02:15.360> because<00:02:15.720> unlike

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
is use this to block them because unlike

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.900 
is use this to block them because unlike
the<00:02:16.140> trophy<00:02:16.380> systems<00:02:16.770> which<00:02:16.950> are<00:02:17.100> limited<00:02:17.280> the

unlimited projectiles can be blocked by
and<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.110> absolutely<00:02:31.530> amazing<00:02:31.770> meaning<00:02:32.430> you

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
and it's absolutely amazing meaning you

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.670 
and it's absolutely amazing meaning you
basically<00:02:33.180> have<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:33.630> orb<00:02:33.990> this<00:02:34.290> bubble

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
basically have this orb this bubble

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.380 
basically have this orb this bubble
following<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.220> around<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:36.000> makes<00:02:36.240> you

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
following you around that makes you

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.630 
following you around that makes you
completely<00:02:36.900> impervious<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.650> any<00:02:38.070> kind<00:02:38.490> of

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
completely impervious to any kind of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.370 
completely impervious to any kind of
Trinity<00:02:39.030> rocket<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:40.080> does<00:02:40.230> matter

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
Trinity rocket and it does matter

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.050 
Trinity rocket and it does matter
harming<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.860> fire<00:02:41.070> at<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.580> will<00:02:41.850> block

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
harming the fire at you it will block

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.300 
harming the fire at you it will block
all<00:02:42.300> three<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:42.990> is<00:02:43.170> absolutely<00:02:43.860> amazing

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
all three and this is absolutely amazing

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.150 
all three and this is absolutely amazing
this<00:02:44.760> streak<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.240> seriously<00:02:45.960> underrated<00:02:46.590> and

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
this streak is seriously underrated and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.100 
this streak is seriously underrated and
you<00:02:47.610> can<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:47.910> use<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.600> basically<00:02:48.780> walk

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
you can just use it to basically walk

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.260 
you can just use it to basically walk
around<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.650> be<00:02:49.740> invincible<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.760> Eternity

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
around and be invincible to Eternity

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.850 
around and be invincible to Eternity
rockets<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.750> guess<00:02:51.990> if<00:02:52.260> there's<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.740> hit

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
rockets I guess if there's a hit

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.830 
rockets I guess if there's a hit
building<00:02:53.280> next<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.760> or<00:02:53.970> hit<00:02:54.270> somewhere

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
building next to you or hit somewhere

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.600 
building next to you or hit somewhere
around<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.530> maybe<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.950> explosion<00:02:56.460> would

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
around you maybe the explosion would

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.360 
around you maybe the explosion would
destroy<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.480> night<00:02:57.840> owl<00:02:58.080> or<00:02:58.260> maybe<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.920> but

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
destroy the night owl or maybe you but

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.310 
destroy the night owl or maybe you but
there<00:02:59.610> normally<00:03:00.060> if<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:00.450> find<00:03:00.720> yourself<00:03:01.170> as

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
there normally if you find yourself as

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.350 
there normally if you find yourself as
one<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.830> these<00:03:01.950> Trinity<00:03:02.460> rocket<00:03:02.760> magnets<00:03:03.240> that

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
one of these Trinity rocket magnets that

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.570 
one of these Trinity rocket magnets that
they<00:03:03.540> always<00:03:03.870> go<00:03:04.110> for<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.470> then<00:03:04.860> maybe<00:03:05.160> you

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
they always go for you then maybe you

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.280 
they always go for you then maybe you
will<00:03:05.730> want<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.000> run<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.480> night<00:03:06.720> out<00:03:06.960> in<00:03:07.170> the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
will want to run the night out in the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.840 
will want to run the night out in the
support<00:03:07.680> streak<00:03:07.980> it's<00:03:08.130> reads<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.700> get

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
support streak it's reads to get

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.310 
support streak it's reads to get
obviously<00:03:09.210> with<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.420> support<00:03:09.750> streets<00:03:10.020> you

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
obviously with the support streets you

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.530 
obviously with the support streets you
can<00:03:10.350> die<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.950> still<00:03:11.190> get<00:03:11.430> them<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.850> then

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
can die and you still get them and then

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.120 
can die and you still get them and then
once<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.840> get<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:13.380> call<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.770> in<00:03:13.920> and

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
once you get it you can call it in and

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.250 
once you get it you can call it in and
there<00:03:14.640> you'll<00:03:14.760> be<00:03:14.820> invincible<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.810> any<00:03:15.840> kind

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
there you'll be invincible to any kind

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.500 
there you'll be invincible to any kind
of<00:03:16.350> explosives<00:03:17.070> flashbangs<00:03:17.820> anything<00:03:18.330> people
