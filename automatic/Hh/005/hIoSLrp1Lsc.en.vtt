00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.359
 I'm playing it and one as you can see 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.359
 we already have a lot of chests with 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.009
 wood a lot of things after there is 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.770

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.840
 enemies there is the other the herd that 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.609

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.210
 we have to grasp is the iron 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:43.519
 medium well if we continue we're going to 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.059
 be able to make a bridge and let's cross to 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.490
 the other part well I disconnected very 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.980
 all right 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.320

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.130
 stable but it does not matter capture from the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.920
 capture the world for minecraft pib es 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.990
 something very strange I know, I do not say no 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.300
 because it's very strange but if you 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.309

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.720

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.290

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.290
 the chests here 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.500
 there it is if we are going to discover here we are going 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.420
 to find a lot of things like 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.670
 example culminating with a very collection 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.550
 unstable wood we will have make 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.560
 later I think that I saw something else here 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.030
 There is a lot of wood but there was something else 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.240
 here and good what they call of that 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.340
 then they can be broken if before 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.840
 empty this to expose ticos swords 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.320
 but it fits another thing in our chests 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.020
