00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.720 
adapter and this I believe is what I
plug<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.709> can<00:02:50.920> charge<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.459> while<00:02:51.580> I'm

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
plug it in so I can charge it while I'm

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:03.920 
plug it in so I can charge it while I'm
recording<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:53.049> this<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.380> really<00:02:53.560> cool<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:02.310> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
recording so this is really cool is the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.430 
recording so this is really cool is the
HDMI<00:03:04.930> cable

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
HDMI cable

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.509 
HDMI cable
awesome<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:07.570> then<00:03:07.950> here<00:03:08.950> we<00:03:09.130> have<00:03:09.160> the

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
awesome and then here we have the

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:29.709 
awesome and then here we have the
battery

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:29.719 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:35.209 

and<00:03:31.879> okay<00:03:32.879> so<00:03:33.150> we'll<00:03:34.140> just<00:03:34.349> quickly<00:03:34.590> look<00:03:35.040> at

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:35.219 
and okay so we'll just quickly look at

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.709 
and okay so we'll just quickly look at
it<00:03:35.400> obviously<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.939> just<00:03:36.120> came<00:03:36.239> out<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.540> box

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:36.719 
it obviously I just came out of the box

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:40.309 
it obviously I just came out of the box
where's<00:03:37.049> my<00:03:37.200> charger<00:03:37.439> okay<00:03:38.390> but<00:03:39.390> there<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.170> is

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
where's my charger okay but there it is

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.349 
where's my charger okay but there it is
very<00:03:42.859> kind<00:03:43.859> of<00:03:44.010> plasticky<00:03:44.670> feeling<00:03:45.120> but<00:03:45.329> I

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
very kind of plasticky feeling but I

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.879 
very kind of plasticky feeling but I
think<00:03:45.659> that's<00:03:45.840> all<00:03:46.019> these<00:03:46.200> aren't<00:03:46.469> because

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
think that's all these aren't because

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.330 
think that's all these aren't because
that's<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.219> way<00:03:47.310> they<00:03:47.430> keep<00:03:47.609> them<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:47.969> light

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
that's the way they keep them so light

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.270 
that's the way they keep them so light
just<00:03:50.340> see<00:03:50.519> here<00:03:51.439> wherever<00:03:52.439> out<00:03:52.680> recording

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
just see here wherever out recording

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.000 
just see here wherever out recording
which<00:03:53.549> we<00:03:53.849> probably<00:03:54.090> will<00:03:54.450> be<00:03:54.739> how<00:03:55.739> can<00:03:55.920> you

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
which we probably will be how can you

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.309 
which we probably will be how can you
not<00:03:56.129> want<00:03:56.189> to<00:03:56.400> go<00:03:56.489> outdoors<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:57.150> record<00:03:57.569> but

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
not want to go outdoors to record but

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.300 
not want to go outdoors to record but
this<00:03:58.500> will<00:03:58.650> be<00:03:58.739> fantastic<00:03:58.920> for<00:04:01.040> recording<00:04:02.040> my

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
this will be fantastic for recording my

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.020 
this will be fantastic for recording my
