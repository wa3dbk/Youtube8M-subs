00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 soy before the next analysis 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.180
 World Cup qualifier return match in the group 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.050
 c 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.200
 nuremberg in nürnberg vision casa 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.269
 Celtic Germany and Kazakhstan 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.680
 and yes we have something natural of course 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.500
 analysis already made before the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.490
 Hinspiel was played in Kazakhstan 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.730
 yes probably then probably in 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.910
 Astana is being played in the capital 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.519
 I go from very strong and 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.630
 so yes ding well and that it is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.910
 the first comparison 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.910
 which does not give the balance 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.750
 I go out of Germany 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.379
 research will win and secondly yes 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.360
 as I said Germany so currently 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.780
 you can look for a bit of a striker 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.670
 say 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.350
 it does not seem like the ruins for that 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.309
 for jogi löw the right addressee 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.129
 to give in front 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.800
 kießling is too big for him gomez yes man 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.170
 know with the well-known problems that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.510
 nominated yes it was nominated but if he 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.979
 then maybe I'll think too 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.060
 plays reus in the storm or idiot is then 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.820
 but probably already 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.460
 if he plays spanish system play 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.840
 will then also is indeed is 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.790
 just the wrong player in it 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.869
 but then actually kissing would be 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.140
 not too bad for the system 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.700
 with kissing also it is not synonymous 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.020
 Not that filigree is on the ball though 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.369
 he has also been through his already 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.430
 many templates in season quite 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.430
 showed that he has strengths there and 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.880
 we have to see that, too 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.990
 beautiful and lion may be playing there 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.700
 then yes again completely 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.200
 by chance, some people still get sick like that 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.020
 now yes already several times the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.590
 case was 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.979
 Bundesliga is playing there you are 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.280
 strangely enough, everyone's fit again 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.189
 often times he is in principle he 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.130
 incorrect players as I said 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.520
 Germany so far everything won 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.630
 except for the draw 44 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.829
 you probably remember 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.829
 against sweden 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.670
 and yes always been victorious 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.720
 where you have to say so that 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.980
 6 1 against ireland was of course very 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.470
 outstanding but now 2 1 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.840
 victory in austria in september 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.930
 was already very happy 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.430
 arnautovic still in front of the empty gate 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:42.230
 because there is a great chance to compensate 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.230
 let's have it right and that's why 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.790
 and from whom can one still emphasize at 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.840
 the kasachen of course the two 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.720
 german heinrich heinrich schmidtgal 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.870
 tribesman even at greuther forth 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:03.090
 under free-kick and of course 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.939
 cocker angel of energy cottbus second 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:13.280
 league but still clearly with 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:19.849
 distance so fast still with distance 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:22.169
 the most expensive players a squad 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.810
 otherwise they are mostly players 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.129
 I believe in astana and actors 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.299
 So the two biggest clubs in 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:37.639
 Kazakhstan and keep performance at 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:41.400
 Germany currently 79 at Kazakhstan 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:48.090
 750 expressed in the table 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:50.419
 That's what's in the table 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.269
 Kazakhstan are 29 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:58.079
 first in table against fifth 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:01.319
 Germany + 9 goals 10 points and 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.970
 Kazakhstan - seven goals one point ago 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.970
 The scorers for Germany in the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:11.220
 qualification so far özil with five klose 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.500
 31 32 and idiot with a goal as I said 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.820
 always against the background that of course 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.120
 the game on friday not yet there 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.120
 is 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.200
 yes that has and then yes and what is yours 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.670
 tip for this game what do you think 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.230
 that go out I guess I'm the one 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.250
 Most of the Bundesliga players are there 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.250
 be a bit restrained 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.080
 I think that win the game 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.180
 be and also clear and therefore go 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.800
 I assume that the return match he 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.970
 be a bit of a story 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.790
 and in the end then win 2 3 0 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.450
 I think it will turn 30, too 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.370
 then 40 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:05:00.060
 depends on what I then there's so 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.690
 and yes that's why so much too 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.690
 this analysis
