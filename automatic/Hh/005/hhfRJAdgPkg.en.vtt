00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.400
 the nutrition is obviously very 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.740
 related to how much energy you need 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.490
 The more I train, the more energy I spend 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.880
 I need to eat more that's true is that 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.880
 we have 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.160
 the days before we have to rely on 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.210
 two things importance hydration 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.820
 especially in the triathlon that 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.440
 normally in the centers we are in 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.180
 very hot very hot places 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.010
 we must be prepared and have a 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.360
 Hydration very well done every day 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.100
 previous 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.920
 on the other side of the feeding what 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.080
 we seek is to have a greater reserve of 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.810
 time that is not a power is not a 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.060
 way in which the body keeps or 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.920
 stores energy within the muscles 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.080
 within the place what form can be 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.580
 increase is glycogen increasing 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.580
 carbohydrates to tender 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.020
 a day before a triathlon is well 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.840
 important that your consumption increases a lot 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.259
 of carbohydrates tries to dine pasta 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.399
 rice potato help as gardener showed 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.399
 I do not have many thanks 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.510
 it's very important to tell people that 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.650
 have to have breakfast 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.180
 have to eat is always 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.180
 important to eat something before 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.890
 try to eat cereal toast 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.890
 fruit bars 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.729
 15 minutes before or the previous time already 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.700
 we can make food a little bit more 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.770
 high in glucose such as some 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.289
 special measures before the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.829
 events can be the mouths the 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.829
 genes 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.180
 during the competition is very important 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.340
 that you hydrate yourself is about taking so 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.870
 minus everything so off during the bike and 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.120
 it's also about eating something with 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.850
 carbohydrates some kind of gel or of 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.840
 gummies or something you 're used to 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.840
 during the vistilla in bed 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.840
 the after when we're going to do 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.290
 Exercise during the exercise 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.880
 it requires a lot of muscular wear 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.460
 large in which mass is lost 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.890
 muscle you lose the glycogen that is 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.000
 use 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.000
 it is lost then 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.390
 when the triathlon is finished it is very 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.220
 important that you recover as soon as possible 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.530
 possible for that can help you a lot 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.180
 that you drink some milk shake or milk 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.570
 chocolate with that you will feel a 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.570
 trick
