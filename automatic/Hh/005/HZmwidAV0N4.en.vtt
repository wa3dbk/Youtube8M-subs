00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi everyone guys are if uil 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.190
 hicks today are here with new digital 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.109
 online where this time I'll show you 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.059
 really a lot of images 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.800
 interesting about the contents 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.190
 of bank robbery expansion 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.020
 which they will obviously have to go out 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.720
 let's talk about vehicles and equipment 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.900
 of the teams that will obviously perform 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.180
 robberies as well as weapons that 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.580
 will have to use these teams and that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.170
 they have precisely in their equipment 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.359
 before starting the memory 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.710
 sure because there is 12 seconds also 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.149
 subscribe to the channel for others 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.140
 contents say we can start 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.730
 immediately 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.100
 then this way succeeded in 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.780
 extrapolate from the rockstar le servers 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.379
 various images of the vehicles that will have to 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.629
 go out 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.030
 let's start with curling technical ea 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.860
 apparently this image confirms us 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.230
 the exit of this vehicle we have 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.120
 also seen previously in the various 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.340
 trailer screenshot we also have the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.960
 karin kourou but it also presents this 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.870
 both in the gameplay and in the various screenshots 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.449
 always seen previously we have 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.340
 also the various princips the aktro this is 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.690
 the motorcycle or motorcycles 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.200
 that you will always see in this 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.810
 moment I didn't understand what it was in 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.380
 actually this name of this vehicle 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.360
 when it shows you the name of the vehicles that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.299
 will come out for bank robberies in a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.979
 previous video I made a while ago 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.320
 then we have the image of a helicopter 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.880
 also present in the trailer ed 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.600
 finally we have the second version 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.180
 of the area called velum luntan si 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.700
 I pronounce so I do not know what will be 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.500
 their differences also because obviously 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.770
 we have never seen this second 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.189
 version of the truth but I think maybe it will be 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.320
 a little more armored than the 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.659
 first version then it will take a while 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.790
 more resistant than the first 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.680
 version more than new vehicles then 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.930
 we have images that confirm us 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.560
 presence of these vehicles that will have to 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.689
 going out for this dlc is that we have 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.630
 however seen around on the various 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.700
 images or trailers instead we pass to the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.409
 I think there are more images 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.270
 important in this video 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.429
 we have pictures on the equipment 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.590
 that we will have for our team and 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.050
 these are all confirmed 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.380
 because as you see also from the image 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.720
 we have 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.640
 images almost identical in the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.890
 trailer the first equipment of the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.570
 team is about strange boxes 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.930
 probably containing 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.480
 clothing on clothes then i 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.210
 various clothes that robbers will have to 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.890
 then we wear the second one 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.050
 it's about a drill we have 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.550
 obviously also seen in the trailer 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.010
 then we have the third image 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.780
 concerning the weapons in which we have 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.960
 even a red gun really 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.870
 fantastic then we will also have the vision 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.180
 night course that will be used 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.220
 to have more visibility in the night 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.110
 clearly we also have a rifle a 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.560
 pump this time with the silencer 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.810
 an assault rifle and finally a card 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.480
 of identity or better najdi card 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.820
 probably false to blow up the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.830
 security and then sneak into 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.410
 bank without problems we pass instead 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.480
 to the fourth image always concerning 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.460
 the equipment is in this image 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.530
 we have a computer a special weapon 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.240
 masks of a bomb that 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.070
 obviously we will use to open 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.440
 inputs impossible to open 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.920
 normally like the boss to this bomb 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.720
 is a termite type I think it is so 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.280
 finally we have the fifth image 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.520
 on the equipment concerning one 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.620
 pistol an assault rifle and a bag 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.650
 and no boys the robberies are made 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.390
 wait more and more especially 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.370
 thanks to these images we hope for 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.020
 well and said this for favreau left 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.130
 in like it only takes two 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.750
 second click that blue button 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.850
 let me like the facebook page 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.400
