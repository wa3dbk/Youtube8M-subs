00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.750
 hello and welcome to a new one 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.880
 video by htc insight 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.699
 I am 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.890
 today at ifa 2011 in berlin like me 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.660
 announced on our site 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.789
 of course, and visitors now htc 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.210
 and htc stops here on the ifa 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.850
 new smartphone before and although the htc 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.790
 desire rx that we are the new middle class 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.300
 be a smartphone and not at the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.180
 mass market is not so true as the HTC 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.390
 in family or nothing ons then the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.769
 high end user long time I get this device 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.570
 I want you now, we imagine 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.670
 have a 4 on the front here 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.369
 inch large display with a resolution 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.790
 of 480 x 800 pixels 

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:03.979
 the display is laminated that means 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:08.390
 that there is hardly a gap or hardly any air 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.650
 between touch panel and glass gives that 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.220
 I could quite my perspective 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.360
 see well 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.009
 this looks like the picture is on 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.600
 the glass and not under the glass and 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.509
 I think it looks quite good 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.149
 and also affects the angle of view 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.210
 very positive, otherwise I have here 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.689
 under the display clearly the three 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.829
 Best back and the keys day 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:40.359
 switcher above we have the logo and the 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:43.789
 ear- shell that will be in the new offer 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:47.270
 a front camera while on the left 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:50.139
 side micro usb connection on the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.329
 right side the volume control 

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:56.240
 below we have the microphone above 350 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.700
 millimeter jack and very 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.600
 unusual for HTC smartphones the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.789
 a stop button at the top in the middle 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.240
 on the back we have here the 5 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.550
 megapixel camera using a f20 camera 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.690
 bsi sensor that means back side 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.330
 illuminated or backward illuminated 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.209
 this helps us with better photos 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.900
 low light conditions too 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.090
 shoot 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.130
 We also have 820 mm here 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:32.270
 wide angle and a htc image chip the 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.820
 Ladin means that the quality 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.520
 the photos will get a bit better 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:42.170
 Of course we also have an LED here 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.610
 blitz the speakers and Beats audio 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:52.400
 logo We can easily configure the device above 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.590
 pretty much just open this here 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.480
 Cover made of polycarbonate 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.350
 and something rubberized is coated 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.690
 So it's not so easy out of hand 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.490
 Slips here we have the slot for the 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.140
 sim card and that slot for the 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.300
 memory card develop here 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.420
 continue to store 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:18.440
 and yes, some already know 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.350
 that this xmet us different this rv 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.280
 which in Asia and Russia in the inn 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:29.150
 is on the market and there it is as 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:32.720
 dual sim device on the move and we have 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.000
 here and here then two are cards 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.460
 insert at least when this ev at 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.650
 I do not have a sim here 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:44.450
 card slot but the memory cards 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.640
 slot yes here we have 1000 650 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.060
 milliamp battery very neat 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.350
 for this class come this price level 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.260
 to the hardware we have here under the 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.110
 hood a qualcomm snapdragon is four 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.620
 Play processor with the designation Msm 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:05.330
 82 25 is a dual core processor with 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:09.110
 one gigahertz per core and with the a 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.840
 30 203 g office on the similar or 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.440
 same level as the 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.790
 andreas 95 gpu unfortunately this one can 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.100
 Processor no hd videos process 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:26.260
 therefore, the megapixel camera can also 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:32.180
 no hd videos record videos in 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:35.030
 wvg here 768 megabytes of RAM 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.419
 much work on internal memory good of 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.449
 we take one each for apps and 1 gb 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:44.780
 we can mediate for our data 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:51.460
 have the following dimensions here and that 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:53.300
 62 3 mm wide 118 105 mm high and 93 mm 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.150
 thin or thick 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.760
 yes I would like to turn it on once 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.919
 the software shows I go once 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.780
 in the settings info and software 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.020
 information 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:12.410
 we have android 4.0 4.1 cream 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.990
 sandwich and htc sense 4.1 that means the 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.620
 same software version currently 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.360
 also on the onyx and it was running 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.979
 namely synonymous with those switchen 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.710
 between the homescreens this light 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:28.450
 3d effect of, for example, the 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.460
 this tea and one of the nonexistent 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.770
 which is six but sufficient 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.880
 for it and actually leaves a lot 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.960
 very good and very fluid 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.479
 a small software difference 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.849
 There is nothing compared to the motto 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.669
 but if we on the 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:49.160
 button finds astrid tap and the 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:53.020
 standard that fischer out of the sandwich 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.430
 and not this 3d the feature of htc 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.930
 whether it is a restriction now or 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.169
 Not 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:03.169
 I am sure that many of you 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:04.700
 that day switche rather prefer that 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.190
 the six will be in the middle of september 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.800
 get a deal and a uvp of 299 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.360
 have euro 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.560
 positioned as mentioned 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.789
 exactly between the hsv and the htc when 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.200
 that that was the htc desire iks on the 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:24.080
 ifa 2012 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.800
 in many thanks for watching and until 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.800
 to the next video
