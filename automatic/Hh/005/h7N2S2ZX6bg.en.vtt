00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:32.160 

I<00:02:16.230> think<00:02:17.230> kids<00:02:17.530> moving<00:02:18.040> oh<00:02:18.610> my<00:02:19.270> god

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.580 

it's<00:02:32.650> shooting<00:02:33.310> print<00:02:33.819> that<00:02:33.940> every<00:02:34.420> time<00:02:34.690> but

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
it's shooting print that every time but

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.910 
it's shooting print that every time but
it<00:02:35.710> appears<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.100> me<00:02:36.220> movies<00:02:37.740> pretty<00:02:38.740> sure

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
it appears to me movies pretty sure

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:54.050 
it appears to me movies pretty sure
anyway<00:02:39.340> we'll<00:02:39.550> see

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.080 

it's<00:02:54.450> definitely<00:02:55.370> definitely<00:02:56.370> coming<00:02:56.880> out<00:02:57.060> I

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
it's definitely definitely coming out I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.020 
it's definitely definitely coming out I
think<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:59.010> was<00:02:59.130> definitely<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.550> limp<00:02:59.790> on<00:02:59.910> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
think it was definitely the limp on the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.580 
think it was definitely the limp on the
outside<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.420> don't<00:03:00.540> know<00:03:01.020> if<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.260> was<00:03:01.380> there

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
outside I don't know if that was there

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:17.720 
outside I don't know if that was there
before<00:03:01.770> or<00:03:02.160> not<00:03:15.500> it's<00:03:16.500> launching<00:03:17.190> bread<00:03:17.489> out

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
before or not it's launching bread out

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.120 
before or not it's launching bread out
everywhere<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:19.560> I've<00:03:19.650> got<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:19.980> GoPro

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
everywhere so I've got the GoPro

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:31.800 
everywhere so I've got the GoPro
recording<00:03:20.850> voice

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.000 

dude<00:03:32.810> I'm<00:03:33.020> pretty<00:03:33.230> sure<00:03:33.470> it's<00:03:33.680> actually

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
dude I'm pretty sure it's actually

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:53.400 
dude I'm pretty sure it's actually
coming<00:03:34.220> out<00:03:34.660> that's<00:03:35.660> ridiculous

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.900 

because<00:03:54.410> we're<00:03:54.620> not<00:03:54.710> having<00:03:54.890> anything<00:03:55.310> just

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
because we're not having anything just

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:04.839 
because we're not having anything just
for<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.180> while<00:03:56.360> this<00:03:56.920> one<00:03:57.920> piece

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
I haven't I never touched this with a

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.280 
I haven't I never touched this with a
with<00:05:12.230> a<00:05:12.260> pilot<00:05:12.680> bearing<00:05:12.920> puller<00:05:13.130> by<00:05:13.670> the<00:05:13.730> way

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
with a pilot bearing puller by the way

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.590 
with a pilot bearing puller by the way
it's<00:05:15.290> been<00:05:15.410> it's<00:05:16.280> a<00:05:16.340> 57<00:05:16.820> block<00:05:17.180> I<00:05:17.390> don't<00:05:17.540> know

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
it's been it's a 57 block I don't know

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.720 
it's been it's a 57 block I don't know
how<00:05:17.750> long<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.500> bearing<00:05:19.100> has<00:05:19.190> actually<00:05:19.580> been

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
how long the bearing has actually been

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.080 
how long the bearing has actually been
in<00:05:19.850> there<00:05:20.030> but<00:05:20.620> I've<00:05:21.620> never<00:05:22.460> tried<00:05:22.760> to<00:05:22.910> take<00:05:23.060> it

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
in there but I've never tried to take it

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.700 
in there but I've never tried to take it
out<00:05:23.300> so<00:05:23.540> I<00:05:23.570> figured<00:05:23.840> I'd<00:05:23.930> try<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.170> bread<00:05:24.410> trick

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
out so I figured I'd try the bread trick

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.130 
out so I figured I'd try the bread trick
and<00:05:24.920> see<00:05:25.070> if<00:05:25.160> it<00:05:25.310> actually<00:05:25.340> worked<00:05:25.930> or<00:05:26.930> if<00:05:27.020> the

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
and see if it actually worked or if the

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.110 
and see if it actually worked or if the
people<00:05:27.260> in<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.530> videos<00:05:27.830> we're<00:05:28.130> using<00:05:28.370> a<00:05:28.700> pilot

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
people in the videos we're using a pilot

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.680 
people in the videos we're using a pilot
rank<00:05:29.300> polar<00:05:29.510> to<00:05:29.750> get<00:05:29.900> moving<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:30.850> then<00:05:31.850> using

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
rank polar to get moving and then using

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.060 
rank polar to get moving and then using
the<00:05:32.780> bread<00:05:32.960> and<00:05:33.170> acting<00:05:33.440> like<00:05:33.470> it<00:05:33.710> got<00:05:33.830> it<00:05:33.980> all

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
the bread and acting like it got it all

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.130 
the bread and acting like it got it all
the<00:05:34.160> way<00:05:34.250> out<00:05:34.280> but<00:05:35.290> no<00:05:36.290> it<00:05:36.620> actually<00:05:36.950> works
