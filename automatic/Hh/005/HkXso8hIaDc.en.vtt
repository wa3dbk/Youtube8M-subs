00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
you hear the bass then like you use

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.030 
you hear the bass then like you use
pretty<00:02:28.610> much<00:02:28.700> d<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.990> go<00:02:30.140> an<00:02:30.410> entire<00:02:30.650> not

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
pretty much d and you go an entire not

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.220 
pretty much d and you go an entire not
an<00:02:31.460> entire<00:02:31.760> octave<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:35.120> then<00:02:35.870> if<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.050> want

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
an entire octave so and then if you want

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.230 
an entire octave so and then if you want
to<00:02:36.350> add<00:02:36.710> something<00:02:37.100> like<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.850> know<00:02:38.150> how

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
to add something like so you know how

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.449 
to add something like so you know how
like<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.450> drum<00:02:38.690> beat<00:02:38.870> goes<00:02:39.110> then<00:02:39.800> you<00:02:39.830> go

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.120 

so<00:02:45.209> like

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.760 

so<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.030> guess<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.810> did<00:02:51.050> it<00:02:51.170> wrong<00:02:51.320> with

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.840 

so<00:02:55.770> something<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.430> give<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.790> a

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
so something like that just give it a

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.160 
so something like that just give it a
beat<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.210> you<00:02:57.870> know<00:02:58.020> I'd<00:02:58.170> like<00:02:58.410> more<00:02:58.620> height

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
beat to it you know I'd like more height

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.600 
beat to it you know I'd like more height
the<00:03:01.170> next<00:03:01.590> chord<00:03:01.830> you're<00:03:01.950> going<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.100> play<00:03:02.160> is

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
the next chord you're going to play is

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.660 
the next chord you're going to play is
all<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.970> way<00:03:03.060> up<00:03:03.210> here<00:03:03.470> which<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:05.160> think

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
all the way up here which is I think

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:13.970 
all the way up here which is I think
it's<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.320> b-flat<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:12.230> then<00:03:13.230> if<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:13.650> want<00:03:13.890> to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
it's a b-flat so and then if you want to

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.160 
it's a b-flat so and then if you want to
get<00:03:14.100> techie<00:03:14.370> then<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.150> could<00:03:15.300> add<00:03:15.480> like<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.870> few

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
get techie then you could add like a few

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.690 
get techie then you could add like a few
notes<00:03:16.380> in<00:03:16.500> between<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:20.190> bring<00:03:20.340> yourself

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
notes in between so to bring yourself

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.400 
notes in between so to bring yourself

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.150 

simple<00:03:38.980> all<00:03:39.040> right<00:03:39.390> so<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:43.150> can<00:03:43.300> also<00:03:43.450> get

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
simple all right so you can also get

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.340 
simple all right so you can also get
extremely<00:03:45.160> technical<00:03:46.000> if<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:47.020> want<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.260> keep
