00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
later but there are some downfalls to

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.299 
later but there are some downfalls to
this<00:00:37.489> one<00:00:38.030> you<00:00:38.539> still<00:00:38.899> can<00:00:39.499> get<00:00:39.769> hit<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.100> you

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
this one you still can get hit and you

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.799 
this one you still can get hit and you
still<00:00:40.550> take<00:00:40.699> damage<00:00:40.760> but<00:00:41.210> you<00:00:41.300> can<00:00:41.510> kind<00:00:41.749> of

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
still take damage but you can kind of

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.299 
still take damage but you can kind of
crops<00:00:42.050> down<00:00:42.289> where<00:00:42.440> i<00:00:42.469> am<00:00:42.530> right<00:00:42.679> there<00:00:43.070> and

you should have no problem and i

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.360 
you should have no problem and i
probably<00:00:45.469> should<00:00:45.710> actually<00:00:45.829> explain<00:00:46.159> all<00:00:46.309> you

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
slide underneath it's pretty simple I

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.200 
slide underneath it's pretty simple I
don't<00:01:13.369> really<00:01:13.520> need<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.820> show<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:14.000> how<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.119> do

don't really need to show you how to do

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.389 
don't really need to show you how to do
it<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:14.420> it<00:01:14.600> isn't<00:01:15.020> super<00:01:15.560> effective<00:01:15.890> but<00:01:16.250> it

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
it and it isn't super effective but it

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.580 
it and it isn't super effective but it
is<00:01:16.579> a<00:01:16.610> safe<00:01:17.030> spot<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:17.539> if<00:01:17.869> you<00:01:17.960> really<00:01:18.229> are<00:01:18.350> in

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
is a safe spot and if you really are in

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.990 
is a safe spot and if you really are in
a<00:01:18.649> clip<00:01:18.950> situation<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.610> can<00:01:19.759> slide

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
a clip situation you can slide

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.209 
a clip situation you can slide
underneath<00:01:20.149> here<00:01:20.539> if<00:01:21.079> anything<00:01:21.530> just<00:01:21.829> to<00:01:22.009> stay

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
underneath here if anything just to stay

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.459 
underneath here if anything just to stay
alive<00:01:22.340> I<00:01:22.759> wouldn't<00:01:23.299> actively<00:01:23.899> use<00:01:24.170> this

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
alive I wouldn't actively use this

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.200 
alive I wouldn't actively use this
cheese<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.159> like<00:01:25.310> do<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.820> whole<00:01:25.969> round

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
cheese to like do the whole round

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.490 
cheese to like do the whole round
because<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:26.600> feel<00:01:26.899> like<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.110> would<00:01:27.320> take<00:01:27.469> a

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
because I feel like it would take a

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.889 
because I feel like it would take a
really<00:01:27.619> really<00:01:28.189> long<00:01:28.430> time<00:01:28.729> as<00:01:29.030> it's<00:01:29.539> not<00:01:29.719> very

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
really really long time as it's not very

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.929 
really really long time as it's not very
effective<00:01:30.200> especially<00:01:30.979> on<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.430> boss<00:01:31.579> wave<00:01:31.820> I

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
effective especially on the boss wave I

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.550 
effective especially on the boss wave I
feel<00:01:32.210> like<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.689> would<00:01:32.780> get<00:01:32.930> his<00:01:33.109> shields<00:01:33.439> back

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
feel like you would get his shields back

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.529 
feel like you would get his shields back
to<00:01:33.829> fast<00:01:34.039> but<00:01:34.579> then<00:01:34.700> again<00:01:34.789> you<00:01:34.969> can<00:01:35.240> Bob<00:01:35.390> Lee

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
to fast but then again you can Bob Lee
