00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.300 
neat out of the tip and here's the one
that's<00:02:55.910> been<00:02:56.420> left<00:02:56.660> at<00:02:56.840> room<00:02:57.079> temperature

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:14.380 

obviously<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.970> need<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.359> stir<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:13.269> mean<00:03:14.269> if

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
obviously that need to stir I mean if

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.879 
obviously that need to stir I mean if
you<00:03:14.510> can<00:03:14.660> see<00:03:16.180> if<00:03:17.180> quite<00:03:17.569> going<00:03:18.350> down<00:03:18.530> quite<00:03:18.859> a

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
you can see if quite going down quite a

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:28.660 
you can see if quite going down quite a
lot<00:03:19.069> slower<00:03:19.400> I<00:03:26.319> mean<00:03:27.319> you<00:03:27.889> probably<00:03:28.160> can't<00:03:28.489> see

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
lot slower I mean you probably can't see

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.379 
lot slower I mean you probably can't see
the<00:03:28.790> difference<00:03:29.239> but<00:03:30.400> in<00:03:31.400> consistency

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.530 

consistency<00:03:35.389> this<00:03:36.139> one<00:03:36.410> is<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:37.060> choice<00:03:38.060> Mac<00:03:38.329> is

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
consistency this one is a choice Mac is

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.629 
consistency this one is a choice Mac is
a<00:03:38.630> lot<00:03:38.930> thicker<00:03:39.230> harder<00:03:39.829> to<00:03:39.980> use<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.430> you'll

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
a lot thicker harder to use and you'll

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.470 
a lot thicker harder to use and you'll
get<00:03:40.819> more<00:03:41.380> more<00:03:42.380> sagger<00:03:42.769> out<00:03:43.010> of<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.480> while

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
get more more sagger out of it while

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.830 
get more more sagger out of it while
it's<00:03:44.660> trying<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:45.200> dry<00:03:45.440> off<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:47.540> basically<00:03:49.840> if

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
it's trying to dry off so basically if

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.830 
it's trying to dry off so basically if
you<00:03:51.769> heat<00:03:51.980> your<00:03:52.160> glass<00:03:52.430> up<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.569> point

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
you heat your glass up to the point

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.830 
you heat your glass up to the point
where<00:03:54.019> it's<00:03:54.139> very<00:03:54.290> hot<00:03:54.650> in<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.190> tin<00:03:55.459> you<00:03:55.840> can

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
where it's very hot in the tin you can

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.599 
where it's very hot in the tin you can
use<00:03:57.349> it<00:03:57.560> straight<00:03:57.950> on<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:59.380> frame<00:04:00.380> people<00:04:00.769> you

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
use it straight on a frame people you

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.050 
use it straight on a frame people you
could<00:04:01.790> use<00:04:01.970> on<00:04:02.180> anyone<00:04:02.750> work<00:04:03.190> without<00:04:04.190> having

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
could use on anyone work without having

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.599 
could use on anyone work without having
to<00:04:05.180> add<00:04:05.269> terms<00:04:05.630> which<00:04:06.079> means<00:04:06.319> it<00:04:06.590> will<00:04:06.739> be<00:04:06.799> and

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.130 

four<00:04:10.609> locks<00:04:10.790> on<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.329> than<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.660> one

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
four locks on you than the one

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.000 
four locks on you than the one
haven't<00:04:12.620> one<00:04:12.800> two<00:04:13.160> three<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:15.500> basically<00:04:15.860> all

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
haven't one two three so basically all

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.520 
haven't one two three so basically all
have<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.280> do<00:04:16.370> is<00:04:16.609> heat<00:04:17.180> it<00:04:17.359> up<00:04:17.480> to<00:04:18.230> a<00:04:18.260> point

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
have to do is heat it up to a point

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.900 
have to do is heat it up to a point
where<00:04:18.680> stent<00:04:18.950> hot<00:04:19.130> and<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:19.489> can<00:04:19.609> use<00:04:19.730> up

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
where stent hot and you can use up

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.880 
where stent hot and you can use up
straight<00:04:20.209> up<00:04:20.239> at<00:04:20.540> ten<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:21.260> might<00:04:21.470> need<00:04:21.680> to

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
straight up at ten you might need to

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.230 
straight up at ten you might need to
keep<00:04:22.100> your<00:04:22.400> tin<00:04:24.310> next<00:04:25.310> to<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.520> heat<00:04:25.730> up<00:04:26.000> if

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
keep your tin next to the heat up if

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.540 
keep your tin next to the heat up if
you're<00:04:26.390> doing<00:04:26.630> quite<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:26.870> lot<00:04:27.050> of<00:04:27.080> work<00:04:27.370> as<00:04:28.370> if

out the kettle and just put it back but
next<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:03.919> heater<00:05:04.070> it's<00:05:04.520> a<00:05:04.669> lot<00:05:04.940> better

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
next to the heater it's a lot better

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.060 
next to the heater it's a lot better
than<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.780> alternative<00:05:06.530> which<00:05:06.770> is<00:05:07.640> and<00:05:09.070> taking

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
than the alternative which is and taking

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.150 
than the alternative which is and taking
it<00:05:10.160> out<00:05:10.419> of<00:05:11.419> a<00:05:11.840> room<00:05:12.200> at<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.500> tin<00:05:12.860> that's<00:05:12.950> been

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
it out of a room at the tin that's been

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.940 
it out of a room at the tin that's been
left<00:05:13.310> at<00:05:13.490> room<00:05:13.669> temperature<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:14.950> adding

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
left at room temperature and adding

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.540 
left at room temperature and adding
turps

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
turps

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.100 
turps
so<00:05:16.790> that's<00:05:16.970> all<00:05:17.180> you've<00:05:17.330> got<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.479> do<00:05:17.690> whack<00:05:17.960> it

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
so that's all you've got to do whack it

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.520 
so that's all you've got to do whack it
