00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello you love today I want to show 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.580
 as I dyed this hair color there 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.109
 He always asks what used 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.940
 for hair color and too far there I thought 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.130
 I feel like I am then 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.290
 dyed the current hair color 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.570
 Of course vegan deep free products 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.190
 as always and though the result is not 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.020
 that's how I like it 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.910
 That's very good to me and like me 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.710
 then this color with two actions 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:31.320
 got this hombre im 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:32.610
 blood I show you after the intro as 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.170
 first of all i have my hair or im 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.680
 Cleaning shampoo from having pieces 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.579
 to wash 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.340
 we also need vaseline 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.640
 of course the directions in the gloves 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.500
 plan and lavender something to flush 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.760
 dilute and then it works 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.120
 Go with the mix 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.140
 The first thing I mix is ​​planning 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.539
 a little bit around the color 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.340
 pastelike or something 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.789
 I have to stretch a bit of space 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.250
 to 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.329
 until I like the color then and that 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.440
 I was a little too dark for that 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.750
 That's why I have a little more 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.070
 given and in the end I have 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.200
 but still done a little bit because 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.970
 that was not enough at the lavender go 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.560
 I just prior to use, however, 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.689
 the whole pack with rinse 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.060
 mixed up for something else 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.560
 to get lighter 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.150
 and yes those are the colors 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 then finally used then goes 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.119
 it's the first thing to ask 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.860
 to lighten the possibly becomes color 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.229
 be used so that you simply from 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.540
 So it was selina fall 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.549
 Ears and disturb this is really gold 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.950
 worth it I share myself first 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.750
 crest off and behind the ear 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.979
 practically the one with the tories more 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.409
 get away with it 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.420
 focus on the front 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.520
 I am not a hairdresser but that feels 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.290
 for me right and then 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.509
 I start with the approach above 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.970
 and shaken for scheikl in there and 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.259
 wear the color from the neck in the wings 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.259
 get up slowly 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.800
 when I finish the front partie 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.530
 I put this away and opened 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.150
 the back partie around her side 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.580
 I find it very helpful 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.500
 to have a mirror behind it because 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.890
 I still see my back 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.869
 can 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.730
 and yes then I can decide 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.530
 how far I want to undergo that and 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.410
 I do that is under this art 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.030
 halo I have red in yellow and 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.010
 I have the purple about that far now 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.690
 the plan pulled down and then missing 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.100
 Of course, the tips are now 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.550
 of course, quite a bit blue 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.010
 or have greenish and there 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.870
 in the end, he has the lavender 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.010
 neutralize and city ​​completely 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.630
 to settle down but in the end 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.730
 I like it very much 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.350
 to make the crossings houses 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.720
 of course I blur that one more 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.489
 a bit so that it does not seem so hard 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.750
 First of all, but still 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.580
 do something more 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.830
 then I came through the tips again 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.269
 and give it some color on it 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.310
 to catch all hair 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.350
 and then comes the already 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.209
 fresh foil to use the for 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.030
 do not make sure you do all your furniture 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.430
 authority with your color and peace 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.290
 can still let that act and before 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.690
 all the damp remains then acts 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.880
 that in my opinion better and yes 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.590
 that grabs her then everything on your 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.840
 head and I have it in the end 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.060
 for about an hour 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.320
 leave a standard eic you can 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.090
 quietly make over night if you are the one 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:23.260
 bock on it and yes then you see 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:24.820
 first off after lisa acting time 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.280
 of course I have my mister emperor 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.380
 washed out without shampoo and then had 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.230
 I blow this result after I blow 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.760
 I'm very happy with the color yes me 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.739
 I hope you like the video

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.920

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.480
 I make the comments 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.610
 one-off effects like the ones with my tips 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.610
