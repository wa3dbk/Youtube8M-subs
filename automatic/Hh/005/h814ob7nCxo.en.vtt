hey guys in this tutorial we check out

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.280 
hey guys in this tutorial we check out
the<00:00:09.610> features<00:00:09.820> of<00:00:10.059> the<00:00:10.299> new<00:00:10.420> bone<00:00:10.690> tool<00:00:10.990> in

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
the features of the new bone tool in

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.150 
the features of the new bone tool in
flash<00:00:11.620> see

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
flash see

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.630 
flash see
five<00:00:15.930> well<00:00:16.930> here<00:00:17.380> we<00:00:17.470> are<00:00:17.500> a<00:00:17.830> new<00:00:18.220> version<00:00:18.400> of

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
five well here we are a new version of

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.700 
five well here we are a new version of
flash<00:00:18.880> and<00:00:19.210> so<00:00:19.630> we<00:00:19.750> have<00:00:19.930> a<00:00:19.960> new<00:00:20.170> version<00:00:20.410> of

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
flash and so we have a new version of

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.600 
flash and so we have a new version of
the<00:00:20.890> bone<00:00:21.070> tool<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.750> as<00:00:23.050> you<00:00:23.380> can<00:00:23.529> see<00:00:23.590> I<00:00:23.950> have<00:00:24.340> a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
the bone tool so as you can see I have a

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.550 
the bone tool so as you can see I have a
drawing<00:00:25.029> on<00:00:25.240> my<00:00:25.360> screen<00:00:25.779> and<00:00:26.020> it's<00:00:26.259> not<00:00:26.529> a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
drawing on my screen and it's not a

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.240 
drawing on my screen and it's not a
symbol<00:00:27.070> and<00:00:27.570> what<00:00:28.570> I'm<00:00:28.689> going<00:00:28.930> to<00:00:28.990> do<00:00:29.199> is<00:00:29.980> take

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
symbol and what I'm going to do is take

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.910 
symbol and what I'm going to do is take
my<00:00:30.369> selection<00:00:30.850> tool<00:00:30.880> and<00:00:31.619> highlight<00:00:32.619> the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
my selection tool and highlight the

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.540 
my selection tool and highlight the
drawing<00:00:34.019> next<00:00:35.019> I'm<00:00:35.440> going<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.890> go<00:00:36.010> ahead<00:00:36.129> and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
drawing next I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.890 
drawing next I'm going to go ahead and
select<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.150> bone<00:00:37.330> tool

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
select the bone tool

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.740 
select the bone tool
I'm<00:00:38.970> simply<00:00:39.970> going<00:00:40.090> to<00:00:40.150> come<00:00:40.300> down<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.629> the

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
I'm simply going to come down to the

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.560 
I'm simply going to come down to the
bottom<00:00:40.930> and<00:00:41.350> click<00:00:41.550> hold<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:42.699> drag<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:43.330> just

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
bottom and click hold and drag and just

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.680 
bottom and click hold and drag and just
move<00:00:43.780> my<00:00:44.710> mouse<00:00:44.950> button<00:00:45.340> up<00:00:45.550> and<00:00:45.790> release<00:00:46.360> and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
move my mouse button up and release and

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.840 
move my mouse button up and release and
then<00:00:47.530> I'm<00:00:47.649> just<00:00:47.680> going<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:47.950> continue<00:00:48.399> on<00:00:48.579> from

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
then I'm just going to continue on from

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.940 
then I'm just going to continue on from
there<00:00:49.000> by<00:00:49.239> clicking<00:00:49.300> holding<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.230> moving<00:00:50.829> up

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
there by clicking holding and moving up

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.660 
there by clicking holding and moving up
again<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:53.140> far<00:00:53.410> this<00:00:53.590> is<00:00:53.649> all<00:00:54.010> just<00:00:54.370> like<00:00:54.550> it

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
again so far this is all just like it

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.000 
again so far this is all just like it
was<00:00:54.820> in<00:00:55.149> flash<00:00:55.390> cs4<00:00:55.809> there's<00:00:56.649> really<00:00:56.770> no

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
was in flash cs4 there's really no

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.240 
was in flash cs4 there's really no
changes<00:00:57.579> and<00:00:57.789> just<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.870> flash<00:00:59.110> cs4<00:00:59.710> you<00:00:59.980> then

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
changes and just like flash cs4 you then

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.340 
changes and just like flash cs4 you then
have<00:01:00.399> to<00:01:00.489> take<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:01.000> selection<00:01:01.449> tool<00:01:01.660> in<00:01:01.960> order

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
have to take the selection tool in order

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.430 
have to take the selection tool in order
to<00:01:02.500> manipulate<00:01:03.160> your<00:01:03.760> joints<00:01:04.239> so<00:01:05.170> then<00:01:05.350> you

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
to manipulate your joints so then you

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.020 
to manipulate your joints so then you
can<00:01:05.560> come<00:01:05.680> up<00:01:05.800> here<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.430> can<00:01:06.580> move<00:01:06.759> your

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
can come up here and you can move your

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.900 
can come up here and you can move your
object<00:01:07.960> around<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.550> do<00:01:09.550> different<00:01:09.880> things

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
object around and do different things

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.910 
object around and do different things
with<00:01:10.450> it

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
with it

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.590 
with it
now<00:01:11.920> where<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.430> real<00:01:12.640> differences<00:01:13.180> come<00:01:13.420> in

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
now where the real differences come in

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.770 
now where the real differences come in
between<00:01:13.780> cs4<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:14.770> cs5<00:01:15.009> is<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:16.270> properties

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
between cs4 and cs5 is the properties

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.309 
between cs4 and cs5 is the properties
box<00:01:17.130> once<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.310> apply<00:01:18.640> your<00:01:18.849> joints<00:01:19.360> you<00:01:19.990> can

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:20.319 
box once you apply your joints you can

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:23.279 
box once you apply your joints you can
change<00:01:20.860> different<00:01:21.130> things<00:01:21.369> about<00:01:22.360> them<00:01:22.840> right

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
change different things about them right

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.440 
change different things about them right
in<00:01:23.410> the<00:01:23.470> properties<00:01:23.920> box<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.880> big<00:01:25.119> things

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
in the properties box the big things

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.770 
in the properties box the big things
being<00:01:25.720> you<00:01:26.200> can<00:01:26.380> add<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.590> spring<00:01:27.190> or<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.630> can

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
being you can add a spring or you can

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.639 
being you can add a spring or you can
constrain<00:01:29.380> your<00:01:29.560> joints<00:01:30.009> in<00:01:30.130> different<00:01:30.759> ways

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
constrain your joints in different ways

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.309 
constrain your joints in different ways
so<00:01:32.649> what<00:01:33.310> is<00:01:33.399> constraining<00:01:34.000> do<00:01:34.209> exactly<00:01:34.720> well

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
so what is constraining do exactly well

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.109 
so what is constraining do exactly well
let's<00:01:35.500> say<00:01:35.679> for<00:01:35.890> instance<00:01:35.979> you<00:01:36.520> don't<00:01:36.849> want

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
let's say for instance you don't want

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.469 
let's say for instance you don't want
your<00:01:37.270> joint<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:37.899> move<00:01:38.110> past<00:01:38.649> a<00:01:38.890> certain<00:01:39.099> point

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
your joint to move past a certain point

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.540 
your joint to move past a certain point
you<00:01:40.479> can<00:01:40.660> apply<00:01:40.929> some<00:01:40.989> parameters<00:01:41.800> so<00:01:42.250> it

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
you can apply some parameters so it

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.910 
you can apply some parameters so it
doesn't<00:01:43.119> do<00:01:43.209> this<00:01:43.360> so<00:01:44.200> for<00:01:44.440> instance<00:01:44.739> let's

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
doesn't do this so for instance let's

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.370 
doesn't do this so for instance let's
come<00:01:45.069> down<00:01:45.099> here<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.640> this<00:01:45.849> one<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.929> let's<00:01:47.229> go

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
come down here to this one and let's go

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.830 
come down here to this one and let's go
ahead<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.709> enable<00:01:48.039> it<00:01:48.160> and<00:01:48.330> click<00:01:49.330> constrain

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
ahead and enable it and click constrain

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.320 
ahead and enable it and click constrain
as<00:01:50.190> you<00:01:51.190> can<00:01:51.310> see<00:01:51.489> right<00:01:51.670> now<00:01:51.729> we<00:01:51.910> have<00:01:52.209> it<00:01:52.300> set

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
as you can see right now we have it set

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.850 
as you can see right now we have it set
to<00:01:52.590> 50/50<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:54.250> really<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:54.970> really<00:01:55.539> has<00:01:55.720> no<00:01:55.989> room

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
to 50/50 so really it really has no room

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.029 
to 50/50 so really it really has no room
to<00:01:56.890> move<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.989> now<00:01:58.989> if<00:01:59.140> we<00:01:59.259> go<00:01:59.380> ahead<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.739> we

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
to move and now if we go ahead and we

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.650 
to move and now if we go ahead and we
try<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.280> move<00:02:00.459> our<00:02:00.580> bone<00:02:00.789> tool<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.270> can<00:02:01.420> see

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
try to move our bone tool you can see

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.260 
try to move our bone tool you can see
that<00:02:01.869> it's<00:02:02.140> constrained<00:02:03.099> it<00:02:03.399> actually<00:02:04.060> is

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
that it's constrained it actually is

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.389 
that it's constrained it actually is
doing<00:02:04.810> some<00:02:05.110> really<00:02:05.140> weird<00:02:05.440> stuff<00:02:05.590> here<00:02:06.069> it's

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
doing some really weird stuff here it's

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.359 
doing some really weird stuff here it's
like<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.819> doesn't<00:02:07.660> move<00:02:07.899> past<00:02:08.800> that<00:02:09.039> certain

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
like it doesn't move past that certain

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.900 
like it doesn't move past that certain
point<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.980> that<00:02:11.980> allows<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.520> do<00:02:12.730> different

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
point so that allows you to do different

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.390 
point so that allows you to do different
things<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.500> let's<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:14.770> go<00:02:14.860> ahead<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.280> undo

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
things so let's just go ahead and undo

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.780 
things so let's just go ahead and undo
that<00:02:15.610> really<00:02:16.030> quick<00:02:17.250> now<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.310> spring

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that really quick now the spring

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.050 
that really quick now the spring
basically<00:02:19.720> allows<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.410> animate<00:02:21.070> like<00:02:22.030> a

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
basically allows you to animate like a

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.830 
basically allows you to animate like a
spring<00:02:22.540> effect<00:02:23.220> automatically

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
spring effect automatically

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.920 
spring effect automatically
so<00:02:25.349> let's<00:02:25.680> go<00:02:25.800> ahead<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.420> I'm<00:02:27.420> going<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.720> take

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
so let's go ahead and I'm going to take

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.720 
so let's go ahead and I'm going to take
this<00:02:28.260> tree<00:02:28.860> here<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.220> I'm<00:02:29.280> going<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.459> kind<00:02:29.700> of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
this tree here and I'm going to kind of

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.640 
this tree here and I'm going to kind of
like<00:02:29.940> bend<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:32.780> now<00:02:33.780> I'm<00:02:34.319> just

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
like bend it like this now I'm just

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.990 
like bend it like this now I'm just
going<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.830> come<00:02:35.010> down<00:02:35.099> here<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.370> my<00:02:35.489> timeline

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
going to come down here to my timeline

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.660 
going to come down here to my timeline
and<00:02:36.660> I'm<00:02:36.750> going<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.140> right-click<00:02:37.410> frame<00:02:38.190> 20

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
and I'm going to right-click frame 20

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.949 
and I'm going to right-click frame 20
and<00:02:38.880> insert<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:40.050> pose<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:42.239> then<00:02:42.480> at<00:02:42.660> frame<00:02:42.930> 20

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
and insert a pose so then at frame 20

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.949 
and insert a pose so then at frame 20
I'm<00:02:43.530> going<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.519> move<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.150> tree<00:02:45.510> back

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
I'm going to just move the tree back

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.270 
I'm going to just move the tree back
this<00:02:46.680> way<00:02:46.980> like<00:02:47.640> kind<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:47.940> like<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.890> now<00:02:49.890> on

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
this way like kind of like that now on

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.339 
this way like kind of like that now on
my<00:02:50.610> timeline<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:51.269> going<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.690> go<00:02:51.810> ahead<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.260> go

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
my timeline I'm going to go ahead and go

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.400 
my timeline I'm going to go ahead and go
to<00:02:52.380> frame<00:02:53.040> 100<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.819> right<00:02:54.599> click<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.080> insert

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
to frame 100 and right click and insert

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.809 
to frame 100 and right click and insert
a<00:02:55.680> pose<00:02:56.959> so<00:02:57.959> now<00:02:58.170> what<00:02:58.920> I'm<00:02:59.010> going<00:02:59.069> to<00:02:59.310> do<00:02:59.580> is

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
a pose so now what I'm going to do is

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.420 
a pose so now what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:03:00.660> going<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.989> click<00:03:01.380> one<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.920> joints

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
I'm going to click one of the joints

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.150 
I'm going to click one of the joints
let's<00:03:03.060> go<00:03:03.209> ahead<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.780> click<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.890> top<00:03:05.100> one

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
let's go ahead and click the top one

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.740 
let's go ahead and click the top one
right<00:03:05.640> here<00:03:06.000> each<00:03:06.840> joint<00:03:07.440> has<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.739> different

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
right here each joint has a different

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.900 
right here each joint has a different
spring<00:03:09.750> parameter<00:03:10.410> along<00:03:11.310> with<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.459> dampening

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
spring parameter along with a dampening

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.259 
spring parameter along with a dampening
parameter<00:03:12.380> so<00:03:13.380> let's<00:03:13.560> go<00:03:13.680> ahead<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.269> actually

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
parameter so let's go ahead and actually

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.449 
parameter so let's go ahead and actually
test<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.750> first<00:03:16.049> before<00:03:16.230> we<00:03:16.500> do<00:03:16.620> anything<00:03:16.890> if

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
test this first before we do anything if

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.059 
test this first before we do anything if
I<00:03:17.640> hit<00:03:17.819> enter<00:03:18.060> on<00:03:18.840> my<00:03:18.870> keyboard<00:03:18.959> that's<00:03:19.950> what

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
I hit enter on my keyboard that's what

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.860 
I hit enter on my keyboard that's what
the<00:03:20.160> animation<00:03:20.580> does<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.910> flings<00:03:21.299> over<00:03:21.630> and

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
the animation does it flings over and

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.170 
the animation does it flings over and
then<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.349> goes<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.530> frame<00:03:22.980> 100<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.670> then

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
then it goes to frame 100 and then

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.990 
then it goes to frame 100 and then
that's<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.709> now<00:03:25.709> I'm<00:03:26.010> going<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.580> click<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.819> top

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
that's it now I'm going to click the top

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.630 
that's it now I'm going to click the top
joint<00:03:27.269> as<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.660> said<00:03:27.840> before<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.440> I'm<00:03:29.250> going<00:03:29.609> to

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
joint as I said before and I'm going to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.289 
joint as I said before and I'm going to
take<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.630> strength<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.650> spring<00:03:32.070> and<00:03:32.340> just

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
take the strength of the spring and just

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.300 
take the strength of the spring and just
to<00:03:33.600> show<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.840> I'm<00:03:34.140> going<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.470> increase<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.190> all

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
to show you I'm going to increase it all

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.840 
to show you I'm going to increase it all
the<00:03:35.400> way<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.519> 100<00:03:36.890> now<00:03:37.890> I'm<00:03:38.130> going<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.489> play<00:03:38.700> the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
the way to 100 now I'm going to play the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.809 
the way to 100 now I'm going to play the
animation<00:03:38.970> again<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:40.410> see<00:03:41.069> what<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.280> does<00:03:41.430> is

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
animation again and see what it does is

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.539 
animation again and see what it does is
when<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.120> goes<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.480> point<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:43.140> just<00:03:43.620> does

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
when it goes to that point it just does

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.789 
when it goes to that point it just does
a<00:03:44.579> springing<00:03:45.000> effect<00:03:45.750> as<00:03:45.959> if<00:03:46.170> it's<00:03:46.290> using<00:03:46.650> like

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
a springing effect as if it's using like

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.220 
a springing effect as if it's using like
the<00:03:46.980> gravity<00:03:47.220> or<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.790> motion<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:49.079> object

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
the gravity or the motion of the object

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.150 
the gravity or the motion of the object
and<00:03:49.799> it<00:03:49.920> just<00:03:50.190> continues<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:51.350> move<00:03:52.350> basically

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
and it just continues to move basically

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.050 
and it just continues to move basically
with<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.549> joint<00:03:54.620> now<00:03:55.620> let's<00:03:56.459> say<00:03:56.579> you<00:03:56.639> want

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
with that joint now let's say you want

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.379 
with that joint now let's say you want
it<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.569> taper<00:03:58.410> off<00:03:58.650> after<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.880> does<00:04:00.120> that

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
it to taper off after it does that

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.520 
it to taper off after it does that
because<00:04:00.510> as<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.840> can<00:04:00.959> see<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.380> was<00:04:01.500> just

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
because as you can see it was just

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.160 
because as you can see it was just
bouncing<00:04:02.220> continuously<00:04:02.910> well<00:04:03.840> that's<00:04:03.959> where

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
bouncing continuously well that's where

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.890 
bouncing continuously well that's where
dampening<00:04:04.739> comes<00:04:04.980> in<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:05.910> again<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.450> for<00:04:06.720> a

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
dampening comes in so again just for a

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.319 
dampening comes in so again just for a
zanuck<00:04:07.319> zanuck<00:04:08.220> stream<00:04:08.579> here<00:04:08.850> I'm<00:04:09.030> just<00:04:09.150> going

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
zanuck zanuck stream here I'm just going

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.000 
zanuck zanuck stream here I'm just going
to<00:04:09.359> put<00:04:09.630> it<00:04:09.750> all<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.959> way<00:04:10.049> to<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.350> hundred<00:04:10.680> and

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
to put it all the way to a hundred and

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.809 
to put it all the way to a hundred and
I'm<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:12.000> going<00:04:12.359> to<00:04:12.480> again<00:04:12.810> play<00:04:13.109> this<00:04:13.380> as<00:04:13.819> it

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
I'm just going to again play this as it

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.690 
I'm just going to again play this as it
goes<00:04:15.000> then<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.750> slowly<00:04:16.519> stops<00:04:17.810> bouncing<00:04:18.810> and

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
goes then it slowly stops bouncing and

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.760 
goes then it slowly stops bouncing and
again<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:20.850> can<00:04:21.000> apply<00:04:21.269> this<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.770> different

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
again you can apply this to different

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.590 
again you can apply this to different
joints<00:04:23.639> so<00:04:23.820> if<00:04:23.880> we<00:04:23.970> go<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.270> click<00:04:24.330> on<00:04:24.510> the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
joints so if we go and click on the

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.390 
joints so if we go and click on the
middle<00:04:24.840> joint<00:04:25.020> as<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.620> can<00:04:25.889> see<00:04:26.070> we<00:04:26.250> don't

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
middle joint as you can see we don't

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.860 
middle joint as you can see we don't
have<00:04:26.550> any<00:04:27.770> spring<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.580> so<00:04:30.300> we<00:04:30.419> can<00:04:30.539> simply

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
have any spring to that so we can simply

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.620 
have any spring to that so we can simply
just<00:04:30.990> go<00:04:31.470> ahead<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:31.860> let's<00:04:32.130> put<00:04:32.340> it<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.580> 54<00:04:33.419> and

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
just go ahead and let's put it to 54 and

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.130 
just go ahead and let's put it to 54 and
put<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.870> dampening<00:04:34.349> to<00:04:35.120> 25<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.479> again

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
put the dampening to 25 and again

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.580 
put the dampening to 25 and again
playing<00:04:37.440> with<00:04:37.530> these<00:04:37.800> parameters

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
playing with these parameters

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.560 
playing with these parameters
well<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:39.010> know<00:04:39.130> give<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.610> different<00:04:40.090> effects

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
well you know give you different effects

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.780 
well you know give you different effects
depending<00:04:40.750> on<00:04:41.260> how<00:04:41.680> strong<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.160> spring<00:04:42.670> it

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
depending on how strong the spring it

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.360 
depending on how strong the spring it
isn't<00:04:43.030> all<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.150> so<00:04:44.140> if<00:04:44.230> we<00:04:44.350> hit<00:04:44.530> return<00:04:44.950> again

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
isn't all that so if we hit return again

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.180 
isn't all that so if we hit return again
here<00:04:45.610> we'll<00:04:46.330> see<00:04:46.510> again<00:04:46.780> we<00:04:47.500> have<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.800> spring

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
here we'll see again we have that spring

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.500 
here we'll see again we have that spring
effect<00:04:48.970> going<00:04:49.210> into<00:04:49.630> play<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:51.240> of<00:04:52.240> course

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
effect going into play and of course

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.060 
effect going into play and of course
that<00:04:52.690> effects<00:04:53.050> this<00:04:53.230> spring<00:04:53.470> effect<00:04:53.800> because

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
that effects this spring effect because

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.980 
that effects this spring effect because
of<00:04:54.100> how<00:04:54.310> this<00:04:54.550> joint<00:04:54.910> is<00:04:55.150> moving<00:04:55.630> so<00:04:55.780> again

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
of how this joint is moving so again

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.020 
of how this joint is moving so again
it's<00:04:56.140> pretty<00:04:56.860> cool<00:04:57.040> how<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.430> all<00:04:57.520> works<00:04:57.820> out

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
it's pretty cool how it all works out

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.670 
it's pretty cool how it all works out
it's<00:04:58.990> pretty<00:04:59.190> intuitive<00:05:00.630> but<00:05:01.630> anyway<00:05:01.990> that

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
it's pretty intuitive but anyway that

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.800 
it's pretty intuitive but anyway that
pretty<00:05:02.920> much<00:05:03.070> covers<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.610> new<00:05:04.030> features<00:05:04.510> of

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
pretty much covers the new features of

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.580 
pretty much covers the new features of
the<00:05:04.900> bone<00:05:05.500> tool<00:05:05.800> it's<00:05:06.760> um<00:05:07.090> I<00:05:07.420> think<00:05:08.410> these<00:05:08.530> are

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
the bone tool it's um I think these are

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.260 
the bone tool it's um I think these are
some<00:05:08.890> great<00:05:08.980> additions<00:05:09.490> and<00:05:09.700> I'm<00:05:09.820> kind<00:05:10.240> of

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
some great additions and I'm kind of

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.580 
some great additions and I'm kind of
looking<00:05:10.360> forward<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.810> trying<00:05:11.350> them<00:05:11.530> out

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
looking forward to trying them out

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.640 
looking forward to trying them out
myself<00:05:11.770> in<00:05:12.160> my<00:05:12.250> movies<00:05:12.580> so<00:05:13.320> hopefully<00:05:14.320> you

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
myself in my movies so hopefully you

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.430 
myself in my movies so hopefully you
guys<00:05:14.830> find<00:05:15.190> them<00:05:15.370> useful<00:05:15.490> as<00:05:15.820> well<00:05:16.140> so<00:05:17.140> anyway

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
guys find them useful as well so anyway

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.380 
guys find them useful as well so anyway
