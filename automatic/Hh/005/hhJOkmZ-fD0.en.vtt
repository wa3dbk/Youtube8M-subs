my<00:02:10.090> deepest<00:02:10.480> fear<00:02:10.510> I'm<00:02:11.140> braden<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.860> admit<00:02:12.160> it

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
my deepest fear I'm braden to admit it

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.940 
my deepest fear I'm braden to admit it
is<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.450> will<00:02:13.600> not<00:02:14.080> be<00:02:14.260> loved<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.740> not

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
is that I will not be loved and not

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.810 
is that I will not be loved and not
worthy<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.370> love<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:15.970> don't<00:02:16.180> deserve<00:02:16.510> it

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
worthy of love and that don't deserve it

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.810 
worthy of love and that don't deserve it
and<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:19.390> think<00:02:19.630> that's<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.080> good<00:02:20.230> visual<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.670> we

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
and I think that's a good visual so we

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.460 
and I think that's a good visual so we
went<00:02:22.000> back<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.270> forth<00:02:22.630> for<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.110> couple<00:02:23.410> of

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
went back and forth for a couple of

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.080 
went back and forth for a couple of
months<00:02:23.530> before<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.220> both<00:02:24.460> found<00:02:24.730> something

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
months before it both found something

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.910 
months before it both found something
we're<00:02:25.330> really<00:02:25.530> comfortable<00:02:26.530> with<00:02:26.710> and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
we're really comfortable with and

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.870 
we're really comfortable with and
figured<00:02:27.190> out<00:02:27.250> how<00:02:27.400> we<00:02:27.460> could<00:02:27.730> do<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:29.520> until<00:02:30.520> a

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
figured out how we could do this until a

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.110 
figured out how we could do this until a
really<00:02:31.570> compelling<00:02:32.070> story<00:02:33.070> in<00:02:33.760> an<00:02:33.880> original

film I think that is one of the huge
components<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.239> that's<00:03:07.450> going<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.690> be<00:03:07.750> sounds

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500
