00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.430
 hello welcome to the video blog of 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.230
 primeriti in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.119
 show you a little tutorial step to 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.039
 step to create this semi collected that 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.960
 you are seeing that I am here now and that 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.329
 it's perfect well for a special night 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.650
 for a party or even because it does not stop 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.390
 Some girlfriend who dares to comb her hair 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.189
 herself at home I show you step to 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.989
 step how is the first thing that you have to 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.729
 to do is to brush the hair very well to 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.839
 that is very unraveled and reduce it in 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.839
 a pigtail of average height 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.920
 the next thing we have to do is 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.780
 catch good I have already seen that I have 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.199
 used on this occasion a necklace of 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.789
 obviously fake pearls but good 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.890
 You can use any other type of 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.799
 ornament some actions parents flowers or 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.690
 even a ribbon a ribbon whatever you want 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.369
 what I've done is cut it 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.920
 having as reference the length of my 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:04.509
 cole is more or less you see that each each 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.530
 row has the length of my tail that 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.450
 is what we are going to do with these two 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.100
 rows of pearls let's hook the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.330
 top to the quote with which 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.330
 I made my ponytail 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.130
 let's first take a 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.549
 and we hooked it we passed one of the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.549
 pearls 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.079
 so that it stays here well caught 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:42.190
 we repeat the operation with him with the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:44.170
 another row of pearls and once you've 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.440
 we have them well insured we are going to 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:53.260
 pass them under the ponytail so that 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:58.810
 are hidden below we are going to 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.130
 split the pigtail into two halves we are 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.650
 each half on one shoulder we go to 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.880
 start working with this first 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:12.010
 let's brush it so it's very 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:13.750
 well untangled and now we're going to 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.190
 use the technique of the pigtail cord 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.990
 braid or cord and I taught in the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.220
 latest video blog about hairstyles that is 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.950
 what you have to do first we are going to 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.310
 start turning this hair chin 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.310
 outside 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.140
 and then we're going to roll it up with 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.760
 the row of pearls in the sense 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:45.060
 otherwise , we would do 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:47.250
 inside when we get to the extreme what 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.230
 we make sure with an elastic rubber band I have 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.129
 used these that are transparent and 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.129
 a little more discreet 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.340
 we repeat the same operation but with the 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.340
 lock we have left 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.110
 once we have it, we are going to 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.489
 use this inn as if it were a 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:38.140
 headband and let's secure it with 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:40.420
 hairpins now I'm going to use two 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.220
 good little pieces of pearl necklace that 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.049
 I have left over a gumdrops and a 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.269
 hairpins to create an ornament with the 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.099
 that covering the rack is very easy 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.260
 The only thing we have to do is to tie the 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.000
 ends of the letters of pearls with the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.269
 gummies and then hook there the 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.269
 Forks 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.920
 or not 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.270
 and now we are going to place this little 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.780
 pin that we have manufactured covering the 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.780
 coletero 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:18.969
 well as you can see the result is a 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.710
 very romantic semi-caught very fast and 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:22.900
 easy to do and for which you can 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.129
 use any element either good 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.229
 comes more 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.610
 some beads a fake pearls like 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.379
 what I used or can you use 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.569
 also some valance of flowers 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.009
