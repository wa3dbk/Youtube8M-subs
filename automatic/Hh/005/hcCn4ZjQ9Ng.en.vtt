00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
something like that it could really

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.110 
something like that it could really
change<00:00:58.079> between<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.070> friday<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.460> say<00:01:00.090> for

as<00:05:06.240> well<00:05:06.390> I<00:05:06.570> think<00:05:06.840> that'd<00:05:06.960> be<00:05:07.140> so<00:05:07.530> good<00:05:07.950> the

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
as well I think that'd be so good the

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.170 
as well I think that'd be so good the
link<00:05:08.520> our<00:05:08.640> player<00:05:08.790> could<00:05:08.970> have<00:05:09.060> would<00:05:09.120> be

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
link our player could have would be

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.430 
link our player could have would be
great<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.750> great<00:05:09.900> thing<00:05:09.930> about<00:05:10.140> Remy

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
great and the great thing about Remy

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.200 
great and the great thing about Remy
he's<00:05:11.250> although<00:05:11.520> he<00:05:11.610> adds<00:05:11.760> the<00:05:11.880> pace<00:05:12.090> and

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
he's although he adds the pace and

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.910 
he's although he adds the pace and
efficient<00:05:12.630> if<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.290> were<00:05:13.410> if<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:13.710> were<00:05:13.740> to

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
efficient if I were if you were to

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.590 
efficient if I were if you were to
direct<00:05:14.250> swap<00:05:14.370> him<00:05:14.580> out<00:05:14.670> for<00:05:14.730> ooh<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.240> wouldn't

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
direct swap him out for ooh it wouldn't

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.810 
direct swap him out for ooh it wouldn't
change<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:16.080> way<00:05:16.200> the<00:05:16.380> squad<00:05:16.620> plays<00:05:16.890> or<00:05:17.100> that

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
change the way the squad plays or that

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.660 
change the way the squad plays or that
much<00:05:18.060> because<00:05:19.160> Remy's<00:05:20.160> great<00:05:20.340> in<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.490> air<00:05:20.580> as

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
much because Remy's great in the air as

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.920 
much because Remy's great in the air as
well<00:05:20.820> so<00:05:20.940> you<00:05:21.000> can<00:05:21.060> use<00:05:21.390> them<00:05:21.510> as<00:05:21.570> a<00:05:21.630> bit<00:05:21.810> of<00:05:21.870> a

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
well so you can use them as a bit of a

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.080 
well so you can use them as a bit of a
target<00:05:22.170> man<00:05:22.380> so<00:05:22.650> this<00:05:23.130> is<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.400> team<00:05:23.580> I<00:05:23.610> feel

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
target man so this is the team I feel

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.090 
target man so this is the team I feel
that<00:05:24.210> it<00:05:24.360> could<00:05:24.570> be<00:05:24.600> most<00:05:24.960> likely<00:05:25.080> next<00:05:25.620> season

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
that it could be most likely next season

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.470 
that it could be most likely next season
out<00:05:26.280> of<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.460> ones<00:05:26.640> and<00:05:26.790> i'll<00:05:26.850> put<00:05:27.030> Remy<00:05:27.270> and

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
out of the ones and i'll put Remy and

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.300 
out of the ones and i'll put Remy and
veil<00:05:27.690> on<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.990> bench<00:05:28.260> could<00:05:28.560> be<00:05:28.650> possibly<00:05:29.070> that

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
veil on the bench could be possibly that

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.490 
veil on the bench could be possibly that
maybe<00:05:29.550> Remy<00:05:29.850> or<00:05:30.060> via<00:05:30.210> do<00:05:30.510> join<00:05:30.810> but<00:05:31.140> this<00:05:31.350> is

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
maybe Remy or via do join but this is

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.380 
maybe Remy or via do join but this is
what<00:05:31.620> I've<00:05:31.710> settled<00:05:31.980> with<00:05:32.220> for<00:05:32.610> now<00:05:32.850> I<00:05:32.880> do<00:05:33.090> also

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
what I've settled with for now I do also

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.420 
what I've settled with for now I do also
want<00:05:33.570> to<00:05:33.690> preface<00:05:33.870> this<00:05:34.020> by<00:05:34.170> saying<00:05:34.320> and<00:05:34.980> it's

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
want to preface this by saying and it's

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.830 
want to preface this by saying and it's
very<00:05:35.670> likely<00:05:35.940> it<00:05:36.120> will<00:05:36.180> change<00:05:36.390> between<00:05:36.600> now

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
very likely it will change between now

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.330 
very likely it will change between now
and<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.470> end<00:05:37.500> of<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.710> window<00:05:37.950> there's<00:05:38.130> two

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
and the end of the window there's two

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.680 
and the end of the window there's two
months<00:05:38.640> left<00:05:38.760> to<00:05:38.910> go<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.060> I'm<00:05:39.210> sure<00:05:39.360> vengas

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
months left to go and I'm sure vengas

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.120 
months left to go and I'm sure vengas
got<00:05:39.840> loads<00:05:40.050> of<00:05:40.170> people<00:05:40.290> hidden<00:05:40.680> up<00:05:40.770> his<00:05:40.860> sleeve

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
got loads of people hidden up his sleeve

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.500

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
that may be it one and we probably

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.270 
that may be it one and we probably
excuse<00:05:43.230> me<00:05:43.350> we'll<00:05:43.500> probably<00:05:43.680> end<00:05:43.800> this<00:05:43.980> window

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
excuse me we'll probably end this window

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.040 
excuse me we'll probably end this window
