skill<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:15.799> will<00:01:16.070> bring<00:01:16.189> me<00:01:16.369> up<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.490> one<00:01:16.759> point

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939

nine<00:01:17.060> eight<00:01:17.509> mil<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.950> it's<00:01:19.310> almost<00:01:19.460> 2<00:01:19.759> ml<00:01:19.909> range

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
nine eight mil so it's almost 2 ml range

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.990 
nine eight mil so it's almost 2 ml range
not<00:01:21.110> quite<00:01:21.350> there<00:01:21.530> for<00:01:21.680> this<00:01:21.799> video<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:22.310> it'll
