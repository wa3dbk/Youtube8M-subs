00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.080
 in the 1950s and most of the 60 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:10.390
 diabetes was not a problem 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.700
 important at that time all the 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.860
 focus was on dealing with 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.260
 diseases that were considered more 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.619
 important as polio and 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.600
 tuberculosis diabetes was thought more 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.119
 in the context of the need for 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.670
 reduce sugar in coffee and not as 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.580
 a serious threat in your sight or even to 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.520
 life unfortunately that is 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.739
 It changed in recent years is no longer 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.020
 exaggerated to say that diabetes is 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.960
 reaching epidemic levels in the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.360
 majority of the western world according to 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.030
 American diabetes association there is more 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.390
 of 20 million diabetics only in 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.120
 America with the astonishing one-third figure 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.760
 undiagnosed and things do not stop 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.719
 there but they paint to get a lot 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.559
 worse since another 41 million 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.890
 Americans are already showing 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.989
 pre-diabetic signs sadly the 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.090
 diabetes is already the first cause of 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.399
 blindness in the usa 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.079
 it is surprising that the professionals of 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.420
 the attention of the vision are 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.460
 predicting a devastating increase in the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.289
 loss of vision as part of the 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.679
 Diabetes epidemic grows so 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.899
 alarming at the moment there is no 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.840
 magic pill to eliminate the risk 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.270
 of diabetic eye injuries but it 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.789
 can do two important things for 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.670
 help prevent complications more 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.009
 serious the little sugar control in the 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.369
 blood is one of the main causes 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.709
 of severe diabetic retinopathy 1 the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.079
 first critical step is to ensure 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.969
 stability and control of your sugar in the 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:50.049
 blood with a healthy diet and 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:52.750
 regular exercise 2 the second step is 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.329
 make sure you have an annual review of 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.879
 diabetic eye a care professional 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:00.219
 of the experienced eye can pick up 

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:02.679
 subtle ocular changes before 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.689
 notice any change in vision and what 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.969
 more important with enough time 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.860
 to do something to prevent 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.020
 consequences 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.210
 If you or someone in your family is 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.730
 affected by this growing wave of 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.730
 diabetes tide acts now for 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.960
 reduce the risk of vision loss 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.960
 do not be a victim anymore
