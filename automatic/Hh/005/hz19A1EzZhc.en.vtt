 hello to all fans of android games with you 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.780
 there was a gamer and you wonâ€™t believe what 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.630
 the game came out on android this is limbo all 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.990
 famous toy that has already visited 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.900
 on all platforms including 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.630
 ah os on ios she helped out a year ago 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.740
 perhaps now her turn has come to 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.700
 android we can jump here 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.800
 can interact with things here 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.100
 and move proper side to side 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.140
 I turned on the touch display itself 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.440
 so you can see that I really 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.920
 I play on the touch device and not on 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.730
 what we are on is not on the computer but in fact 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.920
 In fact, this is a kind of puzzle platformer with 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.070
 elements of survival or something and a game 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.539
 designed by the danish studio she became 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.159
 very popular after the x-box 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.430
 so that's what this thing is I don't even know 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.810
 let's jump on it and I started here 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:17.670
 a little bit of play that's actually so 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.790
 what about this game but like it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.619
 I am the way I did not play on the computer 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.409
 playstation didn't play on and on 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.579
 playstation 3 was coming out on idle tires 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.650
 Vito and in general on many platforms and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.640
 on i don't know need to drag this 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:40.140
 trap somewhere that it was possible so 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.939
 say jump on that yes yes yes I am 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.259
 I understand what to do here, see 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:51.000
 everything turns out to be very easy to take 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.770
 actually here is this trap tass ni 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.439
 that is, we tap on the screen 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:01.110
 We interact with objects and svaypom 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:05.720
 on our character jumps actually here 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.399
 Okay, try not to torture try again 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.410
 check points here are many and you will 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.160
 here the graphics are always saved as 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.420

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.250
