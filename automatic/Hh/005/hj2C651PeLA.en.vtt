00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:15.659
 ferraresi is a cryptographic system which consists of putting 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.009
 available and available to any pilot combinations of figures 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.170
 arts with their desired mixed difficulty coefficients 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.019
 liliana and propositiva miles of hope 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.960
 as the aeronautical technical development of pilots and three furtive airplanes this 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.579
 list of figures that is designed not to remain static in case it did 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.749
 missing pop figures complete gangs and their coefficients corresponds 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.370
 with the creation of this system it has been possible to achieve a criterion unit 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.780
 at international level among all the judges pilots and fans to the world 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.750
 aero batista 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.440
 in relation to the proper name of the figures and thus graphic representation 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.690
 to its sorting by families and its valuation 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.700
 for all this since 1961 the federation bring a unique international Rafael 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.010
 officially adopted this system 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.140
 It was created by the Spanish Jose Luis Walls Clickair Libre 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.619
 once again the spirits if we go with that know the plane 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.140
 in him the cap the peperos the first piece is the thorny 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.920
 in the previous poor 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.240
 pure 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.140
 the central part the heart of the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.210
 of the propellers this plane has a three blade propeller since 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.659
 has a motor of jesus horses motor chassis very large to have 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:45.780
 only two shovels 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.270
 the landing gear 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.410
 this train that the sky already go p tail skate this is the cabril you're 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.990
 this is from weakness fiber there some cavendish from the htc-highroad of 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.630
 coal but this kind of fiberglass and is the one that covers the engine 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.569
 then we have the wings this room are special for croatia 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.320
 are carbon fiber this is the material that has and there is a life that goes 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.430
 from end to end of the law is one piece not like most aircraft 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.120
 where life is screwed with a pair of legs to the fuselage of the plane 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.399
 this is one 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:25.669
 yes not this nothing else have spoilers that hold description for one and 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.819
 other side that are quite long 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.309
 the tree of 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.469
 in a normal year 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.079
 valerón occupies a very small fraction of the restructuring ones and 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.190
 others not fools 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.189
 the feature this aircraft 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.190
 an impressive rotation speed 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.070
 can rotate 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.949
 four hundred twenty degrees cough 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:44.170
 it's awesome 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.880
 and civilians the bottom 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.369
 There are about two pieces two pallets 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:50.789
 wicker and call them 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:53.569
 these are made are stuck 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:54.849
 to the spoiler 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.629
 many are two on each side 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.120
 and what they do is 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.959
 help us once the pilot is defeating the spoiler hits the air 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.909
 and then it helps that fiction will be faster than the plane 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.180
 I rotated on one side faster theme more rotation speed and controls 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.519
 be softer that's a 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.719
 a device 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.349
 observational 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.569
 what is a guide 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.909
 for the pilot one is in the cabin 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.290
 and when they start doing the maneuvers we always have to see out there 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.669
 we are nailing it we work visual flight instruments 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.299
 then in competition we always have three ground angles which is the line 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.219
 horizontal 45 degrees and vertical 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.259
 and this one these bars do not serve as a guide 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.349
 when we reach the lines in such a way that if I want to make a sauce 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.889
 of 45 degrees this bar here 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.699
 it has to go parallel to the horizon and when they go vertical line this bar 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:45.109
 of actress 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.199
 goes for the rose although for that we 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.260
 and written is also a very useful instrument because when this time the 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.649
 airplane in a vertical flight up 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:58.819
 When you are losing speed there came a time when the good did not advance and in 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.509
 piece fall but the pilot does not notice one does not feel if it is going up and 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.510
 going down because it does not have a reference by 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.390
 palleiros starts to be watered down that yes we are already reaching the one of the 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.000
 poets at the speed p 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.910
 vertical 0 and when it goes upwards yes yes that the villa is uncovering 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.590
 and because it's necessary because to maneuver the tail drops percent 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.010
 it is important to keep the square wings doing well and of the ari test and if 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.160
 it starts to fall a wing you have to correct with pear now the pedal well 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.330
 of corrections 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.039
 I said the exposed nadal if one goes if seeing obama downside estimated to know 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.720
 if the plane is climbing uphill 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.949
 and this instrument 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.580
 allows us to do is 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.500
 and then they have the fixed part 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.159
 of the horizontal stabilizer and the moving part 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:43.450
 this serves to make the plane go up or down 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.729
 finally here we have the helm 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.039
 this test the rudder is also balsa wood this heading 10 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.860
 It is very light 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.860
 what it is to move is it does not weigh almost 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:08.549
 elisabeth debrosse of the type of maneuvers that is carried out as it is called 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.289
 from what they consist 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.740
 piraí like the music that there is a whole way how to squeeze the panacea 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.289
 an approval of it 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.289
 formed like this 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.719
 and there is a catalog 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.740
 daghestan 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.770
 with combination that supposes that there 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.560
 600 options for example 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.290
 a barrel can be a complete turn at this time because in several points 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.319
 that is, the infected 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.110
 you pause 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.689
 then in a barrel of four points 90 degrees 82 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.229
 and you can do a dental cleaning 45 degrees ascending or descendant ical 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.860
 climbing down and then families come in circles and clubs 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.360
 what cost 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.190
 private 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.889
 the barrel of the control points 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.080
 together the sinaproc 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.419
 in short there are many 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.419
 they are all in the catalog 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:12.819
 I have been 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.240

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:24.150
