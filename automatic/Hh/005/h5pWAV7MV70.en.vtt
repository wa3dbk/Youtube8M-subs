like<00:00:25.250> 30<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.400> think<00:00:26.640> was<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.119> number<00:00:27.449> I'm<00:00:27.660> not

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
sure maybe it's unlimited or like maybe

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.220 
sure maybe it's unlimited or like maybe
it<00:00:29.880> doesn't<00:00:30.029> stop<00:00:30.359> until<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.779> finish<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.140> my

about 80% of the game I guess art like
fire<00:02:41.189> resistance<00:02:41.879> will<00:02:42.120> help<00:02:42.450> for<00:02:43.139> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
fire resistance will help for the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.770 
fire resistance will help for the
occasional<00:02:43.769> fire<00:02:44.099> person<00:02:44.730> but<00:02:45.000> fire

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
occasional fire person but fire

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.379 
occasional fire person but fire
resistance<00:02:46.260> will<00:02:46.620> be<00:02:46.650> as<00:02:46.859> useful<00:02:47.099> as<00:02:47.489> shock

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
resistance will be as useful as shock

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.240 
resistance will be as useful as shock
resistance<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.169> ice<00:02:49.290> resistance<00:02:49.889> by<00:02:50.040> then

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
resistance and ice resistance by then

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.580 
resistance and ice resistance by then
because<00:02:50.669> in<00:02:51.120> frost<00:02:51.750> resistance<00:02:52.290> by<00:02:52.409> then

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
because in frost resistance by then

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.949 
because in frost resistance by then
because<00:02:52.950> uh<00:02:53.239> it's<00:02:54.239> just<00:02:54.419> pretty<00:02:54.569> much<00:02:54.750> random

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
because uh it's just pretty much random

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.190 
because uh it's just pretty much random

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.949 
fall but they don't for some reason I
don't<00:03:45.000> know<00:03:45.180> if<00:03:45.239> it's<00:03:45.359> because<00:03:45.509> I'm<00:03:45.720> on<00:03:45.870> the

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
don't know if it's because I'm on the

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.319 
don't know if it's because I'm on the
computer<00:03:46.139> but<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.949> don't<00:03:47.759> know<00:03:47.849> their<00:03:48.030> actions

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
computer but I don't know their actions

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.619 
computer but I don't know their actions
don't<00:03:48.449> fall<00:03:48.689> there<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:50.389> it's<00:03:51.389> kind<00:03:51.449> of

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
don't fall there so it's kind of

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.039 
don't fall there so it's kind of

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
different now

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.879

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
when rocks do fall then you're gonna

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.619 
when rocks do fall then you're gonna

now those things that you just saw in

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.640 
now those things that you just saw in
the<00:05:19.680> background<00:05:20.120> like<00:05:21.120> fly<00:05:21.510> up<00:05:21.690> those<00:05:21.960> if<00:05:22.380> you

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
the background like fly up those if you

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.070 
the background like fly up those if you
stand<00:05:22.979> too<00:05:23.070> close<00:05:23.160> they'll<00:05:23.610> blow<00:05:24.150> up<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:24.690> do

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
stand too close they'll blow up and do

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.439 
stand too close they'll blow up and do
tons<00:05:25.560> of<00:05:25.889> damage<00:05:26.070> and<00:05:26.460> sometimes<00:05:26.639> even<00:05:26.940> poison

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
tons of damage and sometimes even poison

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.620 
tons of damage and sometimes even poison
you<00:05:27.570> so<00:05:28.320> avoid<00:05:28.680> them<00:05:28.889> at<00:05:29.190> all<00:05:29.250> costs<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.330> there

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
you so avoid them at all costs and there

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.450 
you so avoid them at all costs and there
are<00:05:30.780> some<00:05:31.169> gates<00:05:31.409> where<00:05:31.680> you<00:05:31.740> can't<00:05:32.130> avoid

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
are some gates where you can't avoid

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.279 
are some gates where you can't avoid
them<00:05:32.699> so<00:05:33.449> you're<00:05:33.570> just<00:05:33.690> kind<00:05:33.840> of<00:05:33.960> its<00:05:34.080> kind<00:05:34.139> of

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
them so you're just kind of its kind of
