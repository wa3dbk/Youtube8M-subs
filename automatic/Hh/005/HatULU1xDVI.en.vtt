00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:14.769
 Hello I am vain and that is the new steering wheel for the car of 2008 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.409
 differs quite clearly from last year 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:21.070
 because this year's own electronics drive electronics and accordingly 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.400
 alone has been given as well as the display here 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.939
 Ras so have steering wheels to build all the cars on board 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.089
 because you are in the middle of the largest target then display the above are the 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:35.540
 Ships space and left and right you can see various parameters 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.560
 then we have six lights on the left side 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.320
 are the Fili 10 where then was percent yellow-red and blue 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.830
 And that fits the same what you also at the track as in the form of fans 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.790
 is therefore at red from where GAL 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.050
 Hopefully, the old woman on the Basel track can also overtake her 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.890
 not such a year 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.670
 then we have the upper right 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.730
 two scarce which are very important are also the authors steering wheel 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.530
 Marschlandschaft 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.270
 Yellow for Pique steers Speed ​​Limiter because the speed is throttled in the 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.220
 Race also 60 and 80 grams Haubner pit lane 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.910
 left the neutral button 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.150
 because we can not just sign in idle 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.770
 fulfill 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.110
 still of use 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.440
 otherwise use because the pedals next to Grabsch 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.590
 right to upshift 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.290
 shape on the left and below 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.890
 respectively, the clutch on both sides right that the classic programs yet 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.630
 some 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.440
 Adjustment Office on the steering wheel 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.800
 around here the pants are all sausages club year 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.330
 of course, too, he has found a lot changed with a cell 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.380
 we do not have traction control anymore, the differential will not work either 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.170
 so cleverly controlled in the past 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.499
 from then on it was only a little bit at the moment 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:48.950
 learn to have water parameters and finally you can continue with the 

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:49.799
 Boost the ride
