separatist<00:03:21.450> void<00:03:21.630> okay<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.380> think<00:03:22.650> suppression

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
separatist void okay I think suppression

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.890 
separatist void okay I think suppression
bonds<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.550> clearly<00:03:24.330> better<00:03:24.570> than<00:03:24.690> some

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
bonds is clearly better than some

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.630 
bonds is clearly better than some
participation<00:03:25.380> okay<00:03:25.710> it's<00:03:25.950> just<00:03:26.130> super

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
participation okay it's just super

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.430 
participation okay it's just super
strong<00:03:26.880> in<00:03:27.000> this<00:03:27.060> format<00:03:27.450> deals<00:03:27.990> with<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.350> many

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440

very<00:03:38.310> nice<00:03:38.520> I<00:03:38.760> agree<00:03:39.000> with<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.240> a<00:03:39.270> hundred

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
very nice I agree with you a hundred

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.880 
very nice I agree with you a hundred
percent<00:03:39.570> also<00:03:40.110> i<00:03:40.140> think<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.470> suppression

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
percent also i think the suppression

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.380 
percent also i think the suppression
bounce<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.550> a<00:03:41.580> much<00:03:41.760> better<00:03:41.790> color<00:03:42.300> than

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
bounce is in a much better color than

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.270 
bounce is in a much better color than
blue<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.080> format<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.710> think<00:03:44.100> White's

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
blue in this format I think White's

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.280 
blue in this format I think White's
probably<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.850> best<00:03:45.030> color<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:45.510> it's

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
probably the best color and it's

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.870 
probably the best color and it's
certainly<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.590> cleanest<00:03:47.220> it's<00:03:47.550> one<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.790> the

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
certainly the cleanest it's one of the

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.610 
certainly the cleanest it's one of the
cleanest<00:03:48.090> also<00:03:48.570> suppression<00:03:49.200> bonds<00:03:49.470> is

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
cleanest also suppression bonds is

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.710

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
if they kill your feature you've got

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.200 
if they kill your feature you've got
another<00:04:46.889> one<00:04:47.100> it<00:04:47.520> can<00:04:47.669> also<00:04:47.730> act<00:04:48.060> as<00:04:48.150> a

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
another one it can also act as a

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.820 
another one it can also act as a
finisher<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:48.810> an<00:04:48.870> aggressive<00:04:49.320> deck<00:04:49.500> even<00:04:49.650> if

you have a bunch of small creatures you

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.790 
you have a bunch of small creatures you

don't really know where your back app is

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.940 
don't really know where your back app is
going<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:57.630> be<00:04:57.840> at<00:04:58.020> in<00:04:58.260> this<00:04:58.380> turn<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.740> there's

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
going to be at in this turn and there's

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.560 
going to be at in this turn and there's
like<00:04:59.550> if<00:04:59.730> you're<00:04:59.820> playing<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.090> control<00:05:00.419> that

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
like if you're playing to control that

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.240 
like if you're playing to control that
gross<00:05:00.780> message<00:05:01.169> to<00:05:01.290> plummet<00:05:01.710> in<00:05:01.860> value<00:05:01.890> you

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
gross message to plummet in value you

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.980 
gross message to plummet in value you
don't<00:05:02.400> want<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.610> a<00:05:02.669> draw<00:05:02.850> and<00:05:03.090> so<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:03.960> don't

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
don't want it a draw and so you don't

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.390 
don't want it a draw and so you don't
want<00:05:04.200> to<00:05:04.260> take<00:05:04.380> it<00:05:04.410> this<00:05:04.560> early<00:05:04.740> but<00:05:04.919> you<00:05:05.310> know

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
want to take it this early but you know

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.400 
want to take it this early but you know
if<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:05.550> pick<00:05:05.700> one<00:05:05.850> up<00:05:05.970> mid<00:05:06.419> to<00:05:06.570> late<00:05:06.720> pack<00:05:06.990> sure

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
if you pick one up mid to late pack sure

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.140 
if you pick one up mid to late pack sure
exactly<00:05:08.160> i<00:05:08.220> think<00:05:08.400> it's<00:05:08.490> great<00:05:08.610> later<00:05:08.910> in<00:05:09.060> the

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
exactly i think it's great later in the

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.850 
exactly i think it's great later in the
pack<00:05:09.330> or<00:05:09.600> maybe<00:05:09.960> even<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.260> second<00:05:10.500> pack<00:05:10.620> third

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
pack or maybe even the second pack third

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.010 
pack or maybe even the second pack third
back<00:05:11.040> but<00:05:11.250> first<00:05:11.430> pack<00:05:11.820> pick<00:05:12.510> one<00:05:12.660> pack<00:05:12.840> one

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
back but first pack pick one pack one

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.360 
back but first pack pick one pack one

so<00:05:30.020> don't<00:05:31.020> read<00:05:31.229> the<00:05:31.350> cast<00:05:31.590> though<00:05:31.860> I<00:05:32.070> mean<00:05:32.370> I

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
so don't read the cast though I mean I

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.830 
so don't read the cast though I mean I
just<00:05:32.490> jamming<00:05:33.030> this<00:05:33.120> over<00:05:33.300> anything<00:05:33.450> else<00:05:33.600> I

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
just jamming this over anything else I

just jamming this over anything else I
think<00:05:34.110> that's<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:35.010> think<00:05:35.460> a<00:05:35.700> see<00:05:35.760> a<00:05:35.910> chance<00:05:36.180> to

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
think that's I think a see a chance to

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.520 
think that's I think a see a chance to
play<00:05:36.570> with<00:05:37.140> his<00:05:37.320> card<00:05:37.650> one<00:05:38.010> time<00:05:39.140> but<00:05:40.140> I<00:05:40.200> was

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
play with his card one time but I was

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.950 
play with his card one time but I was
sufficiently<00:05:41.160> yeah<00:05:41.669> this<00:05:41.970> card<00:05:42.390> really

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
sufficiently yeah this card really

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.400 
sufficiently yeah this card really
performed<00:05:43.830> genres<00:05:44.340> great<00:05:44.610> i<00:05:45.300> would<00:05:46.200> take

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
performed genres great i would take

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.230 
performed genres great i would take
shaundra<00:05:46.890> over<00:05:47.190> suppression<00:05:47.789> bonds<00:05:47.970> out<00:05:48.150> of

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
shaundra over suppression bonds out of

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.270 
shaundra over suppression bonds out of
this<00:05:48.330> pack<00:05:48.570> I<00:05:48.750> think<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.169> ceiling<00:05:49.740> on

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
this pack I think the ceiling on

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.930 
this pack I think the ceiling on
suppression<00:05:50.760> bonds<00:05:51.330> is<00:05:51.479> pretty<00:05:52.320> high<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:53.160> the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
suppression bonds is pretty high and the

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.880 
suppression bonds is pretty high and the
floor<00:05:54.270> is<00:05:54.600> also<00:05:54.990> pretty<00:05:55.169> high<00:05:55.410> like<00:05:55.620> you<00:05:55.740> know

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
floor is also pretty high like you know

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.950 
floor is also pretty high like you know
