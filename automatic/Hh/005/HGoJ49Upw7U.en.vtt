00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.270
 and greet everyone knows what has 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.620
 failed at the fish when that happens we are 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.689
 sure board and we are here for you 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.700
 explain a little really nice thing 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.160
 for rhdp really quickly I do not 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.090
 do not think it was planned in the game 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.150
 in any case not in this way 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.810
 and so therefore this is first step 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.550
 what to do is that 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.129
 they must already have two 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.250
 players on on a server it takes 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.449
 obviously that is one that works 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.120
 although they go to make a boss 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.570
 so a boss who will be his dance is full 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.770
 like this so the here a troll be 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.809
 that you go when I go to you 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.100
 show right away go fight a 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.690
 post in a castle or something 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.320
 like that so you go the pictures of the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.489
 castle and another player so that 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.809
 can you be if you have a very good 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.190
 pc you can connect under a 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.239
 another person on the same server is 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.470
 someone else so there is passing 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.409
 not who you are here you have you have this 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.740
 which is authentic his point which is in the 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.960
 early village is more convenient and 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.409
 who went to a building yen I 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.390
 show you that right now 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.390
 so we end up on my sight then 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.390
 for reese is the map it takes if you have to 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.990
 go to a building with marked on 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:33.820
 a sign 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:35.950
 hiên so we go inside and he 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.850
 just have to talk to someone who has 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.350
 surrounded by four tables we talk to him about it 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.130
 makes a weird sound and actually 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.619
 risette the map 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.390
 if you have seen the weather up at 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.979
 right were reset 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:56.159
 but the modes the bumps and others have 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:58.509
 have reappeared on the map 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:03.009
 finally the time was given at 7 o'clock 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:05.740
 morning for a clown that's all 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.170
 salvageable objects such as pineapple 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.980
 or the pumpkins were also handed 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.950
 here and here we are 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.240
 and so now that you have that 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.790
 there is one who is in the building signed 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.450
 nm and that the other has found a boss so 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.090
 there we came back on the troll in the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.940
 plain then it must be said to beat 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.130
 the bosses we see in nature 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.840
 it is necessary for more ease at least 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.260
 to be at the level 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.670
 about 25 or even 30 that's 25 or even 20 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.980
 we can do it but it's a little bit of them 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.019
 a little hard but from the label 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.299
 25 or even 30 you can easily you 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.480
 to excess and show you 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.120
 that it really works really well 60 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.560
 years to hula a man in his honor did 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.190
 more taste rate of the blow I can more 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.959
 mount on 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.060
 he spends his time writing a mage 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.650
 level 1 and you'll see it's okay 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.110
 to go quickly his xp once I 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.110
 tron rule so we will attack prime 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.010
 here they are so suddenly we could 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.629
 see that points his point that 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.660
 personally I passed a level 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.760
 while I was innocent anyway 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.410
 I spent a level and a half and that 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.700
 pan fish has gone from level 1 to 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.709
 level 6 so the xp that had to have 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.640
 personally my age I had a mage 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.620
 low I had a I but we have 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.510
 also tested I had a bow level on 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.680
 the server then when we started then 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.269
 pass them directly to level 8 so 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.519
 xp data is random 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.849
 it's according to the boss you 're mostly 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.930
 according to the boss you are or maybe I know 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.760
 not if it's number of players on the 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.739
 waiter it's possible it's possible 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.620
 it's in any case you can see that 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.769
 it can really well and now 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.019
 here is the usefulness of a clique 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.599
 people go to a store we go 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.930
 to say well here it is to solve the 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.639
 map 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.280
 I will play my card and when he goes 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.700
 finally support when he's going to talk or to the 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.130
 nobody 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.269
 it'll make a weird noise and 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.489
 here you can see that small 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.010
 so look here for potting soil and 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.359
 Dan Perlet it is a castle well is 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.460
 could see that the boss appeared in 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.979
 this castle is all bosses change 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.180
 finally there are a number of bosses 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.750
 who arrives on a map that 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.750
 change of page 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.110
 that bass and change places 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.990
 when he's like a fish in exit 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:42.460
 the sea ​​so asia still still so he 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.770
 must resist several times before 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.460
 to have a boss next I tell you stop 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.770
 stop 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.970
 ok that's good so there you can see 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.780
 that there is a boss next door so 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.840
 usually if you are in a 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.340
 plain like that where there's already been a boss 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.080
 it is possible it is very likely that 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.180
 when you generate the map 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.340
 there are other pop boschi next door or 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.740
 two or three of each is not 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.590
 huge 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.770
 and so here we will quickly redo the 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.640
 boss and you'll see that 60 years in 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.590
 the body pays very quickly so 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.840
 enjoy quickly ce2 ce2 this little 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.950
 this little trick because it 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.260
 would not surprise me that wall is the 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:24.460
 creator of the game realize this and the 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.730
 night yes that's it 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:32.890
 and for about level 100 past it takes 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.230
 spend about an hour or even a little 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.480
 more so we're going to do that I was 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.310
 level without there is now some 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.510
 level 30 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.760
 a little while ago and then if you 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.760
 really make it scream 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.130
 to pass 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.750
 I spent about a day see a day 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.310
 game show so it's pretty huge 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.880
 while there in an hour and a half you 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.220
 can spend 70 the 22 plus a day 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.139
 choose a day and where a day and a half 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.850
 out of the game yes here in games a 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.870
 day and a half hour of play since the 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.130
 exit the game play it every day shooting 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.380
 we see that it's past level nine 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.350
 here is past level nine and so too 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.270
 it's a little too finally because we're going 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.260
 t she can also enjoy the points 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.510
 from what could see that I 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.500
 really a lot of points everywhere and 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.500
 it's really practical 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.540
 here you can see it's 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.910
 really good and then that's the only thing 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.250
 it's just a pity it's that the 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.750
 stuff that bosses and in bumps 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.889
 like that huh not this in the dungeons 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.200
 but I think it's almost the same 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:53.590
 is that she does not need any spirit 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:56.490
 and all for guns and that's all there 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.990
 some who obviously right and that 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.030
 a dress of the stuff but not the beautiful ones 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.160
 that is not for you by 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.370
 example I talked about the stuff you that 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.930
 he was a boss from the first of 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.770
 first goal you mima drop and stuff 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.740
 power 14 months intruders 84 but I know 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.970
 not that it was he who had told me 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.820
 no666 I think it's good they drug 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.650
 dudus you're not great but still 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.930
 name but from time to time he drop 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.700
 as my staff says, we must remember a 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.910
 last thing is that also look 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:30.940
 but platinum we win is money 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:35.980
 which allows you to upgrade your 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:37.660
 weapons and your armor I think so 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.900
 just go to a bath in 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:42.730
 the tower in the frame around a city 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.020
 and then you can do it well 

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.220
 you win every time you 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.680
 kill a boss so there you can see 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:50.020
 that I have great rookie so not 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.580
 his bread also 42 platinum corner and me 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.380
 as well 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.300
 and then that was all enjoy well 

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.490
 of this trick and we find ourselves more 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.110
 late for a new tweet in sahara him 

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:03.480
 went on what Kraft foods 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.480
 subscribe and it's him
