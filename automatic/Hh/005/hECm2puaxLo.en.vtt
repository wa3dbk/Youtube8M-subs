00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.369 
measure for that today and we are ready
to<00:00:55.309> measure<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.239> first<00:00:56.570> we're<00:00:56.719> gonna<00:00:56.809> find<00:00:57.170> her

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
to measure so first we're gonna find her

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.979 
to measure so first we're gonna find her
withers<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.280> withers<00:00:58.640> are<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.270> top<00:00:59.750> of<00:00:59.899> the

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
withers the withers are the top of the

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.560 
withers the withers are the top of the
shoulder<00:01:00.320> blades<00:01:00.530> right<00:01:00.860> here<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:02.300> then

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
shoulder blades right here and then

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.420 
shoulder blades right here and then
right<00:01:02.870> behind<00:01:03.109> the<00:01:03.530> withers<00:01:03.829> you'll<00:01:04.129> find

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
right behind the withers you'll find

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.490 
right behind the withers you'll find
what<00:01:04.729> we<00:01:04.850> call<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.180> sweet<00:01:05.420> spot<00:01:05.780> it's<00:01:06.229> just

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
what we call the sweet spot it's just

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.200 
what we call the sweet spot it's just
behind<00:01:06.649> the<00:01:07.009> shoulder<00:01:07.310> blades<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:07.880> is<00:01:08.060> where

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
behind the shoulder blades this is where

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.399 
behind the shoulder blades this is where
the<00:01:08.300> harness<00:01:08.479> saddle<00:01:08.930> sits<00:01:09.970> alright<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.409> we're

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
the harness saddle sits alright so we're

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.719 
the harness saddle sits alright so we're
gonna<00:01:12.530> measure<00:01:12.740> from<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.130> floor<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.700> top

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
gonna measure from the floor to the top

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.300 
gonna measure from the floor to the top
of<00:01:14.030> her<00:01:14.150> withers<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.750> this<00:01:15.470> dog<00:01:15.710> happens<00:01:16.130> to

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
of her withers and this dog happens to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.539 
of her withers and this dog happens to
come<00:01:16.490> right<00:01:16.700> in<00:01:16.850> at<00:01:16.970> 22<00:01:17.450> inches<00:01:18.189> next<00:01:19.189> is<00:01:19.369> gonna

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
come right in at 22 inches next is gonna

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.950 
come right in at 22 inches next is gonna
be<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.790> girth<00:01:20.030> we're<00:01:20.330> gonna<00:01:20.450> reach<00:01:20.659> all<00:01:20.840> the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
be the girth we're gonna reach all the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.820 
be the girth we're gonna reach all the
way<00:01:21.049> around<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:22.640> deepest<00:01:23.210> part<00:01:23.540> of<00:01:23.659> her<00:01:23.930> chest

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
way around the deepest part of her chest

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.670 
way around the deepest part of her chest
here<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:26.000> want<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.299> set<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.350> measuring

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
here and you want to set the measuring

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.520 
here and you want to set the measuring
tape<00:01:27.860> so<00:01:28.100> it's<00:01:28.250> snug<00:01:28.460> enough<00:01:28.840> that<00:01:29.840> you're

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
tape so it's snug enough that you're

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.050 
tape so it's snug enough that you're
actually<00:01:30.680> measuring<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.130> dog<00:01:31.369> not<00:01:31.729> just<00:01:31.939> the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
actually measuring the dog not just the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.600 
actually measuring the dog not just the
fur<00:01:32.299> but<00:01:32.869> not<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:33.320> snug<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:33.710> you're<00:01:34.100> removing

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
fur but not so snug that you're removing

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.460 
fur but not so snug that you're removing
air<00:01:35.329> from<00:01:35.540> her<00:01:35.689> lungs<00:01:36.729> so<00:01:38.110> comfortably<00:01:39.110> snug

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
air from her lungs so comfortably snug

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.340 
air from her lungs so comfortably snug
and<00:01:39.799> she<00:01:39.950> comes<00:01:40.159> in<00:01:40.280> right<00:01:40.460> at<00:01:40.610> 28<00:01:40.790> inches<00:01:41.350> and

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
and she comes in right at 28 inches and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.880 
and she comes in right at 28 inches and
then<00:01:42.860> next<00:01:43.509> we're<00:01:44.509> gonna<00:01:44.600> measure<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.590> belly

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
then next we're gonna measure the belly

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.010 
then next we're gonna measure the belly
measurements<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.479> there's<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.720> little<00:01:47.869> bit

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
measurements so there's a little bit

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.660 
measurements so there's a little bit
tricky<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.500> find<00:01:48.829> you're<00:01:49.130> gonna<00:01:49.220> find<00:01:49.549> the

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
tricky to find you're gonna find the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.389 
tricky to find you're gonna find the
back<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:50.090> her<00:01:50.240> rib<00:01:50.420> cage<00:01:50.500> this<00:01:51.500> is<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.680> very<00:01:51.890> boxy

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
back of her rib cage this is a very boxy

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.630 
back of her rib cage this is a very boxy
dog<00:01:52.549> she's<00:01:52.820> very<00:01:53.000> square<00:01:54.070> so<00:01:55.070> she<00:01:55.189> doesn't

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
dog she's very square so she doesn't

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.090 
dog she's very square so she doesn't
have<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:55.790> very<00:01:56.060> defined<00:01:56.390> waistline<00:01:58.570> but<00:01:59.570> I<00:02:00.100> find

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
have a very defined waistline but I find

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.440 
have a very defined waistline but I find
the<00:02:01.159> easiest<00:02:01.189> way<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:01.640> do<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:01.969> is<00:02:02.149> put<00:02:02.329> the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
the easiest way to do this is put the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.660 
the easiest way to do this is put the
measuring<00:02:02.689> tape<00:02:02.930> back<00:02:03.200> here<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:04.340> you'll<00:02:04.490> kind

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
measuring tape back here and you'll kind

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.539 
measuring tape back here and you'll kind
