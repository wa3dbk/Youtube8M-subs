the<00:00:28.430> way<00:00:28.550> I<00:00:28.579> paint<00:00:28.989> so<00:00:29.989> for<00:00:30.380> this<00:00:30.529> tutorial<00:00:31.189> I'm

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
the way I paint so for this tutorial I'm

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.420 
the way I paint so for this tutorial I'm
going<00:00:31.790> to<00:00:31.880> use<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.140> Windsor<00:00:33.140> Newton<00:00:33.430> gloss

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
going to use a Windsor Newton gloss

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.619 
going to use a Windsor Newton gloss
varnish<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.450> this<00:00:36.290> is<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.500> spray<00:00:36.739> varnish

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
varnish and this is a spray varnish

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.630 
varnish and this is a spray varnish
sometimes<00:00:38.629> I<00:00:38.780> use<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.289> liquid<00:00:40.100> varnish<00:00:40.460> where

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
sometimes I use the liquid varnish where

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.610 
sometimes I use the liquid varnish where
you<00:00:40.730> brush<00:00:40.910> on<00:00:41.120> I<00:00:41.329> have<00:00:41.480> a<00:00:41.510> tutorial<00:00:41.780> I<00:00:42.440> will

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
you brush on I have a tutorial I will

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.150 
you brush on I have a tutorial I will
link<00:00:43.129> right<00:00:44.059> here<00:00:44.359> to<00:00:45.050> that<00:00:45.199> old<00:00:45.410> tutorial<00:00:45.920> I

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
link right here to that old tutorial I

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.630 
link right here to that old tutorial I
need<00:00:46.429> to<00:00:46.519> update<00:00:46.699> it<00:00:46.910> but<00:00:48.309> right<00:00:49.309> now<00:00:49.370> we're

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
need to update it but right now we're

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.520 
need to update it but right now we're
talking<00:00:49.879> about<00:00:50.000> straight<00:00:50.149> varnish<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:50.719> the

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
talking about straight varnish so the

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.990 
talking about straight varnish so the
reason<00:00:51.800> I'm<00:00:51.890> using<00:00:52.070> spray<00:00:52.370> varnish<00:00:52.579> on<00:00:52.820> this

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
reason I'm using spray varnish on this

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.729 
reason I'm using spray varnish on this
canvas<00:00:53.269> is<00:00:53.899> because<00:00:54.289> there's<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.559> lot<00:00:54.589> of

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
canvas is because there's a lot of

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.180 
canvas is because there's a lot of
texture<00:00:55.190> on<00:00:55.309> here<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:56.059> I<00:00:56.960> want<00:00:57.230> to<00:00:57.350> get<00:00:57.499> the

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
texture on here and I want to get the

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.470 
texture on here and I want to get the
varnish<00:00:58.550> all<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:58.910> way<00:00:58.999> around

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
varnish all the way around

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.779 
varnish all the way around
I<00:00:59.539> don't<00:00:59.749> want<00:00:59.899> it<00:01:00.019> glump<00:01:00.469> and<00:01:00.789> caught

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
I don't want it glump and caught

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.270 
I don't want it glump and caught
underneath<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.620> texture<00:01:03.620> as<00:01:03.859> you<00:01:04.070> get

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
underneath the texture as you get

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.170 
underneath the texture as you get
sometimes<00:01:04.550> with<00:01:05.380> liquid<00:01:06.380> varnish<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.180> spray

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
sometimes with liquid varnish so spray

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.870 
sometimes with liquid varnish so spray
varnish<00:01:08.390> applies<00:01:08.840> really<00:01:09.140> evenly<00:01:09.620> and<00:01:10.010> what

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
varnish applies really evenly and what

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.740 
varnish applies really evenly and what
you<00:01:11.000> want<00:01:11.210> is<00:01:11.390> your<00:01:11.780> painting<00:01:13.060> this<00:01:14.060> one<00:01:14.330> is<00:01:14.480> is

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
you want is your painting this one is is

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.650 
you want is your painting this one is is
for<00:01:15.410> oil<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.790> acrylic<00:01:18.400> so<00:01:19.400> it<00:01:20.300> works<00:01:20.510> either

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
for oil and acrylic so it works either

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.790 
for oil and acrylic so it works either
way<00:01:20.960> but<00:01:21.680> for<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:22.330> oil<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:24.230> want<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.530> let<00:01:24.650> your

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.570 
to six months preferably six months to a
year<00:01:32.170> before<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.500> actually<00:01:33.890> really<00:01:34.070> varnish

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
year before you actually really varnish

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.820 
year before you actually really varnish
it<00:01:34.760> and<00:01:34.970> what<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.720> varnish<00:01:35.990> will<00:01:36.140> do<00:01:36.290> is<00:01:36.500> it

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
it and what the varnish will do is it

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.070 
it and what the varnish will do is it
will<00:01:37.070> put<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.520> protective<00:01:38.090> coating<00:01:38.300> it<00:01:38.930> will

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
will put a protective coating it will

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.800 
will put a protective coating it will
unify<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.590> painting<00:01:40.070> in<00:01:40.250> most<00:01:41.090> cases<00:01:41.420> and

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
unify the painting in most cases and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.410 
unify the painting in most cases and
right<00:01:42.350> here<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.010> gloss<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:43.910> it<00:01:44.120> will<00:01:44.240> make

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
right here this is gloss so it will make

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
canvas and in both ways now just let it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.030 
canvas and in both ways now just let it
dry<00:03:10.290> for<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.860> couple<00:03:11.460> of<00:03:11.490> seconds<00:03:12.770> just<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:13.860> let

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
dry for a couple of seconds just to let

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.010 
dry for a couple of seconds just to let
it<00:03:14.660> absorb<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.230> even<00:03:16.500> out<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:18.020> ideally

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
it absorb and even out and ideally

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.070 
it absorb and even out and ideally
you're<00:03:19.200> supposed<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.730> wait<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:21.150> think<00:03:21.660> like<00:03:21.810> 10

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
you're supposed to wait I think like 10

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.400 
you're supposed to wait I think like 10
minutes<00:03:22.410> or<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.950> what<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.370> says<00:03:23.490> on<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.730> can

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
minutes or so is what it says on the can

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.720 
minutes or so is what it says on the can
but<00:03:25.410> for<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.160> purpose<00:03:26.520> of<00:03:26.640> this

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
but for the purpose of this

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.460 
but for the purpose of this
demonstration<00:03:26.940> I'm<00:03:27.690> not<00:03:27.930> going<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.140> do<00:03:28.260> that

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
demonstration I'm not going to do that
