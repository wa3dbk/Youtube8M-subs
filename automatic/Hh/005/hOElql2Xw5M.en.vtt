00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.260
 you a matter of today by force of 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.969
 yen for consoles 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.900
 enjoy the tips of a niece from a 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.930

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.300

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.360
 I'm adilson again with you 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.650
 right here on the river 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.360
 It's just a little bit there, everyone. 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.960
 we start from Jesus and take one thing 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.670
 huh 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.670
 only here the throat with her there right? 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:42.519
 hence the Copinha of who is the same 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.610
 Green Lantern bbb 10 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.589
 The idea is not even ten, I do not have 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.619
 now changed sides and now has 10 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:53.049
 is how is it 

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:54.309
 good staff online your new mascot 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:59.879
 Here I want to stay here. 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.629
 geraldo batman's work is good come on 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.020
 quickly 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:09.490
 and it's your view talking is all good that is 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.049
 wrong as though also that the delay 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.310
 But, do what 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.799
 is come to games and hdmi 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.980
 What's interesting is he has three 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.290
 hdmi inputs and an output that will do 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.870
 until the hdmi cable 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.870
 You will see here and this car and this 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.540
 other end you turn on the TV or the 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.380
 projector okay and that's where you were going by 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.380
 example a playstation 3 on that side 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.330
 xbox and side who have already watched our 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.550
 videos know is whose there until 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.020
 32min the new playstation 2 from mines only 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.540
 God tell me right there 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.450
 and then you, for example, nintendo will 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.610
 then you have three positive over such 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.530
 that party next to Kate in the post in 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.450
 because even if the road is not 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:06.580
 so this worksheet I hope so 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:12.519
 even the exchange of a select 3 xbox and wii 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:16.120
 ok since 3 xbox 360 and wii 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:19.239
 So, wherever you are, what kind are you? 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.690
 turn on the tv and everyone who has input 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.690
 It's not between box 3 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.510
 so I stopped two right then you go there 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.550
 take this car here and imagine xbox e 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.980
 playstation 3 connects and so it goes 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:38.490
 sending out calls 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:41.580
 So, whoever happens there is this 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.320
 This joke is good for preserving 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.270
 You have to be taking away the power that 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.320
 both the best net cars because 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.200
 damage 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.210
 this device here is a stop but 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.000
 had in the hall has a model ask for 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.910
 in this competition is better and only has three 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.790
 animals have a model with 45 up to eight 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.370
 ever seen right then depends on both discuss 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.530
 If you want to have some even since the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.010
 google remote is it that he has to take 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:18.810
 Send it to home, you're in an earthquake in the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:22.350
 haiti is interesting is that in brazil 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:27.020
 people searched 30 to 40 reais there are people 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.020
 asking for $ 50,000 seats here I think 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.310
 suck not 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.900
 so out there five dollars on the internet 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.739
 here in brazil you can buy cheaper 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.700
 20 reais you care more than 30 is 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.120
 suck not 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.209
 That's it. There's another thing, right? 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.959
 good just to see what she says quickly 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.610
 This is after the tournament did not return to 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.590

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.100
