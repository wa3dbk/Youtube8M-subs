box so let's see if the packaging is
good

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
good

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.530 
good
basically<00:02:08.940> sites<00:02:09.270> out<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.819> and<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.510> have

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
basically sites out like so and you have

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.300 
basically sites out like so and you have
the<00:02:12.750> box<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:15.090> box<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.420> magnetic<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.500> straps

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the box the box is magnetic so it straps

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.590 
the box the box is magnetic so it straps
open<00:02:17.850> like<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:19.910> there<00:02:20.910> are<00:02:21.000> your<00:02:21.090> content

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
open like so and there are your content

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.330 
open like so and there are your content
so<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.080> isn't<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.440> doesn't<00:02:22.709> packaged<00:02:23.100> as

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
so it isn't it doesn't packaged as

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.120 
so it isn't it doesn't packaged as
nicely<00:02:23.790> as<00:02:24.260> say<00:02:25.260> an<00:02:25.380> iPhone<00:02:25.800> it's<00:02:25.980> not

watch itself or the USB cable for the

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.200 
watch itself or the USB cable for the
watch<00:04:26.630> itself<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.880> it's<00:04:28.880> pretty<00:04:29.060> generic

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
watch itself and it's pretty generic

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.320 
watch itself and it's pretty generic
it's<00:04:29.660> just<00:04:30.020> a<00:04:30.970> actually<00:04:31.970> it<00:04:32.060> might<00:04:32.180> be<00:04:32.300> a

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
it's just a actually it might be a

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.960 
it's just a actually it might be a
proprietary<00:04:32.900> connection<00:04:33.290> pin<00:04:33.680> so<00:04:34.580> it<00:04:34.730> looks

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
proprietary connection pin so it looks

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.750 
proprietary connection pin so it looks
like<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.150> microUSB<00:04:35.570> but<00:04:36.200> maybe<00:04:36.440> it's<00:04:36.740> not<00:04:36.950> we'll

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
like a microUSB but maybe it's not we'll

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.330 
like a microUSB but maybe it's not we'll
have<00:04:37.790> to<00:04:38.000> find<00:04:38.210> out<00:04:38.530> connects<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.680> USB<00:04:39.890> 2.0

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
have to find out connects to a USB 2.0

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.720 
have to find out connects to a USB 2.0
port<00:04:40.370> and<00:04:41.800> of<00:04:42.800> course<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.160> last<00:04:43.310> thing<00:04:43.610> you

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
port and of course the last thing you

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.880 
port and of course the last thing you
have<00:04:43.880> is<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.180> wired<00:04:44.990> headset<00:04:45.470> in<00:04:45.590> case<00:04:45.770> you

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
have is a wired headset in case you

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.290 
have is a wired headset in case you
don't<00:04:46.100> want<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.310> use<00:04:46.430> bluetooth<00:04:46.760> you<00:04:47.060> can<00:04:47.090> use

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
don't want to use bluetooth you can use

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:54.180 
don't want to use bluetooth you can use
a<00:04:47.390> wired<00:04:47.630> headset<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:48.590> we'll<00:04:49.310> open<00:04:49.460> that<00:04:49.700> up

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.650 

it's<00:04:55.190> made<00:04:55.340> out<00:04:55.430> of<00:04:55.460> plastic<00:04:55.640> so<00:04:56.240> a<00:04:56.270> little<00:04:56.480> bit

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
it's made out of plastic so a little bit

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.200 
it's made out of plastic so a little bit
cheap<00:04:56.870> but<00:04:57.230> it<00:04:57.350> is<00:04:57.500> stereo<00:04:58.460> so<00:04:58.790> you<00:04:58.850> do<00:04:59.030> have

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
cheap but it is stereo so you do have

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.050 
cheap but it is stereo so you do have
two<00:04:59.510> heads<00:04:59.930> and<00:05:00.310> again<00:05:01.310> it<00:05:01.430> plugs<00:05:01.640> into<00:05:01.820> that

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
two heads and again it plugs into that

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.100 
two heads and again it plugs into that
semi<00:05:02.750> proprietary<00:05:03.670> USB<00:05:04.670> microUSB<00:05:05.300> like<00:05:05.750> port

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
semi proprietary USB microUSB like port

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.500 
semi proprietary USB microUSB like port
that<00:05:06.410> can<00:05:06.590> stick<00:05:06.860> into<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.070> phone<00:05:07.370> it<00:05:08.330> is<00:05:08.360> a

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
that can stick into the phone it is a

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.420 
that can stick into the phone it is a
little<00:05:08.690> bit<00:05:08.810> more<00:05:08.930> clumsy<00:05:09.230> than<00:05:09.440> up<00:05:10.010> using<00:05:10.280> a

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
little bit more clumsy than up using a

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.460 
little bit more clumsy than up using a
bluetooth<00:05:10.790> included<00:05:11.390> but<00:05:11.660> you<00:05:12.170> just<00:05:12.320> have<00:05:12.440> a

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
bluetooth included but you just have a

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.920 
bluetooth included but you just have a
talk<00:05:12.740> button<00:05:13.070> on<00:05:13.160> here<00:05:13.370> as<00:05:13.460> well<00:05:13.490> so<00:05:14.030> you<00:05:14.810> do

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
talk button on here as well so you do

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.210 
talk button on here as well so you do
get<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.080> option<00:05:15.500> in<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.680> box<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:17.950> finally<00:05:18.950> we

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
get the option in the box and finally we

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.620 
get the option in the box and finally we
also<00:05:19.250> have<00:05:19.520> an<00:05:19.610> instruction<00:05:20.120> manual<00:05:20.450> on<00:05:20.480> the

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
also have an instruction manual on the

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.960 
also have an instruction manual on the
inside<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.680> deepest<00:05:22.130> parts<00:05:22.520> of<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.700> right

the<00:05:28.730> watch<00:05:28.880> out<00:05:29.090> first<00:05:29.360> and<00:05:29.840> then<00:05:29.900> dump<00:05:30.770> this

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
the watch out first and then dump this
