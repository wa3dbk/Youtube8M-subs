just staring at my watch

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.750 
just staring at my watch
trying<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.709> figure<00:04:12.890> out<00:04:13.010> what<00:04:13.280> it<00:04:13.400> was<00:04:13.549> and

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
trying to figure out what it was and

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.190 
trying to figure out what it was and
that's<00:04:13.879> when<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.030> discovered<00:04:14.629> that<00:04:14.660> that<00:04:14.930> is

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
that's when I discovered that that is

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.319 
that's when I discovered that that is
the<00:04:15.530> detail<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.190> like<00:04:16.430> about<00:04:16.609> it<00:04:16.970> that<00:04:17.180> is

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
the detail that I like about it that is

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.710 
the detail that I like about it that is
what<00:04:17.359> really<00:04:18.820> made<00:04:19.820> it<00:04:20.030> that<00:04:20.209> is<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.419> cherry

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
what really made it that is the cherry

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.029 
what really made it that is the cherry
on<00:04:21.019> top

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
on top

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.860 
on top
for<00:04:22.729> me<00:04:22.880> on<00:04:23.150> this<00:04:23.389> watch<00:04:23.979> I've<00:04:24.979> taken<00:04:25.310> it

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
for me on this watch I've taken it

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.680 
for me on this watch I've taken it
snorkelling<00:04:26.870> several<00:04:27.860> times<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:29.510> Loom

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
snorkelling several times and the Loom

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.570 
snorkelling several times and the Loom
is<00:04:29.840> very<00:04:30.080> bright<00:04:30.320> on<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.560> water<00:04:32.590> it's<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.889> it's

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
is very bright on the water it's a it's

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.390 
is very bright on the water it's a it's
a<00:04:34.699> bit<00:04:34.850> heavier<00:04:35.240> than<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.970> Rolexes<00:04:39.400> maybe

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
a bit heavier than the Rolexes maybe

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.650 
a bit heavier than the Rolexes maybe
because<00:04:40.760> of<00:04:40.789> the<00:04:41.000> thicker<00:04:41.210> case<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:41.990> and<00:04:43.660> ETA

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
because of the thicker case and and ETA

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.629 
because of the thicker case and and ETA
or<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.169> air<00:04:45.349> movement<00:04:45.830> maybe<00:04:46.039> it's<00:04:46.310> heavier

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
or the air movement maybe it's heavier

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.120 
or the air movement maybe it's heavier
than<00:04:46.849> the<00:04:47.750> Rolexes<00:04:48.200> audit<00:04:48.590> or<00:04:48.800> at<00:04:48.889> least

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
than the Rolexes audit or at least

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.339 
than the Rolexes audit or at least
that's<00:04:49.520> what<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.820> seems<00:04:50.150> likes<00:04:50.389> to<00:04:50.630> me<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:51.200> is

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
that's what it seems likes to me that is

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.580 
that's what it seems likes to me that is
heavier<00:04:51.710> but<00:04:52.580> it's<00:04:53.090> definitely<00:04:53.360> better<00:04:54.229> made

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
heavier but it's definitely better made
