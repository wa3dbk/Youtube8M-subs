00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
you're going to do is turn this one

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.529 
you're going to do is turn this one
direction<00:04:36.919> or<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.370> other<00:04:39.669> and<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:41.240> way<00:04:41.330> this

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
direction or the other and the way this

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.629 
direction or the other and the way this
works<00:04:41.810> is<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.289> threads<00:04:42.560> on<00:04:42.800> this<00:04:43.010> side<00:04:43.280> our

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
works is the threads on this side our

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.580 
works is the threads on this side our
right-hand<00:04:44.270> threads<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.139> threads<00:04:45.440> on

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
right-hand threads and the threads on

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.830 
right-hand threads and the threads on
this<00:04:45.710> side<00:04:45.949> our<00:04:46.070> left-hand<00:04:46.370> threads<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.060> when

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
this side our left-hand threads and when

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.670 
this side our left-hand threads and when
you<00:04:47.930> turn<00:04:48.199> it<00:04:48.410> it<00:04:49.160> opens<00:04:50.150> it<00:04:50.330> or<00:04:50.510> closes<00:04:51.169> it<00:04:51.350> so

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
you turn it it opens it or closes it so

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.700 
you turn it it opens it or closes it so
basically<00:04:52.990> everything<00:04:53.990> else<00:04:54.110> is<00:04:54.349> staying<00:04:54.530> the

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
basically everything else is staying the

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.820 
basically everything else is staying the
same<00:04:54.740> but<00:04:54.919> we're<00:04:55.190> pushing<00:04:55.750> just<00:04:56.750> this<00:04:57.530> out

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
same but we're pushing just this out

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.890 
same but we're pushing just this out
this<00:04:58.099> way<00:04:58.310> which<00:04:58.520> turns<00:04:58.849> the<00:04:59.000> steering<00:04:59.240> wheel

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.750 

so<00:05:02.900> I'm<00:05:03.110> going<00:05:03.260> to<00:05:03.320> do<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.710> couple<00:05:04.010> rotations

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
so I'm going to do a couple rotations

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.190 
so I'm going to do a couple rotations
and<00:05:04.910> then<00:05:05.030> I'm<00:05:05.120> going<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.360> go<00:05:05.479> and<00:05:05.750> check<00:05:06.050> the

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
and then I'm going to go and check the

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.779 
and then I'm going to go and check the
steering<00:05:06.560> wheel<00:05:09.099> now<00:05:10.099> this<00:05:10.280> one<00:05:10.460> is<00:05:10.610> really

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
steering wheel now this one is really
