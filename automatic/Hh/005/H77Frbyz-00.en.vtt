today<00:03:36.389> is<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:37.709> knockouts<00:03:38.190> division<00:03:38.699> we<00:03:39.419> had<00:03:39.540> a

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
today is the knockouts division we had a

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.659 
today is the knockouts division we had a
match<00:03:39.750> between<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.650> knockouts<00:03:41.069> champions

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
and winter and Angelina I think this

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.539 
and winter and Angelina I think this
could<00:03:43.470> really<00:03:43.590> be<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.799> good<00:03:44.010> feud<00:03:44.310> if<00:03:44.430> they

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
could really be a good feud if they

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.729 
could really be a good feud if they
really<00:03:44.730> booked<00:03:45.329> it<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.690> way<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:46.109> know<00:03:46.440> that

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
really booked it that way I know that

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.559 
really booked it that way I know that
they're<00:03:46.829> not<00:03:46.859> going<00:03:47.099> to<00:03:47.190> do<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.519> but<00:03:47.790> this

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
they're not going to do that but this

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.420 
they're not going to do that but this
could<00:03:48.720> be<00:03:48.840> something<00:03:49.199> good<00:03:49.349> to<00:03:49.590> kind<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.099> bring

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
could be something good to kind of bring

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.159 
could be something good to kind of bring
a<00:03:50.519> little<00:03:50.669> life<00:03:51.180> back<00:03:51.419> to<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:51.690> Knockouts<00:03:52.049> Tag

so yeah those were pretty much the only
things<00:05:29.190> I<00:05:29.280> care<00:05:29.340> about<00:05:29.669> from<00:05:29.760> the<00:05:29.880> show

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
things I care about from the show

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.810 
things I care about from the show
besides<00:05:30.900> that<00:05:31.110> boring<00:05:31.830> show<00:05:32.160> I<00:05:32.190> didn't<00:05:32.639> watch

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
besides that boring show I didn't watch

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.140 
besides that boring show I didn't watch
most<00:05:33.150> of<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.450> I'd<00:05:33.570> rather<00:05:33.780> watch<00:05:34.110> NXT<00:05:34.979> over<00:05:35.150> TNA

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
most of it I'd rather watch NXT over TNA

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.750 
most of it I'd rather watch NXT over TNA
so<00:05:36.210> that<00:05:36.450> just<00:05:36.660> kind<00:05:36.870> of<00:05:36.930> shows<00:05:37.250> so<00:05:38.250> my<00:05:38.550> guess

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
so that just kind of shows so my guess

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.670
