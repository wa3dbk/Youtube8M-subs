to English you're gonna show a mini-map
on<00:00:54.520> their<00:00:54.760> show<00:00:54.970> coordinates<00:00:55.570> so<00:00:55.810> we<00:00:55.960> can<00:00:56.110> do

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
on their show coordinates so we can do

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.310 
on their show coordinates so we can do
that<00:00:56.380> it'll<00:00:56.770> actually<00:00:56.950> show<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.430> coordinates

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
that it'll actually show the coordinates

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.610

your coordinates right here and there is
of<00:01:02.860> course<00:01:03.100> create<00:01:03.490> Waypoint<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:05.049> is<00:01:05.199> really

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
of course create Waypoint this is really

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.550 
of course create Waypoint this is really
cool<00:01:05.920> so<00:01:06.100> we're<00:01:06.369> gonna<00:01:06.460> go<00:01:06.670> ahead<00:01:06.820> and<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:08.439> this

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
little mushroom area we're gonna create

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.539 
little mushroom area we're gonna create
a<00:01:12.430> waypoint<00:01:12.610> here<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:14.040> we're<00:01:15.040> gonna<00:01:15.130> go<00:01:15.399> ahead

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
a waypoint here and we're gonna go ahead

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.149 
a waypoint here and we're gonna go ahead
and<00:01:15.759> say<00:01:16.569> this<00:01:16.719> is<00:01:16.899> a<00:01:16.929> mushroom<00:01:17.350> Waypoint

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
and say this is a mushroom Waypoint

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.209 
and say this is a mushroom Waypoint
okay<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:19.270> mushroom<00:01:19.689> Waypoint<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.350> then<00:01:21.039> just

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
okay so mushroom Waypoint and then just

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.270 
okay so mushroom Waypoint and then just
leave<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.460> coordinates<00:01:21.819> like<00:01:21.939> that<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.770> we've

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
leave the coordinates like that so we've

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.160 
leave the coordinates like that so we've
created<00:01:24.429> a<00:01:24.880> waypoint<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.450> mushroom<00:01:25.810> Waypoint

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
created a waypoint the mushroom Waypoint

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.169 
created a waypoint the mushroom Waypoint
we're<00:01:26.289> gonna<00:01:26.380> walk<00:01:26.679> away<00:01:26.889> from<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:27.340> all<00:01:28.060> the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.800 
cool
so<00:02:08.649> we'll<00:02:08.770> do<00:02:08.890> this<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.429> once<00:02:10.090> you<00:02:10.240> get<00:02:10.509> to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
so we'll do this and once you get to

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.980 
so we'll do this and once you get to
where<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.890> where<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:13.270> Waypoint<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.780> it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
where you where the Waypoint is it

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.320 
where you where the Waypoint is it
starts<00:02:14.319> spinning<00:02:14.500> crazy<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.209> is

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
starts spinning crazy so like this is

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.530 
starts spinning crazy so like this is
where<00:02:16.540> we<00:02:16.690> did<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.440> yeah<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.330> can

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
where we did it and this yeah so you can

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.990 
where we did it and this yeah so you can
also<00:02:19.690> create<00:02:20.200> multiple<00:02:20.440> waypoints<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.700> we<00:02:21.850> can

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
also create multiple waypoints so we can

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.090 
also create multiple waypoints so we can
disable<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.450> Waypoint<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.260> we're<00:02:23.860> gonna<00:02:23.950> go

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
disable that Waypoint and we're gonna go

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.030 
disable that Waypoint and we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.340> create<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.580> new

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
ahead and create a new

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.349 
ahead and create a new
a<00:02:25.069> point<00:02:25.340> we're<00:02:25.489> just<00:02:25.610> gonna<00:02:26.049> we're<00:02:27.049> gonna<00:02:27.200> go

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
a point we're just gonna we're gonna go

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.179 
a point we're just gonna we're gonna go

amazing Mountain Waypoint let's call it
the<00:02:36.680> amazing<00:02:36.890> Waypoint<00:02:37.579> and<00:02:40.599> yeah<00:02:41.599> you<00:02:41.659> could

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
the amazing Waypoint and yeah you could

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.280 
the amazing Waypoint and yeah you could
set<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.109> coordinates<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:43.659> now<00:02:44.659> we<00:02:44.720> can<00:02:45.140> just

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
set the coordinates and now we can just

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.149 
set the coordinates and now we can just
walk<00:02:45.560> away<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:46.129> we<00:02:47.060> will<00:02:47.560> start<00:02:48.560> tracking<00:02:48.769> the

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
walk away and we will start tracking the

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.699 
walk away and we will start tracking the
amazing<00:02:49.579> Waypoint<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.209> now<00:02:50.359> there<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.019> is<00:02:51.170> you

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
amazing Waypoint so now there it is you

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.339 
amazing Waypoint so now there it is you
should<00:02:51.859> follow<00:02:52.069> this<00:02:52.310> arrow<00:02:52.579> and<00:02:53.079> while<00:02:54.079> we're

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
here we're at the amazing Waypoint so if

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
and let's let's go try out the mini-map

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.649 
and let's let's go try out the mini-map
now<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.370> yeah<00:03:10.819> it's<00:03:10.970> it's<00:03:11.299> a<00:03:11.389> little<00:03:11.480> bit

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
now and yeah it's it's a little bit

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.860 
now and yeah it's it's a little bit
buggy<00:03:11.959> but<00:03:12.200> it's<00:03:12.349> really<00:03:12.620> cool<00:03:12.829> I<00:03:13.629> can't<00:03:14.629> tell

buggy but it's really cool I can't tell

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.339 
buggy but it's really cool I can't tell
though<00:03:15.260> where<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:15.590> am<00:03:16.129> on<00:03:16.340> this<00:03:16.459> map<00:03:16.700> though<00:03:20.349> but

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
though where I am on this map though but

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.289 
though where I am on this map though but
yeah<00:03:21.500> oh<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.709> guess<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.220> like<00:03:22.430> does<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:25.299> the

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
yeah oh I guess it like does the the

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.830 
yeah oh I guess it like does the the
blocks<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.260> are<00:03:27.470> on<00:03:27.709> your<00:03:27.859> level<00:03:28.269> so<00:03:29.269> that's

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
blocks that are on your level so that's

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.420 
blocks that are on your level so that's
what<00:03:30.079> this<00:03:30.199> mini-map<00:03:30.470> does<00:03:30.859> but<00:03:31.129> it's<00:03:31.250> really

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
what this mini-map does but it's really

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.830 
what this mini-map does but it's really
cool<00:03:31.639> so<00:03:32.329> we<00:03:32.479> can<00:03:32.629> disable<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.139> mini-map<00:03:34.840> when

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
cool so we can disable the mini-map when

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.710 
cool so we can disable the mini-map when
we<00:03:35.930> don't<00:03:36.109> need<00:03:36.879> so<00:03:37.879> yeah<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:38.180> that's<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.540> mod
