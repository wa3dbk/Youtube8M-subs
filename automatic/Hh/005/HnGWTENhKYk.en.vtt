00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
painful experience um and I thought we

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.370 
painful experience um and I thought we
were<00:00:30.480> gonna<00:00:30.570> go<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:30.750> actually<00:00:31.170> after<00:00:31.320> that

Monaco<00:01:41.100> remember<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.479> year<00:01:42.659> Murray<00:01:43.049> ends<00:01:43.259> has

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
Monaco remember the year Murray ends has

Monaco remember the year Murray ends has
killed<00:01:43.680> us<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.860> thought<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.070> were<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> do

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
killed us I thought we were going to do

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.399 
killed us I thought we were going to do
it<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.210> Marseille<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> remember<00:01:46.079> Perez

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
it and Marseille I remember Perez

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.080 
it and Marseille I remember Perez
scoring<00:01:46.829> when<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> was<00:01:47.100> quite<00:01:47.250> young<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.700> we

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
scoring when I was quite young so we

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.819 
scoring when I was quite young so we
really<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.720> bad<00:01:48.899> record<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.320> France<00:01:49.560> I

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
really do have a bad record in France I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.230 
really do have a bad record in France I
think<00:01:50.130> our<00:01:50.220> only<00:01:50.460> victory<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:50.939> actually

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
think our only victory there actually

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.999 
think our only victory there actually
was<00:01:51.630> Paris<00:01:51.899> every<00:01:52.110> man's<00:01:52.259> worst<00:01:52.500> ever<00:01:52.770> home

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
was Paris every man's worst ever home

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.910 
was Paris every man's worst ever home
defeat<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.460> Europe<00:01:53.759> which<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.350> three<00:01:55.350> no<00:01:55.470> when

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
defeat in Europe which was three no when

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.800 
defeat in Europe which was three no when
videoid<00:01:56.280> Robin<00:01:56.610> think<00:01:57.060> John's<00:01:57.299> Harry<00:01:57.509> scored

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
videoid Robin think John's Harry scored

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.740 
videoid Robin think John's Harry scored
so<00:01:58.380> um<00:01:58.770> no<00:01:59.700> no<00:02:00.119> question<00:02:00.420> about<00:02:00.450> it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so um no no question about it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.080 
so um no no question about it
they're<00:02:00.930> good<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.290> therefore<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.880> my

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
they're good and therefore this is my

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.060 
they're good and therefore this is my
team<00:02:03.329> as<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.320> I've<00:02:04.469> picked<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.829> team

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.469 
team as you can see I've picked a team
that<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> think<00:02:05.700> there's<00:02:05.969> gonna<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> bit<00:02:06.390> of

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
that I think there's gonna be a bit of

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.600 
that I think there's gonna be a bit of
controversy<00:02:06.990> about<00:02:07.469> um<00:02:07.710> I've<00:02:08.220> picked<00:02:08.489> John

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
controversy about um I've picked John

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.180 
controversy about um I've picked John
Obi<00:02:08.819> Mikkel<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.649> think<00:02:10.649> he's<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> very<00:02:11.039> good

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
Obi Mikkel I think he's a very good

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.710 
Obi Mikkel I think he's a very good
player<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.610> guys<00:02:11.790> often<00:02:11.970> give<00:02:12.180> me<00:02:12.330> grief<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
player you guys often give me grief and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.760 
player you guys often give me grief and
you<00:02:12.780> give<00:02:12.900> him<00:02:13.020> grief<00:02:13.200> but

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you give him grief but

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
you give him grief but
that's<00:02:13.920> pick<00:02:14.130> him<00:02:14.250> for<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.460> game<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.730> think

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
that's pick him for this game I think

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.030 
that's pick him for this game I think
he's<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.030> perfect<00:02:15.300> player<00:02:16.170> for<00:02:16.470> away<00:02:16.740> game<00:02:16.920> to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
he's a perfect player for away game to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.530 
he's a perfect player for away game to
the<00:02:17.130> Champions<00:02:17.430> League<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.820> he<00:02:18.180> is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
the Champions League and he is

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.210 
the Champions League and he is
definitely<00:02:19.080> gonna<00:02:19.410> play<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.710> game<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.100> my

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.890 
definitely gonna play in this game in my
opinion<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.850> he<00:02:20.970> certainly<00:02:21.180> play<00:02:21.480> if<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.780> was

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
opinion and he certainly play if I was

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.480

to check um let me know what you think
about<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.400> think<00:02:26.580> it's<00:02:26.760> sort<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
about that I think it's sort of the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.640 
about that I think it's sort of the
debate<00:02:27.420> that's<00:02:27.570> going<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:27.990> with<00:02:28.200> amongst<00:02:28.530> a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
debate that's going on with amongst a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.780 
debate that's going on with amongst a
lot<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:28.920> expands<00:02:29.190> at<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.340> moment<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:29.640> I've

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
lot of so expands at the moment but I've

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.730 
lot of so expands at the moment but I've
gone<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.180> Petter<00:02:30.390> check<00:02:30.660> because<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.620> think

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
gone for Petter check because I think

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.350 
gone for Petter check because I think
that<00:02:32.310> he<00:02:32.430> played<00:02:32.640> brilliantly<00:02:32.820> against

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
that he played brilliantly against

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.910 
that he played brilliantly against
Everton<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.660> we<00:02:33.750> shouldn't<00:02:34.020> shouldn't<00:02:34.770> shake

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
Everton and we shouldn't shouldn't shake

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.410 
Everton and we shouldn't shouldn't shake
it<00:02:35.040> up<00:02:35.130> too<00:02:35.280> much<00:02:35.460> back<00:02:35.670> there<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:35.970> I've<00:02:36.240> also

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
it up too much back there and I've also

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.960 
it up too much back there and I've also
picked<00:02:36.720> Curtis<00:02:37.020> Ouma<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.610> that's<00:02:38.610> because<00:02:38.910> I

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
picked Curtis Ouma and that's because I

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.010 
picked Curtis Ouma and that's because I
think<00:02:39.090> he's<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.210> better<00:02:39.360> player<00:02:39.480> than<00:02:39.600> Gary

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
think he's a better player than Gary

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.150 
think he's a better player than Gary
Cahill<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.530> he's<00:02:40.620> used<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.950> French
