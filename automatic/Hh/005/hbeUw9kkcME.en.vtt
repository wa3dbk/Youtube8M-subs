00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
she should be out and as you know

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.400 
she should be out and as you know

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
did not call off guys like like a John

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.620 
did not call off guys like like a John
Cena<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.220> couple<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.940> weeks<00:02:18.150> ago<00:02:18.330> he's

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
Cena and couple of weeks ago he's

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.860 
Cena and couple of weeks ago he's
knocked<00:02:18.959> out<00:02:19.110> renew<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.040> badly

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
knocked out renew it and so badly

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.589 
knocked out renew it and so badly
yeah<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.230> maybe<00:02:23.190> that's<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.700> time<00:02:23.940> for<00:02:24.150> him<00:02:24.450> if

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
yeah so maybe that's the time for him if

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.850 
yeah so maybe that's the time for him if
they<00:02:24.870> could<00:02:24.900> buy<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.319> world<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.739> a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
they could buy the world of a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.070 
they could buy the world of a
championship<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.239> think<00:02:27.480> after<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:27.870> may

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
championship and I think after that may

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.670 
championship and I think after that may
be<00:02:28.140> big<00:02:28.380> sure<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.360> maybe<00:02:30.360> correct<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.319> often

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
be big sure and maybe correct you often

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.610 
be big sure and maybe correct you often
go<00:02:31.920> one-on-one<00:02:32.220> or<00:02:32.760> maybe<00:02:33.660> Randy<00:02:33.989> wooden<00:02:34.410> got

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
go one-on-one or maybe Randy wooden got

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.130
