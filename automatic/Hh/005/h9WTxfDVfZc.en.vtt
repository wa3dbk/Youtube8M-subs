that<00:02:17.959> was<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.440> battle<00:02:18.770> where<00:02:19.040> Danzo<00:02:20.000> and

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
that was on the battle where Danzo and

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.690 
that was on the battle where Danzo and
Sasuke<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.530> know<00:02:21.590> she<00:02:21.830> wanted<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.550> be<00:02:22.670> a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
Sasuke you know she wanted to be a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.550 
Sasuke you know she wanted to be a
Sasuke<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.420> she<00:02:23.840> was<00:02:23.930> going<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.200> sacrifice

Sasuke and she was going to sacrifice

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.510 
Sasuke and she was going to sacrifice
herself<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:26.800> think<00:02:27.800> sasuke<00:02:28.190> might<00:02:28.400> have

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
herself and I think sasuke might have

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.220 
herself and I think sasuke might have
wanted<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.819> kill<00:02:29.060> her<00:02:29.180> by<00:02:29.330> my<00:02:29.510> t-shirt<00:02:29.870> had<00:02:30.080> to

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
wanted to kill her by my t-shirt had to

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.290 
wanted to kill her by my t-shirt had to
rewatch<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.280> don't<00:02:31.520> take<00:02:31.670> my<00:02:31.880> word<00:02:32.060> for

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
rewatch that so don't take my word for

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.260 
rewatch that so don't take my word for
that<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:33.020> anyways<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:34.250> know<00:02:34.280> she<00:02:34.520> I'm<00:02:35.090> not

sure how she died I think possibly that

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.280

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
mean this makes you think that is it

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.780 
mean this makes you think that is it
possible<00:03:29.480> that<00:03:29.510> he<00:03:30.079> somehow<00:03:30.459> sealed<00:03:31.459> the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
possible that he somehow sealed the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.090 
possible that he somehow sealed the
kages<00:03:32.209> or<00:03:32.570> is<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.320> possible<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:33.709> he<00:03:33.950> took

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
kages or is it possible that he took

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.949 
kages or is it possible that he took
care<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.459> kages<00:03:34.820> because<00:03:35.660> at<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.930> moment

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959

Hokage<00:03:47.480> because<00:03:47.780> i'm<00:03:48.380> guessing<00:03:49.010> because

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
Hokage because i'm guessing because

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.199 
Hokage because i'm guessing because
they're<00:03:49.430> not<00:03:49.489> strong<00:03:49.730> enough<00:03:49.760> at<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.090> same

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
time there's not eligible i guess for

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.699 
time there's not eligible i guess for
other<00:03:52.250> reasons<00:03:52.430> possibly<00:03:52.970> but<00:03:53.510> i'm<00:03:54.380> not<00:03:54.530> i'm

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
other reasons possibly but i'm not i'm

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.380 
other reasons possibly but i'm not i'm
