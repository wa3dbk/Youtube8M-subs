I've<00:00:31.439> well<00:00:32.160> technically<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.820> I've<00:00:33.329> done

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
I've well technically this I've done

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.920 
I've well technically this I've done
north<00:00:33.809> south<00:00:34.020> east<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.530> west<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.980> central<00:00:35.219> so

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
north south east and west and central so

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.369 
north south east and west and central so
anyway<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.700> part<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.840> really

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
anyway so this part of it is not really

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.590 
anyway so this part of it is not really
complete<00:00:40.890> yet<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.370> still<00:00:42.149> kind<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
complete yet I still kind of have to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.000 
complete yet I still kind of have to
figure<00:00:42.719> out<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.140> do<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.649> there<00:00:43.829> are

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
figure out what to do but there are

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.279 
figure out what to do but there are
stairs<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.079> one's

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
stairs on this one and this one's

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.529 
stairs on this one and this one's
actually<00:00:46.469> pretty<00:00:47.030> different<00:00:48.030> from<00:00:48.360> my<00:00:48.510> normal

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
actually pretty different from my normal

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.330 
actually pretty different from my normal
set<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.219> city<00:00:50.520> rather<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.980> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> sense

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
set of a city rather and in the sense

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.889 
set of a city rather and in the sense
that<00:00:53.430> usually<00:00:53.940> cities<00:00:54.270> would<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.750> like

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that usually cities would just be like

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.290 
that usually cities would just be like
that<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.590> ring<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.430> buildings<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> that's

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
that a ring of buildings and that's

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.420 
that a ring of buildings and that's
pretty<00:00:57.480> much<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.870> or<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.620> square<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.010> buildings

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
pretty much it or a square of buildings

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.680 
pretty much it or a square of buildings
this<00:01:00.270> one<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.949> well<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:02.910> West<00:01:03.180> Station

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
this one I as well as West Station

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.830 
this one I as well as West Station
Square<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.170> mean<00:01:04.589> East<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.460> well<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:06.450> East

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
Square I mean East as well as East

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.420 
Square I mean East as well as East
Station<00:01:07.380> Square<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.680> wanted<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.040> do<00:01:08.189> something

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
Station Square I wanted to do something

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.880 
Station Square I wanted to do something
different<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.780> East<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.229> made<00:01:10.439> all<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
different for East I made all the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.320 
different for East I made all the
buildings<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> higher<00:01:11.549> level<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.210> this

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
buildings on a higher level and for this

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.469 
buildings on a higher level and for this
one<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.570> kind<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.049> made<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.280> two<00:01:14.729> different

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
one I kind of made it like two different

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.770 
one I kind of made it like two different
parts<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.369> I<00:01:17.369> don't<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.299> know<00:01:18.390> how<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.509> say

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
parts of I don't really know how to say

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.560 
parts of I don't really know how to say
this<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.020> basically<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.850> there's<00:01:21.390> like

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
this but basically this there's like

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.030 
this but basically this there's like
this<00:01:21.720> little<00:01:21.990> block<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.500> then<00:01:22.650> there's<00:01:22.860> this

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
this little block and then there's this

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.999 
this little block and then there's this
entire<00:01:23.460> block<00:01:23.880> around<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.920> know

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
entire block around it that you know

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.649 
entire block around it that you know
goes<00:01:26.220> around<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.729> there<00:01:27.479> could<00:01:27.630> be

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
goes around it and there could be

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.380 
goes around it and there could be
building<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.110> there<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.560> obviously<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
building is there but obviously with the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.899 
building is there but obviously with the
magic<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.350> filmmaking<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.369> don't<00:01:32.520> even<00:01:32.670> see

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
magic of filmmaking you don't even see

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.219 
magic of filmmaking you don't even see
that<00:01:33.119> at<00:01:33.540> least<00:01:33.750> not<00:01:34.200> yet<00:01:34.350> anyway<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:37.049> yeah

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
that at least not yet anyway and so yeah

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.550 
that at least not yet anyway and so yeah
this<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.700> this<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.079> you<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.140> hear<00:01:40.380> them

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
this is this is it you know hear them

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.880 
this is this is it you know hear them
talking<00:01:41.340> about<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.450> boys<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:43.020> sexy<00:01:43.470> did

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
talking about the boys to sexy did

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.440 
talking about the boys to sexy did
that's<00:01:44.189> pretty<00:01:44.579> much<00:01:44.670> day<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.909> guess<00:01:45.149> I'll<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that's pretty much day I guess I'll do a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.310 
that's pretty much day I guess I'll do a
close-up<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.020> all<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> buildings<00:01:48.320> there's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
close-up on all of the buildings there's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.700 
close-up on all of the buildings there's
a<00:01:49.590> music<00:01:50.399> plant<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.909> actually<00:01:51.210> was<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.710> gonna
