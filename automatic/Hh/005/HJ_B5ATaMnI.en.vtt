00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:13.860
 lanzarote in winter 2015 we had there 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.910
 an empty vacation around the winter cold 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.980
 escape in germany 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.000
 we were just before landing 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:32.700
 nice little sky show of 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:35.309
 our plane lived in the clouds 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.540
 we have in playa blanca 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.440
 that is in the very south of lanzarote 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.440
 located 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.140
 the place is tourist dominated and 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.140
 also only for a few decades 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.140
 opened up 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.760
 Hello 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.400
 There are no hotel buildings there with 15 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.479
 and more floors but almost 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.729
 only small houses or too 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.729
 hotels with only a few floors 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:53.750
 a kilometer long beach promenade invited 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.750
 to go for a walk 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:16.280
 this is the harbor marina rubicon in the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:25.150
 Mainly pay attention and sport boats their 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:27.650
 Moorings had a small front 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.160
 reminds that also the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.959
 Canarian islands once fiercely contested 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.680
 and pirates were up to her 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.680
 exaggerated 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.470
 in the east of playa blanca we have 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:58.140
 We live in a small house 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.140
 rented by ramos 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:08.409
 the house is very nice with 150 square meters 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.680
 generously built and to our delight 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.920
 There was also a sensible dishwasher 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.920
 therein 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.630
 directly below there was a small one 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:28.240
 beach mainly gisikon stony 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.240
 but also with sand 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.400
 especially beautiful are the parrots 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.850
 You could also get beaches from our house 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.200
 walk there but it also led one 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:53.800
 unpaved road to the beaches 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.550
 their use with three euros also not 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.550
 was too expensive 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.160
 O 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.240
 almost always blew a fresher 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.780
 northeast wind 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:20.120
 but you were on those beaches 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.120
 at least at the very bottom of it 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.339
 Euro 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:25.720
 sometimes you had a nice one too 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:28.720
 relatively clear view to the neighbor island 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.720
 fuerteventura 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.330
 Why 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.600
 Oh oh oh 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:22.030
 a small event in three years 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:22.030
 was a bicycle race for handicap title 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:42.829
 they were usually very well trained 

00:06:39.049 --> 00:06:46.449
 and came with a high tempo to 

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:46.449
 small hillside down 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.230
 team 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.300
 great respect for this sport 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:12.300
 people
