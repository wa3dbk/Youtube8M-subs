wasn't<00:00:50.620> I<00:00:50.829> don't<00:00:51.010> think<00:00:51.219> they<00:00:51.309> made<00:00:51.519> it<00:00:51.640> to<00:00:51.760> be

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
wasn't I don't think they made it to be

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.150 
wasn't I don't think they made it to be
an<00:00:52.180> outdoor<00:00:52.420> bushcraft<00:00:53.109> knife<00:00:53.320> but<00:00:53.829> that's

kind of what I wanted to use it for are

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.369

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
but let's see if I can't put an edge on

00:02:26.760 --> 00:03:34.140 
but let's see if I can't put an edge on
this

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.110

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
alright guys I just finished up putting

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.679 
alright guys I just finished up putting
a<00:03:38.299> new<00:03:38.480> badge<00:03:39.349> on<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.709> spine<00:03:40.010> here<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.670> if<00:03:41.569> you

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.750 
a new badge on the spine here and if you
can<00:03:41.870> see<00:03:42.200> in<00:03:42.319> the<00:03:42.439> glare<00:03:42.709> you've<00:03:43.250> got<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.430> nice

nice smooth use a 320 grit belt you can

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.929 
nice smooth use a 320 grit belt you can
see<00:03:48.079> the<00:03:48.290> grind<00:03:48.920> lines<00:03:49.220> in<00:03:49.400> there<00:03:49.519> slightly

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:49.939 
see the grind lines in there slightly

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:50.800 
see the grind lines in there slightly
but<00:03:50.090> that's<00:03:50.239> okay

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
but that's okay

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
nice flat the edges are sharp now so

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.960 
nice flat the edges are sharp now so
we'll<00:04:08.359> give<00:04:08.510> this<00:04:08.659> a<00:04:08.720> little<00:04:09.700> let's<00:04:10.700> give<00:04:10.849> this

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
we'll give this a little let's give this

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.640 
we'll give this a little let's give this
a<00:04:11.090> little<00:04:11.209> try<00:04:11.480> I<00:04:11.750> shouldn't<00:04:12.139> do<00:04:12.200> this<00:04:12.260> in<00:04:12.530> my

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
a little try I shouldn't do this in my

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.180 
a little try I shouldn't do this in my
shop<00:04:12.920> but<00:04:13.280> I'm<00:04:13.519> gonna<00:04:13.639> do<00:04:13.819> it<00:04:13.940> anyway<00:04:14.000> because

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190

now<00:04:17.479> here's<00:04:17.750> my<00:04:17.900> fire<00:04:18.169> steel<00:04:18.470> Ferren<00:04:24.610> no<00:04:25.610> that

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
now here's my fire steel Ferren no that

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:49.480 
now here's my fire steel Ferren no that
seems<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.240> be<00:04:26.389> working<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:48.440> little<00:04:49.190> bit<00:04:49.310> worse

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
seems to be working a little bit worse

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.610 
seems to be working a little bit worse
of<00:04:49.880> an<00:04:50.030> angle<00:04:50.470> now<00:04:51.470> it's<00:04:51.680> working<00:04:52.070> whew

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
of an angle now it's working whew

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.040 
of an angle now it's working whew
there<00:04:54.620> we<00:04:54.710> go<00:04:55.099> um<00:04:56.090> it's<00:04:56.419> a<00:04:56.479> little<00:04:56.720> hard<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:56.930> do

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
there we go um it's a little hard to do

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.810 
there we go um it's a little hard to do
standing<00:04:57.349> behind<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.650> camera<00:04:57.830> but<00:04:58.190> oh<00:04:58.430> I<00:04:58.639> just

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
standing behind the camera but oh I just

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.580 
standing behind the camera but oh I just
messed<00:04:59.120> up<00:04:59.270> my<00:04:59.330> blade<00:04:59.630> let<00:05:00.110> me<00:05:00.169> see<00:05:00.320> if<00:05:00.409> I<00:05:00.470> can

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
messed up my blade let me see if I can

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.740 
messed up my blade let me see if I can
get<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:00.800> off<00:05:02.080> yep<00:05:03.110> Oh<00:05:04.270> clean<00:05:05.270> alright<00:05:05.599> guys

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
get that off yep Oh clean alright guys

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.830 
get that off yep Oh clean alright guys
so<00:05:06.020> we<00:05:06.229> uh<00:05:07.599> the<00:05:08.599> first<00:05:08.870> modification<00:05:10.659> was<00:05:11.659> the

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
so we uh the first modification was the

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.879 
so we uh the first modification was the
spine<00:05:12.199> uh<00:05:12.500> it's<00:05:13.750> got<00:05:14.750> a<00:05:14.780> nice<00:05:15.020> smooth<00:05:15.380> spine<00:05:15.710> on

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
spine uh it's got a nice smooth spine on

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.540 
spine uh it's got a nice smooth spine on
there<00:05:16.070> um<00:05:17.349> there's<00:05:18.349> one<00:05:18.409> drawback

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.129 

the<00:05:22.550> only<00:05:22.669> drawback<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.360> doing<00:05:23.690> what<00:05:23.840> I<00:05:23.870> just

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
the only drawback to doing what I just

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.490 
the only drawback to doing what I just
did<00:05:24.909> this<00:05:25.909> is<00:05:26.120> a<00:05:26.150> carbon<00:05:26.630> steel<00:05:26.750> blade<00:05:27.169> and

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
did this is a carbon steel blade and

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.710 
did this is a carbon steel blade and
it's<00:05:27.949> got<00:05:28.099> a<00:05:28.130> nice<00:05:28.340> finish<00:05:28.699> on<00:05:29.030> it<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.449> protect

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
it's got a nice finish on it to protect

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.950 
it's got a nice finish on it to protect
it<00:05:30.159> even<00:05:31.159> so<00:05:31.789> you<00:05:31.849> want<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:32.210> oil<00:05:32.240> it<00:05:32.539> anyway

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
it even so you want to oil it anyway

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.010 
it even so you want to oil it anyway
keep<00:05:33.860> it<00:05:33.979> oiled<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:35.210> other<00:05:35.330> drawback<00:05:35.840> to<00:05:35.990> that

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
keep it oiled the other drawback to that

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.010 
keep it oiled the other drawback to that
is<00:05:36.380> I<00:05:36.650> have<00:05:36.830> just<00:05:37.210> since<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.330> ground<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.750> spine

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
is I have just since I ground the spine

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.560 
is I have just since I ground the spine
I<00:05:39.349> exposed<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.979> bare<00:05:40.220> carbon<00:05:40.639> steel<00:05:40.940> and<00:05:41.270> is

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
I exposed the bare carbon steel and is

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.800 
I exposed the bare carbon steel and is
going<00:05:41.990> to<00:05:42.050> be<00:05:42.229> much<00:05:42.469> more<00:05:42.740> prone<00:05:43.130> to<00:05:43.639> rust

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
going to be much more prone to rust

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.900 
going to be much more prone to rust
