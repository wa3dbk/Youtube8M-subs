with some shaved mixed grass seed here

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.990 
with some shaved mixed grass seed here
because<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:54.960> times<00:00:55.260> gone<00:00:55.500> by<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.760> lawn<00:00:56.969> that

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
because as times gone by the lawn that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.689 
because as times gone by the lawn that
was<00:00:57.239> planted<00:00:57.890> thinned<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> bit<00:00:59.430> because

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
was planted thinned out a bit because

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.910 
was planted thinned out a bit because
it's<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> very<00:01:00.359> shady<00:01:00.629> spot<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.680> we're<00:01:01.829> gonna

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
it's a very shady spot so we're gonna

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.340 
it's a very shady spot so we're gonna
aerate<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.699> open<00:01:03.059> up<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> soil<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.930> then<00:01:04.199> go

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
aerate to open up the soil and then go

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.870 
aerate to open up the soil and then go
ahead<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.650> put<00:01:04.769> down<00:01:04.949> some<00:01:04.979> nice<00:01:05.339> shade<00:01:05.580> mix

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
ahead and put down some nice shade mix

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.770 
ahead and put down some nice shade mix
grass<00:01:06.150> seed<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:07.280> thicken<00:01:08.280> up<00:01:08.460> along<00:01:08.790> now

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
grass seed to thicken up along now

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.030 
grass seed to thicken up along now
there's<00:01:09.960> another<00:01:10.229> reason<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.650> might<00:01:10.770> want<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
there's another reason you might want to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.910 
there's another reason you might want to
aerate<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:12.510> you've<00:01:12.720> got<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> very<00:01:13.080> compacted

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
aerate is if you've got a very compacted

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.890 
aerate is if you've got a very compacted
lawn<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.060> want<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> go<00:01:15.450> through<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
lawn you do want to go through and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.080 
lawn you do want to go through and
aerate<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> air<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
aerate just so that the air and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
aerate just so that the air and
nutrients<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> roots<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.680> your

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
nutrients can get to the roots of your

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.550 
nutrients can get to the roots of your
grass<00:01:20.340> plants<00:01:20.900> even<00:01:21.900> though<00:01:21.990> your<00:01:22.200> roots<00:01:22.380> are

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
grass plants even though your roots are

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.620 
grass plants even though your roots are
in<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> ground<00:01:23.040> they<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.610> need<00:01:23.970> oxygen<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
in the ground they do need oxygen to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.130 
in the ground they do need oxygen to
survive

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
survive

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.850 
survive
so<00:01:25.830> by<00:01:25.979> aerating<00:01:26.490> you're<00:01:26.610> punching<00:01:26.850> holes<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
so by aerating you're punching holes and

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.149 
so by aerating you're punching holes and
giving<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.009> grass<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> chance<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.890> get<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
giving that grass a chance to to get the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.580 
giving that grass a chance to to get the
nutrients<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.729> air<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.030> needs<00:01:33.380> today<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
nutrients in the air it needs today I

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
nutrients in the air it needs today I
used<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.220> tool<00:01:35.430> behind<00:01:35.670> me<00:01:36.030> which<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.329> called<00:01:36.659> an

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
used a tool behind me which is called an

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.440 
used a tool behind me which is called an
eruv<00:01:37.350> ater<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.700> nice<00:01:38.850> thing<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
eruv ater and the nice thing about the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
eruv ater and the nice thing about the
air<00:01:39.600> Vater<00:01:39.900> has<00:01:40.110> got<00:01:40.290> these<00:01:40.470> times<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.100> they

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
air Vater has got these times that they

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.580 
air Vater has got these times that they
go<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> soil<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:42.869> they<00:01:43.020> shake<00:01:43.380> at

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
go in the soil and then they shake at

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.920 
go in the soil and then they shake at
the<00:01:43.680> same<00:01:43.890> time<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.329> really<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> nice

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the same time so they really do a nice

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.920 
the same time so they really do a nice
job<00:01:46.290> loosening<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> soil<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.810> if<00:01:48.810> you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
job loosening up the soil and if you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.770 
job loosening up the soil and if you
look<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.579> results<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.210> air<00:01:51.450> evader

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
look at the results with this air evader

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.319 
look at the results with this air evader
if<00:01:52.170> you've<00:01:52.680> got<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> thick<00:01:53.220> stand<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.640> grass<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
if you've got a thick stand of grass the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.929 
if you've got a thick stand of grass the
grass<00:01:54.540> stays<00:01:54.869> together<00:01:55.110> very<00:01:55.470> nicely<00:01:55.939> and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
grass stays together very nicely and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.819 
grass stays together very nicely and
loosens<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.750> mean<00:01:57.899> if<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.170> walk<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.710> this

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
loosens it up I mean if I walk on this

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.580 
loosens it up I mean if I walk on this
lawn<00:01:59.040> after<00:01:59.280> I've<00:01:59.610> aerated<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.320> actually

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
lawn after I've aerated it it actually

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.100 
lawn after I've aerated it it actually

dirt<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.539> put<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> seed<00:02:10.170> down<00:02:10.349> in

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
dirt to put the seed down in

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.930 
dirt to put the seed down in
so<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.920> first<00:02:12.130> thing<00:02:12.280> we're<00:02:12.400> gonna<00:02:12.490> do<00:02:12.730> today

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
so the first thing we're gonna do today

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.620 
so the first thing we're gonna do today
is<00:02:13.270> go<00:02:14.140> ahead<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.800> run<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.700> machine<00:02:16.030> over<00:02:16.240> and

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
is go ahead and run the machine over and

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.140 
is go ahead and run the machine over and
then<00:02:17.140> we'll<00:02:17.380> go<00:02:17.560> ahead<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:18.160> plant<00:02:18.760> some<00:02:18.910> grass

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
then we'll go ahead and plant some grass

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.660 
then we'll go ahead and plant some grass
seed<00:02:19.350> now<00:02:20.350> that<00:02:20.560> we've<00:02:20.650> got<00:02:20.830> our<00:02:20.980> lawn<00:02:21.190> area

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
seed now that we've got our lawn area

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.980 
seed now that we've got our lawn area
that<00:02:21.820> I'm<00:02:21.880> going<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.060> go<00:02:22.210> ahead<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.750> take<00:02:22.960> some

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.720 
ahead and spread it over the lawn and
when<00:02:30.520> you're<00:02:30.670> spreading<00:02:31.030> grass<00:02:31.390> seed<00:02:32.730> or

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
when you're spreading grass seed or

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.230 
when you're spreading grass seed or
fertilizer<00:02:34.450> for<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:35.170> matter<00:02:35.410> as<00:02:35.590> well<00:02:35.830> I

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
fertilizer for that matter as well I

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.000 
fertilizer for that matter as well I
really<00:02:37.240> like<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.660> use<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:38.230> rotary<00:02:38.590> spreader

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
really like to use a rotary spreader

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.610 
really like to use a rotary spreader
like<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.459> see<00:02:39.670> here<00:02:40.080> there's<00:02:41.080> another<00:02:41.230> type

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
like you see here there's another type

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.900 
like you see here there's another type
of<00:02:41.650> spreader<00:02:42.040> called<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.400> drop<00:02:42.640> spreader

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
of spreader called the drop spreader

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.420 
of spreader called the drop spreader
which<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.480> about<00:02:43.690> 18<00:02:44.140> inches<00:02:44.200> wide<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:45.070> it

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
which is about 18 inches wide and it

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.630 
which is about 18 inches wide and it
only<00:02:45.550> puts<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.120> seat<00:02:46.360> or<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.510> fertilizer

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
only puts the seat or the fertilizer

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.000 
only puts the seat or the fertilizer
right<00:02:48.640> below<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.090> spreader<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.830> quite<00:02:50.830> often

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
right below the spreader and quite often

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.650 
right below the spreader and quite often
you'll<00:02:51.280> end<00:02:51.400> up<00:02:51.459> missing<00:02:51.790> spots<00:02:52.030> lawn<00:02:52.450> you

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
you'll end up missing spots lawn you

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.060 
you'll end up missing spots lawn you
won't<00:02:52.810> really<00:02:52.959> realize<00:02:53.380> your<00:02:53.560> data<00:02:53.739> until<00:02:53.980> you

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
won't really realize your data until you

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.530 
won't really realize your data until you
come<00:02:54.220> back<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.670> month<00:02:54.850> or<00:02:54.970> two<00:02:55.060> later<00:02:55.090> and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
come back and a month or two later and

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.060 
come back and a month or two later and
see<00:02:55.660> your<00:02:55.810> lawn<00:02:55.959> has<00:02:56.200> green<00:02:56.440> stripes<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:56.950> it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
see your lawn has green stripes in it

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.490 
see your lawn has green stripes in it
but<00:02:57.820> when<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.150> comes<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.540> buying<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:59.050> spreader<00:02:59.410> I

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
but when it comes to buying a spreader I

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.080 
but when it comes to buying a spreader I
really<00:02:59.920> would<00:03:00.040> recommend<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.550> go<00:03:00.700> with<00:03:00.910> a

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
really would recommend you go with a

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.510 
really would recommend you go with a
rotary<00:03:01.630> spreader<00:03:01.930> as<00:03:02.290> opposed<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.280> drop

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
rotary spreader as opposed to a drop

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.400 
rotary spreader as opposed to a drop
spreader<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.209> what<00:03:04.870> we're<00:03:04.959> going<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.110> do<00:03:05.230> now

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
spreader and what we're going to do now

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.770 
spreader and what we're going to do now
is<00:03:05.709> just<00:03:05.739> go<00:03:06.010> ahead<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.580> spread<00:03:07.150> some<00:03:07.570> grass

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
is just go ahead and spread some grass

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.400 
is just go ahead and spread some grass
seed<00:03:07.810> over<00:03:08.260> our<00:03:08.380> entire<00:03:08.500> lawn<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:10.200> then<00:03:11.200> we

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
seed over our entire lawn and then we

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.810 
seed over our entire lawn and then we
should<00:03:11.560> be<00:03:11.620> pretty<00:03:11.800> much<00:03:11.890> be<00:03:12.100> done<00:03:12.130> with<00:03:12.700> the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
should be pretty much be done with the

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.970 
should be pretty much be done with the
exception<00:03:13.150> of<00:03:13.209> watering<00:03:13.630> so<00:03:14.500> there<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.830> go

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980
