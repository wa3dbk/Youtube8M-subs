00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.130
 it's the story of an enemy haunting 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.099
 automotive engineers and 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.080
 boxers the weight just as it slows down 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.910
 an overweight athlete increases the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.820
 fuel consumption and reduced 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.289
 the efficiency of a car but we do not 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.970
 can not put a car on a diet 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.310
 its hull must be solid and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.880
 rigid in order to be safe and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.609
 manageable with skyactiv we had for 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.519
 goal of increasing rigidity 30% and 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.439
 reduce weight by 8% 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.750
 we did it by using 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.010
 more high strength steel more 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.899
 sturdy and lighter than steel 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.489
 and using 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.260
 energy evacuation routes more 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.390
 effective collision because the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.070
 imprint the entire body 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.289
 we wanted to reduce the weight of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.120
 chassis while improving agility and 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.309
 the stability of vehicles masta 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.680
 adoption of more steering systems 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.840
 quick to improve agility at low 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.730
 speed while a style geometry 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.039
 European is for the front suspension a 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.930
 significantly increased stability at high 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.520
 speed at the back 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.019
 we have changed the inclination of 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.519
 wheels and the pivot points of the arms of 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.590
 suspension to improve stability 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.820
 and reduce the plunge of the line a wine 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.530
 braking 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.330
 it is only by starting from scratch that we 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.100
 have been able to make such changes 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.840
 often they are factories 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.729
 different that manufactures the chassis and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.200
 the coop of the vehicles then 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.090
 make compromises so that each 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.710
 piece adapted to others rather than 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.570
 be integrated in perfect harmony 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.790
 with adjacent pieces 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.710
 but since our body cap can 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.970
 work with our chassis ranges we 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.189
 do not have to compromise 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.780
 another example why not 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.729
 enjoy areas of the body 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.530
 reinforced to mount the pieces of the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.470
 suspension instead of reinforcing others 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.600
 areas result a 14% reduction from 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.290
 chassis weight without compromise for the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.509
 road holding 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.490
 finally analysis we have reached 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.380
 surprising numbers but the numbers 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.670
 are not enough the owners of 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.280
 mazda want or if a car 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.140
 powerful and pleasant to drive this 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.149
 that we did by improving the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.090
 driven by details that they will be able to 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.700
 so enjoy and awesome masdar 1 for 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.890
 their sensible solutions boxer you 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.180
 can still run the technology this 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.250
 case 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.440
 active mazda the future of driving 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.600
 goals here we build some 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.600
 masters and you what carbide and you
