I<00:02:20.320> also<00:02:20.709> really<00:02:21.130> enjoyed<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.400> fact<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:21.820> each

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
I also really enjoyed the fact that each

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.540 
I also really enjoyed the fact that each
magic<00:02:22.570> skill<00:02:22.930> felt<00:02:23.290> important<00:02:23.980> something<00:02:24.459> you

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
magic skill felt important something you

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.400 
magic skill felt important something you
just<00:02:24.700> don't<00:02:24.880> see<00:02:25.090> in<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.269> lot<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:25.450> other<00:02:25.690> RPGs

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
just don't see in a lot of other RPGs

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.370 
just don't see in a lot of other RPGs
now<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.190> bed<00:02:27.550> I<00:02:27.910> only<00:02:28.239> have<00:02:28.480> two<00:02:28.810> faults<00:02:29.140> that

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
now the bed I only have two faults that

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.320 
now the bed I only have two faults that
really<00:02:29.650> pop<00:02:29.830> into<00:02:30.070> my<00:02:30.220> head<00:02:30.250> well<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.060> story

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
really pop into my head well the story

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.810 
really pop into my head well the story
is<00:02:31.420> hardly<00:02:31.900> bad<00:02:32.110> actually<00:02:32.890> it's<00:02:33.040> pretty<00:02:33.250> good

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
is hardly bad actually it's pretty good

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.580 
is hardly bad actually it's pretty good
it<00:02:33.910> seems<00:02:34.420> pretty<00:02:34.660> like<00:02:34.959> throughout<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.290> lot<00:02:35.560> of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
it seems pretty like throughout a lot of

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.930 
it seems pretty like throughout a lot of
major<00:02:35.920> parts<00:02:36.340> where<00:02:36.519> they<00:02:36.610> could<00:02:36.820> have

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
major parts where they could have

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.150 
major parts where they could have
actually<00:02:37.150> got<00:02:37.480> us<00:02:37.630> attached<00:02:38.050> well<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:38.800> like

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
actually got us attached well I like

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.280 
actually got us attached well I like
Aurora<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:39.910> her<00:02:40.150> company<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.780> never<00:02:41.019> felt

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
Aurora and her company I never felt

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.020 
Aurora and her company I never felt
connected<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:42.040> them<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.550> want<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:42.910> feel

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
connected to them and I want to feel

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.539 
connected to them and I want to feel
connected<00:02:43.209> an<00:02:43.810> RPG<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.590> that's<00:02:45.100> just<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.370> big

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
connected an RPG and that's just a big

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.610 
connected an RPG and that's just a big
no-no<00:02:45.820> when<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.330> doesn't<00:02:46.510> work<00:02:46.870> out<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.170> way

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
no-no when it doesn't work out that way

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.220 
no-no when it doesn't work out that way
I<00:02:47.860> also<00:02:48.280> felt<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.760> was<00:02:49.030> far<00:02:49.299> too<00:02:49.540> easy<00:02:49.780> even

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
I also felt that was far too easy even

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.320 
I also felt that was far too easy even
on<00:02:50.500> hard<00:02:50.739> mode<00:02:50.860> while<00:02:51.280> some<00:02:51.519> bosses<00:02:51.760> made<00:02:52.150> me

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
on hard mode while some bosses made me

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.900 
on hard mode while some bosses made me
think<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:53.110> game<00:02:53.350> felt<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.799> bit<00:02:54.160> grindy<00:02:54.790> at

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
think the game felt a bit grindy at

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.370 
think the game felt a bit grindy at
moments<00:02:55.330> because<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:55.690> were<00:02:55.780> actually<00:02:55.989> never

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
moments because you were actually never

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.289 
moments because you were actually never
in<00:02:56.620> danger<00:02:56.799> of<00:02:57.100> actually<00:02:57.519> dying<00:02:57.880> with<00:02:58.269> the

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
in danger of actually dying with the

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.870 
in danger of actually dying with the
exception<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:58.989> certain<00:02:59.200> bosses<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:00.459> felt

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
exception of certain bosses so I felt

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.940 
exception of certain bosses so I felt
this<00:03:01.090> was<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.330> flaw<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:01.989> maybe<00:03:02.260> next<00:03:02.560> time<00:03:02.769> they

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
this was a flaw and maybe next time they

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.650 
this was a flaw and maybe next time they
can<00:03:03.130> make<00:03:03.280> harder<00:03:03.640> enemies<00:03:03.760> or<00:03:04.209> at<00:03:04.390> least<00:03:04.540> a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
can make harder enemies or at least a

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.570 
can make harder enemies or at least a
harder<00:03:05.049> difficulty<00:03:05.560> than<00:03:05.769> just<00:03:06.010> hard<00:03:06.280> mode

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
harder difficulty than just hard mode

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.250 
harder difficulty than just hard mode
waits<00:03:07.120> fun

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
waits fun

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:19.080
