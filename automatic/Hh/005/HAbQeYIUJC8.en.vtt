00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.460
 and we are going to prepare puff pastry 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.950
 Fill the ingredients we need 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.190
 they are a sheet of puff pastry prepared 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.190
 ham or sweet chopped bacon or 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.240
 chopped bacon that are chips to taste 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.910
 tomato sauce and an egg and let's 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.970
 start stretching our sheet well 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.820
 of puff pastry prepared and fresh and what 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.859
 let's fold over itself along 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.920
 in such a way that we have to do the 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:36.129
 more or less equal separations as if 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.670
 outside a triptych we see doubles and 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:43.640
 we go back to stretch and bend 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.649
 and we stretch again in such a way that 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.800
 will help us to know where the 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.710
 filling our braid we throw in the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.600
 center a little ketchup and you 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.089
 we put the filling that of course 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.469
 It can be the one we want alone 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.869
 that we have to be careful not to 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.940
 put too much then we could 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:03.530
 overflow then into the oven in the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.170
 cooking 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.850
 we have used mozzarella cheese 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.189
 although it released enough water already also 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.800
 inside the oven so I recommend you 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.710
 that you use the cheese that you want always 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.869
 that is grated and a bit hard and now 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.640
 with the help of a knife let's go 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.799
 making oblique cuts in the sheet and 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.590
 measuring the same size with the 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.630
 help of our finger 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.369
 I do not know if I explain myself well but I think 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.369
 is the image if it looks very good 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.110
 and we have to do like a sala saloj 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.720
 to the ground and let's start with one of the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.580
 tips 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.810
 rising above the filling like 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.990
 you see and crossing the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.409
 this we close it with pinches so that 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.799
 then in the oven does not open 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.770
 and we continue raising a strip of a 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.649
 side and another strip of another and crossing the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.780
 in such a way that we will be making a 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.299
 braid 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.190
 this is the most entertaining part and 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.840
 you have children you will love it 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.840
 give them a hand to do it 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.540
 as you see when we get to the end we 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.880
 we manage a little how we can 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.380
 pinching the dough well so that 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.380
 then do not open us in cooking 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.830
 we tap on the sides 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.440
 to adapt it well 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.680
 and we are going to beat the egg that we had 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.989
 reserved 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.450
 to paint the puff pastry and that way 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.939
 more golden and pretty the oven what 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.209
 we have to have preheated to 200 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.209
 degrees 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.610
 we painted our braid well 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.650
 and with the oven already hot at 200 degrees 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.750
 we will put it in the part a little bit more 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.870
 low to cook well on the part of 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.629
 down about 20 minutes until 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.959
 that is well golden once done 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.750
 this is better than letting it cool down 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.209
 a little while around another 20 minutes 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.210
 because otherwise it will not be hard enough to 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.940
 drive 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.890
 and I have done this we can already serve it and 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.230
 we have our list plait 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.290
 puff pastry that you see is pretty 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.720
 simple and very easy to prepare in addition 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.720
 that is very nice and original os 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.720
 I can assure you it is delicious
