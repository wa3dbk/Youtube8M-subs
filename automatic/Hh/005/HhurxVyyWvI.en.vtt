saw<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.750> trailer<00:01:31.400> but<00:01:32.400> now<00:01:32.700> let's<00:01:32.850> move<00:01:33.090> on

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
saw in the trailer but now let's move on

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.830 
saw in the trailer but now let's move on
to<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.900> black<00:01:34.170> ops<00:01:34.439> 2<00:01:34.860> care<00:01:35.700> package<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.659> it's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to the black ops 2 care package so it's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.600 
to the black ops 2 care package so it's
not<00:01:37.020> actually<00:01:37.500> being<00:01:37.710> called<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> prestige

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
not actually being called the prestige

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760 
not actually being called the prestige
edition<00:01:38.720> it's<00:01:39.720> being<00:01:39.930> called<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.439> care

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
edition it's being called the care

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.460 
edition it's being called the care
package<00:01:41.400> now<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.270> believe<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.899> reason<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
package now I believe the reason for the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.350 
package now I believe the reason for the
separation<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.369> name<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.909> obviously

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
separation of that name is obviously

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.969 
separation of that name is obviously
because<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.170> going<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.380> cost<00:01:46.619> more

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
because this one is going to cost more

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.830 
because this one is going to cost more
you<00:01:47.610> know<00:01:47.729> where<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> prestige<00:01:48.299> editions<00:01:48.750> in
