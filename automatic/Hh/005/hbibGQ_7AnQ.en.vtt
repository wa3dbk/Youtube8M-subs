do<00:01:42.840> anything<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.380> them<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.219> think<00:01:44.520> every

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
do anything for them so I think every

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.219 
do anything for them so I think every
person<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.539> school<00:01:45.600> came<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
person in the school came here for a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.670 
person in the school came here for a
reason<00:01:46.289> and<00:01:47.420> LEP<00:01:48.420> offers<00:01:48.960> more<00:01:49.170> than<00:01:49.229> other
