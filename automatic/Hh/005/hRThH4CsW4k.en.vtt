00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Hi, everyone, how are you waiting? 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.490
 you are very well I feel very much no 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.020
 have been able to upload videos on Friday 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.480
 nor on Sunday but for questions 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.400
 personal was impossible but here 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.230
 I am one more day with a new mission 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.660
 As you know, I've been improving a bit 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.029
 more action and changed places and I 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.580
 I wanted to personalize it a little bit 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.070
 some of some decoration but a 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.320
 little more to my style and more personal and I 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.510
 love the idea of ​​putting pictures because it's 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.830
 with my friends photos of me pictures of things 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.140
 that I like I think it gives a touch 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.850
 as very personal and different than me 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.530
 at least I love that in the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.090
 life of them I give three different ideas 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.250
 to decorate our room with 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.710
 photos so if you are interested in following 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.680
 watching the video to do this good was 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 there I will use this box with photos 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.170
 and decorative elements the truth is that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.170
 It's very very complete and it's great 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.560
 contains all the photos that you have 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.460
 selected 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:03.960
 in my case there are 40 photos this tape 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.750
 decorative with dots a rope for 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.790
 hook the photos small clips 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.790
 to hook the photos to the rope 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.670
 these stickers for the corners of the 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.340
 Photos 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.729
 and two envelopes to give a photo to 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.729
 Who do you want 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.500
 we started with the first idea first of 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.540
 nothing will I be testing with a bottle 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.700
 that all are of the same measure as 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.290
 would be and the space that I need more or 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.480
 least to not start hitting and then 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.160
 wrong and once you have your clear 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.160
 start to paste the photos with zeal 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.310
 this time I'm going to put the pictures of 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.750
 way that the word love is written 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.780
 I think it's not a pretty idea 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.970
 original that can be very cool and if 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.250
 we do it well especially with patience 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.840
 measuring well the distances between a 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.840
 photo and another one is your list 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.970
 to 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.970
 ah 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.329
 Y 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.310
 for the next idea I will use 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.650
 these stickers that are put on the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.269
 corners of the photos and as before 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.189
 first of all I will see how 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.349
 would be the photos and distances 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.060
 between them so as not to be mistaken and a 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.040
 Once I have this, I will start to put 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.720
 little corner and stick it then safe and I 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.720
 go to like me as I go seeing 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.480
 for the next idea I'm going to need 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.070
 the rope appointment and the tweezers in the first 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.070
 place we will measure how much piece 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.870
 we want to thread in my case it was not much 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.730
 since I'm going to do it vertically, not in 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.190
 Horizontal which it is like women 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.959
 we are more used to see what I put 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.850
 on the wall a very finite thumbtack 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.250
 white so you can barely notice and there 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.590
 we will tie the cord 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.330
 once it is well secured we will begin to 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.330
 put our pictures with the tweezers 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.830
 I hope you liked it very much 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.780
 leave it for the comments which of the 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.980
 three ideas have you liked more for me the 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.139
 of the logo that I think has been 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.330
 very cool and at least I love it 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.630
 thank you very much for being there one day 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:42.210
 more and see you soon on Friday in 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.210
 the next video a chao
