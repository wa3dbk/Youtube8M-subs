00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
low heat just to get a little bit of a

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.980 
low heat just to get a little bit of a
liquid<00:06:24.770> out<00:06:24.950> of<00:06:25.100> there<00:06:25.310> and<00:06:25.550> to<00:06:26.360> firm<00:06:26.600> it<00:06:26.630> up<00:06:26.840> a

it<00:06:29.360> for<00:06:29.390> seasoning<00:06:29.720> and<00:06:30.170> I<00:06:30.950> suggest<00:06:31.520> you<00:06:31.760> do<00:06:31.970> it

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
it for seasoning and I suggest you do it

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.940 
it for seasoning and I suggest you do it
with<00:06:32.450> one<00:06:32.870> of<00:06:33.050> the<00:06:33.140> chips<00:06:33.410> that<00:06:33.560> you're<00:06:33.770> going

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
with one of the chips that you're going

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.030 
with one of the chips that you're going
to<00:06:34.010> use<00:06:34.280> because<00:06:34.910> your<00:06:35.270> chip<00:06:35.510> might<00:06:35.870> be<00:06:36.110> more

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.040 
to use because your chip might be more

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.820 
to use because your chip might be more
salty<00:06:37.610> than<00:06:38.050> what<00:06:39.050> you<00:06:39.200> might<00:06:39.320> think<00:06:39.590> so<00:06:39.680> if
