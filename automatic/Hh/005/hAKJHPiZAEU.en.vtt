the best thing I can say is that if no

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.160 
the best thing I can say is that if no

care about wrestling we could read the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.889 
care about wrestling we could read the
book<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:05.640> they<00:00:05.879> would<00:00:06.000> draw<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.240> qualities
