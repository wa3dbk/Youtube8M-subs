00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
to cut some cards just like this I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.560 
to cut some cards just like this I
should<00:01:31.619> point<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:32.820> you're<00:01:32.970> using<00:01:33.299> a

key card on the bottom of the deck
multiple<00:01:36.659> swing<00:01:36.960> cuts<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.680> way<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.130> have

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
multiple swing cuts can be a way to have

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.789 
multiple swing cuts can be a way to have
that<00:01:38.790> card<00:01:39.060> replaced<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.140> that's<00:01:40.290> selected

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
that card replaced so if that's selected

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.370 
that card replaced so if that's selected
card<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.909> do<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> few<00:01:42.329> swing<00:01:42.659> cuts<00:01:42.930> they<00:01:43.170> say

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
card we do a few swing cuts they say
