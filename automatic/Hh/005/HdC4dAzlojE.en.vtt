00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 good morning to everyone salutes bid 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.899
 falca bucay and today I come with a video of 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.790
 theory where I will treat the theory that the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.820
 character of the sixth digimon saga 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.980
 sounds moon x 7 upper mode can be 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.830
 or not the strongest anime character 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.140
 until now well those who have seen the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.060
 sixth digimon saga will know that this 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.859
 character only appears in battle 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.990
 against darkness bayamón who has 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.609
 absorbed into dark knight moon so 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.070
 has increased his powers of form 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.109
 considerable in addition to the attacks 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.669
 devastating things he could do with his 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.469
 right arm that can kill 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.329
 any one blow now 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.300
 has new attacks extremely 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.430
 powerful though sound moon x 7 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.500
 superior mode is infinitely more 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.629
 powerful than the first because the ray 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.670
 black Garamond partners is easily 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.860
 blocked by sound moon without even 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.780
 move a finger and this one could defeat 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.570
 bagram on with a single blow of his sword 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.309
 the most important thing is not that but the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.079
 fact that the black beam of bagram on 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.449
 it is practically the same as 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.609
 big-bang change me increased 100 times 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.290
 vogue is super sayayin 4 with a 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.600
 force so great that it can destroy 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.630
 completely to planet individuals 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.460
 and galaxies including universes besides 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.320
 from the fact that it disintegrates everything 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.270
 touches what makes it one more attack 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 powerful that the big-bang kamehameha has 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.130
 increased 100 times but sound money is 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.140
 unchanged by the attack manages to block it 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.930
 as if it were a miserable stone 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.119
 also if it manages to block an attack so 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.890
 powerful as that would be the best 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.990
 vogue attack is very much in doubt 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.240
 vegeta could put even a finger 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.159
 over to sound moon because I would not have the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.110
 enough strength to go through his 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.090
 shield and with the huge power of 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.640
 sound mont gogh eta would be beaten with 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.500
 just an attack other aspects of 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.450
 sound moon is that when it becomes 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.580
 its most powerful way we can see 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.590
 clearly that merges with all the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.869
 we said that they exist except for 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.970
 bayamón so it is logical to think that 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.950
 has all its attacks in addition to the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.380
 attacks he had in his sound form 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.479
 moon x 7 before moving to top mode 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.640
 a variety of attacks that in itself 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.649
 could cause problems for characters 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.600
 as it is already wallow card and with the power 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.069
 that now has sound mont I doubt a lot 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.009
 that the two mentioned above 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.470
 they could do something against him other 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.200
 well-known characters from other series 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.570
 how lucy ichigo natsu takes out virgo 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.490
 among others, they could not beat 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.290
 sound moon and boy because he does not have the 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.960
 enough power to go through 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.060
 shield and would be defeated quickly lucy 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.040
 for the same reasons besides that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.350
 have greater weakness to objects 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.390
 cutting and follows if the sword of 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.340
 sound moon disintegrates what it touches is 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.410
 obvious to think that lutfi would be totally 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.880
 destroyed in natsu combat 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.520
 it just does not have what it takes 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.740
 to beat sound moon and although many 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.600
 they would say that he pulls out he could simply put 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.940
 to salmon to walk forever in the 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.980
 hand of buddha this is also not possible 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.870
 it has been shown that the shield of 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.180
 sound moon is a separate space of 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.280
 our space time and reality is 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.350
 say that everything that happens inside is 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.630
 a powerful projection of what happens 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.880
 in another alien and incomprehensible dimension 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.770
 said projection is sufficiently 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.630
 powerful to let sound moon 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.430
 affect our dimension through their 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.620
 attacks without your own space 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.690
 separated is affected by none 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.000
 attack class so it takes out no 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.640
 could do anything to sound moon and it would be 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.709
 expired immediately and in the event that 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.940
 sound moon could be hurt thing that 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.700
 it is impossible 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.410
 can destroy both organic matter 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.660
 as inorganic that surrounds it for 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.400
 absorb the regenerate and increase of 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.500
 size since it's a skill 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.540
 innate of the said and has been seen 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.790
 bagram on using it at the same time in 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.440
 the one who fights against Simon for the last time 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.480
 therefore sound moon can 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.550
 regenerate as many times as you need 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.100
 although he does not need it because his shield is 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.110
 impenetrable and if you ask yourself why 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.000
 is that others we said have not used it in 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.280
 the saga is because you need to have 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.200
 certain power to use it and so far 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.750
 only agramón and simon have been so 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.360
 powerful to do that in conclusion 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.700
 taking into account all these points is 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.860
 obvious that sound moon x 7 superior mode 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.230
 is the most powerful character of what 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.300
 we know as anime and even those who 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.580
 before they were considered the most powerful 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.590
 they are like flies before him for the reasons 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.900
 that I have already shown and there is not even 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.390
 individuals in other universes capable of 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.820
 beat him as superman hong and others 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.760
 characters none of them has what 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.530
 it takes to beat simon we could 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.440
 say that it is a kind of god 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.690
 totally invincible but if they do not want 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.790
 believe that sound moon is the most powerful 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.640
 and it is well after all everyone 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.920
 he has his opinion good that's all for 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.810
 today I hope you liked it and we 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:46.000
 we see in another video 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:46.000
