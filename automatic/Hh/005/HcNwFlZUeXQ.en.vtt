00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
limited distance it doesn't go on

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.969 
limited distance it doesn't go on
forever<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> ice<00:01:07.080> spike<00:01:07.380> does<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> same

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
forever so the ice spike does the same

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
forever so the ice spike does the same
amount<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.250> damage<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> shock<00:01:09.030> Ram<00:01:09.380> all

right<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.659> let's<00:01:30.840> go<00:01:30.930> ahead<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> charge<00:01:31.320> this

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
right so let's go ahead and charge this

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.840 
right so let's go ahead and charge this
up<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.920> let<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.729> go<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:33.750> 12<00:01:34.049> 12<00:01:34.290> 12<00:01:34.500> 18<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
up and let it go so I get 12 12 12 18 so

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.109 
up and let it go so I get 12 12 12 18 so
Chris<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.270> 18<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.630> hits<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.560> 12<00:01:37.770> mostly<00:01:38.159> but

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
Chris for 18 and hits for 12 mostly but

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.910 
Chris for 18 and hits for 12 mostly but
if<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> notice<00:01:39.479> sometimes<00:01:39.990> it'll<00:01:40.439> go<00:01:40.650> off<00:01:40.740> by

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
if you notice sometimes it'll go off by

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.469 
if you notice sometimes it'll go off by
itself<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.460> you'll<00:01:41.850> bounce<00:01:42.060> around<00:01:42.270> with

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
itself and you'll bounce around with

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.530 
itself and you'll bounce around with
different<00:01:42.930> enemies<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.430> may<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.670> also<00:01:45.119> used

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
as a heat-seeking re so on the top half

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.520 
as a heat-seeking re so on the top half
of<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> body<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.570> had<00:01:48.689> two<00:01:48.960> different<00:01:49.110> upgrade
