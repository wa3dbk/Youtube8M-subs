interesting on the inside 3 centimeters

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.870 
interesting on the inside 3 centimeters
from<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.570> but<00:03:13.340> can<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.400> see<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.610> kind<00:03:14.790> of

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
ridge in the in the lock bar now I were

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.890 
ridge in the in the lock bar now I were
feeling<00:03:20.970> because<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.299> thing<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:21.660> strong

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
feeling because this thing is so strong

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.170 
feeling because this thing is so strong
it<00:03:21.959> just<00:03:22.170> slams<00:03:22.350> into<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.799> lot<00:03:23.040> bar<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:24.030> that

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
it just slams into a lot bar and that

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.500 
it just slams into a lot bar and that
may<00:03:24.329> be<00:03:24.390> what's<00:03:24.540> causing<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.320> chip<00:03:25.530> I

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
may be what's causing the the chip I

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.850 
may be what's causing the the chip I
don't<00:03:27.510> know<00:03:27.660> but<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.230> can't<00:03:28.530> think<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.739> any

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
don't know but I can't think of any

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.990 
don't know but I can't think of any
other<00:03:29.010> reason<00:03:29.040> why<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.610> check<00:03:29.850> would<00:03:29.940> be

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
other reason why that check would be

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.130 
other reason why that check would be
there<00:03:31.040> in<00:03:32.040> terms<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.519> coincidence<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.959> also

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
there in terms of a coincidence and also
