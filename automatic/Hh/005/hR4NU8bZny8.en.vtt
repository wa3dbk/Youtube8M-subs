00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
of this bridge slot or you have to take

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.910 
of this bridge slot or you have to take
some<00:00:58.429> off<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:59.139> saddle<00:01:00.139> itself<00:01:00.649> or<00:01:00.859> a

some off the saddle itself or a
combination<00:01:01.399> of<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.729> two<00:01:01.969> and<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.269> takes<00:01:03.019> a

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
combination of the two and it takes a

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.770 
combination of the two and it takes a
little<00:01:03.260> finesse<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:03.979> make<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.640> parts<00:01:05.630> fit

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
little finesse to make the parts fit

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.230 
little finesse to make the parts fit
together<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:07.220> b-band<00:01:07.700> system<00:01:08.210> is<00:01:10.150> thinnest<00:01:11.150> a

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
together the b-band system is thinnest a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.730 
together the b-band system is thinnest a
piece<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.420> paper<00:01:11.690> and<00:01:11.840> normally<00:01:12.500> it<00:01:12.590> doesn't

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
piece of paper and normally it doesn't

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.110 
piece of paper and normally it doesn't
require<00:01:12.950> any<00:01:13.430> modification<00:01:14.090> whatsoever<00:01:14.570> and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
require any modification whatsoever and

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.970 
require any modification whatsoever and
it's<00:01:17.120> my<00:01:17.450> thought<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.200> be<00:01:18.350> bad<00:01:18.560> system

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
it's my thought that the be bad system

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.830 
it's my thought that the be bad system
sounds<00:01:19.310> much<00:01:19.580> more<00:01:19.730> accurate

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.069 

this<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> dsl<00:01:26.219> electric<00:01:26.520> system<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.929> has

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
this is a dsl electric system and it has

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.959 
this is a dsl electric system and it has
a<00:01:28.109> little<00:01:28.469> bit<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.679> a<00:01:28.859> kwakiash<00:01:29.369> into<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.969> and

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
a little bit of a kwakiash into it and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.569 
a little bit of a kwakiash into it and
that's<00:01:32.969> until<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.200> banned<00:01:34.500> came<00:01:34.740> along<00:01:35.009> they

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that's until be banned came along they

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.359 
that's until be banned came along they
all<00:01:35.819> had<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.649> Gibson<00:01:37.649> makes<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> real<00:01:38.159> nice

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
all had that Gibson makes a real nice

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.230 
all had that Gibson makes a real nice
system<00:01:38.880> which<00:01:39.420> used<00:01:40.009> piezo-electric

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
system which used piezo-electric

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.649 
system which used piezo-electric

had<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.079> those<00:01:46.200> guitarists<00:01:46.860> sounds

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
had one of those guitarists sounds

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.959 
had one of those guitarists sounds
pretty<00:01:47.670> darn<00:01:47.969> good<00:01:48.109> and<00:01:49.109> ovation<00:01:50.039> was<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
pretty darn good and ovation was a

pretty darn good and ovation was a
pioneer<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:52.039> guitar<00:01:53.039> amplification<00:01:53.459> and<00:01:53.939> they

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
pioneer in guitar amplification and they

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.569 
pioneer in guitar amplification and they
had<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> really<00:01:54.780> really<00:01:55.020> good<00:01:55.289> system<00:01:55.709> the<00:01:56.310> bark

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
had a really really good system the bark

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.729 
had a really really good system the bark
is<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.509> they<00:01:57.659> were<00:01:57.720> stoked<00:01:58.049> yet<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.409> electric

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739 
is but they were stoked yet so electric

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.529 
is but they were stoked yet so electric
