00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.910
 Today I want to give you a new pattern 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.930
 imagine and make case 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.259
 that does not mean we just have something 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.989
 leave out as thought 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.700
 but it has a different reason 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:28.340
 case masses are very much so 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.739
 nice for people who say that takes time 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.950
 Eternal until I go back there when it forest 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:36.950
 is long and it makes the whole thing what 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.360
 one then strictly a little more relaxed and 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.140
 faithfully maybe in the fire protection too 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.510
 work 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.560
 but let's start I have ten 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.960
 added industries 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.690
 just so we can see it once we take 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.420
 the first stitch as usual and then 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.580
 Let's take the thread and wrap it 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.710
 Just two times around that one can 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.960
 of course, change more and more 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.340
 I knit several times or once 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.020
 quite normal a right hand stitch at the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.119
 next I do the same again 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.049
 I leave the thread twice around the nail 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:12.140
 glide and stretch again 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.130
 That's what I do about the whole thing 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.619
 The series I have twice around the nail 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.920
 a knit knit the whole thing 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.399
 once twice around the needle an assist 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.710
 crocheted 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.259
 I can say that ten more times 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.299
 because I'm ten but only about it 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.619
 show but I also had carpenter 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.920
 just when there are 190 to come 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.920
 out 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:51.909
 At the end of the day, we are the most beautiful medium 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:54.100
 yes, but it fits in our days 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.210
 again a piece then we turn the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.259
 work in turn and now comes 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.990
 actually the whole thing 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:07.390
 We take the first stitch again 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:09.429
 just from then we pull the the 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.130
 thread that we have wrapped around so 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.450
 Just go back and knit the 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.720
 mesh right left apology 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.040
 on the left you can not drink it either 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.110
 always depends on what you for one 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.019
 we would like to take effect then 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.150
 again the frank on the next down 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.900
 knit again just right 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.569
 in that case 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.640
 We will also run that what 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.560
 We wound up and down 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.110
 knit the needle has like her 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.550
 number as well as she appears to do that 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.070
 We also go back and forth over the whole series 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.100
 then that's what you call the fall 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.640
 masks fall which we took before 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.380
 to have 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.640
 therefore this expression case mesh 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.480
 How to leave the needle 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.450
 just glide and drink the one 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.320
 why the winds at the beginning from the 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.700
 be it if since this has the effect the 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.100
 You will see if I do the work 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.820
 turn back and knit over it 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.959
 and then you realize what I am 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.780
 with the purpose 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.739
 and even if I say it gets faster 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.100
 while walking knit 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.850
 so now we are done once 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.190
 knitted and now have significantly on 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.780
 once such an end made 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.540
 why did we do it because of us 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.310
 the wrong ones 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.410
 they form a larger pattern 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.660
 longer pattern so you can also 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.160
 easy things man 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.110
 that means I would but everyone 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.870
 actually recommend it at least afterwards 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.360
 a back and return to knit in 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.280
 summer a nice pattern also somewhere 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.440
 A firmness always remains a chorus 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.570
 but you also have one at the same time 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.000
 Whole end where else I might be 3 1 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.250
 or 4 1 stretch because I can in 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.290
 principle diarrhea mesh faster 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.860
 to reach 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.250
 So we have a bottle 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.790
 wearing 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.680
 I hope it might be exciting 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.900
 Tell me you can work it 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.570
 Definitely cool from old man soon 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.190
 exactly and then falls very well where 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.430
 then you can relax a bit 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.110
 as I said you can also with the series 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.520
 knit on the right knit city 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.950
 with a left as I did it 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.270
 that appears from the right then we have 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.990
 Here is my effect where then again 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.360
 a curly row comes in but that 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.230
 tried out if you want to 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.230
 have fun next time
