00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.910
 [Music] 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.190
 so ready packed hello that you 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.380
 there are the holidays are coming up 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.020
 and I start in my well deserved 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.369
 holiday the lab stays so 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.369
 closed next day 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.629
 that's nice here 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.309
 sun beach and sea gorgeous now 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.309
 I enjoy the warm sun 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.870
 This is clearly a case for the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.960
 sunscreen police who was that 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.969
 I was allowed to crab lime rabl 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.479
 The sunscreen police here on the beach 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.460
 sun protection police yes there you have 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.190
 heard correctly you have forgotten yourself 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.590
 cream and fell asleep 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.720
 tune and in this sun can do that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.220
 give a proper sunburn 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.190
 exactly 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.600
 you have to cream yourself I need that 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.920
 Luckily I do not have a hard one 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.729
 hand , he tells me in front of the sunbeams 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.670
 protects 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.610
 nice and good but you know how 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.149
 Sunscreen protects the skin 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.380
 not the chemistries so watch out 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:39.240
 I'll explain how it works 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.190
 First, you should know that 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.740
 sunlight from different species of 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.830
 radiate exists with different 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.350
 two of these radiate the wavelengths 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.440
 invisible to your eyes are the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.650
 so-called uv a and uv b radiate 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.870
 uva rays are boring 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.510
 emit less energy than uv b 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.890
 penetrate deep into the skin and wear 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.380
 there for aging and wrinkles at 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.990
 uv b rays are shortwave 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.890
 more energy than uv a rays and 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.640
 only penetrate into the epidermis they are 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.510
 chiefly responsible for one 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.150
 sunburn 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.840
 both types of radiation effect one 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.370
 browning 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.010
 This is the natural protection 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.080
 Skin mechanism without sunscreen 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.950
 However, both types of radiation are 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.840
 dangerous and what exactly does that belong to 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.510
 suncream 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.770
 it is a so-called emulsion the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.580
 is a mixture of different 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.830
 materials 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.020
 These substances work together like one 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.880
 chemical filter that converts the 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.930
 dangerous energy of the rays in 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.790
 heat around 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.780
 In addition, a part of the rays 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.070
 Reflects and protects the skin 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.560
 So sunscreen reduces the danger 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.320
 to get a sunburn and lets 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.970
 you are getting brown as the 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.160
 sunscreen, however, a little time 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.590
 needs to penetrate the skin and 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.390
 there should unfold their effect 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.850
 you already sunbathe 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.660
 cream and then about 30 minutes 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.220
 waiting 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.959
 thanks for the explanation professor gross 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.410
 Now you should get in fast 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.420
 war 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.430
 thank you for leaving me in time 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.010
 have you woken up otherwise I would have one 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.750
 sunburn get clear the 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.580
 Sunscreen Police is always on 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.320
 location 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.600
 Sunscreen means sunscreen 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.580
 I certainly do not get one now 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.010
 sunburn but do not forget 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.470
 despite sunscreen you should never 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.800
 so stay in the sun for a long time and the 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.570
 Refresh sunscreen 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.970
 and even if you're under the umbrella 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.160
 are ought ye always nice one 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.170
 cream because the rays reach you 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.060
 also in the shade 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.440
 caution here speaks to the sun 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.160
 to install or so they say 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.770
 Needs to say hello has to wake up 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.890
 and have fun in the holidays new 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:08.900
