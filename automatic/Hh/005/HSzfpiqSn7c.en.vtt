00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.520
 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel of 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.469
 in the happy art today flash videos for 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.660
 present you some novelties s se 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.849
 also present you other products that 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.279
 normally use this brand that 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.350
 I particularly appreciate then we start 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.170
 with the first novelty it is the pen 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.150
 of the pen for magnetic nail art 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.010
 or a pen that will allow us to 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.590
 make decorations on the glazes 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.960
 freehand magnetic then a 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.400
 unlike the classic calamity that 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.590
 before it was used on enamel 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.960
 magnetic that gave us a drawing already 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.909
 default thanks to this celine pen 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.080
 so good to us to make a drawing 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.820
 definitely a very nice thing 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.159
 innovative I remember that year 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.809
 last talked about it and it was only 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.330
 available obviously in america 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.369
 this year thanks to God also in Italy 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.059
 it is also available thanks to being more 

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:02.330
 that god is right away of course I wanted it 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.640
 try the curious is very skeptical 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.590
 among other things also because the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.729
 essence magnets normally not 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.770
 worked 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.560
 I didn't trust this pen so much 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.810
 honestly, however, I have to say that instead 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.550
 works also veil anticipated on 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.460
 facebook page I showed you some 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.350
 scribbles made fake wallpapers and ho 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.510
 thought to let you see right in the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.010
 video how it works and therefore also 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.300
 give him a guarantee 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.350
 actually for all the girls 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.380
 skeptical like me and let's go straight 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.350
 prove it then use and a polish 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.620
 magnetic of the laila which is the magnificent 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:48.100
 and it is gray 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:50.600
 the number is here and 0 1 then 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.120
 let's go first put the nail polish 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.080
 on the nail then as when there 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:02.300
 let's put the normal magnet in this 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.060
 so obviously I suggest to abound 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.670
 that enamel because just like in the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.120
 case of the classic disaster also 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.180
 this time if we use more nail polish 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.819
 the design will be more evident then mi 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.740
 I recommend putting so much 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.420
 obviously before drying it 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.360
 nail polish we act with the pen 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.610
 watch 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.550
 when I approach the pen with enamel 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.770
 move to see how it works ie 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:34.140
 really nice an effect 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.000
 now I also do drawings anyway 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.820
 very very simple so that 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.890
 you can see the effect enough 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.010
 simply approach and move the 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.620
 pen as you like this case me 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.260
 I made a line and some contini e 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.300
 so really very simple drawings 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.400
 just to let you see the effect here 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.550
 now below I do others 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.739
 little and how you see the pen works 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.739
 which then is the goal of this a 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.630
 to show precisely what can be bought 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.060
 among other things, it costs very little 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.070
 essence products cost less than 3 euros 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.390
 even in this case we are more or less 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.390
 about two euros and something 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.980
 the packaging is this is a sachet 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.020
 transparent and here are also i 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.780
 drawings of the various possibilities 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.270
 purification and then introduce the 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.980
 so there is no grease pen is not there 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.780
 nothing but in reality there is none 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.260
 need anyway because a pin 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.930
 iron therefore also quite resistant 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.410
 the pen is more or less the length of 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.019
 god my finger including a gap is this 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.090
 here is the pen then in the art la 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.310
 I will also show you some news 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.620
 decoration I did goes well in 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.170
 in this case there are some dots 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:56.040
 very simple then I also did here 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.630
 other dots I also had two others 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.459
 enough proof in the drawer 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.380
 anyway then on the blog I will publish it 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.870
 art lines that I will make thanks to this 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.790
 pen but over pen and I want 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.330
 also present two other innovations that 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.400
 they are two topper then one is this one 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.820
 which is a topper with micro glitter and 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.930
 inside also the flakes 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.430
 iridescent so that they change a little 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.229
 color is the top for number 15 and vi 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.229
 i really show the swatch 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.650
 fantastic is that here i put one 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.180
 base an electric blue enamel and above 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.760
 same the topper because obviously it is 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.710
 these are transparent and inside 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.920
 currencies 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.280
 and these tips here it is as I have 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.010
 said is the number 15 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.260
 very very marine a beautiful life 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.270
 then I also show this other one 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.640
 it's always a bit so always 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.920
 transparent and is the number 16 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.740
 initially I deluded myself that it was 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.150
 like the one that rocked that last 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.630
 this effect did a bit 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.830
 changing, however, was with the flakes and 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.290
 but no this is with gods 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.950
 define them as sequins are more or 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.960
 less than pocket money does not make an effect 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.820
 very strong in reality in the 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.500
 small bottle is much stronger than the effect 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.810
 so I'll show you and many 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.890
 on the nail here it is this one 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.380
 black glaze and there are precisely these 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.270
 a bit shimmering sequins and this one here 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.320
 it a blue enamel 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.720
 however this is also very beautiful 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.640
 topper surely I would have preferred 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.860
 that other more radiant effect though 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.110
 all right as I told you 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.150
 this is the number 16 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.990
 still very nice in the little bottle 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.090
 promises more here it is here then 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.070
 as I told you, they are the two topper at a 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.820
 another product I want to talk to you about 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.920
 is the base here it is here of this base ve 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.840
 I talked a lot about it on the page 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.430
 because so many times girls 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.780
 they ask for a good foundation that I do 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.430
 last so much nail polish 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.230
 well this is one of my favorites 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.900
 unfortunately I don't know lynch i yet 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.020
 facts I have to guarantee that there is not 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.520
 formaldehyde crap inside though I have to 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.200
 tell the truth while using it 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.570
 I also found myself very well 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.510
 because it is a nail polish that makes the nail 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.430
 opaque therefore causes the enamel 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.290
 adhere assets lengthens and that 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.600
 automatically last longer then 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.660
 definitely a great base hoping that 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.340
 precisely even the incised to such 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.230
 let's check it, but here it is anyway 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.160
 I recommend it because I really liked it 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.190
 lot 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.660
 it's called 24 7 is nothing new came out 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.420
 already last year though these have 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.430
 not even a proposal and even this one 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.540
 price of about 2 euros but what of 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.770
 gender 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.110
 then another thing I want you to do 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.210
 seeing even the last is solvent 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.380
 I want to tell you why on the page ne 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.180
 we talked a lot 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.410
 some guys are also confused 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.660
 because I always say that mine 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.130
 the preferred solvent is the essence though 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.020
 unfortunately many boys have taken 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.570
 the wrong one or this one here 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:00.110
 blue this blue contains 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.610
 then the acetone they a solvent s se 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.220
 however and with acetone then 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:07.280
 absolutely not recommended while instead 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.260
 what advice is just and there is 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.200
 just written acetone fi 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.760
 so do not be mistaken used 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.550
 the one without a class, not even because it is 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.470
 excellent, however, removes the enamel of 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.120
 enamel number very quickly and 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.640
 it doesn't hurt lengthens unlike 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.740
 this then bull to us this blue has 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.140
 a very unpleasant smell this rose 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.910
 also better as a fragrance then 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.850
 I definitely recommend pink and 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.560
 do not confuse the two with nothing 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.390
 girls for today that's all as i have 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.670
 said it was really a flash video I hope 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.800
 soon to be able to make a video like it 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.810
 it must also above all nail art 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.790
 because I have very many that 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.650
 I want to do and share with you 

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.230
 unfortunately time has always been a 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.000
 will bring in this at this time 

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.550
 let's put it this way I hope I can anyway 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.160
 give weapons as soon as possible and dedicate yourself 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.410
 here are some more videos in the meantime vi 

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.540
 I send you a kiss and as always 

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.980
 I thank you for the whole company and for 

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.940
 all the beautiful words you tell me 

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.320
 left in the comments 

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.320
 a kiss hello hello
