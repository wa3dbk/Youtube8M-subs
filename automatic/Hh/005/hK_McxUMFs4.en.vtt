00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.190
 Are you watching terrace and now we're going to bagé municipality? 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:09.530
 accompanying a new technology on the same month of 2010 in September air was 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.849
 carla torres 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:11.869
 because it's bad 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.379
 here at embrapa livestock farming south we will know the work that has been 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.210
 carried out two years ago with the creation of quarries on piles 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.269
 best match on this work is the researcher reports sônia 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.269
 30 year sentence how this process works 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:27.749
 be fulfilled 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.979
 and if the system creates and determines Chinese tarkas during the phase of 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:36.769
 on the third day the third day of animal life when he 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.570
 is separated from the mother until the puc of chalita mint 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.740
 is when our then there to give us milk if we feed the calf 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.040
 are active are kept as you can observe here in beijing to heaven 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.690
 open is how the use of trees in the surrounding system 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.550
 when they are of this month they are held by nylon ropes of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.770
 about 2 05 meters to Christmas stakes where on the top 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.280
 we can observe that before support spreads 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.820
 or one 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.100
 a feed container for concentrate 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.860
 and another container where we use 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.329
 water to avoid being used for animals and today is also provided 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.460
 twice a day the milk 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.470
 animals are then kept during the 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.680
 recess pickets 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.690
 he still we have 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.870
 At the disposal of the animals one hour is here. 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.630
 development of this monogastric animals to comedians in this 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.929
 track these phoenix are then placed 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.929
 in addition to the offensive for two animals 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.340
 very important to note that these animals they maintain eye contact but 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.900
 cuba do not maintain the physical contact turner are placed so that they 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.150
 interact knox 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.749
 are advised to see but can not 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:04.890
 this board 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.890
 to avoid contamination of the 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.219
 so little animal 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.779
 that's what you've been watching to teach the system 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.500
 well we observe 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.049
 is she the hulk? 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.769
 a superiority of the benfica even 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.779
 the exam he follows more obtained before this phase the order of 28% in front 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.279
 to another traditional sterilization system are created 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.970
 it's in a picket the only loose 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.500
 with collective shelter and cossu for feeding back to feed 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.970
 so much that concentrated fenacon 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.670
 also collective then these animals created and in this house and during that 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.129
 period gained 1 28% faster than another system 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.979
 we did during the entire observation period 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:59.969
 four four days 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:05.079
 where the age group was observed, the behavior of these 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.009
 animals 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.899
 wheelchair user 12 hours and then we noticed 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:12.889
 what animals are doing every 10 minutes and breeds this behavior 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.099
 if activity was noticed 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.730
 we have the power it was possible to observe then that in this treatment of the 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.419
 stakes the sieves started looking for food are arid as fanny 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.029
 focused 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:30.290
 duke who in the treatment of animals were tradition 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.040
 with the treaty ce pa together then here in that also to test the cover that 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.150
 healing by solid foods started earlier and when we closed then 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.879
 the four observation periods was possible 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.109
 also notice here 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.779
 when they closed the darts these animals in view that they spent more time 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:55.750
 consuming or looking for concentrated hay 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.849
 to animals of the 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.849
 the traditional treatment 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:05.289
 The objective of this system is to reduce mortality in sic 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:11.189
 and to become socks in the future these milk producers 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:19.249
 In addition, this system increases the dairy herd by providing greater 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:20.369
 gain for the producer
