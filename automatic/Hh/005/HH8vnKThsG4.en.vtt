eating them deer movement can be

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.260 
eating them deer movement can be
controlled<00:04:59.560> like<00:04:59.740> this<00:04:59.979> on<00:05:00.130> almost<00:05:00.310> any<00:05:00.760> small

controlled like this on almost any small
property<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.919> trick<00:05:03.220> is<00:05:03.460> to<00:05:03.760> have<00:05:04.090> very<00:05:04.419> heavy

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
property the trick is to have very heavy

property the trick is to have very heavy
cover<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.320> to<00:05:05.889> have<00:05:06.040> isolated<00:05:06.340> food<00:05:07.000> sources

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
cover and to have isolated food sources

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.020 
cover and to have isolated food sources
so<00:05:08.320> that<00:05:08.350> several<00:05:08.710> dull<00:05:09.070> families<00:05:09.520> can<00:05:09.729> use<00:05:09.880> it

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
so that several dull families can use it

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.350 
so that several dull families can use it
at<00:05:10.150> once<00:05:10.389> and<00:05:10.690> they<00:05:11.530> can<00:05:12.220> run<00:05:12.520> through<00:05:12.820> it<00:05:13.000> like

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
at once and they can run through it like

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.140 
at once and they can run through it like
a<00:05:13.389> maze<00:05:13.889> escaping<00:05:14.889> the<00:05:15.280> harassment<00:05:15.669> of<00:05:16.030> the
