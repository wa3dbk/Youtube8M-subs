00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.899 
was fine for comments saying that the
referee<00:02:04.200> didn't<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.740> control<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.729> game

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909

for<00:02:59.800> San<00:03:00.040> Jose<00:03:00.550> you're<00:03:00.790> gonna<00:03:01.000> see<00:03:01.270> RSL<00:03:01.750> with

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
for San Jose you're gonna see RSL with

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.780 
for San Jose you're gonna see RSL with
majority<00:03:02.320> of<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.500> possession<00:03:02.920> they<00:03:03.430> want<00:03:03.730> to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
majority of the possession they want to

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.460 
majority of the possession they want to
have<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.120> ball<00:03:04.300> at<00:03:04.450> their<00:03:04.570> feet<00:03:04.810> san<00:03:05.140> Jose's

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
have the ball at their feet san Jose's

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.290 
have the ball at their feet san Jose's
gonna<00:03:05.680> look<00:03:05.950> for<00:03:06.160> their<00:03:06.280> opportunities<00:03:07.000> in

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
gonna look for their opportunities in

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.300 
gonna look for their opportunities in
that<00:03:07.510> previous<00:03:07.750> match<00:03:08.110> up<00:03:08.380> RSL<00:03:08.950> had<00:03:09.100> almost

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
that previous match up RSL had almost

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.550 
that previous match up RSL had almost
150<00:03:10.000> more<00:03:10.150> passes<00:03:10.630> than<00:03:10.660> them<00:03:11.050> so<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.260> think<00:03:11.350> we

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
150 more passes than them so I think we

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.350 
150 more passes than them so I think we
can<00:03:11.680> expect<00:03:12.010> something<00:03:12.250> similar<00:03:12.700> but<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.210> can

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
can expect something similar but you can

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.300 
can expect something similar but you can
