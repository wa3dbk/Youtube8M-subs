00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
your script it's a good idea to take a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.100 
your script it's a good idea to take a
stopwatch<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.430> read<00:01:57.210> through<00:01:57.780> all<00:01:57.810> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
this will give you a rough time frame of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.609 
this will give you a rough time frame of
how<00:02:02.939> long<00:02:03.180> your<00:02:03.360> film<00:02:03.600> will<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.229> main<00:02:04.409> rule

filming is that a page of action and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.350 
filming is that a page of action and
dialogue<00:02:07.200> should<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.220> about<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.489> minute<00:02:08.940> when
