00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
and we're gonna take them out now once

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.820 
and we're gonna take them out now once
we<00:01:02.110> get<00:01:02.230> these<00:01:02.470> out<00:01:02.730> we're<00:01:03.730> going<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.830> number

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
we get these out we're going to number

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.940 
we get these out we're going to number
our<00:01:09.030> easiest<00:01:10.030> way<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.210> do<00:01:10.479> it<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:11.560> just<00:01:11.619> set

our easiest way to do it and just set
your<00:01:12.070> screws<00:01:12.369> aside<00:01:12.490> but<00:01:13.149> we're<00:01:13.359> gonna<00:01:13.479> number

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
your screws aside but we're gonna number

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:15.660 
your screws aside but we're gonna number
them<00:01:14.200> on<00:01:14.469> the<00:01:14.829> length<00:01:15.070> we're<00:01:15.280> gonna<00:01:15.369> get<00:01:15.579> two

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
them on the length we're gonna get two

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.700 
them on the length we're gonna get two
new<00:01:15.820> plug<00:01:16.060> wires<00:01:16.329> and<00:01:16.479> match<00:01:16.869> them<00:01:17.079> up<00:01:17.229> before

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
new plug wires and match them up before

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.109 
new plug wires and match them up before
we<00:01:17.829> take<00:01:18.009> them<00:01:18.159> off<00:01:18.369> so<00:01:18.670> we<00:01:18.700> can<00:01:18.909> save

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
we take them off so we can save

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.399 
we take them off so we can save
ourselves<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.600> lot<00:01:19.689> of<00:01:19.749> trouble<00:01:19.899> having<00:01:20.289> to

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
ourselves a lot of trouble having to

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.109 
ourselves a lot of trouble having to
figure<00:01:20.560> out<00:01:20.710> where<00:01:20.829> the<00:01:20.950> wires<00:01:21.130> go<00:01:21.399> alright<00:01:21.819> so

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
figure out where the wires go alright so

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.059 
figure out where the wires go alright so
once<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.539> get<00:01:22.630> that<00:01:22.810> last<00:01:23.140> screw<00:01:23.590> out<00:01:23.770> the

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:24.069 
once you get that last screw out the

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:25.529 
once you get that last screw out the
whole<00:01:24.219> coil<00:01:24.520> pack<00:01:24.789> should<00:01:25.030> come<00:01:25.270> right<00:01:25.479> out

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
whole coil pack should come right out

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.870 
whole coil pack should come right out
now<00:01:25.990> all<00:01:26.229> we<00:01:26.350> have<00:01:26.469> to<00:01:26.530> do<00:01:26.770> just<00:01:27.159> take<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.490> coil

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
now all we have to do just take the coil

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.429 
now all we have to do just take the coil
pack<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.390> follow<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:28.780> wires<00:01:28.960> down<00:01:29.229> and

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
pack and follow the wires down and

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.410 
pack and follow the wires down and
unplug<00:01:29.829> them<00:01:29.950> from<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.219> sillim<00:01:30.579> there<00:01:30.789> we<00:01:30.939> go

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
unplug them from the sillim there we go

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.940 
unplug them from the sillim there we go
that's<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.840> for<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.200> now<00:01:32.560> we're<00:01:32.710> just<00:01:32.829> gonna

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
that's it for that now we're just gonna

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.039 
that's it for that now we're just gonna
take<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.399> wires<00:01:33.609> we're<00:01:34.030> gonna<00:01:34.149> follow<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
take the wires we're gonna follow the

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.959 
take the wires we're gonna follow the
lengths<00:01:35.409> of<00:01:35.530> them<00:01:35.710> on<00:01:35.859> the<00:01:36.069> new<00:01:36.189> coil<00:01:36.490> pack<00:01:36.700> and

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
lengths of them on the new coil pack and

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.149 
lengths of them on the new coil pack and
match<00:01:37.210> them<00:01:37.420> right<00:01:37.569> up<00:01:37.719> okay<00:01:38.200> so<00:01:38.259> for<00:01:38.859> the<00:01:38.950> sake

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
match them right up okay so for the sake

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.010 
match them right up okay so for the sake
of<00:01:39.189> this<00:01:39.429> video<00:01:39.700> let's<00:01:40.149> pretend<00:01:40.539> that<00:01:40.719> these

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
of this video let's pretend that these

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.410 
of this video let's pretend that these
two<00:01:41.229> coil<00:01:41.530> packs<00:01:41.829> are<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.399> same<00:01:42.670> which<00:01:43.030> they

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
two coil packs are the same which they

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.090 
two coil packs are the same which they
definitely<00:01:43.780> aren't<00:01:44.079> big<00:01:44.319> hump<00:01:44.530> on<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.740> bottom

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
definitely aren't big hump on the bottom

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.700 
definitely aren't big hump on the bottom
and<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.819> plug<00:01:46.030> wires<00:01:46.270> are<00:01:46.630> way<00:01:46.899> bigger<00:01:47.469> on

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
and the plug wires are way bigger on

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.389 
and the plug wires are way bigger on
this<00:01:47.859> one<00:01:48.069> so<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.700> gotta<00:01:49.209> send<00:01:49.359> this<00:01:49.420> back<00:01:49.719> but

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
this one so I gotta send this back but

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
we're gonna do is take our coil pack and

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.970 
we're gonna do is take our coil pack and
let's<00:02:38.480> just<00:02:38.630> say<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:38.960> is<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.290> new<00:02:39.440> one<00:02:39.650> we

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
let's just say this is the new one we

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.370 
let's just say this is the new one we
would<00:02:40.100> take<00:02:40.280> out<00:02:40.490> a<00:02:40.520> wire<00:02:40.820> okay<00:02:41.480> we<00:02:41.900> find<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
would take out a wire okay we find the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.230 
would take out a wire okay we find the
same<00:02:42.620> length<00:02:42.920> there<00:02:43.190> we<00:02:43.340> go<00:02:43.460> they<00:02:43.670> are<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.030> this

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
same length there we go they are so this

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.300 
same length there we go they are so this
one<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.840> going<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.230> be<00:02:45.410> number<00:02:45.650> three<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.160> the

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
one is going to be number three it's the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.730 
one is going to be number three it's the
same<00:02:46.550> exact<00:02:47.000> link<00:02:47.270> as<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.540> original<00:02:48.350> one<00:02:48.500> so

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
same exact link as the original one so

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.200 
same exact link as the original one so
I'm<00:02:48.980> going<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.130> take<00:02:49.340> this<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.940> would<00:02:50.090> just

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
I'm going to take this and I would just

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.990 
I'm going to take this and I would just
put<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.510> on<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:50.900> one<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.380> that's<00:02:51.560> three<00:02:52.000> but

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
measure the length some of the boxes

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.600 
measure the length some of the boxes
come<00:03:00.410> with<00:03:00.650> grease

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
back we got one more which is

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.789 
back we got one more which is
three<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.959> that's<00:03:31.109> gonna<00:03:31.290> be<00:03:31.469> right<00:03:31.650> that

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
three and that's gonna be right that

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.399 
three and that's gonna be right that
middle<00:03:32.129> now<00:03:32.459> we're<00:03:32.790> gonna<00:03:32.909> go<00:03:33.120> ahead<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.629> push

down<00:03:34.439> until<00:03:34.980> we<00:03:35.519> hear<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.819> click<00:03:36.650> there<00:03:37.650> we<00:03:37.739> go

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
down until we hear and click there we go

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.069 
down until we hear and click there we go
how<00:03:38.159> long<00:03:38.189> clicked<00:03:38.640> now<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.540> get<00:03:39.659> a<00:03:39.689> watch<00:03:39.870> out

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
how long clicked now you get a watch out

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.899 
how long clicked now you get a watch out
for<00:03:40.290> your<00:03:40.500> silver<00:03:41.010> head<00:03:41.280> temperature<00:03:41.700> switch

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
for your silver head temperature switch

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.250 
for your silver head temperature switch
it's<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.299> middle<00:03:42.569> if<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.109> gets

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
it's in the middle if that gets

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.780 
it's in the middle if that gets
unplugged<00:03:43.500> while<00:03:44.219> you're<00:03:44.340> trying<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.579> put<00:03:44.700> the

unplugged while you're trying to put the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.640 
unplugged while you're trying to put the
wires<00:03:44.969> in<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.599> all<00:03:45.750> have<00:03:45.930> air<00:03:46.109> conditioning

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
wires in you all have air conditioning

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.369 
wires in you all have air conditioning
or<00:03:46.859> a<00:03:47.280> temperature<00:03:48.150> sensor<00:03:48.569> on<00:03:48.750> your<00:03:49.109> gauge

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
or a temperature sensor on your gauge

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.619 
or a temperature sensor on your gauge
your<00:03:49.920> coolant<00:03:50.819> temperatures<00:03:51.239> won't<00:03:51.420> show<00:03:51.599> up

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
your coolant temperatures won't show up

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.479 
your coolant temperatures won't show up
great<00:03:51.989> so<00:03:52.290> make<00:03:52.439> sure<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.739> stays<00:03:52.980> plugged<00:03:53.310> in

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
great so make sure that stays plugged in

there in Japan or whatever but if it is
front-wheel<00:04:46.560> drive<00:04:46.740> then<00:04:47.250> you<00:04:47.400> just<00:04:47.580> go<00:04:47.699> from

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
front-wheel drive then you just go from

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.870 
front-wheel drive then you just go from
the<00:04:48.090> timing<00:04:48.780> belt<00:04:48.930> or<00:04:49.199> timing<00:04:49.530> chain<00:04:49.770> one<00:04:50.580> two
