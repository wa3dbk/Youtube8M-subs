me<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> help<00:01:39.479> kill<00:01:39.659> some<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.900> these<00:01:39.960> mofos

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.039 

targeting<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.159> completely<00:01:44.909> auto<00:01:45.210> aiming<00:01:45.689> so

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
targeting is completely auto aiming so

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.670 
targeting is completely auto aiming so
whenever<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.680> near<00:01:46.890> an<00:01:47.159> enemy<00:01:48.680> it'll

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
whenever you get near an enemy it'll

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.080 
whenever you get near an enemy it'll
just<00:01:49.829> automatically<00:01:50.220> target<00:01:50.610> them<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.880> start

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
just automatically target them and start

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.700 
just automatically target them and start
shooting<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.420> its<00:01:51.570> own<00:01:51.750> I'm<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.409> sure<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:52.619> it's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
shooting on its own I'm not sure if it's

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.460 
shooting on its own I'm not sure if it's
like<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.860> with<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:54.390> physical<00:01:54.960> controllers

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
like that with the physical controllers

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.929 
like that with the physical controllers
I<00:01:55.590> know<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.920> controller<00:01:56.340> support<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.909> I

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
I know there is controller support so I

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.429 
I know there is controller support so I
don't<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.180> if<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.390> also<00:01:57.540> does<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.049> with<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
don't know if it also does that with the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.859 
don't know if it also does that with the
controllers<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.340> kind<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.329> kind<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.689> kills

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
controllers but kind of kind of kills

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.179 
controllers but kind of kind of kills
some<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.140> technique<00:02:01.469> involved<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.159> just

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
some of the technique involved you just

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.560

character around and hope

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.570 
character around and hope
and<00:02:06.410> just<00:02:06.560> let<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.770> autotargeting<00:02:07.280> do<00:02:07.430> its

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
and just let the autotargeting do its
