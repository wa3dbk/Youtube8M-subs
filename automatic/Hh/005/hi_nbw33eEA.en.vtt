00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:12.870
 speak today we will talk about nucleic acids 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.299
 which are macromolecules present in all 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.910
 living beings because they are called 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.150
 macromolecules because they are molecules that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.100
 have a high molecular weight 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.490
 formed units that repeat themselves 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.220
 called the nucleotide 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.960
 are in turn composed of 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.010
 three basic components 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.800
 the sugar phosphate and a base 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.079
 hydrogenation invariably between the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.420
 public acts, phosphate will always be the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:49.469
 even paper 43 - sugar can be a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.710
 deoxyribose present in the dna or a 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.840
 ribose present in the amide and bases 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.350
 are divided into two 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.640
 groups or groups of public or 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.439
 purines the group of prime bases or 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.260
 the public bases 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.950
 they have two carbon rings and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 are adenine and guanine and the bases 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.330
 policies also called to ask 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.290
 measures may be thymine cytosine and 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.439
 horace vila which also for aseel 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.979
 Let's first talk about dna or acid 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.200
 deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA is a 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.619
 double-stranded macromolecule 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.470
 these tapes are anti-parallel and 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.369
 complementary because complementary 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.460
 because every time I have the adenine of 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.399
 one side on the other side I'll have thymine 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.570
 Every time I have water girl I 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.450
 I will have the cytokine then mine 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.530
 with tantalum and agostin binds with 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.140
 cytokine because of this is important 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.329
 point out that in a dna molecule 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.270
 amount of adenine will always be equal 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.750
 quantity and quantity equal to the quantity 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.119
 mine 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.830
 always equal to the quantity of 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.840
 cytokine to study whether the name 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.990
 The Great Sore Graf Strings 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.620
 these nuclei of these specific 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.550
 monuments of Jenny name silva never 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.610
 forget 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.310
 every time a g has been expressed it is 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.860
 responsible person is responsible for the 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.630
 characterization of a particularity in the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.640
 cell 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.400
 dna also has another 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.920
 particularity it by the action of enzymes 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.670
 have the ability to 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.500
 replicate this replication happens in a 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.170
 certain stage of the life cycle of the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.959
 cell called intel phase to be more 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.080
 phase is whether in the phase of 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.770
 synthesis and replication of dna 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.200
 it is the basis of eternity because this 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.320
 dna replication gives rise to two 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.340
 new molecules conserving half of the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:10.450
 molecule and it is called the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.360
 100m Conservative Replication Never 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.269
 forget it never forget that dna is 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.880
 the informational molecule is the molecule 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.239
 who holds that he has 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.519
 ability to characterize everything and 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.980
 any particularity our body of 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.880
 our body that any of the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.790
 living beings 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.040
 dna is the master molecule that is 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.640
 responsible for characterizing the world 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.070
 live another nucleic acid is 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.530
 very important for the expression of 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.560
 of the characteristic is ribonucleic acid 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.480
 or r is that unlike in a 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.280
 presents only one daughter of 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.709
 nucleotides so it gives the name of 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.590
 single-stranded nucleic acid 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:58.000
 other differences observed for example 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.440
 in the aura sila instead of china and 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.860
 sugar is not the ribose r dose disorder 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.850
 every ra without exception is formed of dna 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.290
 through a process called 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.590
 transcription involving enzymes 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.750
 RNA polymerase specific calls 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.120
 transcription in all cells 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.400
 occurs inside the 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.490
 already in jungles pro cariocas like 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.020
 for example if the news bacteria 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.150
 this process of 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.599
 this process of synthesis of 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.740
 scratching happens in the cytoplasm is 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:39.840
 important to note that the 3rd basics 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.759
 the messenger the rich ribosome and the rna 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.069
 the messenger is that 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:48.669
 who has the message is the one who has the 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:51.580
 information for protein centers for 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.099
 translation of the messenger he is formed 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:58.330
 from the nucleotide information is 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:05:00.220
 such a tn master molecule at the url of 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.630
 sonic is the one who participates in the 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.039
 structure of the organelle ribosome 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.169
 indispensable for the process of 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:13.500
 translation and beyond the conveyor 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:16.539
 transports the amino acids in a 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.810
 specific to the translation process 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:22.659
 it is important to observe 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.180
 that for the formation of the messenger in 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:29.050
 eukaryotic cells to a process 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.340
 important one called splice o 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:35.400
 spice aims to remove regions 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.620
 inactive to form the messenger 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.360
 called mature you ask me 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.940
 as well 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.029
 the following is the transcription process 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.490
 in eukaryotes for the formation of a 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:50.650
 messenger network is previously formed 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.229
 the heterogeneity 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.139
 this gene is called heterogeneous because 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:59.860
 have inactive regions called 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:02.349
 tones and active regions called edson 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.180
 I can not put a smile on you 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.759
 active and inactive regions 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.940
 the cytoplasm to form a protein 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.909
 otherwise the protein would be wrong or 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.900
 would not be processed then it is important 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:18.130
 regions have throne houses or 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.219
 introns are removed 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.699
 and this withdrawal is carried out by experts 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:27.190
 molecules that are dna molecules 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:29.979
 calls for ribose but when the 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.240
 spice when you remove the inputs only 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.419
 stay the ex 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.469
 and there is the name of the messenger 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.729
 that goes into the cytoplasm if 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:43.599
 binds the ribosomes 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:46.949
 form them if the polis homo and 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:52.870
 protein synthesis the rma transporter 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:57.309
 arrives at a specific site and deposits the 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:59.740
 site is not forgotten on the website and 

00:06:57.309 --> 00:07:03.939
 ribosome the first amino acid to 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:06.729
 methionine and the translation is processed there 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:09.719
 before all this information never 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:12.789
 forget that the basic differences between 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:16.389
 dna are extremely exploited 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:19.240
 remember that the dna has two tapes of 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:21.819
 only one that the process of 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:25.569
 dna replication call doubling 

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:28.960
 you will not replicate that rn is 

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:32.949
 formed by transcription by action 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:36.639
 of enzymes that the dna has china that the rna 

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:40.240
 It has cure sila that the dna has 10 oxy 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:43.659
 ribose and that the ribose is not 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:48.669
 forget there is no difference between dna 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:51.459
 when you analyze phosphate and bases 

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:56.229
 which are equal both to the 

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:59.999
 tell jennia the adenine and guanine study 

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:59.999
 enough and until the next
