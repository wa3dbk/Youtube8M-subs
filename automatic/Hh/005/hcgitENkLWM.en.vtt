00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that ambulance right and that's a huge

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.160 
that ambulance right and that's a huge
problem<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:36.060> erode<00:01:36.450> trust<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:37.020> that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
problem we can erode trust in that

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.569 
problem we can erode trust in that
because<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:37.560> people's<00:01:37.950> lives<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
because that's people's lives on the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.670 
because that's people's lives on the
line<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.240> no<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> wouldn't<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
line so no I wouldn't do it on that and
