 project where that came out 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.280
 Well, you can say it's because of the plate 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.930
 of the missile but I would lie to you because the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.310
 truth I just went on one day 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.920
 I said I'm going to change it as I 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.920
 I will put and I do not know how I do it 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.820
 how did you meet cabbage 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.830
 with young boys tones and I met him 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.090
 lords of modern warfare 2 I started 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.490
 tell me with the capi and it was because I 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.650
 was at that time it was very vice 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.110
 multiplayer gears of gears of war 2 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.330
 since they were all there in the modern 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.950
 warfare and speed that said what 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:25.460
 is what each one has his life 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:28.280
 prestige that this click game 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.460
 I was a week is like that of everything 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.580
 I said I'm going to buy the modern 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.860
 warfare and then there is a ue and so what 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.710
 I knew and logically the goal something that 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.280
 started in this way bales and zombies like 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.630
 You met him as you were interested 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.140
 Zombie zombie alone is as if by a 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.930
 time I went with a friend and he told me 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.750
 you want to play and I said no because I do not know you 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.440
 with something cool and their children came to 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.180
 with a bit of multiplayer wow 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.970
 then the vato told me now we're going to 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.310
 get us into this zombies and he already touched me with 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.550
 some crickets I do not remember that my 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.900
 first weapon was an ugly gun is the 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.530
 first time I had contact with 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.630
 zombies you can say and it's still 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.730
 until after the warm posts 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.239
 they migrated to the white all I bought it and 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.550
 the capsule with all my friends assholes 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.660
 that we arrived at round 4 as all the 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.970
 world 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.640
 and in fact with them I was discovering 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.180
 that the fa capon that drinks that lula 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.340
 but they were no longer interested in the zombie 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.990
 I was nothing but the one who caught with that 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.710
 and they are already on their side I already have 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.870
 very much that I do not talk to them but what 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.360
 day was like you on your own 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.960
 well this one investigate and all that and no longer 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.860
 He interested them they already are 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:57.280
 ok and why be part of the clan to be 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.940
 part of why this clan happens to us 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.500
 is from pure people the truth that I know 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.060
 that my interest many of your friends 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.820
 because they like the same thing as me 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.250
 that is me when I talk to one of you 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.290
 you guys that I talk to you and they're going to 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.230
 give a good answer or we can 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.180
 share ideas I do not know theories or equal 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.310
 clean and almost things that I know they 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.470
 no and they know things that I do not and so 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.430
 to be able to share information and between 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.560
 it can be said to turn on perfect 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.060
 that with this person in favorite and for 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.289
 what 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.919
 definitely my favorite character by addition 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.919
 what is good 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:46.520
 for the implementation of women but not 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:51.349
 to the truth and good this question that 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:54.710
 I wanted to make you have some other 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.150
 I can say some expectation of what 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.470
 would be the following map or better said 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.529
 what is your expectation from the 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.549
 next map what do you expect from origins 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:08.209
 I hope from ory the best actually he 

00:05:04.549 --> 00:05:11.469
 makes it very difficult for you to exceed what 

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:13.879
 it's been in the east of ham because 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:16.099
 I really do not think there's anything that 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:18.199
 I compare him but I hope please 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.839
 Overcome this you see that it is a very good thing 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.339
 and that with a good taste in mouth for 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:29.679
 whites 3 because we're going to be a good 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:31.939
 long without anything perfect then and good 

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:33.859
 for all some questions from the 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:36.049
 subscribers one of them from that 

00:05:33.859 --> 00:05:38.719
 nor that he asks if you were going to make a 

00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:41.259
 orgy with three clan members who 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.259
 you would choose 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.420
 then I would choose spider first 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:54.140
 a poetic 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.140
 I dont know 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:07.470
 the following next try that 7 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.480
 ask how you met me how 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:14.390
 did you know my channel question p nk 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.810
 I knew your channel more than anything because of me 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:20.960
 brother because in the center I worked 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.700

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:34.120
 know your channel he went to see all your 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:37.850
 videos and I saw it passes that 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:40.280
 you comment gone and little by little I left 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.890
 sitting with the asad unitis but 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.660
 they attracted a lot of attention and more than 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:48.710
 nothing was for you so it started me 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:56.800
 draw attention to the history of the 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:56.800
 two pinches 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.420
 next question how good many 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:05.840
 many have the doubt is something like 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:08.930
