00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:14.259
 - very much at night fattens a lot 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.779
 people think that if because we are going to 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.000
 sleep in a while the body will ventilate 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.500
 your metabolism and those carbohydrates like 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.019
 they burned us will not be stored as 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.970
 fat however if consumed by the 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.710
 day it seems we would have more 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.900
 odds of burning them 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.550
 this seems reasonable truth during the 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.410
 sleep it seems that the metabolism is 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.750
 slows down and will burn less than 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.010
 we study certain assets that seems 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.080
 be that that slowdown of 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.270
 metabolism during sleep happens 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.640
 only at the beginning during our 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.340
 sleep there are ups and downs of the 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.530
 metabolism the body recovers by the 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.240
 night and that also has an expense 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.100
 important energy depends on what 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.960
 phase of the dream we find ourselves will have 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.730
 increases or decreases in goal 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.280
 anyway this is not the most 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.040
 important the main thing is to understand that 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.320
 you and I are going to get fat or lose weight 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.390
 the total caloric not by ingesting 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.400
 carbohydrates at night I explain if 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.830
 you eat more calories than you 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.659
 you'll have to take weight if 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.880
 opposite and you want less than what 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.710
 you spend from home losing weight this we 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.300
 the lackluster joshua logan we have to 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.850
 keep in mind that this is the most 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.640
 important the thermodynamics of the body 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.500
 the main factor one thing that we have 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.360
 to be clear is that we do not 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.450
 we work as if we were a machine 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.910
 that needs instantaneous energy at 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.560
 moment to function not like that 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.060
 we work, that is, we 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.039
 we can perform any activity 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.910
 we can go running we can go out to 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.800
 swim 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.020
 any activity without the need of 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.700
 before ingesting carbohydrates as 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.100
 the typical cars of the chosen one that is one 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.140
 Has the battery or the batteries does not start 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.119
 us if we can do that our 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.860
 body has the ability to save 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.110
 carbohydrates in the form of 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.270
 glycogen in our muscles and liver 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.480
 principal therefore if by day you 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.730
 have you been doing 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.620
 exercise left to run get the 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.970
 high physical activity state in 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.610
 movement enough to go up and down 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.590
 external stairs your body will be 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.780
 used the carbohydrates that they had 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.130
 glycogen stores if you have not 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.370
 contributed during the day those 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.080
 carbohydrates is to say your body takes out 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.850
 within the muscle , and liver 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.770
 carbohydrates needed to perform 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.720
 the activities you have to do 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.950
 therefore if by day you have been 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.990
 with a high physical activity or 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.600
 exercising and is not ingested 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.770
 carbohydrates in the same way 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.020
 get exercise with those 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.730
 activities because your body has taken 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.530
 the carbohydrates of the deposits 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.540
 of glycogen that you have in the body in 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.220
 liver muscles therefore by the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.050
 night may suggest a lot of 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.120
 carbohydrates that are not going to be stored 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.250
 as fats and they will not be stored in 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.380
 those glycogen deposits capacity or 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.910
 during the day anyway remember 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.250
 that the most important thing is the total 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.410
 caloric I'll put a very extreme example 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.260
 so you can tell if a person 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.730
 during the day he does a lot of activity 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.150
 physical 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.430
 Exercise goes running to the gym 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.159
 etcetera and it consumes absolutely nothing 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.060
 no food if that person arrives by 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:10.819
 the night and they eat a loaf of bread or 300 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.530
 grams of rice or 15 cookies is 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.090
 I do not care that amount of 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.190
 carbohydrates are not going to be stored as 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.349
 Fat you really think that person 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.210
 would get fat from eating those carbohydrates 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.960
 at night 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.360
 the answer is that not to fatten up already 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.180
 will take one or two loaves of bread or 300 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.490
 grams or 400 of rice at night that 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.350
 person does not get fatter day because spending 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.780
 caloric in the morning has been very 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.930
 large and at the end of the day is by 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.940
 below what you need and you will lose weight 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.390
 even if you eat carbohydrates at one of 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.460
 the night 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.980
 it does not matter those carbohydrates are 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.600
 they would use to be stored in the 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.050
 glycogen deposits and as per the 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.660
 tomorrow has spent more energy really 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.160
 at the end it falls below those 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.200
 calories are not enough to 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.940
 gain weight this concept is the one that 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.500
 you have to understand we do not get fat for 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.180
 to eat carbohydrates for profit or 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.190
 in the morning or in the afternoon or 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.510
 from six o'clock and from eight o'clock 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.060
 and from the nightly diets 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.740
 we keep for the total caloric I hope 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.840
 that has become clearer this typical 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.510
 I doubt that it has many people I hope that you 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.520
 have liked noble point in this video 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.520
 and we'll see you in upcoming videos until
