want to just go over a couple of things
as<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.590> why<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.760> version<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.300> different<00:00:54.809> too

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
as to why this version is different too

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
as to why this version is different too
well<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.219> version<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> fix<00:00:56.940> is

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
well this version of the fix is

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270 
well this version of the fix is
different<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.750> other<00:00:57.989> versions<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.949> may<00:00:59.129> have

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
different to other versions you may have

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.110 
different to other versions you may have
seen<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.809> YouTube<00:01:01.160> this<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> correct<00:01:02.820> way

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
seen on YouTube this is the correct way

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.929 
seen on YouTube this is the correct way
of<00:01:03.149> doing<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.260> simply<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.729> other

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
of doing it simply because in other

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
of doing it simply because in other
versions<00:01:06.150> they<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.020> edit<00:01:07.260> backup

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
versions they get you to edit backup

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.179
