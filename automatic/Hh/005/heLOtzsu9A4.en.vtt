regular t-shirt fabric mesh I got this
from<00:00:25.050> Walmart<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.939> fabric<00:00:26.939> glue<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.599> if<00:00:27.960> you

prefer using a tread and a needle you
can<00:00:30.960> use<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.230> as<00:00:31.410> well<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.790> last<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:32.969> not

least<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:34.110> need<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> scissor<00:00:35.899> okay<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:36.960> first<00:00:37.320> I

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
least you need a scissor okay so first I

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530 
least you need a scissor okay so first I
start<00:00:37.829> by<00:00:37.980> straining<00:00:38.309> out<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.790> shirt<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
start by straining out the shirt on a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.260 
start by straining out the shirt on a
flat<00:00:40.020> surface<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.710> then<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.579> measure<00:00:41.820> how<00:00:42.120> much

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
flat surface and then I measure how much

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
flat surface and then I measure how much
I<00:00:42.420> want<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> cut<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.260> then<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.620> fold<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.129> shirt

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
I want to cut and then I fold this shirt

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
I want to cut and then I fold this shirt
so<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.329> cut<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.960> relatively<00:00:46.469> straight

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
so I can cut it in a relatively straight

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.770 
so I can cut it in a relatively straight
line<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.520> don't<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.030> precise<00:00:48.450> it's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
line you don't have to be precise it's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.760 
line you don't have to be precise it's
just<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.410> make<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.680> work<00:00:49.860> easier<00:00:51.620> once<00:00:52.620> you've

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
just to make you work easier once you've

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.889 
just to make you work easier once you've
done<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.730> next<00:00:53.760> step<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.480> cut<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.780> out

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
done that the next step is to cut it out

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.979 
done that the next step is to cut it out
and<00:00:55.190> also<00:00:56.190> fold<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.210> other<00:00:57.449> piece<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.780> you

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
and also fold the other piece that you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.979 
and also fold the other piece that you
just<00:00:58.199> cut<00:00:58.440> out<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.949> bottom<00:00:59.550> piece<00:00:59.820> fold<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
just cut out the bottom piece fold that

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.770 
just cut out the bottom piece fold that
in<00:01:01.230> half<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:02.039> whichever<00:01:02.430> line<00:01:03.120> they<00:01:03.329> prefer

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
in half or whichever line they prefer

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.450 
in half or whichever line they prefer
and<00:01:04.080> cut<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:08.010> taking<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and cut that out so I'm taking the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.250 
and cut that out so I'm taking the
bottom<00:01:08.760> part<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> t-shirt<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
bottom part of the t-shirt with the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.539 
bottom part of the t-shirt with the
hemline<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.010> everything<00:01:11.369> already

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
hemline and everything already

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.210 
hemline and everything already
structured<00:01:12.320> make<00:01:13.320> sure<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.650> leave<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> space

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
structured make sure you leave a space

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.999 
structured make sure you leave a space
in<00:01:14.460> between<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.119> two<00:01:15.150> cutouts<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.990> next<00:01:16.890> step

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
in between the two cutouts the next step

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.679 
in between the two cutouts the next step
is<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.280> measure<00:01:17.460> out<00:01:17.670> how<00:01:17.850> much<00:01:18.000> fabric<00:01:18.270> mesh

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
is to measure out how much fabric mesh

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.719 
is to measure out how much fabric mesh
you're<00:01:18.930> gonna<00:01:19.080> need<00:01:19.320> for<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.189> whole<00:01:20.369> round<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
you're gonna need for the whole round of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.670 
you're gonna need for the whole round of
the<00:01:20.880> t-shirt<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.600> cut<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.930> out

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.640 

next<00:01:28.680> turn<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.159> two<00:01:29.490> cut<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.060> pieces<00:01:30.869> inside

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
next turn the two cut out pieces inside

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.590 
next turn the two cut out pieces inside
out<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.979> fold<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.790> edges

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.899 

once<00:01:36.230> the<00:01:36.440> edges<00:01:36.710> are<00:01:36.830> folded<00:01:37.280> I'm<00:01:37.550> going<00:01:37.820> to

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
once the edges are folded I'm going to

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.780 
once the edges are folded I'm going to
iron<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.450> folded<00:01:39.229> side<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.250> will<00:01:40.370> be<00:01:40.460> easier

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
iron the folded side so will be easier

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.270 
iron the folded side so will be easier
for<00:01:40.820> me<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.210> glue<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:42.050> and<00:01:42.500> it<00:01:42.680> will<00:01:42.800> also<00:01:43.130> have

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
for me to glue it and it will also have

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.430 
for me to glue it and it will also have
a<00:01:43.310> straight<00:01:43.670> line<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.750> work<00:01:45.229> would

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
a straight line so the work would

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.110 
a straight line so the work would
actually<00:01:45.830> look<00:01:45.979> like<00:01:46.040> you<00:01:46.430> bought<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:46.760> from<00:01:46.970> a

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
actually look like you bought it from a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.680 
actually look like you bought it from a
store<00:01:47.740> next<00:01:48.740> fold<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.400> fabric<00:01:49.790> mesh<00:01:50.060> into<00:01:50.450> two

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
store next fold the fabric mesh into two

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.850 
store next fold the fabric mesh into two
on<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.580> longer<00:01:52.580> side<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.990> then<00:01:54.170> start

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
on the longer side and then start

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.800 
on the longer side and then start
putting<00:01:55.430> some<00:01:55.729> glue<00:01:55.910> on<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.300> side<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:56.540> you

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
putting some glue on the side that you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.840 
putting some glue on the side that you
just<00:01:56.869> folded<00:01:57.560> pulled<00:01:57.950> from<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.340> inside<00:01:58.670> and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
just folded pulled from the inside and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.150 
just folded pulled from the inside and
out<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.240> then<00:01:59.509> attach<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.740> fabric

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
out and then attach it to the fabric

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.859 
out and then attach it to the fabric
mesh<00:02:01.369> for<00:02:01.790> both<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.150> top<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.720> bottom

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.150 
at the top and the bottom sides of one
side<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.450> done<00:02:20.840> let<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.140> dry<00:02:21.440> out<00:02:21.470> for<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.920> few

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
side is done let it dry out for a few

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.040 
side is done let it dry out for a few
minutes<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:22.850> then<00:02:23.120> turn<00:02:23.420> your<00:02:23.570> work<00:02:23.900> around

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
minutes and then turn your work around

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.720 
minutes and then turn your work around
and<00:02:24.560> do<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.920> same<00:02:25.130> thing<00:02:25.310> on<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.520> other<00:02:25.550> side

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
and do the same thing on the other side

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.030 
and do the same thing on the other side
this<00:02:28.730> part<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.090> optional<00:02:29.300> but<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:30.739> me<00:02:30.890> I

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
this part is optional but for me I

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.199 
this part is optional but for me I
didn't<00:02:31.250> want<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.519> leave<00:02:31.670> them<00:02:31.820> as<00:02:31.970> they<00:02:32.000> were

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
didn't want to leave them as they were

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.840 
didn't want to leave them as they were
so<00:02:32.570> I'm<00:02:32.840> cutting<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.380> sleeves<00:02:33.850> diagonally

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
so I'm cutting the sleeves diagonally

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.770 
so I'm cutting the sleeves diagonally
folding<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.660> edges<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.580> then<00:02:37.580> applying<00:02:38.450> the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
folding the edges and then applying the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.370 
folding the edges and then applying the
fabric<00:02:39.170> glue<00:02:39.580> inside<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.820> folded<00:02:41.209> area<00:02:41.780> like

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
fabric glue inside the folded area like

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.340 
fabric glue inside the folded area like
so<00:02:42.620> let<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.370> dry<00:02:43.549> off<00:02:43.700> for<00:02:44.090> for<00:02:44.900> about<00:02:45.080> an<00:02:45.230> hour

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
so let it dry off for for about an hour

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:56.020 
so let it dry off for for about an hour
or<00:02:45.530> two<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:47.180> finish<00:02:47.750> result

and the needle you can use the fabric
cool<00:04:00.150> here<00:04:00.509> would<00:04:01.409> actually<00:04:01.769> be<00:04:01.859> easier<00:04:02.189> but<00:04:02.430> I

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
cool here would actually be easier but I

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.140 
cool here would actually be easier but I
prefer<00:04:03.269> using<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.780> thread<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.229> needle

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
prefer using the thread and the needle

next<00:04:06.150> I'm<00:04:06.299> just<00:04:06.329> stretching<00:04:06.930> out<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.229> fabric

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
next I'm just stretching out the fabric

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.619 
next I'm just stretching out the fabric
just<00:04:08.819> by<00:04:09.030> holding<00:04:09.419> it<00:04:09.540> on<00:04:10.109> the<00:04:10.530> two<00:04:10.709> ends<00:04:10.949> and

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
just by holding it on the two ends and

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.879 
just by holding it on the two ends and
that's<00:04:12.629> all<00:04:12.840> we<00:04:13.199> have<00:04:13.319> to<00:04:13.500> do<00:04:13.590> for<00:04:13.709> this

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
that's all we have to do for this

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:38.260
