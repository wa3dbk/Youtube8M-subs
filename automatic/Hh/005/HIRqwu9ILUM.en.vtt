phones overall though I think the
sensation<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.759> great<00:01:57.060> phone<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:57.750> you

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
sensation is a great phone and if you

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.240 
sensation is a great phone and if you
get<00:01:57.960> one<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.320> won't<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.649> disappointed

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
get one you won't be disappointed

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520 
get one you won't be disappointed
however<00:01:59.729> there<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.060> small<00:02:00.540> problem<00:02:00.840> I'm

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
however there is one small problem I'm

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.580 
however there is one small problem I'm
also<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.979> testing<00:02:02.340> Samsung's<00:02:02.880> Galaxy<00:02:03.180> s2<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
also in testing Samsung's Galaxy s2 and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.770 
also in testing Samsung's Galaxy s2 and
so<00:02:05.280> far<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.640> appears<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.149> almost<00:02:06.270> every

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
so far it appears that in almost every

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.960 
so far it appears that in almost every
respect<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.380> slightly<00:02:07.710> better<00:02:08.250> as<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
respect it's slightly better as the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.729 
respect it's slightly better as the
sensation<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.020> think<00:02:10.200> those<00:02:10.319> people<00:02:10.349> will

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
sensation so I think those people will

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.410 
sensation so I think those people will
be<00:02:10.800> better<00:02:10.979> off<00:02:11.129> going<00:02:11.430> for<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.270> those

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
be better off going for one of those

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.540 
be better off going for one of those
however<00:02:12.780> I'll<00:02:12.959> confirm

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
however I'll confirm

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.580 
however I'll confirm
at<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:13.790> my<00:02:13.910> gadgets<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.330> web<00:02:14.540> TV<00:02:14.780> test<00:02:15.260> will<00:02:15.440> be

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
at in my gadgets a web TV test will be

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.280 
at in my gadgets a web TV test will be
