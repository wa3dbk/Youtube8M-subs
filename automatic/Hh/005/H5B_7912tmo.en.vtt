00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.690 
that kind of leads me on to a little bit
of<00:00:41.489> speculation<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.800> gravity<00:00:43.800> rush<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.340> so

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
of speculation as to gravity rush to so

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.790 
of speculation as to gravity rush to so
whether<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:45.840> actually<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> come<00:00:46.620> out

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
whether it's actually going to come out

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 
whether it's actually going to come out
for<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> PlayStation<00:00:47.940> Vita<00:00:48.270> now<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.690> its<00:00:48.930> own

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
for the PlayStation Vita now on its own

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.779 
for the PlayStation Vita now on its own
whether<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.340> come<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.670> for

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
whether it's just going to come out for

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.880 
whether it's just going to come out for
the<00:00:50.879> PlayStation<00:00:51.449> 4<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:51.989> its<00:00:52.140> own<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:52.590> whether

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the PlayStation 4 on its own or whether

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.250 
the PlayStation 4 on its own or whether
it's<00:00:53.129> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.309> come<00:00:53.430> out<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:54.000> both<00:00:54.480> systems

it's going to come out for both systems

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.619 
it's going to come out for both systems
now<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.829> am<00:00:56.430> hoping<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.820> praying<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.390> will

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
now I am hoping and praying that it will

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
now I am hoping and praying that it will
still<00:00:57.989> make<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.559> PlayStation<00:00:59.190> Vita<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
still make it to the PlayStation Vita a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.479 
still make it to the PlayStation Vita a
fingers<00:01:00.539> crossed<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:02.129> Sony's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
fingers crossed and I do think Sony's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.189 
fingers crossed and I do think Sony's
actually<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.180> probably<00:01:03.390> make<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.930> for

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
actually going to probably make it for

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.789 
actually going to probably make it for
both<00:01:04.530> consoles<00:01:05.299> but<00:01:06.299> obviously<00:01:06.680> you<00:01:07.680> know

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
both consoles but obviously you know

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.080 
both consoles but obviously you know
there<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> chance<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.670> could<00:01:08.700> just

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
there is a chance that it could just

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.510 
there is a chance that it could just
come<00:01:09.240> out<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.780> PlayStation<00:01:10.619> 4<00:01:11.070> because<00:01:11.369> it's

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
come out for PlayStation 4 because it's

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.789 
come out for PlayStation 4 because it's
kind<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.820> gone<00:01:11.970> really<00:01:12.360> really<00:01:12.600> quiet<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.229> the
