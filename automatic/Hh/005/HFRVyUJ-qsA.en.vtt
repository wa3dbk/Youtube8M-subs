 in the world of cinema and television 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.420
 this week 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.050
 ah 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.109
 then we started with what was already 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.919
 revealed the title that the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.140
 Star Wars movie episode 7 for 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:32.129
 finally stop calling the star wars 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.460
 episode 7 and it will be star wars the force 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.739
 away fine if this title is revealed 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.750
 in English we ask you 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.420
 users as they believe will be the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.519
 translation into Spanish the war of the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.470
 galaxies and the rows of the tortillas the 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.510
 awakening of strength the awakening of 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.589
 force or star wars force 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.589
 wake up bored 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.530
 as you will remember now is 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.019
 working on the film league 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.510
 of justice itself that will bring together 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.339
 several superheroes however now 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.180
 comes the news that apparently 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.399
 many am will not be one of them since the 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.490
 president of new line commented that it is a 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.740
 dc comic but not a character from the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.840
 league of justice and on the other hand the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.759
 actor dwayne johnson who will perform 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.220
 'the white' adame in this movie 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.369
 Chazal commented that this is a 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.470
 very good and independent project 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.570
 the other films and the truth is that 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.009
 it must sound like something very good but I 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.750
 I think it felt more like when 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.130
 you play in the seats and everyone 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.130
 feel and are happy less 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.210
 and also now the news of 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.730
 that toy story returns with a fourth 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.440
 part and it would be directed by john 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.630
 lasseter who led the first and 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.850
 second part of this movie 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.640
 I would also return to tom hanks and tim 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.500
 allen as buzz lightyear and woody is 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.380
 animated sequel is scheduled for the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.540
 June 16, 2017 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.860
 format that I believe your story and I 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.200
 same best ending that could have had 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.330
 They should not do more than just pretend 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.990
 that does not exist I stayed until 13 s 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.190
 for me that end back these 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.860
 recently the actor christian bale 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.260
 date are the proposal to interpret 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.450
 steve jobs in the new movie that 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.910
 is developing about the life of this 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.070
 character so now everything indicates 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.220
 that this role was offered to the actor 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.959
 michael fassbender and maybe it could be a 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.820
 little difficult since it is also 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.800
 working on the second part of 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.010
 I promised the art movie without 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.110
 write and x-men 'apocalypse cristian 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.350
 I see is a temperamental diva michael 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.420
 fassbender will do a better role 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.250
 for me what it does not give is a movie of 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.430
 this guy still does not understand how his 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.430
 biography was best seller sent from 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.440
 my iphone to josie you will see the second 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.420
 part of the amazing spiderman 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.640
 they cried like grace jones with death 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.050
 from gwen stacy also no longer opening 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.810
 they are worried because now 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.570
 the rumor arises that washington could 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.020
 return in the role of gwen stacy to 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.580
 the third part of this delivery and 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.290
 basically theories or the 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.800
 justification that this character 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.950
 will continue with life is that the person 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.950
 that he died was not gwen stacy but a clone 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.620
 from gwen stacy the truth power is about 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.210
 of assumptions but if basically 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.460
 They want to apply our dead 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.560
 I was on my feet those are and are 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.510
 pulling pal bush ok ugly maybe 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.030
 come back to cameback flashback mode like 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.680
 the album in the dark knight rises bishop 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.390
 hands to the tribute spheres and 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.490
 there is also the possibility that your 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.400
 character will be part of this new 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.650
 spin off from spider-man called glass 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.840
 feeling which will be interpreted by 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.490
 female characters that is to say by 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.680
