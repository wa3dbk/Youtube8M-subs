 advisable to consume a life 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.080
 or a life that has a 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.020
 the amount of 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.240
 carbon and rapid absorption and some 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.040
 minerals a home-cooked option like that 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.900

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.460
 absorption 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.890
 which means that cities that are going to 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.930

 blood to the body may use 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.430
 to produce atp energy that goes 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.470
 use for muscle contraction and 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.020
 so my source of carbohydrates 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.899
 of the transaction will be with honey 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.780

 that fresh prophecy does not arrive and note 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.420
 than the assembly because a thousand 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.939
 liter of liquid or who is with a 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.149

 500 grams of carbohydrates both 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.280
 how our life 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.510
 my advice is that 500 thousand liters of

 Water 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.470

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.049
 and who puts a pinch of salt to 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.230
 to compensate for the loss of sodium if physical 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.700
