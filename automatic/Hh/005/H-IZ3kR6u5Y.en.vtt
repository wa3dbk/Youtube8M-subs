I'm bringing you a tutorial on a trick I

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.110 
I'm bringing you a tutorial on a trick I
don't<00:00:07.649> know<00:00:07.740> exactly<00:00:08.250> what<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.610> call<00:00:08.790> but

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
don't know exactly what to call but

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.350 
don't know exactly what to call but
basically<00:00:09.690> it's<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.410> corner<00:00:10.830> tic-tac<00:00:11.460> 360<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.330> a

basically it's a corner tic-tac 360 to a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.030 
basically it's a corner tic-tac 360 to a
cat<00:00:12.630> leap<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.530> actually<00:00:13.860> not<00:00:13.889> a

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
cat leap and it's actually not a

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.700 
cat leap and it's actually not a
complete<00:00:14.460> 360<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.179> more<00:00:15.330> like<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.619> 270<00:00:16.619> or

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
complete 360 it's more like a 270 or

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.500 
complete 360 it's more like a 270 or
something<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.369> I'm<00:00:17.789> just<00:00:17.940> going<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.150> call<00:00:18.359> it

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
something but I'm just going to call it

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.410 
something but I'm just going to call it
a<00:00:18.690> 360<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:20.100> simplify<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:20.850> you're

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
a 360 to simplify it because you're

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.970 
a 360 to simplify it because you're
going<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> basically<00:00:21.900> be<00:00:22.199> learning<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.560> tic-tac

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980

going to basically be learning a tic-tac
360<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.240> learn<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.600> move<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.380> basically

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
360 to learn this move but basically

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.920 
360 to learn this move but basically
what<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.029> corner<00:00:27.359> with<00:00:27.750> two

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
what it is is you have a corner with two

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.960 
what it is is you have a corner with two
walls<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.500> you're<00:00:29.220> going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.670> ticked

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
walls and you're going to be ticked

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.240 
walls and you're going to be ticked
jackin<00:00:30.359> off<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:30.840> that's<00:00:31.560> where<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.859> step<00:00:32.070> off

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
jackin off one that's where you step off

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.819 
jackin off one that's where you step off
the<00:00:32.309> wall<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.759> one<00:00:32.790> foot<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> spin<00:00:34.649> the

step on it with my right foot and spin

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.010 
step on it with my right foot and spin
this<00:00:43.440> way<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.340> go<00:00:44.489> towards<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.030> wall<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this way to go towards this wall to a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.590 
this way to go towards this wall to a
cat<00:00:46.350> leap<00:00:46.590> or<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> wall<00:00:47.550> run<00:00:47.789> depending<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.390> how
