you I should really just stop I think
that's<00:00:33.870> third<00:00:34.079> time<00:00:34.410> he's<00:00:34.620> been<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> two

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
that's third time he's been in the two

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.119 
that's third time he's been in the two
choices<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.960> then<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.140> third<00:00:37.320> time<00:00:37.559> he's<00:00:37.800> not

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
choices and then the third time he's not

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.580 
choices and then the third time he's not
been<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.120> either<00:00:39.239> way<00:00:39.510> Charlie<00:00:39.899> Adam<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.320> you

know<00:00:40.710> getting<00:00:41.070> thrown<00:00:41.610> out<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> team<00:00:42.210> so

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
know getting thrown out the team so

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.720 
thank you Charlie but um no thank you
and<00:00:45.450> we're<00:00:45.930> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.230> add<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.559> inform<00:00:47.370> cruise

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and we're going to add in inform cruise

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.529 
and we're going to add in inform cruise
into<00:00:48.500> sentiment<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.539> boating

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
into sentiment there and boating

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.810 
into sentiment there and boating
hopefully<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> centre-back<00:00:52.680> which<00:00:53.039> doesn't<00:00:53.610> do

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
hopefully a centre-back which doesn't do

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.270 
hopefully a centre-back which doesn't do
great<00:00:54.539> things<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:55.079> our<00:00:55.230> chemistry<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.920> think

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
great things with our chemistry I think

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.950 
great things with our chemistry I think
the<00:00:56.430> chemistry<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:57.030> back<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> rise<00:00:57.690> I'm

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the chemistry is back on the rise I'm

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.380 
the chemistry is back on the rise I'm
fairly<00:00:58.230> sure<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:58.590> was<00:00:58.710> 78<00:00:59.250> before<00:00:59.609> then<00:00:59.820> it's

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
fairly sure what was 78 before then it's

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.500 
fairly sure what was 78 before then it's
up<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.600> 82<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.789> you<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.940> we're<00:01:03.120> getting<00:01:03.210> there

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
up to 82 so you know we're getting there

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.640 
up to 82 so you know we're getting there
three<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> defenders<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:04.530> are

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
three of the defenders there are

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.649 
three of the defenders there are
completely<00:01:05.220> isolated<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:06.240> terms<00:01:06.510> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
completely isolated in terms of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.020 
completely isolated in terms of
chemistry<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.380> let's<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.400> how<00:01:08.520> many<00:01:08.670> goals<00:01:08.850> we

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
chemistry so let's see how many goals we

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.340 
chemistry so let's see how many goals we
concede<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> first<00:01:09.689> game<00:01:09.869> right<00:01:10.140> let's

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
concede in the first game right let's

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.020 
concede in the first game right let's
have<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> look<00:01:10.650> at<00:01:10.710> our<00:01:10.799> first<00:01:11.040> opponent<00:01:11.760> what

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
have a look at our first opponent what

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.700 
have a look at our first opponent what
I'll<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:13.189> Ronaldo<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> first<00:01:14.850> game<00:01:15.119> um

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
I'll really Ronaldo in the first game um

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.980 
I'll really Ronaldo in the first game um
that's<00:01:16.710> not<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.880> mean<00:01:18.090> Weidenfeller<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.869> not

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
that's not a I mean Weidenfeller is not

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.289 
that's not a I mean Weidenfeller is not
good<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.770> that's<00:01:20.130> pretty<00:01:20.759> much<00:01:21.030> all<00:01:21.240> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
good I think that's pretty much all I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.630 
good I think that's pretty much all I
can<00:01:21.720> take<00:01:21.900> from<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.290> team<00:01:22.470> play<00:01:22.890> Neymar<00:01:23.490> out

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
can take from that team play Neymar out

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.190 
can take from that team play Neymar out
wide<00:01:23.850> that's<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.270> good<00:01:24.450> ball<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.020> whip

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
wide that's a good ball if we can whip

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.330 
wide that's a good ball if we can whip
that<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.500> oh<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.490> guys<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.540> don't<00:01:28.530> know<00:01:28.770> with

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
that in oh it's a guys I don't know with

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.210 
that in oh it's a guys I don't know with
those<00:01:29.460> words<00:01:29.700> drop<00:01:30.170> ball<00:01:31.170> back<00:01:31.500> what<00:01:31.979> are<00:01:32.070> you

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
those words drop ball back what are you

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.510 
those words drop ball back what are you
doing<00:01:32.820> what<00:01:33.570> was<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.200> why<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.680> Cruz<00:01:35.159> taking

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
doing what was that why is Cruz taking

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
doing what was that why is Cruz taking
this<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:35.939> messy<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> don't<00:01:36.659> understand

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
this and not messy I don't understand

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.649 
this and not messy I don't understand
whoever<00:01:37.619> oh<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.790> that's<00:01:39.030> why<00:01:39.210> crews<00:01:39.509> are

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
whoever oh that that's why crews are

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.510 
whoever oh that that's why crews are
taking<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.049> instead<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.320> Messi<00:01:40.650> because<00:01:40.680> Cruz

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
taking it instead of Messi because Cruz

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.039 
taking it instead of Messi because Cruz
does<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.970> weird<00:01:42.180> run-up<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.840> takes

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
does have a weird run-up that takes

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.080 
does have a weird run-up that takes
about<00:01:43.259> five<00:01:43.860> seconds<00:01:44.340> longer<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.759> lets<00:01:44.909> them

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
about five seconds longer and lets them

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.880 
about five seconds longer and lets them
put<00:01:45.329> someone<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> line<00:01:45.899> fair<00:01:46.320> enough<00:01:46.649> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
put someone on the line fair enough that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.740 
put someone on the line fair enough that
is<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> good<00:01:47.310> free-kick<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.210> top<00:01:48.450> corner

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
is a good free-kick it's not top corner

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.080 
is a good free-kick it's not top corner
so<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:48.990> not<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.290> satisfying<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.670> it's

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
so it's not that satisfying but it's

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.969 
so it's not that satisfying but it's
been<00:01:51.540> aimed<00:01:51.810> pretty<00:01:52.200> well<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.619> know<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.890> is

been aimed pretty well you know that is
right<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> bottom<00:01:53.549> corner<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:53.970> fair

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
