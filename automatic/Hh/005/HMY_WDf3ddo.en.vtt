00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.180
 So we are in Moscow river 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.099
 Not far from the price of the city I am Alexey 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:39.629
 let's review this one 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:41.850
 great machine lesson and so rob machines 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.220
 cake so what's the big deal with it 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.900
 that this is not amateur machine 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.640
 the level is rather the initial 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:53.160
 professionally what is the difference in 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.129
 The first here is completely dead 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.489
 reinforced patented pipes 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:03.289
 Aluminum is quite complicated and 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.930
 expensive technology so type plus she 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:12.780
 unusual geometry is especially evident 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:14.550
 on such feathers, that's not cheap 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.430
 technology unlike standard 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.100
 straight pipes so here given 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.399
 the bike is more expensive what's more 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.789
 distinctive feature 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:29.250
 Shimano 10 speed transmission 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.039
 Shimano dior rear shifters 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.060
 switch shimano slx that is it 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.709
 not amateur level 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.289
 front switch fuck understand well 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.690
 It looks like tart from abad 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.619
 double alexrims do the light 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.000
 pistoning them with a get tire 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.160
 bar own time 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.190
 spring and oil fork rock shox with 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.310
 bounce rate adjustment 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.270
 blocking 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.280
 and all other characteristics that is 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.030
 this is no longer amateurism live again 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.290
 fork 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.000
 Well maybe amateur but high quality 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.930
 further hydraulic brakes avid juicy 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.770
 7 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.490
 but the main feature here is already coming 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.530
 integrated carriage 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.300
 I mean, I can't say that she 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.220
 I can't say better she's worse she 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.980
 just different from the standard 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.430
 who live here goes integrated 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:32.770
 pedal carriage replaced by set 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:35.260
 on some strange thing shaped 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.440
 Stream transactions 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.330
 abundant but overall it's a bike 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.700
 started professional level 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.130
 racing on this bike basically 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.160
 as he is, you can safely speak 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.900
 racing what some other cross-country 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.540
 he calmly pulls it 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.700
 it is a good good machine 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.440
 the only thing is that he has no mounts 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.290
 the years 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.930
 the trunk that is, it is not designed for it 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.500
 and this is his minus but on the other hand he 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:10.180
 lighter than its competitors but more expensive 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.250
 because the drop machines is the floor true and so 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.530
 further transmission of the initial 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.630
 professional level on dior coins 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.090
 rear derailleur and thrust ie 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.040
 already transmission in order to 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.680
 feel what quality is 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.530
 accuracy and speed of switching to these 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.010
 transmission in principle is already possible 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.940
 participate 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.350
 amateur in original races 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.820
 cross country 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.320
 here is a special geometry which 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.460
 allows you to put very high 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.300
 bulk tires 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:44.140
 so they or a good nation with this as 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.450
 would use that roslyakov and for 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.050
 asphalt for example tires which 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.470
 will let you save on like here 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.760
 nice surrounded by oil plug with 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.250
 locking out 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.850
 adjustment of smoothness rebound and firm 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.590
 rock show special reinforced geometry 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.080
 where you need it is butene shit and 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.850
 pipes that are reinforced where they go 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:12.489
 the biggest loads on the frame this 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.160
 A good bike that is very 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.489
 will pass to those who want a good 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.760
 quality machine brand yet 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.220
 lt 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.350
 still rock machine here ru so 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.290
 expensive but high quality 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.820
 if you don't mind the money is very good 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.930
 the choice 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.610
 subscribe tell friends 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.980
 put likes order advertising 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.880
 thank you Sergey who took it all off 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.880
