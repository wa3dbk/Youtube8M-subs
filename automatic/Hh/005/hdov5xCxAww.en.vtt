 now in a boxing I think in the title 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.480
 of video you already know what it is not about 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.090
 helmets that broke my 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.769
 mine last week on a trip that 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.210
 I did I took the computer broke the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.890
 helmets I have to buy some new ones 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.439
 the unboxing are helmets that have 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.119
 cost 50 euros worth not worth 50 because 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.689
 with shipping and everything because if 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.489
 50 852 that's because in dollars they can 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.820
 be about 65 about 70 a knife 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.989
 perfect ceramic to cut already 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.969
 They know that I bought everything I started 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.300

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.710

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.860
 vibration the helmets to imagine 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.310
 little machine for that I bring here in my 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.310
 piece of knife to cut the fish 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.310

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.420

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.810
 able to take it out now 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.039

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.140
 wrapper that I god of mine when I was born 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:47.140

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.680
 until we have the house 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.570
 wow let's dedicate the helmets basically 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.910
 the cable the cable weigh a barrel weighs 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.310
 plus cable that good helmets 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.110

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.210
 I had to stay I'm playing ua 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.720
 notice what gentleness here this for the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:14.180
 head that touch that I go quality of 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:17.350
 helmet has here the microphone has the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.790
 volume the little button d 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.800
 of the light that will light up is not a 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.800
 little button is a holocaust 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.110
 the little button of violation the volume 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:31.080
 it's pretty good the cases are weighed 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.840
 They do not weigh much but they are sturdy 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.750
 robust is not what I like the most 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.740
 sponge is for the head that has 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.190
 with a gold connection usb connection in 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.260
 nothing to connect so you can see it for 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.840
 a better connection have put cables of 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.840
 gold there is an adhesive tape here 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.180
 I shit on God perhaps the tape of 5 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.700
 just look 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.140
 Hair is made of gold the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.420
 connections being the cable of cables 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.250
 copper as I always thought two meters and 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.569
 medium cable here so I can 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.760
 to form with this can the house to me 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.470
 neighbor connect me deficiency the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.550
 connections now you can not well 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.550
 would make it clear yes 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.760
 good 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.250
 the calculations are pretty good 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.860
 brought because it brings something else as well as 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.300
 they are 7.1 bring up drivers and all 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.910
 the helmets because you know everything has its 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.130
 own sound system the truth that 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.540
 They are pretty good that I miss anything 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.049
 bring to the connection 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.150
 connection code you bring has 7.1 virtual 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.579
 that's an excellent sound for the one who 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.590
 is playing in the battlefield and for the 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.210
 Fuck the shit with this over 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.160
 I have thought a paper baterfi 4 no 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.640
 it is impressive this has requirements 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.320
 of the system then already in almost all the 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:08.250
 world two and a half meters of cable lime 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.690
 has to leave the sun of deaf has 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.190
 vibration the vibration has to be the 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.320
 I'm playing host when they're shooting at me 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.320
 begins to vibrate the helmets wants to be 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.300
 a wonder not good then nothing up 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.560

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.210
 now more videos since I have here a 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.360
