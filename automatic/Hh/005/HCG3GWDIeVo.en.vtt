00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 I'm here in bruno corano's boxing 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.930
 besides being an instructor and he did 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.660
 some courses on bruno equipment 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.150
 please explain the importance of 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.030
 a good pasta before explaining about 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.640
 the overalls, I'll explain why 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.039
 I am also able to speak about 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.670
 equipment as well as piloting as 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.109
 world under me I founded the bike stayed in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.029
 Brazil is a school that uses 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.420
 American methodology and is exactly why 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.920
 This is what I came to know 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.860
 not only of piloting more about the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.430
 equipment to motoschool content that 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.050
 Uses is an arm of the secretary of 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.770
 American government transport that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.129
 Pilot study is an organ within nh 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.649
 dsa love the sex always administration 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.140
 finally, this organ studies the interaction of 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.789
 to be human on the bike 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.370
 both with regard to pilotage 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.329
 tire equipment and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.510
 safety 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.380
 then annually we unite 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.740
 I go there and listen a little about how the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.689
 as the unfolding of a tumble is what 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.400
 represents deceleration for the body 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.320
 in this whole thing that much 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.650
 people accustomed to hearing 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.380
 added to this is I think I am 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.830
 completing more than five years as 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.650
 official pilot painting in brazil that is 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.460
 the brand and has a leading Italian brand 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.619
 in the world in overalls that is what saves 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.549
 really save our skin when the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.250
 people fell 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.759
 this overalls is tailor made one 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.770
 Professional version equals a monkey 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.619
 stoner use the world's riders 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.159
 sponsored by the ministry is suzana is 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.540
 Even a person talks more and is 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.100
 I put it comes with 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.320
 my name 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.590
 it comes up to bruno corano's writing to read 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.280
 if in the code all my 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.009
 what makes it a jumpsuit is the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.200
 that makes a overalls good 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.940
 which differentiates why one costs 10 thousand 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.910
 another costs 2 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.920
 I'll give you an idea, let's start with 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.090
 low 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:21.300
 This cinnamon when you close it. 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.849
 He has a grip here, of course. 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.790
 playing you can feel it so he 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.840
 sticks to your shape shin 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.849
 Independent looks at my leg. 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.790
 regardless of the movement I make 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.769
 because the bike we move too it 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.019
 do not get up and down and dancing 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.319
 because it cripples as if it were a 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.540
 elastic close to my ankle 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.420
 added to that we go up all 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.190
 ventilated very light leather 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.069
 What makes a overalls dry is also 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.370
 that he is very light he weighs 3 4 pounds 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.510
 less in normal overalls 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:00.319
 Then we 'll raise the protections. 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.799
 all of them extremely sophisticated in 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.360
 not transfer the impact to their 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.530
 joints 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.040
 Okay, but what you do and kill yourself is highly 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.680
 differentiated 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.430
 if we fix the whole lap in the 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.489
 knee 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.180
 the knee and the whole lap of the 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.610
 knee is elastic if you listen like this 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.280
 the opposite side of the ball but the 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.700
 that this interferes with the greater 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.989
 inconvenience is you are walking 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.700
 bike and a bad quality overalls . 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.000
 knee is moving 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.709
 just as the story of cinnamon is 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.170
 one is a system that they call 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.299
 floating it sticks to your knee 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.970
 regardless of the movement you make 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:51.019
 a overalls stretches the knee never 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.420
 leaves the place or is the independent 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.730
 as you eventually hit the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.840
 floor protection will be in place 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.000
 because what happens often is that 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.859
 protection is shifted 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.359
 so when you hit the bottom she did not 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:10.190
 was in front of the knee 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:13.459
 ok and then we follow suit plus 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.870
 light that I said it has to be is it 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.870
 have to give you freedom he has to 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.669
 act as if it were a condom 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.229
 attached to the body and at the same time not 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.650
 prevent movement 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.330
 so it has a lot of elasticity and the 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.160
 models to run the ministry follow 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.400
 this same construction has something has 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.760
 things that we can not see anymore 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.669
 a sewing system alpinestars beyond 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.520
 of special lines and everything else is not only 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.540
 about one tissue in the other and pass the 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.750
 machine 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.690
 they make a kind of a hook and just 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.980
 then they sewed or were very 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.800
 more resistant 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.600
 it's different you sew as soon as you 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.430
 set it up and move the line here in 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.940
 top 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.090
 in addition where the sections are 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.120
 susceptible to tear they make parts 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.510
 leather sole without many seams 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.570
 For what is the chances of separation 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.210
 tear they have practically disappeared 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.820
 this same same concept 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.320
 been explaining it will be 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:28.010
 applied for all the rest of the overalls 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:30.020
 shoulder elbow and everything else is 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.970
 difference is in the details in the 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.390
 collar that looks like the neoprene 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:39.050
 very comfortable in the finish 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:42.230
 internal and so on 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.670
 so is one is an infinity of 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:49.070
 small aspects looking at him back here 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:52.310
 again that issue of elasticity 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.610
 he is the whole lap and laziness 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:59.690
 So you have to move and he does not 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.520
 hold me I think this is a summary there is 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.100
 the staff spoke up here but this is yours 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.100
 professional what the pine star wars 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.460
 she has a bed at an affordable price 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:13.940
 the normal street user can 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.620
 protect as much as and practically 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.320
 the same technology 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.490
 just not tailor made it's tech 1 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.780
 r 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.110
 How I told you if we look 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.650
 exactly the same quality of protection 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.100
 knee or 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:32.610
 the leather is bored the same quality as 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.199
 lightweight and extremely elastic seam to 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.000
 Sometimes we hit the eye allowing 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.710
 so one of the first things that looks 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.710
 How does the crotch of the overall 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.660
 we have that it is pure leather the pilot does not 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.850
 You can not even move here. 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.460
 just like that mean stuff 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:50.789
 write izmailov 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.590
 so it's even concept overalls 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:55.410
 exceptional quality 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:58.289
 it does not concern the same safety 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:03.840
 elastic construction all around 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:07.710
 to give freedom to the pilot and / or 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.870
 it is the road user can walk with 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.590
 equipment as sophisticated as the 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.620
 our 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.780
 any doubt is do not stop writing 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.979
 I entered on my site bruno corano punto 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.669
 com 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:19.669
 a hug
