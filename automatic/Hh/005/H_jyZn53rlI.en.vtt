00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
here right now we're working on a BMW

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.900 
here right now we're working on a BMW
it's<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.250> 3-series<00:00:02.820> 2006<00:00:03.659> 890<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:07.639> we<00:00:08.639> do<00:00:08.790> our

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
it's a 3-series 2006 890 and we do our

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.789 
it's a 3-series 2006 890 and we do our
problem<00:00:11.540> showing<00:00:12.540> up<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.990> dashboard<00:00:13.170> as<00:00:13.650> I

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
problem showing up on the dashboard as I

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.340 
problem showing up on the dashboard as I
will<00:00:13.980> show<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:15.020> I'll<00:00:16.020> just<00:00:17.960> put<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> key<00:00:19.289> in

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
will show you I'll just put the key in

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:28.560 
will show you I'll just put the key in
the<00:00:19.529> ignition<00:00:21.980> start<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> engine

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.750 

as<00:00:29.380> you<00:00:29.529> can<00:00:29.680> see<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:31.449> have<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.720> ABS<00:00:32.050> and<00:00:32.760> brake

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
as you can see we have the ABS and brake

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.119 
as you can see we have the ABS and brake
warning<00:00:34.090> light<00:00:34.300> showing<00:00:34.690> up

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.060 

and<00:00:38.640> then<00:00:38.850> there<00:00:39.090> they<00:00:39.210> always<00:00:39.359> well<00:00:43.039> see<00:00:44.039> that

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
and then there they always well see that

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.430 
and then there they always well see that
well

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.970 

so<00:00:52.280> basically<00:00:52.670> what<00:00:52.970> we<00:00:53.090> need<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.329> do<00:00:53.540> is<00:00:53.980> hook

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
so basically what we need to do is hook

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.040 
so basically what we need to do is hook
it<00:00:55.100> up<00:00:55.220> to<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.370> scan<00:00:55.730> tool<00:00:56.000> which<00:00:56.239> can<00:00:56.480> diagnose

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
it up to a scan tool which can diagnose

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.780 
it up to a scan tool which can diagnose
the<00:00:57.290> fault<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.820> I'm<00:00:58.940> gonna<00:01:00.040> use<00:01:01.040> a<00:01:01.070> diagnostic

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
the fault and I'm gonna use a diagnostic

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.820 
the fault and I'm gonna use a diagnostic
tool<00:01:02.030> which<00:01:02.629> will<00:01:02.870> show<00:01:03.110> you<00:01:03.170> where<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.500> fault

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
tool which will show you where the fault

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.400 
tool which will show you where the fault
is<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:05.449> then<00:01:05.600> hopefully<00:01:05.960> we<00:01:06.080> can<00:01:06.110> get<00:01:06.290> the

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
is and then hopefully we can get the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.350 
is and then hopefully we can get the
fault<00:01:06.620> fixed<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.220> then<00:01:07.369> we<00:01:07.640> set<00:01:07.880> using<00:01:08.210> that

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
fault fixed and then we set using that

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.430 
fault fixed and then we set using that
diagnostic<00:01:08.720> tool<00:01:09.140> as<00:01:09.290> well<00:01:10.150> remembering<00:01:11.150> it's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
diagnostic tool as well remembering it's

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.890 
diagnostic tool as well remembering it's

Stability control system we're trying

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.230 
Stability control system we're trying
diagnose<00:01:40.759> here<00:01:42.430> so<00:01:43.430> we<00:01:43.610> want<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:43.910> read<00:01:44.119> the

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
diagnose here so we want to read the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.590 
diagnose here so we want to read the
trouble<00:01:44.570> code<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.700> it's<00:01:46.940> telling<00:01:47.270> us<00:01:47.390> that

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
trouble code and it's telling us that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.740 
trouble code and it's telling us that
the<00:01:47.780> wheel<00:01:47.960> speed<00:01:48.320> sensor<00:01:48.890> we<00:01:49.190> are<00:01:49.310> left<00:01:49.720> has<00:01:50.720> a

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
the wheel speed sensor we are left has a

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.389 
the wheel speed sensor we are left has a
fault<00:01:51.140> it's<00:01:51.410> called<00:01:51.830> 5<00:01:52.430> Delta<00:01:52.850> over<00:01:53.330> zero<00:01:54.399> so

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
fault it's called 5 Delta over zero so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:56.800 
fault it's called 5 Delta over zero so
what<00:01:55.580> we<00:01:55.700> need<00:01:55.819> to<00:01:55.880> do<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.179> we<00:01:56.300> need<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.509> go<00:01:56.660> in

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
what we need to do is we need to go in

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.160 
what we need to do is we need to go in
and<00:01:57.080> change<00:01:57.410> that<00:01:57.679> ABS<00:01:57.950> sensor<00:01:58.459> over<00:01:58.929> once<00:01:59.929> the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
and change that ABS sensor over once the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.440 
and change that ABS sensor over once the
area<00:02:00.440> sensor<00:02:00.979> is<00:02:01.130> all<00:02:01.280> changed<00:02:01.970> over<00:02:02.149> then<00:02:02.360> we

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
area sensor is all changed over then we

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.180 
area sensor is all changed over then we
should<00:02:02.630> be<00:02:02.720> able<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.929> come<00:02:03.110> back<00:02:03.259> into<00:02:03.649> the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
should be able to come back into the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.180 
should be able to come back into the
vehicle<00:02:04.509> erase<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.690> fault<00:02:05.929> code<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.500> then

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
vehicle erase the fault code and then

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.210 
vehicle erase the fault code and then
the<00:02:07.310> ABS<00:02:07.700> light<00:02:07.940> should<00:02:08.830> clear<00:02:09.830> from<00:02:10.099> the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
the ABS light should clear from the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.059 
the ABS light should clear from the
dashboard<00:02:10.399> so<00:02:11.349> the<00:02:12.349> first<00:02:12.620> thing<00:02:12.800> we<00:02:12.890> need<00:02:13.040> to

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
dashboard so the first thing we need to

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.550 
dashboard so the first thing we need to
do<00:02:13.250> is<00:02:13.310> check<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.580> ABS<00:02:14.000> sensor<00:02:14.209> needs<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.230> jack

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
do is check the ABS sensor needs to jack

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.500 
do is check the ABS sensor needs to jack
up<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.920> vehicle<00:02:16.310> and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
up the vehicle and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.850

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
the rear wheel hi guys

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.660 
the rear wheel hi guys
giggles<00:02:22.310> jacked<00:02:22.549> up<00:02:22.760> wheelers<00:02:23.599> off<00:02:24.670> abs

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
giggles jacked up wheelers off abs

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.690 
giggles jacked up wheelers off abs
sensor<00:02:26.290> we<00:02:27.290> need<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.739> do<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:28.040> if<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.310> can<00:02:28.459> see

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
sensor we need to do is if you can see

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.160 
sensor we need to do is if you can see
this<00:02:29.480> cable<00:02:29.780> here<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.450> ABS<00:02:32.930> sensor

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
this cable here this is the ABS sensor

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.759 
this cable here this is the ABS sensor
k1<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.790> we<00:02:34.910> need<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:36.370> remove<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:38.780> bolt<00:02:39.410> there

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
k1 so we need to remove that bolt there

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.850 
k1 so we need to remove that bolt there
and<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.280> sensor<00:02:41.030> should<00:02:41.209> pull<00:02:41.510> out<00:02:41.769> then<00:02:42.769> if

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
and the sensor should pull out then if

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.550 
and the sensor should pull out then if
you<00:02:42.950> follow<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.750> lead<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.900> runs<00:02:45.110> underneath

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
you follow the lead it runs underneath

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.640 
you follow the lead it runs underneath
there<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.120> comes<00:02:47.360> out<00:02:47.540> here<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:49.280> goes

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
there and it comes out here it goes

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.670 
there and it comes out here it goes
plugs<00:02:51.650> in<00:02:51.860> just<00:02:52.190> under<00:02:52.670> this<00:02:53.530> piece<00:02:54.530> of

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
plugs in just under this piece of

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.390 
plugs in just under this piece of
material<00:02:54.829> here<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.579> what<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.329> can<00:02:56.480> do<00:02:56.629> is<00:02:57.400> take

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
material here so what you can do is take

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:19.110 
material here so what you can do is take
a<00:02:58.459> 10<00:02:58.910> mil<00:03:15.069> so<00:03:16.069> you<00:03:16.160> can<00:03:16.310> lift<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:16.609> pocket<00:03:16.910> and

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
a 10 mil so you can lift this pocket and

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.490 
a 10 mil so you can lift this pocket and
there<00:03:20.120> you<00:03:20.209> will<00:03:20.329> see<00:03:20.390> where<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.810> ABS<00:03:21.079> sensors

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
there you will see where the ABS sensors

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.110 
there you will see where the ABS sensors
plugged<00:03:21.769> in<00:03:22.720> simply<00:03:23.720> pull<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.079> out<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:25.120> should

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
plugged in simply pull that out I should

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.940 
plugged in simply pull that out I should
disconnect<00:03:27.019> really<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:30.790> should

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
disconnect really I should

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:45.690 
disconnect really I should
but<00:03:33.490> then<00:03:33.640> again<00:03:33.730> I've<00:03:34.030> got<00:03:34.240> a<00:03:34.270> camera<00:03:34.569> in<00:03:34.750> one

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.100 

so<00:03:46.700> you<00:03:46.760> just<00:03:46.910> need<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.150> unravel<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.780> ABS

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
so you just need to unravel the ABS

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.890 
so you just need to unravel the ABS
sensor<00:03:50.080> and<00:03:51.080> put<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.379> new<00:03:51.500> one<00:03:51.680> in<00:03:52.810> this<00:03:53.810> is

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
sensor and put the new one in this is

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.470 
sensor and put the new one in this is
the<00:03:54.019> new<00:03:54.140> abs<00:03:54.500> sensor<00:03:55.150> notice<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.239> part

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
the new abs sensor notice the part

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.600 
the new abs sensor notice the part
number<00:03:56.840> generally<00:03:57.800> will<00:03:57.950> do<00:03:58.099> the<00:03:58.220> same<00:03:58.400> on

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
number generally will do the same on

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.120 
number generally will do the same on
your<00:03:58.730> vehicle<00:03:59.180> boss<00:03:59.500> it<00:04:00.500> might<00:04:00.709> not<00:04:00.890> always<00:04:01.010> be

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
your vehicle boss it might not always be

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.870 
your vehicle boss it might not always be
the<00:04:01.310> case<00:04:01.340> so<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:01.670> might<00:04:01.880> need<00:04:01.970> double<00:04:02.300> check

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
the case so you might need double check

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.440 
the case so you might need double check
came<00:04:04.880> from<00:04:06.310> www<00:04:07.310> re<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.330> Dominator<00:04:08.750> Kotobuki

came from www re and Dominator Kotobuki

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.940 
came from www re and Dominator Kotobuki
that's<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.569> good<00:04:11.720> price

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
that's a good price

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.180 
that's a good price
I've<00:04:13.730> used<00:04:13.970> them<00:04:14.090> before<00:04:14.420> for<00:04:14.569> ABS<00:04:14.900> sensors<00:04:15.609> so

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
I've used them before for ABS sensors so

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.620 
I've used them before for ABS sensors so
definitely<00:04:19.190> give<00:04:19.370> it<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.519> try<00:04:19.790> so<00:04:20.389> we'll<00:04:20.510> get

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
definitely give it a try so we'll get

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.310 
definitely give it a try so we'll get
the<00:04:20.750> souped<00:04:20.959> up<00:04:22.270> maybe<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.389> sensor<00:04:23.840> is<00:04:23.990> in<00:04:24.139> there

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
the souped up maybe a sensor is in there

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:36.390 
the souped up maybe a sensor is in there
so<00:04:25.160> all<00:04:25.550> we<00:04:25.760> really<00:04:25.910> need<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.300> do<00:04:26.419> now<00:04:26.570> is<00:04:26.810> just

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:54.110 

go<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.639> vehicle

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.340 

all<00:04:55.120> right<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:55.510> we're<00:04:55.630> back<00:04:55.750> in<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:55.930> vehicle

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
all right so we're back in the vehicle

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.610 
all right so we're back in the vehicle
now<00:04:57.420> having<00:04:58.420> just<00:04:58.450> changed<00:04:58.990> over<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.290> ABS

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
now having just changed over the ABS

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.690 
now having just changed over the ABS
sensor<00:04:59.830> from<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.280> rear<00:05:02.400> what<00:05:03.400> we're<00:05:03.520> going<00:05:03.640> to

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
sensor from the rear what we're going to

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.790 
sensor from the rear what we're going to
go<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.150> do<00:05:04.270> now<00:05:04.510> is<00:05:04.750> arrays<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.260> trouble<00:05:05.590> code

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
go and do now is arrays the trouble code

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.040 
go and do now is arrays the trouble code
and<00:05:06.490> what<00:05:06.700> you<00:05:06.820> will<00:05:07.030> find<00:05:07.330> or<00:05:07.480> we<00:05:07.570> should<00:05:07.810> find

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
and what you will find or we should find

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.350 
and what you will find or we should find
if<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.380> sensor<00:05:09.010> has<00:05:09.220> been<00:05:09.940> put<00:05:10.150> in<00:05:10.240> there

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
if the sensor has been put in there

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.200 
if the sensor has been put in there
correctly<00:05:10.950> is<00:05:11.950> that<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.280> ABS<00:05:12.550> lights<00:05:12.940> on<00:05:13.120> the

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
correctly is that the ABS lights on the

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.720 
correctly is that the ABS lights on the
dashboard<00:05:13.390> here<00:05:13.750> will<00:05:14.020> be<00:05:14.680> removed<00:05:15.040> and<00:05:15.250> turn

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
dashboard here will be removed and turn

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.500 
dashboard here will be removed and turn
off<00:05:15.940> so<00:05:16.810> clicker<00:05:17.260> is<00:05:17.470> a<00:05:18.060> go<00:05:19.060> straight<00:05:19.390> away

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
off so clicker is a go straight away

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.420 
off so clicker is a go straight away
with<00:05:19.720> no<00:05:19.870> problem<00:05:20.200> they're<00:05:20.350> all<00:05:20.530> ABS<00:05:21.100> lights

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
with no problem they're all ABS lights

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.200 
with no problem they're all ABS lights
have<00:05:21.580> gone<00:05:21.610> off<00:05:21.790> there<00:05:22.200> so<00:05:23.200> that<00:05:24.040> is<00:05:24.220> very
