00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 congratulations rightful guess 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.960
 that you can be satisfied 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.059
 yes I think we can certainly be satisfied 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.580
 but like trains you still have 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.080
 certain things that find for 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.969
 could be improved 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.400
 once if we speak evidence so 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.779
 play dominant with so much pressure on the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.750
 opponent then you need those two de 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.279
 make colder 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.660
 in retrospect it is naturally in 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.300
 beauty of a second goal 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.140
 let it be clear but danny had 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.960
 the possibility to go in the first half 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.280
 make the two notes then he had the sage 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.390
 speak again at that match 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.640
 faster 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.110
 can be closed by the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.210
 fact that your boys are a little more estimated 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.789
 able to give and we just now 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.680
 you enjoyed doing the last fifteen minutes 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.030
 he of me uncertain and so you see that the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.980
 Bravest ball then goes in and the other 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.280
 shots from within the sixteen clarinet 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.469
 from who went on and then it looks so beautiful 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.470
 is very much you have a lot 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.810
 made in your career 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.980
 You know exactly how all of your goals 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.770
 used to go 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:08.170
 is in the top 5 yes i'm bonus tip 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.170
 top 5 in but why what position 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.450
 yes well up to 3 maybe my one 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.590
 study you can take me to them 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.480
 you try it your disease in the corner of your eye 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.830
 You see it might be an attack 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.350
 perfect in it 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.530
 so yes technically just right at that 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.360
 does what has it looks like a goal 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.850
 that he has also been scored times is years 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.729
 ago and it was a TV show by someone 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.369
 a tweet by whom I do not know who the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.020
 trees fill it up with red flowers if you like 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.710
 he wants to but I know you mean 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.190
 her even closer that week 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.190
 it was the same idea 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.880
 yet you had perhaps more should 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.210
 scoring can flush or does it seem 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.810
 very easy from the stands 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.680
 my viewers every goal and in congo 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.560
 then it becomes beautiful 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.390
 well well i have been here more often 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.500
 been in scoring position as the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.009
 past matches and that is according to 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.570
 good times 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.130
 and yes i think there 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.660
 bit of bad luck certainly one at 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.220
 must prick that their police 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.680
 I must have his pocket with a 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.230
 opponent that is difficult but 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.060
 two balls that were good but 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.230
 the more I have to score it is 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.510
 hardest in soccer 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.830
 we know that but if you then by way 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.410
 to speak 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.620
 such a goal scores she was not doing that 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.739
 then of course you have to be fantastic 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.690
 because I think this is enough 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.890
 of the month and a nice story score 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.450
 for themselves 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.299
 yes I think she did that herself 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.430
 gift given yes but important them 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.810
 were the 3 points and that you then on you 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.959
 furthermore also made a goal that 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.549
 so beautiful is that beans are just too much 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.950
 registered in advance kilo yes 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.470
 on the other hand you keep the 0 and again 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.540
 introduce me to them if you have one on maybe 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.610
 giving away two chances is much 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.850
 that is what we are, we have a great deal 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.340
 much pressure was exerted on Willem 2 and 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.000
 Willem 2 made it difficult for you not to 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.710
 to come to play 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.020
 And then you also know this from 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.740
 backward easier if you like them 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.740
 the build up late 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.060
 do what they want in the temple 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.730
 being must did too 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.010
 dangerous and that was not in today 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.060
 picture because the call is pushed forward 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.950
 given what 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.079
 in short, learned from that 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.530
 for example, burrows 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.849
 yes not only from roda i think of 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.090
 several competitions but we are still there 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.469
 not 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.299
 we have another whole Tuesday 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.439
 difficult pot and that's where we are now 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.060
 go direction 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.340
 are you physically there for example 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.010
 ready for yes that must follow quite 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.150
 have to take a look tomorrow how the state of 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.609
 business is how the injuries are 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.340
 and the freshness of the boys but me 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.409
 I think it will be better after today 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.180
 injuries because offline got a further 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.680
 as a precaution, tap to the side you think 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.780
 wants to get to the side as a precaution 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.430
 achieved yes and there it says 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.139
 return come hand side 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.959
 ultimately offers more perspective 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:05.169
 then you have more options 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.169
 because too 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.819
 in marseille you need everyone
