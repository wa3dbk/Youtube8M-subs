00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.410
 inhibited 60 years ago I decided to change

 to another country to meet another 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.350
 country for painting to improve life and 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.799

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.499
 My brother was already living in Portugal and was 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.460
 also to find European culture 

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:10.979

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.219

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.609
 grândola and cultivating plant also flower 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:20.509
 here we are 70 years old are growing 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:24.719
 these plants is here in portugal 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:27.509
 I have always liked plants from the flora of 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:30.810
 trees always enjoying the person and the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.939
 humans and animals for the mission 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.670
 living things are very interesting and 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.079
 now in the last 20 30 years my life 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.299
 all working with flávio 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.539
 I really like it because it wakes up. 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.340
 the feeling of the people this much 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.229
 interesting cultivar has so many types 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.929
 different plants and here in portugal 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.549
 is touched content size 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.889
 especially san antonio 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.799
 the group a tropical plant that originates 

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:58.349
 observed from South America to the center 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.659
 america and a very generous plant 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:03.270
 It's a long life when you wear a diaper. 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.950
 cut to the plant in a vase and we 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.950
 for a year growing a small plant 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.569
 promote great care in the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.890
 climate the manure and all the water the humidity 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.750
 the plant that was and 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.040
 because if one sells the person enjoys the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.800
 plant in your house 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.800
 in case the bottom cut that is for me is 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.620
 more interesting is a plant that we have 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.490
 small chameleon with a material 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.240
 that the skilled person is of the type la rocca 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:37.050
 and this could live of the year and 10 15 years 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.260
 within substrate and we take care of your there 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.140
 and then cutting a photo gives a flower a 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.239
 leaf a flower a leaf all your life 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.790
 then we cut flower pack shows 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.430
 flower with a tube to protect it by 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.450
 boxes to send to the florist the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.080
 majority who use this plant in 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.670
 really very delicate sound for a 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.910
 climate so there is a greenhouse with 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.300
 technology that allows you to protect 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.870
 of the cold we have heating with the 11 that 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.620
 biomass and burn in wood 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.530
 The rest of the bagasse is crushed 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.680
 for example the rest of the product 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.680
 also is we have automatic pantai that 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.560
 allows with lots of sun and close the sun made 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.840
 the audience is getting shadow a new cloud 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.840
 opens the planting and feared automatic with 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.209
 fogging and I fear automatic fertilization 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.920
 six times a day for one 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.120
 minute for the plant to have all 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.160
 care needed 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.739
 our work also cut the leaves 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.260
 it was so to take away though they sold it 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.840
 time while also being more careful 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.660
 is to take care of the plant with the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.549
 that is perfect and from that the 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.560
 also a small cultivation of 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.630
 orchid but the concentration in this 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.079
 moment and cultured flower 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:02.730
 cut me a more beautiful plant is 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:05.489
 there are plans for the future 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:11.820
 immediate future is to enjoy life in every 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:14.459
 to find peace and be well now 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.919
 It's my family taking care of their children already. 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.890
 started to be great is that they are good 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.460
 start a job one place the other with 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.850
 greenhouse greenhouses with floro flowers 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:32.220
 it is the turn to let the thing come to a 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:36.030
 good time now level of precise plans 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.770
 I would like in the future without being another 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.889
 change the country has an experience 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.430
 in another more complicated country to learn 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.699
 the tongue to come to the mother in the 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:51.569
 Australia or in Thailand and elsewhere 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:54.380
 hot and different country to do 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.380
 other 13
