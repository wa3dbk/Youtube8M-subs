00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.070
 that there are friends of youtube 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.000
 Today I am going to teach you how to remove this 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.779
 problem that we have in the network error 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.270
 not because we can not connect to 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.000
 a computer and as we can see I have 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.730
 in network three computers that is new 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.039
 pc becomes me equal soul workstation 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.820
 in this case I am controlled from this 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.280
 Saul go with a remote access to Saul 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.980
 workstation 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.920
 then it is basically the purchase 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.930
 of the workstation then obviously 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.190
 we will have access without any problem 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.190
 in our workstation because it's the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.860
 same culture to lenovo pc too 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.559
 we have access but now at the time of 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.559
 try to open saul go let's see 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.820
 will be thinking and we will not leave again 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.820
 could get in 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.780
 whoever encloses this 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.619
 keep thinking and keep thinking and not 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.280
 You can enter because you can not enter 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.770
 can enter disappear state 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.630
 but can not get access to a bathroom 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.909
 good in this case they will appear on 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.920
 name of your computer I am 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.380
 doing a lot of research on how 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.869
 solve this problem and then I could not 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:35.200
 but I just discovered with which one is 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:38.920
 the problem of error 0 x 800 700 35 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.400
 this error is due to the firewall 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.750
 for example and today I said because I think that 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.050
 it is more than obvious that it can be the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.270
 firewall we are going to show 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.270
 we will bring your firewall 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.000
 and this really I do this video 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.100
 because I did not find any solution 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.730
 I really had to discover it myself 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.120
 what was the answer 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.880
 problem school then I hope with 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.580
 this can help you 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.680
 enough people not good here I can see 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.920
 that the firewall is totally 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.580
 off then we ask ourselves what 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.060
 that the firewall 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.950
 well there really are a few antivirus like 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.280
 kaspersky in this case I have it here 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.130
 open that activate another firewall inside 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.170
 of them it does not matter that they activate 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.830
 windows firewall I'm going to leave you 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.590
 activated another firewall because 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.020
 because it has power I am kaspersky 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.180
 then it really is not there 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.460
 have to configure it and you have to deactivate 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.340
 software word like here we can see 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:52.320
 this firewall is enabled then 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.320
 you have to check your antivirus 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.400
 obviously I have to wait if I can 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.500
 that you have another type of 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.940
 antivirus then there is only 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.580
 what to look for where your 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.350
 firewall of your antivirus and then from 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.680
 there, for example, only what 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.360
 deactivated I will not accept them and will 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.040
 say that some components are 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.290
 disabled and then if so, no 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.030
 because I enabled them then I'm going to 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.800
 close and let's see what happens with 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.590
 our access remote control 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.130
 health workstation that I have here we are going to 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.200
 open and quickly we already have access to 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.320
 the computed not only that but also already 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.970
 we have access to the folders to the 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.850
 folder that I had already shared that was 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.980
 material that we see it in another side that 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.100
 this is abel bayo and this health 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.920
 workstation here we see 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.569
 on the computer that is already enabled on 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.530
 material 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.510
 and also in the remote access of 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.749
 health workstation we also have 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.030
 exactly the same access and we can 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:57.090
 see that we already have all our 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.360
 textures like 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.220
 and all our images and folders that 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.040
 we want to share we already have them 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.650
 shared in the other counted in this 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.590
 case I do not have remote control access 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.349
 in kabul l go towards new pc but 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.500
 also in the new pc I can see 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.720
 these textures well I hope that with this 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.930
 have solved some doubts and power 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.570

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.880

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.040

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.470
 trying hours and then I do not 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.510
