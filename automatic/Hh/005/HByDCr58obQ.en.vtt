00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
a little tighter I actually went with

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.439 
a little tighter I actually went with
the<00:04:13.500> plastic<00:04:16.579> instead<00:04:17.579> of<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.820> ailment<00:04:18.269> this

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
the plastic instead of the ailment this

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.719 
the plastic instead of the ailment this
is<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.600> platinum<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.169> took<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.470> aluminum<00:04:19.949> off

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729

tolerance<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:26.430> it's<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.639> lot<00:04:26.759> tighter<00:04:28.550> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
tolerance and it's a lot tighter the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.939 
tolerance and it's a lot tighter the
aluminum<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.360> actually<00:04:30.570> had<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.080> shin<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.650> try
