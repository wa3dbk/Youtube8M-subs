00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750
 made a diatonic accordion is more 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.269
 small of a different plate structure 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.309
 10 buttons each of which produces 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.710
 two notes one when compressing the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.350
 keep the other when it expands 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.210
 the diatonic accordion also called 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.199
 organetto is the main instrument 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.199
 of popular music 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.769
 the artisan who produces the accordions 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.859
 draws the right keyboard from the candle a 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.130
 hardwood first sawing 10 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.070
 grooves then practice 10 holes with a 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.920
 drill the keyboard to be exact not 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.140
 it is composed of keys but here 10 buttons 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.879
 which produce the notes now costs 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.620
 the artisan flips the keyboard e 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.809
 dig the wood with a milling machine 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.460
 creating the space that will allow for 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.350
 pieces to move each groove of the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.789
 keyboard will house a toggle that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.989
 connect each button to his 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.180
 corresponding air valve 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.190
 now the sound box is built one 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.979
 box containing steel reeds 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.210
 which produce the accordion sound 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.979
 pressing and releasing the buttons yes 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.290
 pushes air into the holes in the case 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.180
 harmonica depending on the buttons yes 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.960
 they press the area will come in a different one 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.210
 reed thus producing the most le 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.340
 reeds are long and thick and less vibrate 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.770
 and the note's tone is lower more 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.710
 the reeds are short thinner the faster it is 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.950
 the higher the note there is a vibration 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.770
 8 also for each button compressing the 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.410
 bellows activate 4 by expanding it 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.090
 four others using an iron 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.619
 hot the artisan seals the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.180
 structure of the hips with wax 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.759
 of bees to avoid spillage 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.590
 air 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.300
 let's go back to the artisan keyboard 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.280
 install 10 valves made of wood 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.800
 of maple each of which has one 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.869
 plastic lever at the signature a spring 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.310
 ensures that the rod has the right one 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.140
 tension to open and close 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.710
 correctly the valve when the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.869
 musician press the button 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.820
 after having colored and lacquered in wood 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.490
 the artisan glues a button to each 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.560
 funny over the internal lever 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.530
 pressing a button triggers the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.850
 leventina that goes to cover the relative ones 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:22.030
 holes below the tuner assembles 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.010
 and tests the keyboard sounds 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.250
 now it can mount the left side 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.590
 of the keyboard using the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.590
 boiling wax just like before 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.330
 the valves in this keyboard are made 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.340
 of pine a more flexible wood than 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.550
 makes their installation easier 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.590
 in this limited space 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.240
 outside an intense is placed 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.950
 decorative wooden made from a 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.730
 ebony strip and some 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.310
 rosewood details on the keyboard 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.190
 left with two matching buttons 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.230
 each with three reeds it produces two notes 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.510
 low and two agreements 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.580
 after having colored and lacquered the keyboard 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.290
 the craftsman attacks a spring between each 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.450
 valve and its equivalent a 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.750
 button adjusts the spring tension 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.630
 and check the seal of the press then 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.430
 the name of the company inside now 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.750
 waist the keyboard completes the case 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.120
 finite harmonica 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.480
 meanwhile the bellows are prepared 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.340
 that pushes the air through the reeds la 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.880
 factory buys pre-pack cardboard 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.310
 caught you local knows if from these 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.720
 diamond-shaped leather pieces 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.650
 seal the openings avoiding that 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.650
 the air escapes 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.790
 now strips of fabric come 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.130
 glued inside the folds of the 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.130
 cardboard for decorative purposes only 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.640
 these are the steel coatings 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.170
 stainless reinforce the edges of the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.400
 cardboard so as not to make them punctured 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.140
 other strips of fabric come 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.810
 glued on the ends of the folds 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.810
 this decorates to reinforce the cardboard 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.910
 let's move on to the final assembly 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.300
 the craftsman nails the bellows to 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:30.000
 left keyboard just like it was 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.920
 in the past the keyboard left to one 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.250
 hand strap the right one nor a 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.510
 one for the thumb after that too 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.180
 right keyboard has been nailed 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.650
 this diatonic accordion is ready 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.650
 for a musical test
