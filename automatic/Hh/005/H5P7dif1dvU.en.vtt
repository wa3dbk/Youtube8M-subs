00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.710
 Parcel arrived from China rode to 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.010
 channel 20 days 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.320
 see ordinary Chinese mail well I 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.130
 I think it's not difficult to guess what is here 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.310
 I will come of course to open tech 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:34.080
 in size it is clear that it is 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:39.180
 I came but see ordered selfi 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:44.070
 stick this in because a friend wanted 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.350

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.910

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.520
 or work all here with us as always 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.640
 nothing else well and selfie stick goes 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.550
 which box is a box of course 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.489
 crumpled on the road 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:04.339
 it's okay seller 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.380
 took care 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.920
 good so sealed oh well 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.500
 let's see , we immediately have a mount 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.330
 I still have me so much 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.530
 such is not necessary and nothing else here 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.409
 there are no boxes and such came to us 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:26.640
 selfie stick gave such a mount but not 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.729
 especially reliable what to do already 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.659
 there is so to speak let's see how it is 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.380
 one segment opens the second segment 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.650
 the third segment is shorter guys it is very 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.299
 long enough this still i'm not up to the end 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.360
 and laid out let's add 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.210
 as stated by the seller she is somewhere 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.990
 up to about 100 meters and folded 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.729
 she is 20 centimeters looking at 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.570
 we also have jack and a button 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.840
 Of course, no, I understand the batteries 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.790
 I do not need to insert anything here hopefully not 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.840
 it is necessary then let's see how we 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.840
 is mounting 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.080
 so we have a little black mount 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:24.970
 let's trailer well of course here and under 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:28.209
 so let's see this side 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.209
 does it reach 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:38.989

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:43.250

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.170

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:55.670
 Already good because I have a familiar iphone 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.280
 6 Well, I think it will be very , very great 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.989
 pretty strong handle to me 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.810
 like here we have written monopod 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.879
 look great photographed but it's on 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.390
 this camera is like a front one 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.700
 Why do we look at the camera? 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.489

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.340
