this<00:03:22.560> swelling<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:23.129> due<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:24.000> liquid<00:03:24.480> which

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
this swelling is due to liquid which

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.140 
this swelling is due to liquid which

must do four things first shading the
extent<00:07:26.350> of<00:07:26.470> your<00:07:26.650> eczema<00:07:26.830> in<00:07:27.430> the<00:07:27.760> outline

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
extent of your eczema in the outline

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.500 
extent of your eczema in the outline
drawing<00:07:29.100> then<00:07:30.100> assess<00:07:30.610> the<00:07:30.790> dryness<00:07:31.030> of<00:07:31.360> your

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:31.510 
drawing then assess the dryness of your

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.370 
drawing then assess the dryness of your
skin<00:07:33.210> then<00:07:34.210> tick<00:07:34.570> the<00:07:34.600> boxes<00:07:35.170> which

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:35.380 
skin then tick the boxes which

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.890 
skin then tick the boxes which
correspond<00:07:36.040> to<00:07:36.160> the<00:07:36.370> intensity<00:07:37.000> of<00:07:37.300> the

correspond to the intensity of the
various<00:07:38.350> symptoms<00:07:38.740> using<00:07:39.460> the<00:07:39.820> illustrations

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 
various symptoms using the illustrations

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.300 
various symptoms using the illustrations
and<00:07:42.600> finally<00:07:43.600> assess<00:07:44.110> on<00:07:44.440> the<00:07:44.770> scale<00:07:45.040> from

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.310 
and finally assess on the scale from

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.790 
and finally assess on the scale from
zero<00:07:45.670> to<00:07:45.730> ten<00:07:45.940> the<00:07:46.480> disturbance<00:07:47.110> caused<00:07:47.440> by

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800 
zero to ten the disturbance caused by

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.500 
zero to ten the disturbance caused by
itching<00:07:48.250> and<00:07:48.460> sleep<00:07:48.820> loss<00:07:50.760> the<00:07:51.760> final<00:07:52.150> score

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:52.510 
itching and sleep loss the final score

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.470 
itching and sleep loss the final score
will<00:07:53.020> be<00:07:53.200> calculated<00:07:53.890> by<00:07:54.040> your<00:07:54.220> doctor<00:07:54.640> but

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:55.480 
will be calculated by your doctor but

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.020 
will be calculated by your doctor but
you<00:07:56.110> can<00:07:56.290> also<00:07:56.560> calculate<00:07:57.010> it<00:07:57.490> using<00:07:57.700> the

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.030 
you can also calculate it using the

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:02.880 
you can also calculate it using the
equations<00:07:58.600> at<00:07:58.810> the<00:07:58.840> end<00:07:59.110> of<00:07:59.290> the<00:07:59.410> form<00:08:01.890> well

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:02.890 
equations at the end of the form well

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.670 
equations at the end of the form well
good<00:08:03.520> luck
