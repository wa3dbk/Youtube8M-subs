today's video we're gonna be discussing

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.810 
today's video we're gonna be discussing
basic<00:01:41.509> domination<00:01:42.509> tactics<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.670> find<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
basic domination tactics I find the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.850 
basic domination tactics I find the
initial<00:01:45.000> rush<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.689> most<00:01:45.960> important<00:01:46.560> part<00:01:46.799> of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
initial rush the most important part of

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.980 
initial rush the most important part of
this<00:01:46.979> game<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.060> secure<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.600> central

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
this game if you can secure the central

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.630 
this game if you can secure the central
flag<00:01:49.290> you're<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:49.950> good<00:01:50.070> position<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
flag you're in a very good position to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.880 
flag you're in a very good position to
set<00:01:50.939> up<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.299> pretty<00:01:52.020> much<00:01:52.140> hold<00:01:52.439> all<00:01:52.740> the

set up and pretty much hold all the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.249 
set up and pretty much hold all the
avenues<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.280> approach<00:01:53.689> I'd<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.020> start

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259

with<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> riot<00:02:24.150> shield<00:02:24.620> hopefully<00:02:25.620> my

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
with the riot shield hopefully my

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.060 
with the riot shield hopefully my
teammates<00:02:26.130> didn't<00:02:26.340> cover<00:02:26.460> my<00:02:26.670> behind<00:02:26.940> and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
teammates didn't cover my behind and

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.140 
teammates didn't cover my behind and
like<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.220> said<00:02:29.430> once<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.700> capture<00:02:29.940> that

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
like I said once you capture that

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.510 
like I said once you capture that
central<00:02:30.630> flag<00:02:31.010> you're<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.160> good<00:02:32.370> position

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
central flag you're in a good position

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.900 
central flag you're in a good position
so<00:02:35.520> here's<00:02:36.240> one<00:02:36.540> more<00:02:36.780> clip<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.520> in<00:02:38.520> this<00:02:38.700> one

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
so here's one more clip and in this one

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.490 
so here's one more clip and in this one
it<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.270> shows<00:02:39.450> another<00:02:39.480> example<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.350> an

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
it just shows another example of an

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.420 
it just shows another example of an
initial<00:02:40.890> rush<00:02:41.100> with<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.760> ride<00:02:41.940> shield<00:02:43.430> now

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
initial rush with the ride shield now

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.400 
initial rush with the ride shield now
the<00:02:44.520> ride<00:02:44.790> shield<00:02:45.150> isn't<00:02:45.540> perfect<00:02:45.990> for<00:02:46.170> every

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
the ride shield isn't perfect for every

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.620 
the ride shield isn't perfect for every
map<00:02:47.450> but<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.870> can<00:02:49.500> find<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.740> way<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.890> make<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.220> work

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
map but I can find a way to make it work

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.850 
map but I can find a way to make it work
one<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.720> my<00:02:51.780> favorite<00:02:52.110> classes<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:55.260> again<00:02:55.440> here

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
one of my favorite classes so again here

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.760 
one of my favorite classes so again here
rushing<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.490> center<00:02:56.790> flag<00:02:57.500> absorbing<00:02:58.500> fire

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
rushing the center flag absorbing fire

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.740 
rushing the center flag absorbing fire
so<00:02:59.250> your<00:02:59.400> opponent<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.030> your<00:03:00.180> teammates<00:03:00.600> can

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
so your opponent so your teammates can

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.240 
so your opponent so your teammates can
take<00:03:01.110> down<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.470> opponents<00:03:03.530> now<00:03:04.530> once<00:03:05.040> I

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
take down the opponents now once I

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.340 
take down the opponents now once I
secure<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.910> central<00:03:06.420> flag<00:03:06.630> if<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.990> happen<00:03:07.140> to

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
secure the central flag if I happen to

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.460 
secure the central flag if I happen to
survive<00:03:08.060> I'll<00:03:09.060> set<00:03:09.390> up<00:03:09.420> for<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.930> position

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
survive I'll set up for the position

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.390 
survive I'll set up for the position
around<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.310> flag<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:13.220> pretty<00:03:14.220> much<00:03:14.340> just

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
around that flag and pretty much just

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.640 
around that flag and pretty much just
try<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.910> hold<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:16.880> also<00:03:17.880> like<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.650> switch

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
try to hold it I also like to switch

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.680 
try to hold it I also like to switch
classes<00:03:20.310> once<00:03:20.580> I'm<00:03:20.790> comfortable<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.540> we're

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
classes once I'm comfortable that we're

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.210 
classes once I'm comfortable that we're
in<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.840> good<00:03:21.989> position<00:03:24.440> don't<00:03:25.440> do<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.040> this

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
in a good position don't do it in this

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.570 
in a good position don't do it in this
clip<00:03:26.580> here<00:03:27.030> but<00:03:28.010> most<00:03:29.010> part<00:03:29.220> once<00:03:29.430> you're

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
clip here but most part once you're

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.580 
clip here but most part once you're
comfortable<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.510> have<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.690> spawn<00:03:31.260> flag

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
comfortable that you have a spawn flag

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.440 
comfortable that you have a spawn flag
and<00:03:31.860> then<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.100> central<00:03:32.430> flag<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:33.000> can<00:03:33.030> switch

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
and then the central flag you can switch

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.500 
and then the central flag you can switch
classes<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:34.790> use<00:03:35.790> whatever<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.300> comfortable

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
classes and use whatever is comfortable

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.880 
classes and use whatever is comfortable
for<00:03:36.750> you

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.010 

so<00:03:42.890> this<00:03:43.040> next<00:03:43.250> example<00:03:43.610> is<00:03:44.210> another<00:03:44.690> game

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
so this next example is another game

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.840 
so this next example is another game
that<00:03:45.590> I'm<00:03:45.860> gonna<00:03:45.980> show<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.220> little<00:03:46.340> more<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.760> the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
that I'm gonna show a little more of the

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.650 
that I'm gonna show a little more of the
match<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.460> little<00:03:49.700> bit<00:03:49.880> into<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.180> we

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
match so this is a little bit into it we

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.270 
match so this is a little bit into it we
failed<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:51.140> first<00:03:51.290> couple<00:03:51.650> of<00:03:51.680> rushes<00:03:52.040> for

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
failed the first couple of rushes for

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.220 
failed the first couple of rushes for
the<00:03:52.370> center<00:03:52.610> flag<00:03:52.850> I<00:03:53.290> just<00:03:54.290> kept<00:03:54.440> trying<00:03:56.230> and

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
the center flag I just kept trying and

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.370 
the center flag I just kept trying and
eventually<00:03:57.440> you<00:03:57.860> get<00:03:58.010> it

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
eventually you get it

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.800 
eventually you get it
no<00:04:00.380> this<00:04:00.650> isn't<00:04:01.040> very<00:04:01.480> kill<00:04:02.480> death<00:04:02.690> ratio

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
no this isn't very kill death ratio

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.470 
no this isn't very kill death ratio
friendly<00:04:03.710> but<00:04:03.980> like<00:04:04.490> I<00:04:04.640> said<00:04:04.700> you<00:04:05.090> know<00:04:05.210> I

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
friendly but like I said you know I

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.740 
friendly but like I said you know I
played<00:04:06.200> a<00:04:06.230> win<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:07.210> that's<00:04:08.210> the<00:04:08.360> point<00:04:08.540> of<00:04:08.660> the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
played a win and that's the point of the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.110 
played a win and that's the point of the
game<00:04:08.870> so<00:04:09.350> this<00:04:09.890> is<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:10.070> domination<00:04:10.520> tactic

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
game so this is a domination tactic

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.890 
game so this is a domination tactic
there<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:11.990> see<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.440> I've<00:04:12.590> switched<00:04:12.980> classes

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
there you see that I've switched classes

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:22.420 
there you see that I've switched classes
I'm<00:04:14.900> ready<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.470> hold<00:04:16.070> down<00:04:16.280> flags<00:04:21.220> I'm<00:04:22.220> just

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
I'm ready to hold down flags I'm just

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:40.390 
I'm ready to hold down flags I'm just
waiting<00:04:22.790> to<00:04:22.820> die<00:04:22.940> here<00:04:23.360> switch<00:04:23.660> classes

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.430 

so<00:04:41.400> you've<00:04:41.970> got<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.300> remember<00:04:42.540> that<00:04:42.930> for<00:04:43.260> most

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
so you've got to remember that for most

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.050 
so you've got to remember that for most
Maps<00:04:43.770> there's<00:04:44.070> only<00:04:44.190> certain<00:04:44.520> avenues<00:04:45.030> of

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
Maps there's only certain avenues of

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.820 
Maps there's only certain avenues of
approach<00:04:45.420> on<00:04:45.840> this<00:04:45.960> map<00:04:46.140> in<00:04:46.320> particular

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
approach on this map in particular

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.470 
approach on this map in particular
there's<00:04:47.040> only<00:04:47.190> three<00:04:47.580> ways<00:04:47.790> they<00:04:48.060> can<00:04:48.120> come<00:04:48.360> in

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
there's only three ways they can come in

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.680 
there's only three ways they can come in
yet<00:04:48.750> so<00:04:48.990> there's<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:50.250> two<00:04:50.520> there<00:04:51.270> I'm<00:04:51.510> sorry

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
yet so there's the two there I'm sorry

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.200 
yet so there's the two there I'm sorry
there's<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.110> three<00:04:52.410> bridges<00:04:52.880> so<00:04:53.880> if<00:04:54.060> you're

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
there's the three bridges so if you're

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.970 
there's the three bridges so if you're
playing<00:04:54.510> with<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.720> team<00:04:54.960> that's<00:04:55.320> great<00:04:55.650> because

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
playing with a team that's great because

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.740 
playing with a team that's great because
then<00:04:56.160> you<00:04:56.400> can<00:04:56.550> easily<00:04:56.700> break<00:04:57.030> up<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.510> decide

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
then you can easily break up and decide

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.410 
then you can easily break up and decide
who's<00:04:57.960> going<00:04:58.200> we're<00:04:58.730> playing<00:04:59.730> with<00:04:59.850> randoms<00:05:00.300> a

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
who's going we're playing with randoms a

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.870 
who's going we're playing with randoms a
little<00:05:00.630> tougher<00:05:01.100> but<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.130> usually<00:05:02.640> try<00:05:02.850> to

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
little tougher but I usually try to

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.870 
little tougher but I usually try to
cover<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.620> least<00:05:04.620> popular<00:05:05.220> Avenue<00:05:05.820> of

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
cover the least popular Avenue of

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.760 
cover the least popular Avenue of
approach<00:05:06.320> because<00:05:07.320> I<00:05:07.410> know<00:05:07.470> they'll<00:05:07.710> be

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
approach because I know they'll be

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.020 
approach because I know they'll be
covering<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.220> other<00:05:08.340> way<00:05:10.700> so<00:05:11.700> there's<00:05:11.880> no

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
covering the other way so there's no

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.810 
covering the other way so there's no
need<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.270> rush<00:05:12.780> in<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.350> take<00:05:13.770> see<00:05:14.070> that<00:05:14.550> will

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
need to rush in and take see that will

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.270 
need to rush in and take see that will
screw<00:05:15.090> up<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.300> spawns<00:05:15.600> if<00:05:16.020> you<00:05:16.170> keep<00:05:16.380> two

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
screw up the spawns if you keep two

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.160 
screw up the spawns if you keep two
flags<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.880> let<00:05:17.970> them<00:05:18.090> have<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.330> third<00:05:18.600> it

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
flags and let them have the third it

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.100 
flags and let them have the third it
will<00:05:19.830> have<00:05:20.130> them<00:05:20.340> spawning<00:05:20.730> back<00:05:21.720> by<00:05:21.960> their

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
will have them spawning back by their

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.910 
will have them spawning back by their
flag<00:05:22.410> and<00:05:22.770> this<00:05:23.040> is<00:05:23.220> very<00:05:23.430> beneficial<00:05:23.600> because

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
flag and this is very beneficial because

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:34.690 
flag and this is very beneficial because
you'll<00:05:25.920> know<00:05:26.130> where<00:05:26.820> they're<00:05:26.970> coming<00:05:27.090> from

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.060 

so<00:05:35.270> obviously<00:05:35.720> I'm<00:05:35.840> coming<00:05:36.170> the<00:05:36.290> left<00:05:36.620> avenue

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
so obviously I'm coming the left avenue

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.780 
so obviously I'm coming the left avenue
of<00:05:37.130> approach<00:05:37.220> here<00:05:38.350> I've<00:05:39.350> got<00:05:40.070> one<00:05:40.340> teammate

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
of approach here I've got one teammate

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:41.440 
of approach here I've got one teammate
with<00:05:41.000> me

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
with me

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.700 
with me
and<00:05:42.070> I<00:05:43.070> have<00:05:43.280> the<00:05:43.430> other<00:05:43.460> four<00:05:43.850> guys<00:05:44.090> are<00:05:44.710> split

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
and I have the other four guys are split

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.940 
and I have the other four guys are split
up<00:05:45.890> and<00:05:46.100> covering<00:05:46.780> the<00:05:47.780> other<00:05:48.020> ways<00:05:48.290> to<00:05:48.800> get<00:05:48.890> to

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
up and covering the other ways to get to

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:57.370 
up and covering the other ways to get to
the<00:05:49.130> flags<00:05:53.200> and<00:05:54.200> that's<00:05:54.710> pretty<00:05:55.040> much<00:05:55.160> it<00:05:56.380> once

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
the flags and that's pretty much it once

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.530 
the flags and that's pretty much it once
you<00:05:57.680> have<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:58.250> two<00:05:58.460> flags<00:05:58.820> you<00:05:59.180> know<00:05:59.300> you<00:05:59.390> just

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
you have the two flags you know you just

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.910 
you have the two flags you know you just
want<00:05:59.690> to<00:05:59.720> set<00:05:59.870> up<00:05:59.960> a<00:06:00.020> perimeter<00:06:00.230> around<00:06:00.440> them

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.920 
want to set up a perimeter around them

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.830 
want to set up a perimeter around them
the<00:06:01.610> only<00:06:01.760> time<00:06:02.000> you<00:06:02.120> want<00:06:02.210> to<00:06:02.300> push<00:06:02.510> in<00:06:02.690> for

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
the only time you want to push in for

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.270 
the only time you want to push in for
their<00:06:02.960> flag<00:06:03.140> is<00:06:03.470> if<00:06:03.620> you're<00:06:03.800> sure<00:06:04.040> you're

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
their flag is if you're sure you're

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.160 
their flag is if you're sure you're
gonna<00:06:04.370> lose<00:06:04.610> one<00:06:04.790> of<00:06:04.880> yours<00:06:05.090> I<00:06:09.280> also<00:06:10.280> use<00:06:10.580> the

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
gonna lose one of yours I also use the

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.960 
gonna lose one of yours I also use the
sensory<00:06:12.220> turret<00:06:13.220> gun<00:06:13.400> because<00:06:13.970> it's<00:06:14.240> a<00:06:14.360> great

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
sensory turret gun because it's a great

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.730 
sensory turret gun because it's a great
great<00:06:16.970> support<00:06:17.420> to<00:06:17.540> have<00:06:17.750> on<00:06:18.350> domination<00:06:20.740> try

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
great support to have on domination try

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.530 
great support to have on domination try
to<00:06:21.800> set<00:06:22.130> it<00:06:22.160> up<00:06:22.340> covering<00:06:22.880> one<00:06:23.030> of<00:06:23.060> your<00:06:23.210> flags

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
to set it up covering one of your flags

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.760 
to set it up covering one of your flags
and<00:06:23.960> you<00:06:24.470> can<00:06:24.680> basically<00:06:25.990> leave<00:06:26.990> that<00:06:27.200> Flybe

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
and you can basically leave that Flybe

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:34.940 
and you can basically leave that Flybe
and<00:06:28.010> focus<00:06:28.370> on<00:06:28.490> a<00:06:28.520> different<00:06:28.700> direction

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.580 

so<00:06:35.520> obviously<00:06:36.090> we<00:06:36.330> win<00:06:36.540> this<00:06:36.720> game<00:06:36.960> so<00:06:37.350> no

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
so obviously we win this game so no

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.610 
so obviously we win this game so no
sense<00:06:37.890> going<00:06:38.160> anymore<00:06:38.400> into<00:06:38.850> it<00:06:39.000> but<00:06:39.620> that
