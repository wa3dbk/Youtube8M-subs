clips<00:04:18.070> they're<00:04:18.280> more<00:04:18.459> like<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.760> little

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
clips they're more like the little

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.900 
clips they're more like the little
sliding<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.959> cones<00:04:20.400> taking<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.489> off<00:04:21.640> and

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
sliding and cones taking it off and

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.650 
sliding and cones taking it off and
putting<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.270> on<00:04:22.360> every<00:04:22.840> morning<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:23.320> night<00:04:23.610> so

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
putting it on every morning and night so

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.290 
putting it on every morning and night so
easy<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.140> don't<00:04:26.500> have<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.340> touch<00:04:27.610> my<00:04:27.940> hair

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
easy and I don't have to touch my hair

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.380 
easy and I don't have to touch my hair
so<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.020> think<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:29.470> this<00:04:29.800> is<00:04:30.010> kind<00:04:30.310> of<00:04:30.340> like<00:04:30.550> my

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
so I think that this is kind of like my

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.530 
so I think that this is kind of like my
solution<00:04:32.260> to<00:04:32.500> protect<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:32.980> styling<00:04:33.610> like<00:04:34.270> let
