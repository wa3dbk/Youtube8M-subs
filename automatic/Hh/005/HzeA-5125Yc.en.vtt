00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
eyes and stuff like that so it was a

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.339 
eyes and stuff like that so it was a
tough<00:05:52.669> night<00:05:52.930> defensively<00:05:53.930> of<00:05:54.050> course<00:05:54.229> I

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
tough night defensively of course I

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.740 
tough night defensively of course I
don't<00:05:54.410> think<00:05:54.650> we<00:05:54.710> stopped<00:05:55.009> on<00:05:55.360> maybe<00:05:56.360> punting

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
don't think we stopped on maybe punting

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.620 
don't think we stopped on maybe punting
three<00:05:57.080> times<00:05:57.380> in<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.680> whole<00:05:57.800> night

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
three times in the whole night

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.150 
three times in the whole night
offensively<00:05:59.630> I<00:05:59.990> don't<00:06:00.260> think<00:06:00.440> we<00:06:00.530> performed

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
offensively I don't think we performed

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.270 
offensively I don't think we performed
that<00:06:01.190> we<00:06:01.400> made<00:06:01.610> bad<00:06:01.849> decisions<00:06:02.050> as<00:06:03.050> a<00:06:03.740> coach

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
that we made bad decisions as a coach

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.980 
that we made bad decisions as a coach
