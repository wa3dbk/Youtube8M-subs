00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.660
 hello my name is remote cajamarca am 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.910
 of quito and I am 27 years old 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.280
 basically my dream started recently 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.610
 I realized what I wanted to do I had my 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.800
 mother who had 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.800
 a pre-infarct does 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.079
 some months when it happened on the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.180
 little heart of my life in a world in 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.789
 where if there is no longer 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.890
 I think not 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.220
 it would not be the same or it could not live 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.960
 I would not know what to do 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.960
 and ask me what have I done to 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.970
 to thank you and just make a 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.580
 a long time ago I told my brothers that 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.560
 I wanted to do something for them that we do 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.360
 cows and to send them on a trip of 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.570
 trip to my father and my mother and then 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.790
 came up what the program offers me what 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.610
 he designed very excited and everything and I said and 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.850
 it would be a great opportunity not to do 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.830
 If you do not send them from that trip as 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.080
 I thought it was a trip very very very of 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.750
 world of this be but and now maybe 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.590
 with that I can send you one more place 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.840
 cool if I want to ask 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.299
 apologies for having taken so long in 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.710
 do something for you and tell him that you 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.830
 I love a lot 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.990
 for my family 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.710
 and for my dreams I will sing with the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.710
 soul of color 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.750
 Hello, I'm renato, good night, many 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.610
 love your dream I love that you have given 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.119
 Now, how important is your 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.130
 mommy many sometimes do not have this 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.320
 opportunity and faces the person 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.720
 that loves in a moment to another truth and 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.450
 make videos your mom went ahead and 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.729
 now he has a beautiful son who tells him 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.740
 mom I love you I adore you and now you fight 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.950
 to give you a well-deserved trip not 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.360
 and really one does not realize the saying 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.150
 it is very said 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.070
 redundancy but you do not count what one 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.830
 he has until he loses it and that's how 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.520
 happened that time that situation I realized 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.800
 that I was not thanking what my 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.280
 mother has given me all my mommy is my 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.170
 agenda he knows everything about me 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.100
 and I want to thank in some way 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.100
 this takes true view 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:42.569
 because the only one on this earth 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.170
 but here is my mommy and she is also 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.520
 With a lot of love I know what happens 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.350
 this song goes with a lot of love for 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.620
 you so the letter has nothing to 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.620
 see but 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.900
 and here 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.860

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.780

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:10.390

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.680
 motivates to sing you have a voice too 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.220
 spectacular 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.100
 so already an incredible idol that has 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.100
 seen what he is saying 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:41.970
 I said 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.750
 one 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.280
 Well then tell him he takes you to the car 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.710
 that is delivering perfect for all 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.680
 it's ready it's very good 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.260
 then take positions and I leave them 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:06.710

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.710

 this bird of passage I do not know why 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.650
 I'm getting used to 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.650

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.640

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.180
 date 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.640
