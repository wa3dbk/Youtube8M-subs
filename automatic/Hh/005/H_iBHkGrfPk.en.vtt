would have cost thousands of dollars or

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.019 
would have cost thousands of dollars or
might<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:23.070> been<00:00:23.100> able<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.609> be<00:00:23.730> produced

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
your computer there are three things

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.770 
your computer there are three things
that<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.510> drive

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that I really like about this drive

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.249 
that I really like about this drive
first<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.950> very<00:01:14.400> light<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:15.030> fact<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.080> first

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
first it's very light in fact the first

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.270 
first it's very light in fact the first
thing<00:01:16.470> you're<00:01:16.590> probably<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.220> think

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
thing you're probably going to think

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.520 
thing you're probably going to think
when<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.700> pick<00:01:17.909> up<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.210> dry<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.290> while

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
when you pick up the dry is that while

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.590 
when you pick up the dry is that while
seagate<00:01:20.220> must<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.610> forgot<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.060> put<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> drive

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
seagate must have forgot I put the drive

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.050 
seagate must have forgot I put the drive
in<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.619> case<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.250> mean<00:01:23.700> really

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
in this is just the case I mean really

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.940 
in this is just the case I mean really
I've<00:01:24.360> had<00:01:24.390> thumb<00:01:24.810> drives<00:01:25.140> heavier<00:01:25.590> than<00:01:25.770> this

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
I've had thumb drives heavier than this

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.800 
I've had thumb drives heavier than this
external<00:01:26.340> drive<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:27.299> means<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.689> this

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
external drive that means that this

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.710 
external drive that means that this
portable<00:01:28.200> drive<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.890> ideal<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:29.729> travel<00:01:30.180> it's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
portable drive is ideal for travel it's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.569 
portable drive is ideal for travel it's
solid<00:01:31.200> state<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:31.950> means<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> doesn't

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
solid state so that means it doesn't

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.370 
solid state so that means it doesn't
have<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.060> those<00:01:33.180> delicate<00:01:33.750> spinning

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
have one of those delicate spinning

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.990 
have one of those delicate spinning
platters<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.340> damaged<00:01:35.850> when

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
platters that can be damaged when

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.200 
platters that can be damaged when
jostled<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.630> also<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.040> light<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.880> when

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
jostled and also it's so light that when

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.020 
jostled and also it's so light that when
you<00:01:39.329> put<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.780> your<00:01:39.900> travel<00:01:40.290> bag

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
you put it in your travel bag

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.480 
you put it in your travel bag
going<00:01:41.150> to<00:01:41.240> notice<00:01:41.420> their<00:01:41.799> second<00:01:42.799> this<00:01:43.220> drive

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
going to notice their second this drive

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.510 
going to notice their second this drive
is<00:01:43.520> fast<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.570> I<00:01:44.720> mean<00:01:44.960> really<00:01:45.470> fast<00:01:45.860> when<00:01:46.490> I

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
is fast and I mean really fast when I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.190 
is fast and I mean really fast when I
tested<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.180> performance<00:01:47.690> of<00:01:47.810> this<00:01:47.930> drive

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
tested the performance of this drive
