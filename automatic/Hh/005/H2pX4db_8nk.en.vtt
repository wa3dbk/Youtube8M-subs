00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 The site about the future of Brazil is this one down here today I will speak phrases like 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.620
 is that a forecast is made 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.230
 four major changes in the world are taking place. 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.049
 world population is aging 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.739
 there is a process of globalization with the intensification of world trade 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:23.559
 China is the new hegemonic power and has been transforming the world 

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:27.769
 fossil fuels are ending. 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.449
 good first to population 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.489
 that is happening to the population, the population of the debtor countries seems to 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.810
 that is old 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.120
 She is not going to work so much anymore. 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.450
 as in the recent past health spending will increase greatly to see much 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.240
 feather claws common pension and retirement 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.140
 so U.S 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.990
 but I know that they are basically in the case 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.190
 already the poor countries the population is young healthy and well educated in the vain 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.610
 through a demographic window that called behind 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.610
 then the one that will boost our economy 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.230
 globalization and what globalization is globalization is 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.710
 basically because of the increase in world trade because what happens because 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.020
 monthly trade happens worldwide 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.200
 It's happening because we create computers and this allows the exchange of 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.640
 information mainly through the internet 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.030
 and the fall of the Soviet Union and ended with the story that communism 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.160
 it works 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.360
 and today we are in the middle between communism and capitalism 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.550
 so send all the countries of the world practically as monobloc show 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.160
 formerly not two blocks in block b was united states is block 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.400
 led by the possible practically does not commercialize ventÃ´se 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.840
 to the world today so are 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.770
 is a unique ideology later a social-democracy and more the internet and 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.770
 scaling up with the doctor high and very 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.509
 another detail that is happening to China is the new hegemonic power if 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.630
 you get the sport's history be monica 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.780
 from here, I went to holland from holland 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.580
 in england of england of the united states and now the thousand states are going 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.670
 to china or could with name 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.329
 he later lost military power 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.699
 fast enough transforms it into the world in a meaningful way 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.919
 china basically buys expensive selling cheap so bring a big 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.599
 benefit that the world in general 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.280
 only critics here ask him to commit himself to something that I think 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:31.709
 happening the same thing that china comes 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.079
 so be a question 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.109
 going through life crisis and this problem with china 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:41.119
 already we are the mirror of china so we win because it sells expensive brings 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.469
 even if you win because you buy cheap kopra cheap and 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.639
 another interesting detail happening 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.649
 end of fuel supplies 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.369
 around 1700 1800 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.369
 we started with the industrial revolution in england 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:01.129
 and there was a lot of coal there, so that 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.829
 asia chat machine with coal and this gave a turbinada in the world - 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:06.909
 industrial Revolution 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.439
 only here the parents fixed and consuming so much oil as their mineral coal 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.289
 so now they are 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.289
 as they will go through great difficulties with the price increase 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.949
 time 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:22.769
 we have not yet fully explored some oil and moreover 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.100
 we have the possibility are not the highly 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.190
 see we have very large comparative advantages in biofuel then 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.060
 we are going with the end of the oil the Brazilian economy the sector of nothing 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:38.569
 photo that I did a comparative picture of the great changes for you 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.569
 What is happening, good population? 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.220
 of the site is old from the young post 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.190
 by action is causing unemployment in rich countries and good wages of 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.180
 country is causing crises in rich countries and a good 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.180
 growth in Brazil or Africa 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.889
 the oil on the site is over and we, besides having oil, will have 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.069
 biofuels 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.659
 all this is making Brazil 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.609
 is strongly this is it is it looks only is the rich countries are practically 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.949
 stagnant will pass us - including Japan we will be the fourth power 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.949
 world economy after united states 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.520
 and on time 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.480
 we will be isolated the third to the fourth world power 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.040
 Brazil will grow a lot due to being a small county between 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.620
 you studied
