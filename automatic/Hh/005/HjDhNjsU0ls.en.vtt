that<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.969> know<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.360> lot<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.780> people<00:00:52.020> actually

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that you know a lot of people actually

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.139 
that you know a lot of people actually
liked<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:52.980> desire<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.610> look<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.030> it's

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
liked it they desire this look but it's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.000 
liked it they desire this look but it's
really<00:00:54.300> not<00:00:54.510> beneficial<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> wood<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
really not beneficial to the wood or to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.130 
really not beneficial to the wood or to
the<00:00:56.129> integrity<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.570> construction

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the integrity of the of the construction

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.020 
the integrity of the of the construction
of<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> architecture<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.699> had<00:00:59.879> in

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
of the architecture and if you had in

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.639 
of the architecture and if you had in
mind<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> natural<00:01:00.960> finish<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.469> is

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
mind to have a natural finish this is

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.510 
mind to have a natural finish this is
far<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
far from it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.219 
far from it
the<00:01:03.000> thing<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.270> don't<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.449> about<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:04.019> when

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the thing I don't like about this when

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.590 
the thing I don't like about this when
people<00:01:04.260> let<00:01:04.589> these<00:01:04.880> would<00:01:05.880> go<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
people let these would go like this and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
people let these would go like this and
let<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.020> gray<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:08.189> actually

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
let it get this gray is that it actually

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.490 
let it get this gray is that it actually
turns<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.119> type<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.780> driftwood

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
turns into a type of like a driftwood

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.710 
turns into a type of like a driftwood
and<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.760> punky<00:01:12.240> wood<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and and the the punky wood on the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.510 
and and the the punky wood on the
outside<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.320> dead<00:01:13.530> fibers<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.159> know<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.369> can

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
outside the dead fibers you know it can

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.950 
outside the dead fibers you know it can
be<00:01:14.549> removed<00:01:14.760> almost<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.450> fingernail

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
be removed almost with your fingernail

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.320 
be removed almost with your fingernail
and<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> last<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.030> boards

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and that's not going to last this boards

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.060 
and that's not going to last this boards
not<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:19.140> not<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.590> stay<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
not going to it's not going to stay in a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.590 
not going to it's not going to stay in a
pristine<00:01:20.430> condition<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.060> you'd<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
pristine condition like you'd like to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.539 
pristine condition like you'd like to
and<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.740> an<00:01:22.890> accelerate<00:01:23.430> it's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
and this is just an accelerate it's

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.160 
and this is just an accelerate it's
going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> go<00:01:23.820> from<00:01:24.030> black<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.630> black<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.110> and

any boards no not really I got it in the
right<00:02:35.300> time<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.750> mean<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:37.250> most<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.270> the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
right time I mean the most of the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.060 
right time I mean the most of the
company<00:02:38.630> was<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.020> elevation<00:02:39.440> primarily

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
company was on that elevation primarily

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.800 
company was on that elevation primarily
because<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.520> oil<00:02:40.730> in<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:40.970> wood<00:02:41.180> has<00:02:41.330> left<00:02:41.600> and

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
because the oil in the wood has left and

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.720 
because the oil in the wood has left and
the<00:02:41.870> Sun<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.230> bacon<00:02:42.680> on<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.459> when<00:02:43.700> that

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
the Sun is bacon on it and when that

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.760 
the Sun is bacon on it and when that
happens<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.300> wood<00:02:44.480> starts<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.930> move<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.560> little

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
happens the wood starts to move a little

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.920 
happens the wood starts to move a little
bit
