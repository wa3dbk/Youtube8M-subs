00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
and I think we have another one though

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.460 
and I think we have another one though
we<00:02:53.820> do<00:02:53.970> we<00:02:54.060> get<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.269> sonic<00:02:54.660> screwdriver<00:02:54.810> there

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
we do we get a sonic screwdriver there

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:06.009 
we do we get a sonic screwdriver there
on<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.970> foil<00:02:58.069> sticker

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:12.229 

next<00:03:07.019> pack<00:03:10.459> these<00:03:11.459> are<00:03:11.640> all<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.879> ones<00:03:12.090> that

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
next pack these are all the ones that

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.490 
next pack these are all the ones that
were<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:14.370> starts<00:03:14.819> back<00:03:15.170> as<00:03:16.170> we<00:03:16.349> get

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
were in the starts back as we get

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.020 
were in the starts back as we get
towards<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:16.980> bottom<00:03:17.159> it<00:03:17.430> will<00:03:17.549> be<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.849> ones

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
towards the bottom it will be the ones

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.270 
towards the bottom it will be the ones
are<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.390> picked<00:03:19.290> out<00:03:19.500> individually<00:03:22.280> trongo

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.110 
sticker a holographic for sticker they
sell<00:03:36.239> us<00:03:36.329> three<00:03:37.459> holographic<00:03:38.459> stickers<00:03:38.909> so

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
sell us three holographic stickers so

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:51.559 
sell us three holographic stickers so
far<00:03:48.980> too<00:03:49.980> special<00:03:50.519> you<00:03:50.760> know<00:03:50.969> this<00:03:51.269> one<00:03:51.540> I

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
far too special you know this one I

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.319 
far too special you know this one I
don't<00:03:51.810> think<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:53.459> have<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.669> nice<00:03:53.790> picture<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.209> a

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
don't think you have a nice picture of a

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:01.000 
don't think you have a nice picture of a
Dalek<00:03:54.780> there<00:03:57.409> and<00:03:58.409> at<00:03:58.650> least<00:03:58.739> it's<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.189> pax<00:03:59.459> and

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
Dalek there and at least it's a pax and

now all the individual ones I picked up
they<00:04:04.950> have<00:04:05.159> the<00:04:05.400> same<00:04:06.060> foil<00:04:06.540> stick<00:04:06.840> there<00:04:07.079> as

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
they have the same foil stick there as

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:17.979 
they have the same foil stick there as
before

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.370 

we<00:04:18.989> have<00:04:19.440> another<00:04:20.810> holographic<00:04:21.810> false<00:04:22.049> liquor

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
we have another holographic false liquor

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.840 
we have another holographic false liquor
in<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:22.590> one<00:04:22.800> but<00:04:22.919> this<00:04:23.010> again<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.550> new

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
in this one but this again is the new

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.159 
in this one but this again is the new
dr.<00:04:24.300> boss<00:04:24.540> it<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:26.540> longer<00:04:27.540> version<00:04:28.139> of

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
dr. boss it is a of longer version of

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.230 
dr. boss it is a of longer version of
the<00:04:28.770> one<00:04:28.889> we<00:04:29.010> got<00:04:29.190> before<00:04:29.490> so<00:04:29.729> we<00:04:29.790> have<00:04:29.940> two

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
the one we got before so we have two

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.350 
the one we got before so we have two
different<00:04:31.199> holographic<00:04:31.979> versions<00:04:32.570> so<00:04:33.570> far

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.230 

and<00:04:37.930> we<00:04:38.229> have<00:04:38.439> three<00:04:38.889> packs<00:04:39.159> left<00:04:39.400> of<00:04:39.639> open<00:04:40.030> now

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
and we have three packs left of open now

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.290 
and we have three packs left of open now
and<00:04:43.050> then<00:04:44.050> I<00:04:44.169> can<00:04:44.199> look<00:04:44.560> at<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:45.520> foil<00:04:45.849> stickers

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
and then I can look at the foil stickers

00:04:46.300 --> 00:05:01.080 
and then I can look at the foil stickers
again<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:59.169> there<00:04:59.439> is<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.770> new<00:04:59.919> doctor<00:05:00.370> not<00:05:00.669> on

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
again and there is the new doctor not on

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.170 
again and there is the new doctor not on
a<00:05:02.009> holographic<00:05:03.009> stick<00:05:03.430> it<00:05:03.580> was<00:05:03.699> a<00:05:04.000> good

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
a holographic stick it was a good

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.709 
a holographic stick it was a good
picture<00:05:04.419> of<00:05:04.569> him<00:05:07.889> and<00:05:08.889> on<00:05:09.849> to<00:05:10.060> our<00:05:10.180> very<00:05:10.509> last
