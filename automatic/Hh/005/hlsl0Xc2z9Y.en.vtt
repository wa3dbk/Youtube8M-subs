00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
start with mobility Samsung Galaxy s5

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.130 
start with mobility Samsung Galaxy s5
technically<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.910> less<00:00:27.240> mobile<00:00:27.539> found<00:00:27.930> in

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
technically is a less mobile found in

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.490 
technically is a less mobile found in
Samsung<00:00:28.710> Galaxy<00:00:29.130> s4<00:00:29.519> yep<00:00:30.060> yep<00:00:30.750> that's<00:00:30.990> right

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
Samsung Galaxy s4 yep yep that's right

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.680 
Samsung Galaxy s4 yep yep that's right
it's<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.040> less<00:00:32.219> mobile<00:00:32.579> phone<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.030> try<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
it's a less mobile phone I try the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.160 
it's a less mobile phone I try the
thicker<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.440> wider<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.390> heavier<00:00:36.390> with

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
thicker it's wider it's heavier with

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.310 
thicker it's wider it's heavier with
about<00:00:37.380> 15<00:00:37.860> grams<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.930> it's<00:00:39.930> over<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
about 15 grams so it's it's over a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.470 
about 15 grams so it's it's over a
bigger<00:00:40.739> phone<00:00:41.010> than<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.550> Samsung<00:00:41.969> Galaxy<00:00:42.090> s4

certain extent to one meter water

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.090 
certain extent to one meter water
emerging<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.930> has<00:01:43.170> defensive<00:01:43.710> system

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
emerging it has defensive system

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.050 
emerging it has defensive system
basically<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.810> river<00:01:46.049> around<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> phone<00:01:47.340> in

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
basically the river around the phone in

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.440 
basically the river around the phone in
the<00:01:48.329> backlight<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> defensive

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the backlight this is the defensive

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.270 
the backlight this is the defensive
thing<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.259> defensive<00:01:52.619> key<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.220> you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
thing this is the defensive key so you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.530 
thing this is the defensive key so you
pretty<00:01:53.579> much<00:01:53.700> should<00:01:53.939> appreciate<00:01:54.180> this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
pretty much should appreciate this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.090 
pretty much should appreciate this
system<00:01:54.720> all<00:01:55.200> right<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.649> should<00:01:55.740> pretty<00:01:56.009> much

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
system all right you should pretty much

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.039 
system all right you should pretty much
appreciate<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.670> because<00:01:57.240> I've<00:01:57.570> found<00:01:57.810> some
