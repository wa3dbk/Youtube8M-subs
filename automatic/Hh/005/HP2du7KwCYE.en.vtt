um there's two antenna tubes that come

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.550 
um there's two antenna tubes that come

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
inside this unit so our battery clips in

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.810 
inside this unit so our battery clips in
there's<00:01:44.649> actually<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.250> notice<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:45.610> there's

this<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:44.019> actually<00:02:44.440> as<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:44.739> this<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:44.980> my<00:02:45.100> son's

abuse and use than what my son has mine

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.819 
abuse and use than what my son has mine
used<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.360> really<00:02:52.810> quite<00:02:53.110> easily<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.650> then<00:02:53.739> it

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
used to really quite easily and then it

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.350 
used to really quite easily and then it
magically<00:02:54.370> stopped<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:54.910> couldn't<00:02:55.180> figure

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
magically stopped and I couldn't figure

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.789 
magically stopped and I couldn't figure
out<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.570> reason<00:02:55.930> why<00:02:56.079> and<00:02:56.230> eventually<00:02:56.620> feed

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
out the reason why and eventually feed

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.340 
out the reason why and eventually feed
it<00:02:56.920> out<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.940> rim<00:02:58.269> was<00:02:58.780> actually<00:02:59.110> spinning

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
it out the rim was actually spinning

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.390 
it out the rim was actually spinning
inside<00:02:59.799> the<00:02:59.950> wheel

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
inside the wheel

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.449 
inside the wheel
and<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.660> grabbed<00:03:01.959> some<00:03:02.079> glue<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.680> I've

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
and so I grabbed some glue and I've

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.150 
and so I grabbed some glue and I've
glued<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.290> glued<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.500> rims<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:05.980> wheel

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
glued the glued the rims to the wheel

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.580 
glued the glued the rims to the wheel
and<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:06.819> fixed<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.480> for<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.690> while<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.230> then<00:03:08.560> I

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
and that fixed it for a while and then I

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.990 
and that fixed it for a while and then I
started<00:03:08.950> doing<00:03:09.129> again<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.610> in<00:03:09.730> the

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
started doing again and in the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.320 
started doing again and in the
the<00:03:10.300> actual<00:03:10.630> axle<00:03:11.080> itself<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:12.220> actual<00:03:12.400> axle

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
the actual axle itself the actual axle

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.160 
the actual axle itself the actual axle
was<00:03:13.480> spinning<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.280> rumor<00:03:15.610> staying

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
was spinning and the the rumor staying

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.380 
was spinning and the the rumor staying
staying<00:03:17.170> still<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:18.490> drop<00:03:18.880> some<00:03:19.060> more<00:03:19.180> glue

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
staying still so drop some more glue

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.460 
staying still so drop some more glue
inside<00:03:19.750> there<00:03:19.960> and<00:03:20.050> that's<00:03:20.170> pretty<00:03:20.350> much

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
inside there and that's pretty much

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.700 
inside there and that's pretty much
cured<00:03:20.980> my<00:03:21.190> vehicle<00:03:22.200> but<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.260> mean<00:03:23.410> that's<00:03:23.560> a

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
cured my vehicle but I mean that's a

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.510 
cured my vehicle but I mean that's a
fairly<00:03:23.980> solid<00:03:24.160> little<00:03:24.430> unit<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:27.400> only
