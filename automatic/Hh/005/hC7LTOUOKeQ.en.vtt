made any adjustments or any changes to
compensate<00:04:05.730> for<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.030> traction<00:04:06.540> out<00:04:06.660> there

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
compensate for the traction out there

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.880 
compensate for the traction out there
well<00:04:08.010> we're<00:04:08.340> running<00:04:09.290> maybe<00:04:10.290> not<00:04:10.500> quite<00:04:10.770> as

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
well we're running maybe not quite as

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.260 
well we're running maybe not quite as
tight<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.100> gear<00:04:11.310> ratio<00:04:11.640> as<00:04:11.760> we<00:04:11.880> could<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.180> a

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
tight a gear ratio as we could and a

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.710 
tight a gear ratio as we could and a
little<00:04:12.480> bit<00:04:12.570> taller<00:04:12.780> tires<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:15.209> think

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
little bit taller tires and I think

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.880 
little bit taller tires and I think
tonight<00:04:15.840> I'll<00:04:16.109> probably<00:04:16.350> take<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.620> little<00:04:16.799> bit

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
tonight I'll probably take a little bit

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.840 
tonight I'll probably take a little bit
of<00:04:16.950> flower<00:04:17.160> weight<00:04:17.489> out<00:04:17.640> of<00:04:17.760> it

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
out of it try to make a little bit

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.150 
out of it try to make a little bit
easier<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.450> drive<00:04:22.630> because<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.170> scraping<00:04:24.070> the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
easier to drive because the scraping the

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.640 
easier to drive because the scraping the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.960 
paving they've made it a little bit sore
and<00:04:26.890> it's<00:04:27.040> kind<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.250> hard<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.520> get<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.640> hold<00:04:27.760> up

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970

it's<00:04:28.180> not<00:04:28.300> not<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.690> real<00:04:28.900> good<00:04:29.050> seal<00:04:29.350> on<00:04:29.380> the

we're<00:04:39.740> gonna<00:04:39.889> have<00:04:39.979> to<00:04:40.039> adjust<00:04:40.159> board<00:04:40.580> if<00:04:40.669> it

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
we're gonna have to adjust board if it

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.999 
we're gonna have to adjust board if it
does<00:04:40.970> how<00:04:41.960> do<00:04:42.020> you<00:04:42.169> stand<00:04:42.379> in<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.650> field<00:04:42.860> right

right<00:04:51.740> now<00:04:51.819> no<00:04:52.819> I<00:04:52.849> believe<00:04:53.360> actually<00:04:53.659> there

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
right now no I believe actually there

right now no I believe actually there
were<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.139> couple<00:04:54.289> cases<00:04:54.620> this<00:04:54.800> morning<00:04:54.979> when<00:04:55.250> I

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
were a couple cases this morning when I

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.649 
were a couple cases this morning when I
was<00:04:55.460> experimenting<00:04:55.819> a<00:04:56.090> little<00:04:56.150> bit<00:04:56.300> too<00:04:56.509> much

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
was experimenting a little bit too much

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:57.939 
was experimenting a little bit too much
and<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:56.900> could<00:04:57.080> probably<00:04:57.259> gone<00:04:57.590> a<00:04:57.650> little<00:04:57.770> bit

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
and I could probably gone a little bit

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.030 
and I could probably gone a little bit
quicker<00:04:58.159> this<00:04:58.340> morning<00:04:58.669> as<00:04:58.759> it<00:04:58.879> was
