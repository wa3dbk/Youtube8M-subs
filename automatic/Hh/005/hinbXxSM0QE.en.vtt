00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:06.570
 because all the statistics is a set of methods and processes had game instead 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.399
 of getting law of collective behavior 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:14.469
 It is worth recalling collective behavior and not each of the 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.009
 private 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.740
 in this personal definition 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.410
 the collective not individually is the objective in collective statistics and not 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.769
 individually 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.369
 a group of people for example we verify that it has a group of people 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.369
 Those people so yellow shirt opt ​​for elected Hamish husband 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.230
 interests us 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.360
 but the amount of people per month at a speed of about shirts 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.190
 red newspaper who is wearing the yellow shirt is here I made groups 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.020
 ef 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.149
 and work today's game companies and so 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.350
 the protons speak a little more but the important here makes clear accordingly 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.059
 with the consed the study statistics stand out physically to be concerned with 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.100
 the collective with the group and was not displayed 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.890
 in the case of statistics 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.110
 so I have 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.439
 form of classification in which I have a descriptive statistic the optimal bid 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.290
 we also have the question of the probability that the inference 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.260
 statistic other Indian statistic 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.860
 inactive is a form of classification although some authors do the activity 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.390
 this division is only Santista with descriptive statistics 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.610
 and there is the question of embedded statistics or statistical inference 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.000
 is also well known 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.770
 but there are a generation these three major areas 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.360
 when working with statistical certainty 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.080
 so let's check the 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.530
 What is the sarney concept in each of them? 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.250
 When we are working with the first item the first seat area is 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.700
 descriptive statistics if we take the name 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.460
 for this reason there was basically expressive 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.650
 when we work on this stage in this area we are 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.020
 description of the states present here let's do let's make 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.460
 rationalize the result 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.140
 those of those who are there 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.050
 when we speak for example about this destruction in this perspective 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.979
 descriptive statistics then for example 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.089
 let's suppose we have a room i in the audio room 6 let's assume it has 11 ten 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.949
 students 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:19.459
 we have ten students and when verifying that 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.459
 understand that these ten students five students 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:27.529
 are female five male students then the fact is doing 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:28.839
 a description 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.899
 doubt says the representation in this case I'm working on this federal 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.779
 Descriptive statistics bar 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.719
 in a second moment another area that is precisely the pressure of the 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.099
 probability 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.119
 so in this case I check 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.329
 this is a random fact 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.579
 the case is very common when one speaks of probability which the probability 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.460
 to throw a dice up 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.089
 he carried the phase 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.089
 go up 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:03:00.759
 has a probability of 1/6 in that month then every time the 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.230
 the truth is going to be the same 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.759
 to find a certain value 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.839
 so in this case we also work with the probability question 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:13.269
 probability also has another area called adjustments to 15 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.129
 trend 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.169
 unfortunately the statistics as you can see there 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.059
 in this case of this area we are looking at the question of an inference 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:22.619
 a new reference 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.800
 a conclusion to observation 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.089
 and the identification of new knowledge 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:32.789
 already the probability that it will be gray as the support to find this new 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:33.529
 study 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:37.169
 so the idea is to go let's hurt some new information 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:39.589
 part of the lives of those who 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:43.349
 collected interpretations we will insert a new 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.289
 So we found her at work. 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:49.879
 much with these three areas there first make a description 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.069
 of cities 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.069
 presented and also make an inference 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.919
 of the two to be worked on
