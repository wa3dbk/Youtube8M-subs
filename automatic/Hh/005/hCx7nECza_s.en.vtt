 that was chosen in red for mom 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.369
 so here is the phone looks good 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.100
 the first thing that catches your eye is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.369
 small little screen though 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.640
 the inscriptions on it are quite normal crane 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.189
 by the way has a good review and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.960
 makes a very good impression 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.489
 its size is really small 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.629
 phone legenky present here 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.860

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.789

 will suit from any of your smartphone this 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.439
 In general, I think poured additionally 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.750
 charging with them and here it doesnâ€™t mean 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.700
 then the output can be cut some not 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.400

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.810

 it is able ts Again mol and 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.369
 switched to the left sim card 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.829
 that is, like this 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.570
 SIM switch is carried out here 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.540

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.739
 battery in principle with a small 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.910
 use I think enough practically 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:30.000

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.910
 the phone and from the mp3 player he has no camera 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.299
 it's pretty simple and I would say 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.790
 dear that is for 1450 rubles 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.670

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.930

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.290
 small cramps and good quality 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:58.019

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:02.160

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:05.130

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.359
 hornet whom materials she said 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.700

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:20.669
 will protect from liquids although no 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:23.280
