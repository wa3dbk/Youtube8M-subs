going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> basically<00:01:43.229> wait<00:01:43.530> until<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:43.950> axe

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
going to basically wait until this axe

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.670 
going to basically wait until this axe
spawns<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:45.030> will<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.390> called<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.020> hammer<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
spawns that will be called for hammer of

spawns that will be called for hammer of
the<00:01:46.710> Fire<00:01:47.250> Lord<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.240> hammer<00:01:48.630> is

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
the Fire Lord now this hammer is

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.780 
the Fire Lord now this hammer is
essentially<00:01:49.470> well<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:50.070> actually<00:01:50.430> an<00:01:50.520> axe

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
essentially well it's actually an axe

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.210 
essentially well it's actually an axe
and<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.570> will<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.960> propped<00:01:52.290> up<00:01:52.530> against<00:01:52.979> this

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
and it will be propped up against this

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.149 
and it will be propped up against this
wall<00:01:53.329> exactly<00:01:54.329> here<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.899> there<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.829> so

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
wall exactly here and there it is so

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.560 
wall exactly here and there it is so
what<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.430> do<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:56.820> right-click<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.360> this

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
what we do is we right-click on this

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
video from passing through an area so

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.390 
video from passing through an area so
you<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.600> block<00:03:06.870> off<00:03:07.020> bridges<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:08.070> can<00:03:08.220> block

this<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.720> PTR<00:03:43.170> so<00:03:43.410> everything<00:03:43.829> is<00:03:43.980> very

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
this is the PTR so everything is very

because<00:03:54.329> it's<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.200> bit<00:03:55.380> overpowered<00:03:56.070> but<00:03:56.850> i

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
because it's a bit overpowered but i

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.640 
because it's a bit overpowered but i
thought<00:03:57.060> i'd<00:03:57.209> show<00:03:57.390> this<00:03:57.540> off<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.350> first

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
thought i'd show this off and the first

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.100 
thought i'd show this off and the first
ability<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.760> actually<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.239> number<00:04:00.360> 2<00:04:00.690> ability

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
reticle in place up to three of these

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.290 
reticle in place up to three of these
for<00:04:57.060> any<00:04:57.440> at<00:04:58.440> any<00:04:58.680> one<00:04:58.920> time<00:04:59.060> before<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.150> first

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
for any at any one time before the first

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.090 
for any at any one time before the first
one<00:05:00.540> do<00:05:00.720> spawns<00:05:01.050> obviously<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:01.830> can<00:05:01.950> put

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
one do spawns obviously so you can put

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.860 
one do spawns obviously so you can put
three<00:05:02.370> of<00:05:02.460> these<00:05:02.580> down<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.480> lasts<00:05:03.660> for<00:05:03.840> a

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
three of these down and it lasts for a

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.990 
three of these down and it lasts for a
couple<00:05:03.900> of<00:05:04.260> seconds<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:04.890> we'll<00:05:05.040> route<00:05:05.430> pretty

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
couple of seconds and we'll route pretty

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.600 
couple of seconds and we'll route pretty
much<00:05:06.150> anything<00:05:06.540> in<00:05:07.230> place<00:05:07.800> for<00:05:08.130> that<00:05:08.220> time<00:05:08.430> so

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
much anything in place for that time so

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.540 
much anything in place for that time so
this<00:05:08.700> works<00:05:08.970> on<00:05:09.270> friendly<00:05:09.780> NPCs<00:05:10.560> aggressive

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
this works on friendly NPCs aggressive

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.290 
this works on friendly NPCs aggressive

but<00:05:18.450> obviously<00:05:19.020> this<00:05:19.200> is<00:05:19.380> a<00:05:19.410> cancel<00:05:19.950> or<00:05:20.130> a

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
but obviously this is a cancel or a

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.090 
but obviously this is a cancel or a
macro<00:05:20.930> cancelled<00:05:21.930> ability<00:05:22.410> it<00:05:22.530> is<00:05:22.680> actually<00:05:23.070> a

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
macro cancelled ability it is actually a

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.860 
macro cancelled ability it is actually a
buff<00:05:23.400> that<00:05:23.640> you<00:05:23.730> gain<00:05:23.970> on<00:05:24.180> your<00:05:24.360> buff<00:05:24.570> bars

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
buff that you gain on your buff bars

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.200 
buff that you gain on your buff bars
green<00:05:25.830> ability<00:05:26.310> as<00:05:26.490> opposed<00:05:26.790> to<00:05:26.970> a<00:05:27.000> negative

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
green ability as opposed to a negative

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.290 
green ability as opposed to a negative
red<00:05:28.050> so<00:05:28.710> of<00:05:29.040> course<00:05:29.190> it<00:05:29.460> is<00:05:29.580> fairly<00:05:29.850> useless

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
red so of course it is fairly useless

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.300 
red so of course it is fairly useless
but<00:05:30.630> it<00:05:30.720> can<00:05:30.960> mess<00:05:31.260> with<00:05:31.470> people<00:05:31.800> quite<00:05:32.100> often

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
but it can mess with people quite often
