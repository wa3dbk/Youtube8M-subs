know you want to do it at the right
speed<00:04:39.259> if<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.830> try<00:04:40.070> ripping<00:04:40.520> it<00:04:40.639> it<00:04:40.820> won't

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
speed if you try ripping it it won't

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.029 
speed if you try ripping it it won't
work<00:04:41.240> I<00:04:41.570> yanked<00:04:42.289> it<00:04:42.350> right<00:04:42.530> out<00:04:42.650> of<00:04:42.770> my<00:04:42.860> hands

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
work I yanked it right out of my hands

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.080 
work I yanked it right out of my hands
cuz<00:04:43.250> I<00:04:43.310> tried<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.580> rip<00:04:43.699> it<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:43.850> hard<00:04:45.280> okay<00:04:46.280> okay

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
cuz I tried to rip it so hard okay okay

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.310 
cuz I tried to rip it so hard okay okay
so<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:47.270> might<00:04:47.479> have<00:04:47.539> to<00:04:47.660> speed<00:04:47.990> up<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.199> video

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
so I might have to speed up the video

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.390 
so I might have to speed up the video
because<00:04:48.830> if<00:04:49.070> these<00:04:49.190> things<00:04:49.430> go<00:04:49.729> like<00:04:49.910> forever

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
because if these things go like forever

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.830 
because if these things go like forever
I<00:04:52.400> make<00:04:52.580> sure<00:04:52.610> we<00:04:53.030> like<00:04:53.210> doing<00:04:53.389> what<00:04:53.539> Paris

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
I make sure we like doing what Paris

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.840 
I make sure we like doing what Paris
came<00:04:54.110> back<00:04:54.320> here<00:04:54.560> cuz<00:04:54.770> they<00:04:54.889> moved<00:04:55.130> yeah<00:04:55.340> all

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
gonna win fastest going I guess I'm not

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.439 
gonna win fastest going I guess I'm not
so<00:05:08.210> great<00:05:08.360> at<00:05:08.449> this<00:05:08.750> huh<00:05:09.940> blow<00:05:10.940> it<00:05:11.120> back<00:05:11.270> into

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
so great at this huh blow it back into

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.719 
so great at this huh blow it back into
frame<00:05:13.780> yeah<00:05:14.780> it's<00:05:15.260> still<00:05:15.680> going<00:05:15.979> really<00:05:16.310> fast

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
frame yeah it's still going really fast

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.040 
frame yeah it's still going really fast
I<00:05:17.470> think<00:05:18.470> yours<00:05:19.099> is<00:05:19.340> just<00:05:20.180> naturally<00:05:20.660> faster

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
I think yours is just naturally faster

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.640 
I think yours is just naturally faster
than<00:05:21.199> mine

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
than mine

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.330 
than mine
spotless<00:05:22.370> okay<00:05:22.970> because<00:05:23.889> it's<00:05:24.889> not<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.190> case

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
spotless okay because it's not the case

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.650 
spotless okay because it's not the case
I<00:05:25.520> know<00:05:25.900> how<00:05:26.900> to<00:05:26.960> do<00:05:27.229> these<00:05:27.380> I<00:05:28.210> gotta<00:05:29.210> watch<00:05:29.389> you

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
if you do it too fast it won't work

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.860 
if you do it too fast it won't work
right<00:05:37.099> I'm<00:05:37.490> not<00:05:37.669> doing<00:05:37.940> it<00:05:38.030> fast<00:05:38.240> enough<00:05:38.449> look

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
right I'm not doing it fast enough look

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
yeah okay I don't know if you want to do

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.100 
yeah okay I don't know if you want to do
the<00:06:23.039> tricks<00:06:23.249> guys<00:06:23.749> because<00:06:24.749> this<00:06:24.899> thing<00:06:25.080> is

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
the tricks guys because this thing is

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.100 
the tricks guys because this thing is
spinning<00:06:25.469> really<00:06:25.770> fast<00:06:25.889> and<00:06:26.339> that<00:06:27.110> causes

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
spinning really fast and that causes

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.529 
spinning really fast and that causes
friction<00:06:28.289> now<00:06:28.680> the<00:06:28.740> very<00:06:29.189> first<00:06:29.759> time<00:06:30.120> I<00:06:30.330> tried

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
friction now the very first time I tried

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.029 
friction now the very first time I tried
this<00:06:30.569> at<00:06:30.870> work<00:06:31.020> but<00:06:31.199> now<00:06:31.349> I<00:06:31.379> think<00:06:31.620> you<00:06:31.800> need<00:06:31.919> to

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
this at work but now I think you need to

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:32.450 
this at work but now I think you need to
do<00:06:32.159> it

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
do it

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.489 
do it
they<00:06:32.969> also<00:06:33.120> said<00:06:33.449> there's<00:06:33.960> a<00:06:34.050> little<00:06:34.259> notch<00:06:34.469> in

00:06:34.489 --> 00:06:34.499 
they also said there's a little notch in

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:36.260 
they also said there's a little notch in
that<00:06:34.889> and<00:06:35.159> this<00:06:35.309> thing<00:06:35.669> that<00:06:35.939> they<00:06:36.059> said<00:06:36.210> to

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
that and this thing that they said to

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.089 
that and this thing that they said to
put<00:06:36.389> it<00:06:36.539> in<00:06:36.719> there<00:06:36.930> and<00:06:37.169> spin<00:06:37.439> it<00:06:37.559> mine's<00:06:37.949> a

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
put it in there and spin it mine's a

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:53.850 
put it in there and spin it mine's a
fail<00:06:38.279> okay<00:06:39.180> I'll<00:06:39.300> show<00:06:39.479> them<00:06:39.629> how<00:06:39.809> to<00:06:39.839> do<00:06:40.050> that

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.200 

I<00:06:55.860> will<00:06:56.860> say<00:06:57.160> it<00:06:57.430> seems<00:06:57.700> like<00:06:57.910> they<00:06:58.060> work

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
I will say it seems like they work

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.810 
I will say it seems like they work
better<00:06:58.390> just<00:06:58.660> on<00:06:58.780> the<00:06:58.930> table<00:06:59.260> yeah<00:06:59.830> then<00:07:00.250> just

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:00.820 
better just on the table yeah then just

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.430 
better just on the table yeah then just
then<00:07:01.180> to<00:07:01.360> put<00:07:01.540> it<00:07:01.660> in<00:07:01.780> this<00:07:01.930> little<00:07:02.110> divot

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 
then to put it in this little divot

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:08.310 
then to put it in this little divot
that's<00:07:03.190> just<00:07:03.460> my<00:07:03.970> opinion<00:07:06.960> okay<00:07:07.960> so<00:07:08.020> there's

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
that's just my opinion okay so there's

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.450 
that's just my opinion okay so there's
