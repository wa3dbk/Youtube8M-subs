00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.129
 I had a dream that I had a dream of 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:11.610
 of a world more just more humane 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:13.230
 a completely crazy dream everyone 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.639
 tells us that it was not possible that 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.070
 I would never have the skins if the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.570
 material possibility of doing so and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.310
 and then I said we're going to see and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.410
 then I went in I did that 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.430
 I had this house to build two 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.050
 it's been a long time since I 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.490
 The belly 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.349
 I said to myself we try it we'll see 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.849
 and in fact the network of builders 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.930
 in straw bales it's a network of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.850
 very lively sale very players and who 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.520
 conquered me right away so I was 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.129
 directly tried as a volunteer 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.809
 on building sites see what it was and 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.800
 there I realized that he 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.820
 needed to be very numerous for 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 build a house in boots of 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.629
 straw because all alone 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.690
 far too long to be 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.219
 volunteer because at the level of 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.070
 materials it costs nothing at the level of 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.690
 time is very expensive and it does not 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.110
 been possible only because people get 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.110
 put together 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.830
 ecology it's different for 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.210
 each of us is not worth it 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.740
 get caught by the big firms 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.380
 ecology is what we do 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.159
 to do the least damage around 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.570
 we while building so I'm 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.040
 based on the principle that I wanted 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.799
 local materials so this season so 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.290
 it's the land of the land that we put 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.869
 directly on the walls the straw of the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.420
 field next to the wood of syria from to 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.680
 side and that's how it went the idea 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.980
 starting less than 2 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.360
 footprints at the ecological level then 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.930
 obviously it requires a lot of oil 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.300
 elbow 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.590
 but as we are numerous and we have 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.450
 time and do it on a volunteer basis 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.450
 it's just joy and it can be done 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.140
 we could do it at the concrete mixer 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.750
 but it makes a lot more noise 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.100
 it's a lot less funny and it's not 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.570
 much more effective in the end 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.390
 because the hands are still 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:03:05.990
 wonderful world and a half be for them 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:07.460
 goyas the people who come are 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.870
 people who build but who get 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:14.060
 also build it's still mm 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.010
 a single actor so there was some 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.540
 straw boot over the boots of 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.360
 straw two years ago we covered 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.730
 with rammed earth and straw 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.870
 mix that has dried up his outfit two 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.180
 years moved but now 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.020
 but especially all the facing coating 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.240
 ie the finish we would not want 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.190
 too flat but a bit more mineral because 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.230
 I would like a little more mineral so we 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.830
 will cover with a last layer is 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.940
 as in honda indices to the earth 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.300
 there is the whole earth is a very small 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.300
 than anything else 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.769
 when the earth is just the right 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.780
 consistency to this patch well and if the 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.959
 procedure is the spanking stroking done 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.260
 it's the caress we love 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.700
 a lot it's his caresses and when 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.110
 we do it all day long it's 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.489
 almost a meditation for me it's this 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.950
 that will make you want to make a house 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.890
 of straw that I love the earth and so 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.000
 it's magic 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.000
 though in the head for our advice 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.730
