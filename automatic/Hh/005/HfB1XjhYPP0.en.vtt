00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
back end and push this down and then you

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.749 
back end and push this down and then you
get<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.759> between<00:01:44.820> two<00:01:45.299> points

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.179 

okay<00:01:49.930> I'm<00:01:50.930> going<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.200> continue<00:01:51.740> this<00:01:51.890> for<00:01:52.130> a

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
okay I'm going to continue this for a

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.139 
okay I'm going to continue this for a
little<00:01:52.490> while<00:01:52.640> just<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:54.140> make<00:01:54.320> sure<00:01:54.969> you<00:01:55.969> know

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
little while just to make sure you know

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.590 
little while just to make sure you know
how<00:01:56.390> it's<00:01:56.630> done

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.719 

okay

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.089 

a<00:02:03.759> shuttle<00:02:04.920> will<00:02:05.920> hold<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:07.110> little<00:02:08.110> over

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
a shuttle will hold a little over

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.080 
a shuttle will hold a little over
I<00:02:09.239> think<00:02:10.239> it's<00:02:10.360> 50<00:02:10.750> feet<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:11.110> string<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:12.090> it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
I think it's 50 feet of string and it

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.140 
I think it's 50 feet of string and it
takes<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.959> little<00:02:14.920> better<00:02:15.160> than<00:02:15.459> two<00:02:15.670> shuttles

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
takes a little better than two shuttles

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.339 
takes a little better than two shuttles
to<00:02:16.450> make<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.379> crab<00:02:17.769> net<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> 15<00:02:18.819> inch<00:02:19.030> bow

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.030

hitches<00:03:05.069> then<00:03:06.069> I<00:03:06.310> locked<00:03:06.609> up<00:03:06.849> with<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.150> half

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
hitches then I locked up with a half

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.710 
hitches then I locked up with a half
knot<00:03:11.489> just<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.609> keep<00:03:12.760> everything<00:03:13.120> tight<00:03:13.540> and

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
knot just to keep everything tight and

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.970 
knot just to keep everything tight and
in<00:03:14.019> place<00:03:15.810> now<00:03:16.810> there<00:03:16.959> are<00:03:17.019> two<00:03:17.140> ways<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.379> can

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
in place now there are two ways you can

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.839 
in place now there are two ways you can
start<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:20.440> main<00:03:20.650> thing<00:03:20.950> is<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.129> get<00:03:21.340> this<00:03:21.519> two

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
start the main thing is to get this two

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.020 
start the main thing is to get this two
foot<00:03:22.409> two<00:03:23.409> and<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.560> half<00:03:23.769> foot<00:03:24.040> piece<00:03:24.609> of<00:03:24.760> string

okay<00:07:47.820> now<00:07:47.940> you<00:07:48.000> keep<00:07:48.240> that<00:07:48.510> up<00:07:48.590> until<00:07:49.590> you<00:07:50.280> have

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 
okay now you keep that up until you have

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:56.650 
okay now you keep that up until you have
completely<00:07:50.910> filled<00:07:51.920> the<00:07:52.920> ring<00:07:53.190> with<00:07:53.970> loops

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:04.670 
make about 30 loops which will easily

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.980 
make about 30 loops which will easily
