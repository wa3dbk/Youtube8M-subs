me<00:00:26.080> so<00:00:26.350> you<00:00:26.410> use<00:00:26.740> this<00:00:26.920> on-site<00:00:27.400> for<00:00:27.610> a<00:00:27.640> couple

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
me so you use this on-site for a couple

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.420 
me so you use this on-site for a couple
of<00:00:27.940> weeks<00:00:28.090> what<00:00:28.450> you<00:00:28.570> use<00:00:28.690> it<00:00:28.840> for<00:00:28.869> Chad

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
of weeks what you use it for Chad

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.000 
of weeks what you use it for Chad
basically<00:00:30.430> used<00:00:30.880> it<00:00:31.090> to<00:00:31.270> round<00:00:31.930> over<00:00:32.079> tabletop

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
basically used it to round over tabletop

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.979 
basically used it to round over tabletop
some<00:00:33.550> of<00:00:33.640> the<00:00:33.730> legs<00:00:33.969> that<00:00:34.120> we<00:00:34.329> use<00:00:34.539> we<00:00:34.870> also

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
some of the legs that we use we also

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.880 
some of the legs that we use we also
used<00:00:35.410> it<00:00:35.590> to<00:00:35.710> do<00:00:35.860> inlay<00:00:36.399> on<00:00:36.929> four<00:00:37.929> hinges<00:00:38.260> and

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
used it to do inlay on four hinges and

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.380 
used it to do inlay on four hinges and
sharing<00:00:39.640> cabinet<00:00:40.030> work

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
sharing cabinet work

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.479 
sharing cabinet work
so<00:00:40.690> no<00:00:40.899> more<00:00:41.019> hammer<00:00:41.260> and<00:00:41.409> chisel<00:00:41.710> on<00:00:41.769> that<00:00:41.980> it

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
so no more hammer and chisel on that it

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.489 
so no more hammer and chisel on that it
seems<00:00:42.819> like<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.329> smallest<00:00:43.690> router<00:00:44.109> I've<00:00:44.319> ever

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.499 
seems like the smallest router I've ever

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.919 
seems like the smallest router I've ever
seen<00:00:44.739> did<00:00:44.949> that<00:00:45.120> play<00:00:46.120> for<00:00:46.329> a<00:00:46.359> plus<00:00:46.629> or<00:00:46.839> a<00:00:46.870> minus

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
seen did that play for a plus or a minus

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.500 
seen did that play for a plus or a minus
and<00:00:47.379> what<00:00:47.499> you<00:00:47.589> did<00:00:47.769> I<00:00:47.979> seen<00:00:48.850> it<00:00:48.969> as<00:00:49.089> a<00:00:49.120> plus

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
and what you did I seen it as a plus

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.020 
and what you did I seen it as a plus
because<00:00:50.079> of<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.979> size<00:00:51.219> and<00:00:51.249> the<00:00:51.729> weight

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
because of the size and the weight

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.910 
because of the size and the weight
difference<00:00:52.420> between<00:00:53.019> a<00:00:53.050> big<00:00:53.289> gaudy<00:00:53.530> router

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
difference between a big gaudy router

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.189 
difference between a big gaudy router
sitting<00:00:54.819> on<00:00:54.909> the<00:00:55.030> edge<00:00:55.179> of<00:00:55.479> a<00:00:55.569> board<00:00:55.899> basically

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
sitting on the edge of a board basically

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.099 
sitting on the edge of a board basically
it's<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.159> lot<00:00:57.370> easier<00:00:57.789> to<00:00:58.149> balance<00:00:58.449> and<00:00:58.899> work

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
it's a lot easier to balance and work

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.529 
it's a lot easier to balance and work
with<00:00:59.409> it's<00:00:59.679> you<00:01:00.039> know<00:01:00.129> trying<00:01:00.789> to<00:01:00.909> steer<00:01:01.179> boss

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
with it's you know trying to steer boss

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:02.699 
with it's you know trying to steer boss
pretty<00:01:01.870> much<00:01:02.109> yeah<00:01:02.409> a<00:01:02.440> little<00:01:02.649> more

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:02.709 
pretty much yeah a little more

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:04.979 
pretty much yeah a little more
maneuverable<00:01:03.309> right<00:01:03.579> right<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.299> it's<00:01:04.839> got

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
maneuverable right right and it's got

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.780 
maneuverable right right and it's got
some<00:01:05.019> settings<00:01:06.010> on<00:01:06.130> here<00:01:06.190> so<00:01:06.549> you<00:01:06.640> can

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
some settings on here so you can

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.950 
some settings on here so you can
customize<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.299> to<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.630> work<00:01:07.750> you're<00:01:07.930> doing

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
customize it to the work you're doing

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.899 
customize it to the work you're doing
let's<00:01:08.530> talk<00:01:08.680> about<00:01:08.829> those<00:01:09.070> all<00:01:09.490> right<00:01:09.670> well

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
let's talk about those all right well

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.389 
let's talk about those all right well
the<00:01:10.090> first<00:01:10.420> is<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.719> variable<00:01:11.170> speed

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
the first is the variable speed

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.709 
the first is the variable speed
basically<00:01:12.399> with<00:01:12.549> the<00:01:12.670> old<00:01:12.850> wood<00:01:13.119> that<00:01:13.149> we<00:01:13.479> use

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
basically with the old wood that we use

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.980 
basically with the old wood that we use
it<00:01:14.020> chips<00:01:14.619> away<00:01:14.770> pretty<00:01:15.250> easily<00:01:15.369> so<00:01:15.939> if<00:01:16.539> I<00:01:16.659> find

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
it chips away pretty easily so if I find

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.469 
it chips away pretty easily so if I find
that<00:01:17.289> my<00:01:18.070> speeds<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:18.579> little<00:01:18.610> too<00:01:18.880> high<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.390> it

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
that my speeds a little too high and it

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.450 
that my speeds a little too high and it
starts<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.930> rip<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.289> wood<00:01:20.500> turn<00:01:21.039> the<00:01:21.189> speed

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
starts to rip the wood turn the speed

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.999 
starts to rip the wood turn the speed
down<00:01:21.670> create<00:01:22.359> a<00:01:22.420> smoother<00:01:22.840> surface<00:01:23.380> okay

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
down create a smoother surface okay

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.429 
down create a smoother surface okay
it's<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.460> depth<00:01:24.640> adjustable<00:01:25.210> as<00:01:25.299> well<00:01:25.600> yes<00:01:26.079> it's

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
it's a depth adjustable as well yes it's

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.219 
it's a depth adjustable as well yes it's
I<00:01:27.250> think<00:01:27.609> it's<00:01:27.880> called<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.180> micro<00:01:28.600> adjustment

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
I think it's called the micro adjustment

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.429 
I think it's called the micro adjustment
which<00:01:29.530> pretty<00:01:30.250> fine-tuned<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:31.439> works

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
which pretty fine-tuned it works

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:33.749 
which pretty fine-tuned it works
relatively<00:01:33.100> smoothly

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
relatively smoothly

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.300 
relatively smoothly
you<00:01:34.179> just<00:01:34.390> flip<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.659> latch<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.439> then<00:01:35.649> this

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
you just flip the latch and then this

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.340 
you just flip the latch and then this
actually<00:01:36.880> lets<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.270> go<00:01:37.450> faster<00:01:37.960> too<00:01:39.179> so

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
actually lets you go faster too so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.510 
actually lets you go faster too so
that's<00:01:41.350> one<00:01:41.560> way<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:41.950> makes<00:01:42.340> it

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
that's one way that makes it

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.550 
that's one way that makes it
user-friendly<00:01:43.030> alrighty<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.469> know

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
user-friendly alrighty and you know

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.870 
user-friendly alrighty and you know
these<00:01:44.710> days<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:45.070> seems<00:01:45.250> like<00:01:45.399> everything<00:01:45.729> has

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
these days it seems like everything has

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.700

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
compact design is after a while kind of

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.720 
compact design is after a while kind of
puts<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.560> lot<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.770> tension<00:02:37.950> on<00:02:38.280> your<00:02:38.310> wrist

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
where if it was shorter and you could

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.280 
where if it was shorter and you could
still<00:02:41.460> have<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.850> lot<00:02:42.210> of<00:02:42.330> control<00:02:42.720> on<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.080> top

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
still have a lot of control on the top

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.780 
still have a lot of control on the top
of<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.920> looks<00:02:44.070> like<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.310> might<00:02:44.340> flip<00:02:44.610> over

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
of it that looks like it might flip over

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.280 
of it that looks like it might flip over
then<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.090> could<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.600> know<00:02:45.720> kind<00:02:45.960> of<00:02:46.020> run<00:02:46.200> it

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
then you could you know kind of run it

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.530 
then you could you know kind of run it
like<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.680> therefore<00:02:47.250> making<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.000> easier<00:02:48.330> on
