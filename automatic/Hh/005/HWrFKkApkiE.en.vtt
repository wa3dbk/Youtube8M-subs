hello everyone resources from survive
july<00:00:03.840> third<00:00:04.110> 2015<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.990> once<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.170> while<00:00:07.319> I

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
july third 2015 and once in a while I

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.970 
july third 2015 and once in a while I
come<00:00:07.560> across<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:08.929> really<00:00:09.929> excellent<00:00:10.290> video<00:00:10.740> and

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
come across a really excellent video and

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.789 
come across a really excellent video and
we<00:00:11.400> just<00:00:11.639> introduced<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.330> moon<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:13.410> my

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
we just introduced the moon on my

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.090 
we just introduced the moon on my
channel<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.540> this<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> very<00:00:15.929> good

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.859 

presentation<00:00:20.100> about<00:00:20.220> how<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.699> moon<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.600> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
presentation about how the moon is a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.359 
presentation about how the moon is a
light<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.410> another<00:00:22.710> different<00:00:23.130> kind<00:00:23.279> of

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
light and another different kind of

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.679 
light and another different kind of
proof<00:00:23.580> than<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.090> did<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.539> my

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
proof than what we just did on my

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.040 
proof than what we just did on my
channel<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.670> I<00:00:26.670> want<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> keep<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.779> mind

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
channel and I want you to keep in mind

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.939 
channel and I want you to keep in mind
when<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.349> watch<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.160> video<00:00:29.420> that<00:00:30.420> he<00:00:30.630> uses

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
when you watch this video that he uses

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.790 
when you watch this video that he uses
Stellarium<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.189> he<00:00:32.430> also<00:00:32.610> uses<00:00:32.940> another

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
Stellarium and he also uses another

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.310 
Stellarium and he also uses another
software<00:00:34.800> package<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:36.149> demonstrate<00:00:36.750> certain

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
software package to demonstrate certain

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.069 
software package to demonstrate certain
things<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.829> space<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.660> you<00:00:39.660> need<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.930> know

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
things in space and you need to know

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.330 
things in space and you need to know
that<00:00:40.399> these<00:00:41.399> software<00:00:41.940> programs<00:00:42.480> are

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
that these software programs are

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.639 
that these software programs are
extremely<00:00:44.340> accurate<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:45.090> far<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
extremely accurate as far as what the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.279 
extremely accurate as far as what the
model<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.160> supposed<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.910> anyway<00:00:48.289> there's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
model is supposed to be anyway there's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.830 
model is supposed to be anyway there's
very<00:00:49.800> deep<00:00:50.100> mathematics<00:00:50.789> behind<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.420> program

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
very deep mathematics behind the program

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.160 
very deep mathematics behind the program
itself<00:00:52.879> things<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.090> Google<00:00:54.270> Earth<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
itself things like Google Earth all the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.990 
itself things like Google Earth all the
way<00:00:55.289> up<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.489> Stellarium<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.640> other<00:00:56.760> programs

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
way up to Stellarium and other programs

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.349 
way up to Stellarium and other programs
like<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.829> they<00:00:58.829> use<00:00:59.160> very<00:00:59.489> complex

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
like that they use very complex

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.469 
like that they use very complex
mathematical<00:01:03.260> formulas<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.450> ways<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
mathematical formulas and ways to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.810 
mathematical formulas and ways to
demonstrate<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.710> visually<00:01:08.369> what<00:01:08.700> is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
demonstrate to you visually what is

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.820 
demonstrate to you visually what is
actually<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.689> space<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.530> case

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
actually going on in space in this case

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.600 
actually going on in space in this case
and<00:01:12.560> just<00:01:13.560> keep<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:13.950> mind<00:01:14.250> as<00:01:14.460> you're

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
and just keep that in mind as you're

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.390 
and just keep that in mind as you're
looking<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.950> it's<00:01:16.950> what<00:01:17.159> allows

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
looking at this and it's what allows

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.880 
looking at this and it's what allows
these<00:01:17.610> programs<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.720> where<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.560> put<00:01:19.740> in

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
these programs to where you can put in

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.070 
these programs to where you can put in
any<00:01:20.130> kind<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.520> date<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> past<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.990> future

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
any kind of date in the past and future

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.310 
any kind of date in the past and future
up<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> some<00:01:23.369> lemon<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:23.850> sure<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.200> can

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
up to a some lemon I'm sure but you can

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.780 
up to a some lemon I'm sure but you can
go<00:01:25.409> many<00:01:25.560> years<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> past<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> future

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
go many years in the past and future

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.359 
go many years in the past and future
with<00:01:27.090> these<00:01:27.270> programs<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.080> pick<00:01:28.740> any<00:01:28.950> vantage

with these programs and pick any vantage

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.600 
with these programs and pick any vantage

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
see what it looks like from that vantage

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.170 
see what it looks like from that vantage

the lie but in any case remember that

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.719 
the lie but in any case remember that
they've<00:01:54.090> had<00:01:54.350> many<00:01:55.350> many<00:01:55.649> years<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.159> now<00:01:56.430> many

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
they've had many many years and now many

they've had many many years and now many
many<00:01:57.119> years<00:01:57.329> with<00:01:57.630> computers<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:59.159> figure<00:01:59.490> out

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
many years with computers to figure out

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.520 
many years with computers to figure out
all<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.090> stuff<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.570> come<00:02:00.719> up<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:00.869> formulas

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
all this stuff to come up with formulas

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.240 
all this stuff to come up with formulas
to<00:02:01.740> make<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.040> look<00:02:02.280> right<00:02:02.579> no<00:02:02.820> matter<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.329> and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
to make it look right no matter what and

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.399 
to make it look right no matter what and
but<00:02:05.250> anyway<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.579> can<00:02:05.969> see<00:02:06.180> now<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.479> every

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
but anyway you can see now that every

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.990 
but anyway you can see now that every
now<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.740> then<00:02:07.890> something<00:02:08.429> things<00:02:08.670> come<00:02:08.970> up

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
now and then something things come up

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.240 
now and then something things come up
that<00:02:09.149> just<00:02:09.450> don't<00:02:09.690> make<00:02:09.810> sense<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.709> would

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
that just don't make sense I would

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.830 
that just don't make sense I would
highly<00:02:11.520> recommend<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:12.180> channel<00:02:12.629> right<00:02:12.780> here

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840

that so here it is guys and I just had

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.770 
that so here it is guys and I just had
flat<00:03:59.609> earth<00:03:59.819> there's<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.180> couple<00:04:00.329> things<00:04:00.540> I'm

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
flat earth there's a couple things I'm

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.140 
flat earth there's a couple things I'm
coming<00:04:01.380> across<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:02.040> leads<00:04:02.730> me<00:04:02.849> to<00:04:03.120> believe

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
coming across that leads me to believe

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.240 
coming across that leads me to believe
that<00:04:03.389> the<00:04:03.690> absolute<00:04:03.900> best<00:04:04.530> model<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.220> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
that the absolute best model is the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.789 
that the absolute best model is the
concave<00:04:05.940> one<00:04:06.239> but<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:06.930> can't<00:04:07.410> say<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.620> for

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
concave one but I can't say that for

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.400 
concave one but I can't say that for
sure<00:04:08.010> for<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.609> couple<00:04:08.940> reasons<00:04:08.970> all<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:09.900> know<00:04:10.200> is

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
sure for a couple reasons all I know is

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.099 
sure for a couple reasons all I know is
the<00:04:10.590> worst<00:04:10.889> model<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.120> globe<00:04:12.660> the

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
the worst model is the globe the

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.319 
the worst model is the globe the
absolute<00:04:13.799> worst<00:04:14.099> with<00:04:14.639> different<00:04:15.000> things<00:04:15.150> I'm

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
absolute worst with different things I'm

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.569 
absolute worst with different things I'm
looking<00:04:15.480> at<00:04:15.750> is<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.049> globe<00:04:16.320> more<00:04:17.070> things<00:04:17.310> fall

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
looking at is the globe more things fall

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.550 
looking at is the globe more things fall
apart<00:04:17.609> with<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.389> than<00:04:18.630> with<00:04:18.660> anything<00:04:19.200> else

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.710 

so<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.800> leaves<00:04:23.039> other<00:04:23.430> shapes<00:04:23.880> let's<00:04:24.510> just

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
so that leaves other shapes let's just

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.140 
so that leaves other shapes let's just
put<00:04:24.870> it<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.020> way<00:04:25.169> for<00:04:25.289> now<00:04:25.530> so

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
put it that way for now so

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.020 
put it that way for now so
enjoy<00:04:27.050> this<00:04:27.290> I<00:04:27.530> think<00:04:27.770> it's<00:04:27.889> fantastic<00:04:28.070> take

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
enjoy this I think it's fantastic take

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.719 
enjoy this I think it's fantastic take

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
the moon in the sky at the same time a

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.750 
the moon in the sky at the same time a
lot<00:04:36.750> of<00:04:36.840> people<00:04:37.110> are<00:04:37.230> posting<00:04:37.760> panoramic

lot of people are posting panoramic

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.680 
lot of people are posting panoramic
images<00:04:39.120> of<00:04:39.300> this<00:04:39.530> of<00:04:40.530> questions<00:04:41.450> so<00:04:42.450> I<00:04:42.480> wanted

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
images of this of questions so I wanted

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.930 
images of this of questions so I wanted
to<00:04:42.750> just<00:04:42.870> try<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:43.890> explain<00:04:44.400> this<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.700> bit

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
to just try and explain this a bit

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.010 
to just try and explain this a bit
better<00:04:45.090> it's<00:04:45.960> quite<00:04:46.170> hard<00:04:46.440> to<00:04:46.560> do<00:04:46.800> with<00:04:47.010> words

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
better it's quite hard to do with words

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.270 
better it's quite hard to do with words

morning in southern Spain the location

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.870 
morning in southern Spain the location
set<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.160> southern<00:05:08.490> Spain<00:05:08.930> we<00:05:09.930> can<00:05:10.110> see<00:05:10.760> see<00:05:11.760> the

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
set to southern Spain we can see see the

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.310 
set to southern Spain we can see see the
moon<00:05:12.060> there<00:05:12.330> in<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.510> sky<00:05:12.660> and<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.170> Sun<00:05:15.320> both

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
moon there in the sky and the Sun both

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.940 
moon there in the sky and the Sun both
in<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.770> sky<00:05:18.230> stellarium<00:05:19.230> is<00:05:19.500> actually<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.830> good

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
in the sky stellarium is actually a good

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.280 
in the sky stellarium is actually a good
software<00:05:20.370> if<00:05:20.610> you<00:05:20.760> don't<00:05:21.000> zoom<00:05:21.540> in<00:05:21.750> or<00:05:21.840> out<00:05:21.900> it

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
software if you don't zoom in or out it

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.690 
software if you don't zoom in or out it
basically<00:05:22.500> acts<00:05:23.040> as<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:23.340> flat<00:05:24.180> earth<00:05:24.210> in<00:05:24.600> a<00:05:24.660> way

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
basically acts as a flat earth in a way

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.390 
basically acts as a flat earth in a way
there<00:05:26.700> we<00:05:26.820> go<00:05:26.940> sun<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.360> moon<00:05:27.450> in<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.780> sky

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
there we go sun and moon in the sky

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.610 
there we go sun and moon in the sky
let's<00:05:29.400> just<00:05:29.580> change<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.090> time<00:05:30.570> back<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:31.110> 930

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
let's just change the time back to 930

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.340 
let's just change the time back to 930
so<00:05:32.010> we're<00:05:32.130> a<00:05:32.160> bit<00:05:32.310> accurate<00:05:33.200> I've<00:05:34.200> been

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
so we're a bit accurate I've been

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.350 
so we're a bit accurate I've been
playing<00:05:34.620> around<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:35.010> bit<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:38.150> we're<00:05:39.150> going

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
playing around a bit and we're going

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.180 
playing around a bit and we're going

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.250 
nine thirty in the morning like it'll
get<00:06:25.980> her<00:06:26.070> lined<00:06:26.280> up<00:06:26.810> we<00:06:27.810> can't<00:06:28.050> see<00:06:28.290> spain<00:06:30.260> and

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
get her lined up we can't see spain and

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.750 
get her lined up we can't see spain and
we<00:06:31.380> have<00:06:31.470> to<00:06:31.560> go<00:06:31.650> away<00:06:31.800> around<00:06:31.950> the<00:06:32.190> Atlantic

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
we have to go away around the Atlantic

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:42.100 
we have to go away around the Atlantic
to<00:06:33.480> see<00:06:33.660> Spain<00:06:37.670> what's<00:06:38.670> going<00:06:39.060> on

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.040 

it<00:06:43.100> doesn't<00:06:43.400> make<00:06:43.520> sense<00:06:43.630> if<00:06:44.630> we<00:06:44.840> come<00:06:45.020> out

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
it doesn't make sense if we come out

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.780 
it doesn't make sense if we come out
from<00:06:45.410> Spain<00:06:45.710> there<00:06:45.980> you<00:06:46.130> can<00:06:46.280> see<00:06:46.310> the<00:06:46.580> moon's

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
from Spain there you can see the moon's

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.650 
from Spain there you can see the moon's
well<00:06:47.030> off<00:06:48.970> it's<00:06:49.970> a<00:06:50.060> long<00:06:50.240> way<00:06:50.360> around<00:06:50.480> to

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:50.660 
well off it's a long way around to

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.260 
well off it's a long way around to
another<00:06:50.840> 10<00:06:51.110> 20<00:06:51.440> degrees<00:06:51.770> around<00:06:52.130> its<00:06:52.520> fake

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
another 10 20 degrees around its fake

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.310 
another 10 20 degrees around its fake
orbit<00:06:54.250> another<00:06:55.250> thing<00:06:55.610> is<00:06:55.870> the<00:06:56.870> moon<00:06:57.050> here<00:06:57.260> you

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.320 
orbit another thing is the moon here you

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.640 
orbit another thing is the moon here you
can<00:06:57.470> see<00:06:57.620> the<00:06:57.770> Sun<00:06:57.980> is<00:06:58.160> nothing<00:06:58.730> in<00:06:58.850> the<00:06:58.940> way

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
can see the Sun is nothing in the way

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.170 
can see the Sun is nothing in the way
remember<00:07:00.650> we<00:07:00.770> can<00:07:00.920> all<00:07:01.040> see<00:07:01.280> one<00:07:01.550> face<00:07:01.850> to<00:07:01.880> the

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
remember we can all see one face to the

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.780 
remember we can all see one face to the
moon<00:07:02.440> so<00:07:03.440> why's<00:07:03.740> that<00:07:03.770> why's<00:07:04.220> the<00:07:04.430> moon<00:07:04.610> not

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
moon so why's that why's the moon not

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.910 
moon so why's that why's the moon not
fall<00:07:05.030> I<00:07:07.330> can<00:07:08.330> see<00:07:08.570> it<00:07:08.660> there's<00:07:09.380> nothing<00:07:09.500> in<00:07:09.830> the

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:09.920 
fall I can see it there's nothing in the

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.810 
fall I can see it there's nothing in the
way<00:07:11.830> it's<00:07:12.830> because<00:07:13.160> the<00:07:13.340> moon<00:07:13.520> self

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:13.820 
way it's because the moon self

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.890 
way it's because the moon self
illuminates<00:07:16.120> you<00:07:17.120> just<00:07:17.270> think<00:07:17.420> those<00:07:17.600> sun's

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
illuminates you just think those sun's

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.540 
illuminates you just think those sun's
rays<00:07:18.170> coming<00:07:18.530> up<00:07:18.680> the<00:07:18.770> moon<00:07:18.920> it<00:07:19.100> would<00:07:19.160> just<00:07:19.310> it

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
rays coming up the moon it would just it

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:27.930 
rays coming up the moon it would just it
would<00:07:19.670> just<00:07:19.820> hit<00:07:20.030> it<00:07:20.350> it<00:07:21.350> would<00:07:21.470> hit<00:07:21.560> that<00:07:21.620> face

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:27.940 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.310 

so<00:07:28.940> you<00:07:29.000> can<00:07:29.090> move<00:07:29.270> me<00:07:29.420> up<00:07:29.450> the<00:07:29.600> balls<00:07:29.810> in<00:07:30.080> we

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.320 
so you can move me up the balls in we

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.640 
so you can move me up the balls in we
start<00:07:30.590> getting<00:07:31.870> that's<00:07:32.870> what<00:07:33.200> seems

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:33.650 
start getting that's what seems

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.190 
start getting that's what seems
to<00:07:33.800> be<00:07:33.830> the<00:07:33.920> case<00:07:34.420> and<00:07:35.420> i<00:07:35.510> haven't<00:07:35.540> have<00:07:35.960> a<00:07:35.990> play

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.200 
to be the case and i haven't have a play

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.740 
to be the case and i haven't have a play
around<00:07:36.230> in<00:07:36.560> celestion<00:07:37.400> Stellarium<00:07:37.970> and<00:07:38.180> let

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:38.750 
around in celestion Stellarium and let

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.880 
around in celestion Stellarium and let
me<00:07:38.810> know<00:07:38.840> what<00:07:39.020> you<00:07:39.080> find<00:07:39.520> have<00:07:40.520> a<00:07:40.580> good<00:07:40.760> day
