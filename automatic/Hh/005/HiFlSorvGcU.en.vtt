00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
comes a new possibility that it might

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.180 
comes a new possibility that it might
not<00:04:03.910> go<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.510> exact<00:04:04.900> attention<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.770> person

want<00:04:06.610> yeah<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:09.100> you<00:04:09.640> know<00:04:09.760> honestly<00:04:10.300> like

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
want yeah and you know honestly like

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.060 
want yeah and you know honestly like
think<00:04:13.780> about<00:04:13.989> if<00:04:14.200> they<00:04:14.350> did<00:04:14.560> bring<00:04:14.800> up<00:04:14.950> the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
think about if they did bring up the

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.030 
think about if they did bring up the
show<00:04:15.250> me<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:16.180> monsters<00:04:16.720> get<00:04:16.930> bigger<00:04:17.380> could

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
show me the monsters get bigger could

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.729 
show me the monsters get bigger could
they<00:04:18.190> be<00:04:18.220> more<00:04:18.780> scarier<00:04:19.780> could<00:04:20.230> it<00:04:20.320> be<00:04:20.350> you

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
they be more scarier could it be you

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.950 
they be more scarier could it be you
know<00:04:20.890> I<00:04:21.130> mean<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:21.970> is<00:04:22.180> like<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.660> late<00:04:22.810> two

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
know I mean this is like the late two

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.840 
know I mean this is like the late two
thousand<00:04:23.290> let<00:04:23.440> me<00:04:23.530> think<00:04:23.740> like<00:04:24.490> a<00:04:24.550> lot

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
thousand let me think like a lot

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.500 
thousand let me think like a lot
different<00:04:25.419> now<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:27.220> technology<00:04:27.610> now<00:04:28.060> can

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
different now and the technology now can

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.940 
different now and the technology now can
probably<00:04:28.600> make<00:04:28.930> our<00:04:29.110> own<00:04:29.350> awesome

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
probably make our own awesome

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.340 
probably make our own awesome
really<00:04:30.400> scary<00:04:30.700> but<00:04:31.120> now<00:04:31.390> honestly<00:04:31.660> kid<00:04:32.110> firmly

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
really scary but now honestly kid firmly

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.140 
really scary but now honestly kid firmly
so<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.860> could<00:04:32.980> be<00:04:33.130> like<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.820> know<00:04:33.850> something

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
so it could be like you know something

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.140 
so it could be like you know something

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
way to expand a little bit up on the

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.220 
way to expand a little bit up on the
idea<00:06:20.650> of<00:06:21.070> monsters<00:06:22.000> maybe<00:06:22.900> some<00:06:23.110> with

would be definitely involved the course
that's<00:06:27.460> what<00:06:27.940> every<00:06:28.210> day<00:06:28.330> cartoons<00:06:28.810> hapless
