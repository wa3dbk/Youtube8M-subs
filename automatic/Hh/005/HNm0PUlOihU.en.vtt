00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.480
 Lima is a city that was opposite 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.739
 to the sea and the truth that we did not take the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.180
 profit that we could get him out of 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.850
 several days that I've been hearing from 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.260
 restaurant mangoes tell me that I 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.329
 they had told him that they had renewed him and 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.390
 it proved me neither with nor with antonia what 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.060
 what do you think 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.980
 besides going out every day 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.300
 and the truth is that really what they say 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.480
 of the best view of the inah is not so 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.480
 exaggerated 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:08.290
 it is a thing that does not have nor being in 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.070
 the post office like that to the medium like that 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.200
 I prefer and the sea that is not have 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.460
 well we are inhabited like that throwing 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.340
 a whole portfolio that we have called 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.160
 Mango moments in the afternoons just 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.080
 well let's give a moment of lunch 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.600
 not that we are not renamed as 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.369
 moment models therapist because 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.990
 being a single idea we realize 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.940
 what a clear team, you women 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.470
 they do not meet in the afternoons is the 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.910
 ideal time to report a bit of 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.910
 catharsis and really not 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.149
 but ours but men too 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.250
 they have their own therapy and all 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.660
 would come in the next exact turn 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.420
 because we also have type the 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.100
 after oficce we have Saturdays we are 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.570
 united no dj born in those afternoons 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.590
 nights like for what kind of people 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.909
 normal 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.909
 a little 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.149
 here there is no che in any way 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.039
 recognized if you have not searched for all type 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.570
 a staff of expert people in the part 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.580
 gastronomic to implement a letter 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.890
 that he had a little bit of everything between 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.690
 the buffets that somehow are like 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.760
 had commented that it was clear is what 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.470
 people identify mangoes but also 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.950
 time we have breakfast options 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.500
 LUNCH piqueos this main course not 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.879
 is for an alternative just the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.560
 who does not really want to pay for a 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:29.180
 buffet and here you feel that you see 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.180
 forced to eat a buffet not 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.630
 we also have the option of hot 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.060
 the famous pizzas or go to the pizza 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.239
 vegetarian with thin crust 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.720
 I have the kits of artichoke kits x 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.150
 of spinach we particularly have a 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.099
 suddenly international option 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.380
 we found something so Peruvian but if it is 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.050
 classic like sandwiches but also 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.959
 international as is a French kit or 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.780
 a spanish omelet from europe spain and 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.700
 good and the classic skewers of power 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.500
 mostly because we mix the scope 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.500
 classic with international element 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.710
 we place four seasons well 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.560
 Segmented ham sandwiches area 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.680
 hot area like they are some 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.730
 visits 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.299
 pig the oven cupcakes cakes and 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:36.290
 another area that is good chocolate fruits 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.689
 three ice creams the pancakes then 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.310
 when talking to a buffet you have to like 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:45.079
 that not very hot and then a bit 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.469
 then he has a monkey is cool 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.870
 then there is a little bit of everything we have 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.299
 roast 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.010
 we have oriental transits are not 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.409
 flavors with reason we have players 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.200
 strong all soft flavors ensobrar and 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.720
 Sweet a spicy flavor to start 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.190
 attack as many senses and 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.190
 tastes that should come to mind 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:20.030
 I loved the protocol of the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:23.079
 buffet there is no protocol but if 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.079
 there is a taste 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.240
 to me at least I like to sit 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.639
 take me 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.310
 a coffee and getting warm 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.199
 let's say it that exact and then move on 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.110
 just to the table but that tactics 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.480
 I'm waiting 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.139
 and losing 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.940
 shame the feet 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.360
 practically the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:54.460
 and after attacking her 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.879
 a total therapy now we create the same 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.879
 chord
