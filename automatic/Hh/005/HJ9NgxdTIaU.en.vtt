see it that well but it's right near the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.639 
see it that well but it's right near the
duodenum<00:00:56.660> pancreas<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:58.170> kind<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.469> rubber

down we're just move on I moved about
the<00:01:06.840> small<00:01:07.140> intestine<00:01:07.650> um<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the small intestine um this is the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.630 
the small intestine um this is the
descending<00:01:09.990> colon<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.310> lead<00:01:11.460> into

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
descending colon it's going to lead into

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.469 
descending colon it's going to lead into
the<00:01:11.729> rectum<00:01:12.950> then<00:01:13.950> right<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.360> going<00:01:15.360> across

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the rectum then right here going across

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.660 
the rectum then right here going across
the<00:01:15.869> body<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the body like this is going to be the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.950 
the body like this is going to be the
transverse<00:01:18.180> colon<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.360> goes<00:01:21.509> down

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
transverse colon and then that goes down

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.130 
transverse colon and then that goes down
is<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.770> descending<00:01:23.250> colon<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.240> arse<00:01:24.930> are

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
is the descending colon or the arse are

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.440 
is the descending colon or the arse are
ascending<00:01:25.560> colon<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> be

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
ascending colon and this is going to be

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.810 
ascending colon and this is going to be
the<00:01:27.540> cecum<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.890> vermiform<00:01:29.280> appendix

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the cecum with the vermiform appendix

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.410 
the cecum with the vermiform appendix
which<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.659> little<00:01:30.930> knob<00:01:31.079> right<00:01:31.320> here

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
which is this little knob right here

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.640 
which is this little knob right here
it's<00:01:33.420> going<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.750> attach<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> small

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
intestine and this part of a small

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.890 
intestine and this part of a small
intestine<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.590> ileum<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.329> then<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
intestine is the ileum and then the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.569 
intestine is the ileum and then the
middle<00:01:40.049> portion<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> small<00:01:40.860> intestine<00:01:40.890> is

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
middle portion of the small intestine is

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.609 
middle portion of the small intestine is
going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> jejunum<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.500> going

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
going to be the jejunum and it's going

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.139 
going to be the jejunum and it's going
to<00:01:43.680> go<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:44.009> towards<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.340> duodenum<00:01:44.670> which

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
to go up towards the duodenum which

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.039 
to go up towards the duodenum which
attaches<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.869> stomach<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:48.180> spleen

you can't really see it that well but
it's<00:01:52.259> right<00:01:53.189> about<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.630> it's<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.990> be

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
it's right about here it's going to be

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.330 
it's right about here it's going to be
more<00:01:55.259> posterior<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.070> stomach

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
more posterior to the stomach

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.700 
more posterior to the stomach
and<00:01:58.340> we<00:01:58.850> have<00:01:59.060> our<00:01:59.210> naval<00:02:00.430> pieces<00:02:02.500> it's<00:02:03.500> going

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
and we have our naval pieces it's going

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.830 
and we have our naval pieces it's going
to<00:02:03.800> be<00:02:03.860> like<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.340> tiny<00:02:04.580> indent<00:02:05.120> within<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.690> body

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
to be like a tiny indent within the body

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.249 
to be like a tiny indent within the body
wall<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:07.340> can't<00:02:07.580> really<00:02:07.700> see<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.000> on<00:02:08.149> this<00:02:08.360> and
