we are using the plaster ground for a

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.350 
we are using the plaster ground for a
thin<00:03:16.260> wall<00:03:16.500> application<00:03:17.280> such<00:03:17.910> as<00:03:17.940> with<00:03:18.330> a

thin wall application such as with a
fiberglass<00:03:19.200> wall<00:03:19.770> you<00:03:20.610> leave<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.090> plaster

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
fiberglass wall you leave the plaster

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.200 
fiberglass wall you leave the plaster
guard<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.900> place<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.250> got<00:03:23.460> the<00:03:23.580> plastic

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
guard in place so you got the plastic

guard in place so you got the plastic
guard<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.720> then<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:26.010> have<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.460> fiberglass

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
guard and then you have the fiberglass

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.100 
guard and then you have the fiberglass
goes<00:03:27.240> over<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.870> drill<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> hole<00:03:28.860> between

inches the diameter a hole in your
fiberglass<00:03:41.390> then<00:03:42.390> with<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.440> fiberglass

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
fiberglass then with the fiberglass

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.040 
fiberglass then with the fiberglass
right<00:03:44.220> here<00:03:44.580> then<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:45.600> take<00:03:46.020> your<00:03:46.430> escutcheon

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
right here then you take your escutcheon

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.850 
right here then you take your escutcheon
and<00:03:49.050> put<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.709> right<00:03:49.860> on<00:03:50.100> there<00:03:50.310> like<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.860> then

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
and put it right on there like that then

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.480 
and put it right on there like that then
your<00:03:54.410> your<00:03:55.410> long<00:03:55.790> Phillips<00:03:56.790> head<00:03:56.970> screws<00:03:58.490> go

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
your your long Phillips head screws go

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:09.580 
your your long Phillips head screws go
in<00:03:59.670> here<00:04:04.100> go<00:04:05.100> ahead<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.280> tighten<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:05.700> down

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.710 

okay<00:04:10.590> so<00:04:10.650> this<00:04:10.890> tightens<00:04:11.370> right<00:04:11.430> on<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.630> the

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
okay so this tightens right on to the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.290 
okay so this tightens right on to the
fiberglass<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:14.070> clamps<00:04:14.790> right<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.209> the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
fiberglass it clamps right on to the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:29.080 
fiberglass it clamps right on to the
fiberglass<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:16.019> what<00:04:16.140> it<00:04:16.230> does

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.010 

okay<00:04:29.930> so<00:04:30.919> with<00:04:31.070> that<00:04:31.100> tightened<00:04:31.610> down<00:04:31.669> you<00:04:32.150> see

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
okay so with that tightened down you see

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.290 
okay so with that tightened down you see
the<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:34.460> fiberglass<00:04:34.850> will<00:04:35.210> be

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
the the the fiberglass will be

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.540 
the the the fiberglass will be
sandwiched<00:04:35.780> between<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.830> plaster<00:04:37.250> ground

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
sandwiched between the plaster ground

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.650 
sandwiched between the plaster ground
and<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.600> scutcheon<00:04:38.870> as<00:04:39.230> it's<00:04:39.800> very<00:04:39.919> secure

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
and the scutcheon as it's very secure

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.110 
and the scutcheon as it's very secure
you<00:04:41.660> don't<00:04:41.870> need<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.790> fasten<00:04:43.790> it<00:04:43.850> to<00:04:43.910> the

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
you don't need to fasten it to the

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.470 
you don't need to fasten it to the
backing<00:04:44.600> at<00:04:44.720> all<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.139> it's<00:04:45.889> a<00:04:46.040> test<00:04:46.370> rate<00:04:47.150> to

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
backing at all it it's a test rate to

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.050 
backing at all it it's a test rate to
the<00:04:47.720> fiberglass<00:04:49.510> shower<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:51.770> use<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.190> in<00:04:52.400> a

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
the fiberglass shower you use it in a

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.110 
the fiberglass shower you use it in a
thicker<00:04:53.840> wall<00:04:54.110> application<00:04:54.950> you<00:04:55.550> plaster

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
thicker wall application you plaster

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.510 
thicker wall application you plaster
right<00:04:56.300> up<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:56.690> it<00:04:56.840> nice<00:04:57.620> and<00:04:57.650> flush<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.400> then

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
right up to it nice and flush and then

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.830 
right up to it nice and flush and then
you<00:04:58.639> take<00:04:58.880> it<00:04:59.000> off<00:04:59.150> and<00:04:59.389> don't<00:04:59.480> use<00:04:59.750> it<00:04:59.990> or<00:05:00.680> you

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
you take it off and don't use it or you

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.770 
you take it off and don't use it or you
use<00:05:02.840> it<00:05:03.020> in<00:05:03.110> a<00:05:03.200> thin<00:05:03.350> wall<00:05:03.560> application<00:05:04.780> except

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
use it in a thin wall application except

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.240 
use it in a thin wall application except
you<00:05:05.870> take<00:05:06.080> that<00:05:06.260> you<00:05:06.560> break<00:05:07.040> that<00:05:07.160> cap<00:05:07.430> off<00:05:07.639> and

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
you take that you break that cap off and

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.920 
you take that you break that cap off and
then<00:05:10.250> you<00:05:11.889> sandwich<00:05:12.889> the<00:05:13.460> fire<00:05:14.120> glass<00:05:14.360> between

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
then you sandwich the fire glass between

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.840 
then you sandwich the fire glass between
the<00:05:15.320> plaster<00:05:15.710> guard<00:05:15.919> and<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.790> escutcheon<00:05:18.850> now

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
the plaster guard and the escutcheon now
