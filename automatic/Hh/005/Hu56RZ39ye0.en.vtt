concern where the surface temperature is
not<00:00:59.219> getting<00:00:59.460> cold<00:00:59.789> enough<00:01:00.000> until<00:01:00.300> late

not getting cold enough until late

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.950 
not getting cold enough until late
because<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.170> hrrr<00:01:02.039> model<00:01:02.449> kept<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> freezing

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
because the hrrr model kept the freezing

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.120 
because the hrrr model kept the freezing
line<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> low<00:01:05.369> longest<00:01:06.119> time<00:01:06.360> and

just you know sleet and rain mix and i

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.710 
just you know sleet and rain mix and i
thought<00:01:10.439> gosh<00:01:10.680> that's<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.040> concern<00:01:11.510> this<00:01:12.510> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
thought gosh that's a concern this is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.539 
thought gosh that's a concern this is
different<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> fact<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.040> freezing

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
different in the fact that the freezing

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.340 
different in the fact that the freezing
line<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:15.030> much<00:01:15.299> further<00:01:15.540> towards<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> north

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
line is much further towards the north

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.440 
line is much further towards the north
as<00:01:17.070> much<00:01:17.340> further<00:01:17.580> towards<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.030> south<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
as much further towards the south and

north texas into louisiana and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.899 
north texas into louisiana and
mississippi<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.570> hrrr<00:01:22.439> i<00:01:22.470> cannot<00:01:23.369> say

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
mississippi so the hrrr i cannot say

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.590 
mississippi so the hrrr i cannot say
enough<00:01:24.180> good<00:01:25.140> things<00:01:25.200> about<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.580> model<00:01:27.060> it's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
enough good things about this model it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.140 
enough good things about this model it's
not<00:01:27.900> perfect<00:01:28.439> no<00:01:28.770> model<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.369> perfect<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:29.939> this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
not perfect no model is perfect but this

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.780 
not perfect no model is perfect but this
is<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> very<00:01:30.720> short<00:01:30.900> range<00:01:31.650> high<00:01:32.040> resolution

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
is a very short range high resolution

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.080 
is a very short range high resolution
model<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.360> only<00:01:33.990> goes<00:01:34.380> out<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.799> 15<00:01:35.250> hours<00:01:35.400> we

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
model it only goes out to 15 hours we

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.660 
model it only goes out to 15 hours we
have<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> whole<00:01:36.810> event<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.950> now<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.520> we

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
have the whole event in this now so we

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.319 
have the whole event in this now so we
can<00:01:38.820> take<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> look<00:01:39.180> at<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.189> we'll<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.820> go

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
can take a look at it and we'll just go

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.730 
can take a look at it and we'll just go
right<00:01:42.509> through<00:01:42.750> here<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> simulated

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
right through here this is simulated

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.590 
right through here this is simulated
radar<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.600> this<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.780> at<00:01:46.020> eleven<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.950> morning

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.109 
there's the 35 degree line this is going
to<00:02:02.939> be<00:02:03.180> sleet<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.049> freezing<00:02:04.140> rain<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.119> you'll

after<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.140> Oscars<00:02:10.319> yeah<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.340> think<00:02:11.550> we'll<00:02:11.879> get

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
after the Oscars yeah I think we'll get

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.850 
after the Oscars yeah I think we'll get
some<00:02:12.720> up<00:02:12.959> towards<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.440> north

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
some up towards the north

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.560

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.710 
the area that I've got a dusting to one
inch<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.830> have<00:02:56.310> changed<00:02:56.670> my<00:02:56.880> forecast<00:02:57.540> to

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
inch I have changed my forecast to

include up to two inches for this area

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.070 
include up to two inches for this area
right<00:03:02.070> here<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.520> it<00:03:02.640> may<00:03:02.790> expand<00:03:03.360> further

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
right here and it may expand further

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.260 
right here and it may expand further
just<00:03:04.620> south<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.070> Metro<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:06.000> showing

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
just south of the Metro this is showing

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.670 
just south of the Metro this is showing
around<00:03:06.390> an<00:03:06.690> inch<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:06.959> I've<00:03:07.020> got<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.200> dusting<00:03:07.470> to

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
around an inch and I've got a dusting to

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.170 
around an inch and I've got a dusting to
one<00:03:07.890> inch<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.220> think<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.550> forecast<00:03:08.940> will<00:03:09.060> work

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.820 
one inch I think that forecast will work
out<00:03:09.300> well<00:03:09.330> for<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.690> Metro<00:03:10.020> but<00:03:10.170> there<00:03:10.530> could

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
out well for the Metro but there could

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.400 
out well for the Metro but there could
be<00:03:10.890> an<00:03:11.160> area<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:11.850> i'll<00:03:12.239> show<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.570> hrrr

towards hot spring County and then it

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.650 
towards hot spring County and then it
really<00:03:44.280> narrows<00:03:44.549> it<00:03:44.820> down<00:03:44.850> once<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.360> gets<00:03:45.510> into

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
really narrows it down once it gets into

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.120 
really narrows it down once it gets into
grant<00:03:45.930> Jefferson<00:03:46.440> County<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.799> it<00:03:46.860> picks<00:03:47.040> it

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
grant Jefferson County and it picks it

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.250 
grant Jefferson County and it picks it
back<00:03:47.280> up<00:03:47.489> so<00:03:47.790> i<00:03:47.820> think<00:03:47.940> i<00:03:48.239> have<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.989> higher

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
back up so i think i have a higher

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.470 
back up so i think i have a higher
degree<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.650> confidence<00:03:50.130> in<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.820> one<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.239> two

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
degree of confidence in a one to two

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.440 
degree of confidence in a one to two
inch<00:03:51.780> or<00:03:52.260> up<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.860> two<00:03:53.160> inch<00:03:53.370> forecast<00:03:53.910> out<00:03:54.150> here

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
inch or up to two inch forecast out here

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.430 
inch or up to two inch forecast out here
so<00:03:55.080> here's<00:03:55.680> my<00:03:55.739> forecast<00:03:56.370> right<00:03:56.610> now<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:58.290> i

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
so here's my forecast right now and i

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.259 
so here's my forecast right now and i
may<00:03:58.590> extend<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.190> dusting<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.850> little<00:04:00.120> bit

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
may extend this dusting a little bit

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.670 
may extend this dusting a little bit
further<00:04:00.480> towards<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.870> north<00:04:01.049> but<00:04:01.380> i<00:04:01.470> think

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
further towards the north but i think

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.310 
further towards the north but i think
one<00:04:01.860> inch<00:04:02.040> totals<00:04:02.459> would<00:04:02.640> maybe<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.660> good<00:04:04.110> bed

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
one inch totals would maybe a good bed

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.750 
one inch totals would maybe a good bed
across<00:04:04.590> portions<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.220> central<00:04:05.580> arkansas

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
across portions of central arkansas

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.550 
across portions of central arkansas
dusting<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.480> one<00:04:06.600> inch<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.049> I<00:04:07.110> got<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.290> dusting

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
dusting to one inch and I got a dusting

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.530 
dusting to one inch and I got a dusting
because<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.190> further<00:04:08.400> north<00:04:08.549> you<00:04:08.910> go<00:04:09.060> i<00:04:09.209> think

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
because the further north you go i think

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.090 
because the further north you go i think
the<00:04:09.630> amounts<00:04:09.930> will<00:04:10.019> be<00:04:10.049> lighter<00:04:10.380> then<00:04:10.950> you'll

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
the amounts will be lighter then you'll

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.440 
the amounts will be lighter then you'll
go<00:04:11.220> up<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.459> about<00:04:11.549> one<00:04:11.760> inch<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.150> then<00:04:12.239> here's

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
go up to about one inch and then here's

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.500 
go up to about one inch and then here's
this<00:04:12.600> area<00:04:13.019> of<00:04:13.230> up<00:04:13.829> to<00:04:14.070> two<00:04:14.280> inches<00:04:14.480> that<00:04:15.480> i

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
this area of up to two inches that i

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.360 
this area of up to two inches that i
think<00:04:15.630> would<00:04:15.870> be<00:04:16.019> possible<00:04:16.470> neck<00:04:16.680> does<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.280> i

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
think would be possible neck does that i

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.039 
think would be possible neck does that i
have<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.579> going<00:04:17.970> into<00:04:18.120> hot<00:04:18.359> spring<00:04:18.690> county

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
have that going into hot spring county

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.620 
have that going into hot spring county
and<00:04:19.229> it<00:04:19.739> make<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:20.130> little<00:04:20.579> bit<00:04:20.729> further<00:04:21.000> towards

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
and it make a little bit further towards

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.330 
and it make a little bit further towards
the<00:04:21.690> east<00:04:21.900> just<00:04:22.140> a<00:04:22.289> touch<00:04:22.560> but<00:04:22.919> up<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.160> two

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
the east just a touch but up to two

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.920 
the east just a touch but up to two
inches<00:04:23.370> in<00:04:23.700> this<00:04:23.940> location<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.539> then

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
inches in this location and then

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.659 
inches in this location and then
remember<00:04:25.289> i<00:04:25.320> showed<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.590> this<00:04:26.070> this<00:04:26.370> will<00:04:26.550> be

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
remember i showed you this this will be

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.710 
remember i showed you this this will be
sleet<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.030> snow

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
sleet and snow

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.350 
sleet and snow
maybe<00:04:28.530> some<00:04:28.770> freezing<00:04:29.010> rain<00:04:29.160> and<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.850> expect

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
maybe some freezing rain and I expect

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.200 
maybe some freezing rain and I expect
you<00:04:31.050> know<00:04:31.260> you<00:04:31.320> could<00:04:31.740> get<00:04:31.980> up<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.250> an<00:04:32.790> inch<00:04:32.940> of

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
you know you could get up to an inch of

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.750 
you know you could get up to an inch of
both<00:04:33.480> I<00:04:33.780> guess<00:04:33.870> in<00:04:34.350> some<00:04:34.500> locations<00:04:34.860> but<00:04:35.250> this

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
both I guess in some locations but this

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.580 
both I guess in some locations but this
is<00:04:35.940> another<00:04:36.210> quick<00:04:36.510> hitting<00:04:36.780> not<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.350> major

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
is another quick hitting not a major

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.200 
is another quick hitting not a major
storm<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.190> keep<00:04:38.400> saying<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:38.820> over<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.090> over

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
storm I keep saying that over and over

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.820 
storm I keep saying that over and over
it<00:04:39.390> seems<00:04:39.600> because<00:04:40.080> none<00:04:40.290> of<00:04:40.320> these<00:04:40.470> are<00:04:40.500> major

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
it seems because none of these are major

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.980 
it seems because none of these are major
storms<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.490> flow<00:04:41.670> aloft<00:04:42.000> is<00:04:42.240> very<00:04:42.480> fast<00:04:42.750> these

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
storms the flow aloft is very fast these

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.290 
storms the flow aloft is very fast these
disturbances<00:04:43.470> just<00:04:43.770> fly<00:04:44.280> through<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:44.850> they

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
disturbances just fly through and they

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.880 
disturbances just fly through and they
move<00:04:45.510> quickly<00:04:45.900> they<00:04:46.140> usually<00:04:46.500> get<00:04:46.680> here

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
move quickly they usually get here

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.440 
move quickly they usually get here
faster<00:04:47.340> than<00:04:47.370> models<00:04:47.790> predict<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.210> they<00:04:48.270> get

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
faster than models predict and they get

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.760 
faster than models predict and they get
out<00:04:48.660> of<00:04:48.720> here<00:04:48.900> faster<00:04:49.290> than<00:04:49.320> models<00:04:49.650> to

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
out of here faster than models to

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.950 
out of here faster than models to
predict<00:04:50.100> predict<00:04:50.640> so<00:04:51.150> keep<00:04:51.480> that<00:04:51.510> in<00:04:51.690> mind

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
predict predict so keep that in mind

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.320 
predict predict so keep that in mind
with<00:04:52.140> today's<00:04:52.440> I'm<00:04:52.680> showing<00:04:53.040> around<00:04:53.220> 10<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:53.940> 11

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
with today's I'm showing around 10 to 11

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.300 
with today's I'm showing around 10 to 11
it<00:04:54.510> may<00:04:54.960> be<00:04:55.020> right<00:04:55.650> around<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:55.980> time<00:04:56.100> or<00:04:56.280> just

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
it may be right around that time or just

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.220 
it may be right around that time or just
a<00:04:56.490> little<00:04:56.670> bit<00:04:56.820> sooner<00:04:57.150> but<00:04:57.630> just<00:04:57.840> like<00:04:57.990> last

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
a little bit sooner but just like last

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.890 
a little bit sooner but just like last
night<00:04:58.530> I<00:04:58.800> mean<00:04:59.370> this<00:04:59.460> stuff<00:04:59.670> was<00:04:59.850> gone<00:05:00.330> by

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
night I mean this stuff was gone by

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.170 
night I mean this stuff was gone by
about<00:05:01.200> nine<00:05:01.440> or<00:05:01.470> ten<00:05:01.770> o'clock<00:05:02.010> and<00:05:02.340> some<00:05:03.090> of

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
about nine or ten o'clock and some of

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.030 
about nine or ten o'clock and some of
the<00:05:03.270> models<00:05:03.660> just<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:04.260> day<00:05:04.410> prior<00:05:04.680> didn't

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
the models just the day prior didn't

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.770 
the models just the day prior didn't
have<00:05:05.160> it<00:05:05.280> starting<00:05:05.850> until<00:05:06.060> about<00:05:06.270> seven<00:05:06.720> or

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
have it starting until about seven or

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.040 
have it starting until about seven or
eight<00:05:06.930> o'clock<00:05:07.290> so<00:05:08.040> again<00:05:08.640> these<00:05:09.000> are<00:05:09.060> quick

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
eight o'clock so again these are quick

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.560 
eight o'clock so again these are quick
movers<00:05:10.500> these<00:05:11.130> troughs<00:05:11.700> these<00:05:12.090> disturbances

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
movers these troughs these disturbances

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.480 
movers these troughs these disturbances
that<00:05:12.750> they're<00:05:13.140> not<00:05:13.290> digging<00:05:13.770> deep<00:05:14.190> they're

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
that they're not digging deep they're

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.850 
that they're not digging deep they're
not<00:05:14.990> intensifying<00:05:15.990> they're<00:05:16.230> just<00:05:16.440> flying

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
not intensifying they're just flying

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.370 
not intensifying they're just flying
through<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.670> mean<00:05:17.880> flow<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.150> lot<00:05:18.420> okay<00:05:19.350> I

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
through the the mean flow a lot okay I
