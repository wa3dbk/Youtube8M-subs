00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.990 
completely coated right up in here
I<00:01:10.550> got<00:01:11.270> another<00:01:11.479> run<00:01:11.750> here<00:01:12.700> smaller<00:01:13.700> runs

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
I got another run here smaller runs

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.540 
I got another run here smaller runs
right<00:01:14.210> there<00:01:14.710> runs<00:01:15.710> on<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:15.950> inside<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.310> little

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
right there runs on the inside a little

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.610 
right there runs on the inside a little
bit<00:01:16.760> but<00:01:16.940> I'm<00:01:17.000> taking<00:01:17.300> door<00:01:17.960> handles<00:01:18.350> off<00:01:18.470> to

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
bit but I'm taking door handles off to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.420 
bit but I'm taking door handles off to
do<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:19.540> great<00:01:20.540> works<00:01:20.690> next<00:01:20.900> time<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:22.160> then

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
do the great works next time and then

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.640 
do the great works next time and then
appears<00:01:25.430> not<00:01:25.610> so<00:01:25.850> bad<00:01:26.090> but<00:01:26.900> along<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.440> top

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
appears not so bad but along the top

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.590 
appears not so bad but along the top
right<00:01:27.860> here<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.280> couldn't<00:01:29.090> get<00:01:29.180> in<00:01:29.270> between<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
right here I couldn't get in between the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.320 
right here I couldn't get in between the
seal<00:01:29.810> correctly<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:30.890> that's<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.820> object<00:01:31.880> up

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
seal correctly so that's the object up

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.990 
seal correctly so that's the object up
and<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.500> worst<00:01:33.710> part<00:01:34.009> is<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:35.680> if<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:37.850> can

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
and the worst part is this if you can

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.389 
and the worst part is this if you can
see<00:01:38.149> these<00:01:38.300> cracks<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:39.710> looks<00:01:39.920> worse<00:01:40.190> in

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
see these cracks it looks worse in

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.910 
see these cracks it looks worse in
person<00:01:41.440> by<00:01:42.440> all<00:01:42.560> means

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
person by all means

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.150 
person by all means
and<00:01:43.070> it's<00:01:43.790> probably<00:01:44.030> cold<00:01:44.119> weather<00:01:45.100> but<00:01:46.100> uh

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
and it's probably cold weather but uh

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.090 
and it's probably cold weather but uh
not<00:01:46.729> much<00:01:46.850> I<00:01:47.000> can<00:01:47.060> do<00:01:47.270> about<00:01:47.300> it<00:01:47.540> I<00:01:47.860> got<00:01:48.860> some

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
not much I can do about it I got some

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.240 
not much I can do about it I got some
runs<00:01:49.910> right<00:01:50.240> here<00:01:51.040> one<00:01:52.040> right<00:01:52.070> there<00:01:54.220> when<00:01:55.220> I

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
runs right here one right there when I

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.380 
runs right here one right there when I
change<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.820> blue<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.330> black<00:01:56.680> on<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.830> inside<00:01:58.390> so

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
change to blue to black on the inside so

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.219 
change to blue to black on the inside so
doesn't<00:01:59.630> look<00:01:59.720> out<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.930> place<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:02.229> that's

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
doesn't look out of place and that's

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.320 
doesn't look out of place and that's
really<00:02:03.409> it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
really it

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.509 
really it
