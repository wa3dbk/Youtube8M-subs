playing Tekken 6 in my local arcade so I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.839 
playing Tekken 6 in my local arcade so I
already<00:00:26.699> know<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> little<00:00:27.119> bit<00:00:27.330> about<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> game

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
already know a little bit about the game

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
already know a little bit about the game
the<00:00:29.960> game<00:00:30.960> doesn't<00:00:31.289> come<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> black

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the game doesn't come with a black

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.319 
the game doesn't come with a black
plastic<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.850> it

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
plastic on it

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.110 
plastic on it
like<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.770> plastic<00:00:34.770> film<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
like the plastic film on it and the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.340 
like the plastic film on it and the
reason<00:00:36.420> why<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.750> because<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.110> game<00:00:37.260> was

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
reason why it's because the game was

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.490 
reason why it's because the game was
sold<00:00:37.620> out<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:39.210> only<00:00:39.300> copy<00:00:39.660> left<00:00:39.780> was<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
sold out and the only copy left was the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.170 
sold out and the only copy left was the
one<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> shelf<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.520> they<00:00:41.700> had<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.969> give<00:00:42.149> me
