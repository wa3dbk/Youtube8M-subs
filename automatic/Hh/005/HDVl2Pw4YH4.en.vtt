00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.470
 Hello my name is GeneviÃ¨ve Lenain I 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.380
 am a chef and a teacher 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.900
 cooking for 22 years and I propose you 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.030
 to teach you how to make a marinade 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.800
 special for the grill of the summer 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.930
 so to make this recipe we 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.720
 will need some sources of soy 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.680
 it's salty soy sauce I 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.670
 precise honey with an orange peel 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.219
 and peanut oil to make this 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.760
 recipe so the first step 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.770
 we will start by testing our orange 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.079
 with a hester micro planoise so 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.370
 like this in general when I do 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.200
 monkeys use it for meat 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.480
 laurent hunt marries well with 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.460
 lime meat with fish 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.809
 it gives a little taste there and more 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.750
 something natural 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.640
 so here I 'm going to finish 2nd this one 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.360
 so range here I collect 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.280
 delicately lowe's like this so 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.680
 the recipe was also very simple in 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.670
 done on the rule of three 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.150
 so here I m 3 tablespoons of 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.150
 soya sauce 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:21.330
 I have watched added six tablespoons 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:22.920
 oil one two three four five six 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.909
 we will not need to put salt 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.189
 because soy 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.619
 it is already salted so against him 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.820
 put a touch of honey and we will be 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.700
 on a half teaspoon 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.930
 so here we mix well together 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.420
 is your marinade is ready 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.340
 I invite you to use this marinade 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.259
 and marinate your meat or your fish 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.659
 for three days and well now 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.979
 you know how to prepare marinades for 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.979
 the barbecues or this summer
