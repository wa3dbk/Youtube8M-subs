00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.360
Good Afternoon.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.800
Could all the Catholics 
please raise their hands?

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.360
And the protestants?

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.560
The Muslims?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.360
The Buddhists?

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.600
Right, well I’m a “Pastafarian”. 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.200
All these religions
that we’ve just listed 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.280
have lead us into wars. 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.920
And those wars have triggered deaths. 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.720
And the fear of dying 
makes us have faith in religion. 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.280
It’s intriguing, isn’t it really? 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.320
There is someone who knows a lot about 
war, deaths and religion:

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.320
Bush.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.080
In the United States Bush realised 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.760
That his students were learning about
The theory of Evolution in Biology. 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.280
You know, Darwin, fossils, the idea 
that we came from monkeys 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.800
And he said, “No, no, 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.840
I think God came 
6,000 years ago 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.080
and created the Earth by hand,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.000
and that’s all that exists".

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.440
And he implemented that 
school teaching hours had to be shared 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.120
between Biology and Creationism,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.160
in which DNA and fossils
are used to evidence our faith.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.520
Listen.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.240
There was a Physics student, who said, 
“I’m going to propose a third option.”

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.120
This third option
has a clear scientific basis. 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.960
On the Y axis, 
the average global temperature.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.040
On the X axis,
the number of pirates.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.480
You can see that the fewer pirates, 
the higher the planet temperature is. 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.040
I have a scientific basis. 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.040
“This guy is crazy!” is he not.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.760
Pirates are the heavenly beings of the 
“Flying Spaghetti Monster”,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.960
my religion. 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.160
You’ll see some similarities 
with Creationism. 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.760
But you’ll have to go some to find them.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.680
Pastafarianism is placed

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.920
between the natural and supernatural. 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.520
Temperature, pirates.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.880
Ok?

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.240
The Creationism that Bush championed 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.360
is positioned between
the supernatural and the &lt;i&gt;retarded&lt;/i&gt;.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.840
You understand English, don’t you?

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.000
Thanks. 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.320
Ok.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.200
From this moment on,
we undoubtedly have a maker.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.440
The creator is
"The Flying Spaghetti Monster".

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.840
Him.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.680
It’s not his real name.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.560
His name is so lovely and long 
that whoever pronounces it will die.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.240
It was purely done for fun.

51
00:02:42,120 --&gt; 00:02:45,480
Just like other gods, he created 
the universe and the Earth. 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.320
None of this six days and then rested.
In 0.0628 seconds.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.240
And twice,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.720
because the first time he got drunk 
and forgot he had already made it.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.800
Once he saw the ground that he had, 
he said “I’ll make intelligent beings."

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.960
And he made the human being.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.200
Not in his image and likeness,
nor by chance. 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.640
And he said to them "you’ll be curious 
and want to know lots of things.”

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.680
Perfect.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.560
"I’m going to put this to the test 
to entertain you.”

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.400
For example, fossils. 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.760
Because I actually created the Universe, 
but have a laugh."

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.440
Perfect.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.240
Scientists love to waste time with 
fossils. 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.960
It is a religion,
and therefore has its commandments.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.320
There was a man
that climbed a mountain. 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.200
to meet the Flying Spaghetti Monster, 
my god, 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.160
and he gave him ten commandments.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.080
This man, inspired, came running down,  
broke and lost two. 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.960
and he said:
"oh well, those eight, who cares".

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.400
Among them,
the two most important are:

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.760
"Don’t spend money building temples 
to worship me, I’m not that vain.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.120
Use it to cure illnesses, 
battle against poverty and make love".

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.600
Make love is another commandment.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.200
With whoever you want,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.720
however and whenever you want,
provided there is consent.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.760
Fulfilling these two commandments
and another six just as stupid,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.120
you will find your way into the 
pastafarian heaven,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.640
that is made up of:

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.440
volcanoes of ice cold beer

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.960
and factories of &lt;i&gt;stripteasers&lt;/i&gt;.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.400
Amazing.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.160
From now on

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.920
neither being baptised nor voting
is necessary.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.200
¿Do you like pasta?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.320
¿Spaghetti, macaroni, tortellini?

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.200
¿Beer?

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.200
You’re already Pastafarians, 
you’ve made it.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.800
No obligations.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.720
To eat pasta and drink beer 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.920
Whenever you want. 
No pressure. 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.920
For whoever wants,
to be even more Pastafarian,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.040
on Fridays you can dress up as 
a pirate.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.600
And on the 19th of September,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.600
you can come together for the 
"International Talk Like a Pirate Day”.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.560
You’re all invited.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.640
Finally, please,
give it a go, try it out. 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.400
If you don’t like Pastafarianism, 
your old gods, probably, 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.040
will accept you once again
with open arms.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.680
Thanks a lot.
