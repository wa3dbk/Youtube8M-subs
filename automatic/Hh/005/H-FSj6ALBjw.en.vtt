couple stuff that you need is um Python
which<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> programming<00:00:38.460> language<00:00:38.850> that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
which is a programming language that

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.150 
which is a programming language that
will<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.960> will<00:00:39.989> need<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.469> run<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.890> an

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
will you will need to run on an

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.530 
will you will need to run on an
application<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.850> I'll<00:00:41.910> go<00:00:42.180> over<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.420> right

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
application and I'll go over it right

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.420 
application and I'll go over it right
now<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.930> PKM<00:00:43.739> file<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:45.379> PKM<00:00:46.379> file<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.980> basically

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
now a PKM file a PKM file is basically

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.729 
now a PKM file a PKM file is basically
what<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> computer<00:00:48.660> reads<00:00:48.899> as<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> pokemon<00:00:49.530> so

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
what the computer reads as a pokemon so

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.950 
what the computer reads as a pokemon so
the<00:00:50.190> Pokemon<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:51.059> stored<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.809> your

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the Pokemon that you have stored in your

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.650 
the Pokemon that you have stored in your
game<00:00:52.170> correspond<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.309> bit<00:00:53.550> PKM<00:00:54.120> file<00:00:54.360> for

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
game correspond to a bit PKM file for

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.099 
game correspond to a bit PKM file for
example<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.379> um<00:00:55.800> sorry<00:00:56.699> about<00:00:56.730> that

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
example this one is um sorry about that

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.319 
example this one is um sorry about that
this<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.129> heat<00:00:59.340> transfer<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
this one is the heat transfer the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.770 
this one is the heat transfer the
Pokemon<00:01:00.899> Ranger<00:01:01.140> 3<00:01:01.550> that<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.699> receive<00:01:03.059> from

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
Pokemon Ranger 3 that you receive from

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050 
Pokemon Ranger 3 that you receive from
the<00:01:03.989> mission<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.070> Japanese<00:01:05.580> Pokemon

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the mission then it's a Japanese Pokemon

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.200 
the mission then it's a Japanese Pokemon
so<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.350> from<00:01:07.500> an<00:01:07.619> event<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.670> instead<00:01:09.150> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so so this from an event so instead of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.429 
so so this from an event so instead of
having<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> game<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.170> get<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
having to have the game you can get it

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.830 
having to have the game you can get it
much<00:01:11.040> easier<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:12.000> couldn't<00:01:12.330> save<00:01:12.720> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
much easier so this couldn't save you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.030 
much easier so this couldn't save you
some<00:01:13.049> time<00:01:13.260> instead<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.619> having<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.860> go<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
some time instead of having to go to

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.789 
some time instead of having to go to
Toys<00:01:14.280> R<00:01:14.430> Us<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.939> game<00:01:15.600> stops<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.350> receive<00:01:16.710> an

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
Toys R Us and game stops to receive an

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.140 
Toys R Us and game stops to receive an
event<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.520> receive<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.850> through

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
event so you can just receive it through

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.390 
event so you can just receive it through
the<00:01:18.270> computer<00:01:18.540> much<00:01:19.530> faster<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.280> also

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the computer much faster you can also

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.060 
the computer much faster you can also
receive<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.659> event<00:01:21.960> sometimes<00:01:22.380> before<00:01:22.860> it

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
receive the event sometimes before it

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.969 
receive the event sometimes before it
even<00:01:23.250> comes<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.939> that's<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.320> pecan<00:01:25.740> farm

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
even comes out so that's a pecan farm

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.249 
even comes out so that's a pecan farm
I'll<00:01:26.189> go<00:01:26.400> over<00:01:26.520> right<00:01:27.000> now<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:28.049> them

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
I'll go over right now how to get them

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.980 
I'll go over right now how to get them
and<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.740> sudo<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:30.090> also<00:01:30.210> need<00:01:30.390> sudo<00:01:30.750> got

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and this is sudo you also need sudo got

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.499 
and this is sudo you also need sudo got
app<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.680> that's<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:32.549> application<00:01:33.270> that

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
app and that's an application that

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.210 
app and that's an application that
tricks<00:01:34.020> any<00:01:34.259> other<00:01:34.470> application<00:01:35.009> into

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
tricks any other application into

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.670 
tricks any other application into
thinking<00:01:35.610> you're<00:01:36.060> running<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.570> under<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> root

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
thinking you're running it under a root

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.190 
thinking you're running it under a root
user<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.250> administrative<00:01:38.970> privileges<00:01:39.210> I'll

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
user with administrative privileges I'll

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.940 
user with administrative privileges I'll
go<00:01:40.380> over<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.710> again<00:01:40.860> how<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.880> works<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
go over that again how that works and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.690 
go over that again how that works and
last<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.670> least<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.119> sent<00:01:45.689> PKM<00:01:46.259> that's

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
last but not least this sent PKM that's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700 
last but not least this sent PKM that's
an<00:01:47.700> application<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.600> will<00:01:49.079> actually<00:01:49.500> get

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
an application that will actually get

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.370 
an application that will actually get
the<00:01:49.979> dot<00:01:50.220> PKM<00:01:50.610> file<00:01:50.850> into<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.570> GPS<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.229> your

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the dot PKM file into the GPS in your

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.460 
the dot PKM file into the GPS in your
game<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.520> first<00:01:53.729> off<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.540> need<00:01:54.689> python<00:01:55.290> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
game so first off you need python and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.600 
game so first off you need python and
i'll<00:01:55.560> go<00:01:55.770> over<00:01:55.950> how<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.070> get<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.430> right<00:01:56.549> now

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
i'll go over how to get that right now

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:05.480 
i'll go over how to get that right now
of<00:01:56.820> course<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.210> head<00:01:57.509> over<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.780> Safari<00:02:04.490> here

go<00:04:27.690> like<00:04:27.720> that<00:04:28.020> dragon<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:28.770> drop<00:04:29.100> in<00:04:29.400> the

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
go like that dragon and drop in the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.060 
go like that dragon and drop in the
pseudo<00:04:30.530> shooter<00:04:31.530> will<00:04:31.680> open<00:04:31.980> up<00:04:33.830> okay<00:04:34.830> and

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
pseudo shooter will open up okay and

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.790 
pseudo shooter will open up okay and
then<00:04:35.550> you<00:04:36.180> pretty<00:04:36.720> much<00:04:36.840> put<00:04:37.140> in<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.530> password

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
then you pretty much put in the password

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.180 
then you pretty much put in the password
for<00:04:38.190> your<00:04:38.340> group<00:04:38.580> for<00:04:39.320> your<00:04:40.320> root<00:04:40.530> account<00:04:40.770> so

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
for your group for your root account so

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.550 
for your group for your root account so
after<00:04:41.640> you<00:04:41.730> do<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:41.990> terminal<00:04:42.990> will<00:04:43.110> open<00:04:43.410> up

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
after you do that terminal will open up

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.860 
after you do that terminal will open up
