but I say what did what that does when

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.870 
but I say what did what that does when
you<00:01:10.920> finalize<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:13.189> puts<00:01:14.189> information<00:01:14.729> that

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you finalize that puts information that

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.399 
you finalize that puts information that

those<00:01:38.130> cover<00:01:38.340> edges<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.299> actually

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
those cover edges you have to actually

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.140 
those cover edges you have to actually
go<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:40.049> mentioned<00:01:40.500> draw<00:01:40.650> cover<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:42.060> have

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
go to have mentioned draw cover you have

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.149 
go to have mentioned draw cover you have
a<00:01:42.210> look<00:01:42.329> at<00:01:42.450> these<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:44.009> this

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
a look at these you have to do this

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.219 
a look at these you have to do this
because<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.490> tells<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> AI<00:01:45.329> where<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.079> can

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
because this tells the AI where it can

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.170 
because this tells the AI where it can
hide<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:47.689> you<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:49.290> attacks<00:01:49.619> or<00:01:49.860> whatever

hide to you know do attacks or whatever
the<00:01:51.180> blue<00:01:51.390> ones<00:01:51.630> are<00:01:51.990> where<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.829> or<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> AI

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the blue ones are where you or the AI

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.789 
the blue ones are where you or the AI
can<00:01:53.970> crouch<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> white<00:01:54.930> wall<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.500> one

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
can crouch and the white wall is one

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.639 
can crouch and the white wall is one
hundred<00:01:55.860> percent<00:01:56.040> cover<00:01:56.579> basically<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:58.380> get

here's your pathing testing i'm going to
use<00:02:22.230> just<00:02:22.740> standard<00:02:23.360> agne<00:02:24.830> why<00:02:25.830> not<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.510> i<00:02:28.020> can

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
use just standard agne why not so i can

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.700 
use just standard agne why not so i can
do<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> display<00:02:29.010> overlay<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.030> so

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
do the display overlay and this is so

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.530 
do the display overlay and this is so
essentially<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.860> everything<00:02:32.340> looks<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:33.150> i

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
essentially that everything looks like i

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.210 
essentially that everything looks like i
can<00:02:33.980> go<00:02:34.980> over<00:02:35.190> top<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:36.570> know<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.220> npc

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
can go over top you know that the npc

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.670 
can go over top you know that the npc
should<00:02:38.580> be<00:02:38.730> able<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.150> traverse<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.590> whole

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
should be able to traverse the whole

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.730 
should be able to traverse the whole
area<00:02:40.980> now<00:02:41.520> test<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.120> once<00:02:42.780> I've<00:02:42.990> selected<00:02:43.440> my
