00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:14.710
 very well what happened to you because you had 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:17.890
 that from now atrophied 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.020
 so I had a doctor like irak and 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.900
 had a problem that the teeth were 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.349
 I felt I think recent from below for 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.349
 ahead 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.630
 I had the upper back 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.590
 I had been trying to fix for a while 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.150
 I went to different opinions and I did not 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.980
 I was convinced of the solution as 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.130
 Greece or when I came to talk to 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.690
 you and then we talk 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.110
 and that could be solved in a way 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.970
 relatively simple the problem of 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.920
 inclusion when I tried to solve 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.079
 the problem that he has identified towards 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.609
 from four to five years 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.649
 and the solution that had been given 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.570
 originally it was to get my teeth 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.800
 to align it in the mouth 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.080
 my intuition was to think that it was not 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.720
 adequate then it was when it comes here 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.670
 to the green clinic so they gave me 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.400
 opinion a little rasa then the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.680
 explanation that was given to me was the one that 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.990
 convinced to be able to operate and that such 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.420
 jordi the fact of altering without 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.350
 autonomy three days with another ex 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.350
 practically 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.790
 I have no problem, none 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.550
 now they are now is when I start 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.860
 the orthodontic period to fix it 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.540
 and the most important thing has been done and I 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.670
 I think now it's fixing it with auto 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.320
 the intervention when one thinks the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.310
 intervention is a little bulky 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.010
 but then it was an intervention 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.910
 simple was less time than what 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.770
 I thought 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.730
 he recovers that in a quick way indeed 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.680
 only four days ago I had surgery and 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.510
 we are here talking, no problem is 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.830
 this weekend going out until 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.620
 the new one has been or is is very 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.040
 showy when one knows but after 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.940
 you realize that you are not easy 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.940
 inside the cable 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.760
 and how would you rate the process satisfied 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.800
 with the absolute total and not yet 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.710
 the process ends but it is totally for 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.300
 how fast it has been for the goal and 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.740
 because when you have to do 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.510
 things are done well and they are made direct 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.090
 you have to think about the process you have to 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.440
 think the result and I'm super 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.440
 satisfied of everyone's function
