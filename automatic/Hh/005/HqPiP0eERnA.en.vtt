so<00:01:32.870> I<00:01:32.900> think<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:33.320> fair<00:01:33.620> to<00:01:33.650> say<00:01:33.800> that<00:01:34.220> these

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
so I think it's fair to say that these

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.660 
so I think it's fair to say that these
rankings<00:01:35.450> are<00:01:35.890> tremendously<00:01:36.890> important<00:01:37.490> and

they're<00:01:38.120> clearly<00:01:38.510> influential<00:01:39.320> on<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.860> way

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
they're clearly influential on the way

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.500 
they're clearly influential on the way
that<00:01:40.220> families<00:01:40.580> are<00:01:40.610> making<00:01:40.970> decisions<00:01:41.090> about
