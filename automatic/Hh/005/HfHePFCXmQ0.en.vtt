piece for example was the call I put it

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.490 
piece for example was the call I put it
on<00:01:21.200> right<00:01:21.440> like<00:01:21.620> this<00:01:21.800> like<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.010> sandwich<00:01:23.410> and<00:01:24.410> I

on right like this like a sandwich and I
would<00:01:24.590> start<00:01:24.830> clamping<00:01:25.490> here<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:25.820> here<00:01:26.150> what

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
would start clamping here and here what

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.910 
would start clamping here and here what
it's<00:01:27.020> gonna<00:01:27.140> do<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.410> it's<00:01:27.440> gonna<00:01:27.590> make<00:01:27.800> sure

that veneer is nice and flat on the
headstock<00:01:30.160> that'll<00:01:31.160> also<00:01:31.280> give<00:01:31.430> me<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.670> little

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
headstock that'll also give me a little

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.160 
headstock that'll also give me a little
bit<00:01:31.970> of<00:01:32.090> continuity<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:32.690> headstock<00:01:33.140> is

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
bit of continuity to the headstock is

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.420 
bit of continuity to the headstock is
made<00:01:33.410> out<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.590> four<00:01:33.800> pieces<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.250> looks<00:01:34.370> a

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430

the<00:01:49.130> glue<00:01:49.250> because<00:01:49.520> when<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:49.700> cut<00:01:49.850> this

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
the glue because when you cut this

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.120 
the glue because when you cut this
profile<00:01:50.330> and<00:01:50.570> notice<00:01:50.780> them<00:01:50.950> I'll<00:01:51.950> put<00:01:52.070> the

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
profile and notice them I'll put the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.760 
profile and notice them I'll put the
call<00:01:52.310> on<00:01:52.340> put<00:01:53.210> some<00:01:53.360> clamps<00:01:53.630> on<00:01:53.750> there<00:01:53.960> and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
call on put some clamps on there and

Park<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:27.010> right<00:03:27.220> up<00:03:27.370> against<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.760> edge<00:03:27.819> of<00:03:27.940> the

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
Park it right up against the edge of the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.110 
Park it right up against the edge of the
fretboard<00:03:28.150> like<00:03:28.600> that<00:03:29.940> give<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.090> little

fretboard like that give it a little

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.879 
fretboard like that give it a little
slide<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.930> make<00:03:35.079> sure<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.350> glue<00:03:35.530> is<00:03:35.650> kind<00:03:35.859> of

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
slide so make sure the glue is kind of

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.599 
slide so make sure the glue is kind of
distributed<00:03:36.430> on<00:03:36.549> there<00:03:36.760> really<00:03:36.880> good<00:03:38.609> so

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
distributed on there really good so

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
again I'm gonna put it right up to the

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:41.849 
again I'm gonna put it right up to the
edge<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:40.780> my<00:03:40.900> fretboard<00:03:41.319> make<00:03:41.470> sure<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.680> stay

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
edge of my fretboard make sure to stay

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.690 
edge of my fretboard make sure to stay
is<00:03:41.980> there<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.780> take<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.019> sheet<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.260> wax<00:03:44.470> paper

cover<00:03:48.700> this<00:03:54.690> glue<00:03:55.690> around<00:03:55.959> there<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.440> watch

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
cover this glue around there and watch

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.589 
cover this glue around there and watch
with<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:56.889> wax<00:03:57.040> paper<00:03:57.280> so<00:04:00.060> get<00:04:01.060> my<00:04:01.150> wax<00:04:01.329> paper

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
with the wax paper so get my wax paper

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.790 
with the wax paper so get my wax paper
going<00:04:01.900> on<00:04:02.139> there

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
up seeing it a little bit anyway so get

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.229 
up seeing it a little bit anyway so get
this<00:04:20.220> I'm<00:04:20.489> gonna<00:04:20.580> get<00:04:20.730> really<00:04:20.850> really<00:04:20.940> close

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
this I'm gonna get really really close

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.160 
this I'm gonna get really really close
because<00:04:21.390> I<00:04:21.540> don't<00:04:21.660> know<00:04:21.750> another<00:04:22.020> little

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
because I don't know another little

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.100 
because I don't know another little
clamping<00:04:22.590> call<00:04:22.770> in<00:04:22.920> here<00:04:23.340> where<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.240> I<00:04:24.510> know

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
clamping call in here where the I know

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.480 
clamping call in here where the I know
it's<00:04:25.260> hard<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.470> see<00:04:25.650> but<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:25.980> got<00:04:26.310> another

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
it's hard to see but I got another

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.680 
it's hard to see but I got another
little<00:04:26.640> clamping<00:04:27.000> call<00:04:27.150> that's<00:04:27.330> in<00:04:27.450> here

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
little clamping call that's in here

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.970 
little clamping call that's in here
because<00:04:27.870> there's<00:04:28.170> actually<00:04:28.440> just<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.650> little

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
because there's actually just a little

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.070 
because there's actually just a little
bit<00:04:29.100> of<00:04:29.160> a<00:04:29.250> bend<00:04:29.400> over<00:04:29.730> from<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.660> face<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:30.990> the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
bit of a bend over from the face of the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.630 
bit of a bend over from the face of the
neck<00:04:31.230> to<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.800> edge<00:04:31.890> of<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.070> fretboard<00:04:32.160> just<00:04:32.550> a

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
neck to the edge of the fretboard just a

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.150 
neck to the edge of the fretboard just a
tiny<00:04:32.970> tiny<00:04:33.300> one<00:04:33.600> so<00:04:34.500> what<00:04:34.620> I'm<00:04:34.710> gonna<00:04:34.830> wind<00:04:35.070> up

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
tiny tiny one so what I'm gonna wind up

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.620 
tiny tiny one so what I'm gonna wind up
doing<00:04:35.340> is<00:04:35.580> putting<00:04:35.760> another<00:04:35.970> clamping<00:04:36.360> column

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
doing is putting another clamping column

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.520 
doing is putting another clamping column
there<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:37.440> holds<00:04:37.710> that<00:04:37.830> down<00:04:39.230> so<00:04:40.230> just<00:04:40.380> gonna

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
there that holds that down so just gonna

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:48.350 
there that holds that down so just gonna
take<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.710> couple<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.130> our<00:04:41.340> clamps<00:04:47.210> put<00:04:48.210> these

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
take a couple of our clamps put these

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:57.230 
take a couple of our clamps put these
guys<00:04:48.540> on<00:04:54.830> again<00:04:55.830> go<00:04:56.340> kind<00:04:56.580> of<00:04:56.670> loose<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:57.000> first

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
guys on again go kind of loose it first

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:08.030 
guys on again go kind of loose it first
a<00:05:05.600> little<00:05:06.600> bit<00:05:06.690> loose<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:07.020> person<00:05:07.470> just<00:05:07.800> to<00:05:07.890> make

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
a little bit loose a person just to make

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.670 
a little bit loose a person just to make
sure<00:05:08.070> everything<00:05:08.580> stays<00:05:08.850> on<00:05:09.030> there<00:05:09.180> straight

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
sure everything stays on there straight

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.840 
sure everything stays on there straight
you<00:05:10.680> can<00:05:10.800> kind<00:05:10.980> of<00:05:11.010> come<00:05:11.190> back<00:05:11.370> down<00:05:11.580> with<00:05:11.700> more

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
you can kind of come back down with more

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.690 
you can kind of come back down with more
clamping<00:05:12.270> pressure<00:05:12.300> at<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:12.780> end<00:05:13.640> all<00:05:14.640> right

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
clamping pressure at the end all right

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.760 
clamping pressure at the end all right
so<00:05:14.940> I<00:05:14.970> got<00:05:15.090> these<00:05:15.240> on<00:05:15.540> there<00:05:15.870> looks<00:05:16.500> like<00:05:16.560> it's

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
so I got these on there looks like it's

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.490 
so I got these on there looks like it's
pretty<00:05:16.950> even<00:05:17.960> give<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.020> a<00:05:19.110> little<00:05:19.290> bit<00:05:19.410> of<00:05:19.470> a

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
pretty even give it a little bit of a

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.310 
pretty even give it a little bit of a
little<00:05:19.890> bit<00:05:19.980> of<00:05:20.070> pressure<00:05:20.250> here

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.300 

all<00:05:25.320> right<00:05:25.440> I'm<00:05:25.530> hanging<00:05:25.770> over<00:05:25.920> by<00:05:26.040> just<00:05:26.220> a

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
all right I'm hanging over by just a

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.860 
all right I'm hanging over by just a
shave<00:05:27.170> it's<00:05:28.170> not<00:05:28.350> the<00:05:28.470> end<00:05:28.560> of<00:05:28.590> the<00:05:28.680> world<00:05:29.870> and

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
shave it's not the end of the world and

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.060 
shave it's not the end of the world and
I'm<00:05:30.990> gonna<00:05:31.080> come<00:05:31.290> back<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:31.650> throw<00:05:31.800> some<00:05:31.980> of

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
I'm gonna come back and throw some of

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.030 
I'm gonna come back and throw some of
these<00:05:32.160> guys<00:05:32.460> on<00:05:33.500> just<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.590> make<00:05:34.740> sure<00:05:34.770> that

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
these guys on just to make sure that

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.670 
these guys on just to make sure that
that<00:05:35.390> again<00:05:36.390> the<00:05:36.540> pressure<00:05:36.720> from<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.080> call<00:05:37.320> is

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
that again the pressure from the call is

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:51.290 
that again the pressure from the call is
distributed<00:05:38.490> evenly<00:05:49.940> because<00:05:50.940> again<00:05:51.120> with

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
distributed evenly because again with

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.870 
distributed evenly because again with
veneer<00:05:51.660> especially<00:05:52.230> there's<00:05:53.130> a<00:05:53.220> gap<00:05:53.490> the

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
veneer especially there's a gap the

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.240 
veneer especially there's a gap the
veneer<00:05:54.090> is<00:05:54.180> so<00:05:54.330> thin<00:05:54.660> that<00:05:55.620> if<00:05:55.770> there's<00:05:55.950> a<00:05:56.010> gap

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
veneer is so thin that if there's a gap

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.450 
veneer is so thin that if there's a gap
it's<00:05:56.520> gonna<00:05:56.610> be<00:05:56.790> really<00:05:57.120> really<00:05:57.300> obvious<00:05:58.460> so

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
it's gonna be really really obvious so

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.950 
it's gonna be really really obvious so
it's<00:05:59.550> best<00:05:59.760> just<00:05:59.850> to<00:06:00.030> get<00:06:00.240> a<00:06:00.270> lot<00:06:00.450> of<00:06:00.480> clamps<00:06:00.840> on

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
it's best just to get a lot of clamps on

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.730 
it's best just to get a lot of clamps on
there<00:06:01.170> even<00:06:01.470> if<00:06:01.620> you<00:06:01.680> use<00:06:01.830> a<00:06:01.860> few<00:06:02.100> extra

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
there even if you use a few extra

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.339 
there even if you use a few extra
doesn't<00:06:04.039> matter<00:06:04.690> so<00:06:05.690> now<00:06:05.810> what<00:06:05.930> I've<00:06:06.050> got<00:06:06.080> is

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
doesn't matter so now what I've got is

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:07.689 
doesn't matter so now what I've got is
my<00:06:06.470> other<00:06:06.590> little<00:06:06.800> clamping<00:06:07.190> call<00:06:07.370> it's<00:06:07.669> going

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
my other little clamping call it's going

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:13.050 
my other little clamping call it's going
to<00:06:07.819> hold<00:06:08.000> this<00:06:08.150> guy<00:06:08.389> down<00:06:08.599> right<00:06:08.630> here<00:06:09.289> and

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.360 

we'll<00:06:14.060> go<00:06:14.180> ahead<00:06:14.240> and<00:06:14.389> put<00:06:14.539> that<00:06:14.569> on<00:06:14.750> and<00:06:15.370> get

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
we'll go ahead and put that on and get

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:25.140 
we'll go ahead and put that on and get
it<00:06:16.460> all<00:06:16.580> clamped<00:06:16.910> up

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.210 

you
