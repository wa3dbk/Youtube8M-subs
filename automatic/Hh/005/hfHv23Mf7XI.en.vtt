00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.570
 hello friends of this occasion we are going to 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.910
 present a computer simulator 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.539
 this simulator what he is going to do is 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.240
 simulate different signals 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.039
 computers to be able to check 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.590
 the state of them 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.439
 here what we are going to observe is 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.019
 the following of which components consists 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.450
 the simulator this time we're going to 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.500
 check a computer that is going to be 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.810
 for a pointer 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.690
 this is a pointer that will handle a 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.829
 immobilizer system then you must 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.530
 be present the computer the key and 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.870
 right now the immobilizer module 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.820
 we will describe the detail simply 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.660
 I want you to see that he is connected 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.260
 the computer in modules to the simulator 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.940
 this by assumptions through cables 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.480
 let's see now what the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.480
 simulator 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.300
 the simulator consists 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.610
 from a touch screen to where we 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.200
 we can select the different 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.000
 computers that at any given time 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.340
 let's go to review it will also include 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.490
 with a platform where we 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.760
 we can verify the activation of the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.400
 negative pulses of coils 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.620
 positive pulses of coils 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.630
 jack valve controls that would be 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.550
 in this case four cables for the most 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.130
 common and if it was one or two cables 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.260
 Well, we only use these two the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 relay control in this case is 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.430
 the automatic stoppage of the pump 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.380
 High and low fan controls 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.530
 speed 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.960
 the earth outputs of the computer 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.260
 to the same simulator or to the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.450
 sensors the supply voltage of 5 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.400
 bags or in this case some 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.890
 computers that are going to have a voltage 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.630
 of 9 volts for some sensors and 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.340
 others are going to have control of 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.739
 advance of time that in this case would be 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.590
 the line is for the control of the field of 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.239
 alternator and check light but something 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.000
 additional that has this built-in 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.239
 simulator is to have an output control 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.670
 of voltage separated from the computer is 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.100
 say that if the computer were of 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.380
 some time the source of 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.540
 internal power we can 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.180
 take five bags from here and they are 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.700
 we connect to the exit of the source 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.130
 we can also do it with 12 volts or 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.010
 with earth 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.690
 to see the most complete performance of 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.350
 this computer will be the following 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.350
 tests 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.310
 and it's to be able to check a 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.470
 computer is necessary that we do the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.870
 respective connections the simulator 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.120
 has three connectors this will be a 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.180
 connector one for controls coils e 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.879
 injectors the connector two for output 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.170
 of sensors and connector 3 for the 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.180
 power input is to the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.879
 computer and valve control 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.280
 jack but also it will also connect 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.230
 with a 99 or have a 99 where 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.290
 we can connect the scanner and 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.420
 be monitoring in real time how 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.950
 the same computer is behaving 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.989
 once we have 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.940
 identified these three connectors or 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.170
 these four connectors let's do the 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.170
 next connection 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.769
 well the next test is performance 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.840
 of a pointer's computer like what 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.890
 we mentioned the simulator has its 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.950
 connections on the side so that 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.109
 work needs a power to 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.180
 this is going to have the source for 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.060
 turn on the same simulator they are already 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.150
 made the connections respectively of 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.579
 the three must 37 this time we have 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.280
 connected here an immobilizer module 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.650
 from a pointer the key in it 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.689
 computer the next test that 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.299
 we are going to do is select the 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:17.439
 type of vehicle to be able to do that 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.439
 operate the computer 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.470
 very well once the connections are made 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.530
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.050
 feed the simulator once it is 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.680
 is fed let's look at the 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.900
 screen 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.449
 what will it look like to where it says test 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.580
 of the eco and test delta test tag 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.919
 that is one his future so we're going to 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.660
 do a test to the engine echo a 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.400
 Once we have selected we are going to 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.080
 appear the different brands of 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.259
 computers with which we can 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.590
 work here we will start with chevrolet 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.389
 then immediately follows kreisler and 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.090
 example if we left with kreider 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.810
 let's see who has 60 computers 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.660
 pins that is one of a cm of 80 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.300
 unai and tec pins that would be the three 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.120
 Cherokees connectors or versions 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.520
 of nfc in this case the proof that 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.430
 we are going to execute now is going to 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.199
 be for a pointer therefore what 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.690
 we are going to have to do is what 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.220
 next we will look for the line of 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.490
 mounting 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.890
 there's the renault opel and we're going to 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.660
 the line of volkswagen on the line 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.750
 volkswagen we will have for the 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.030
 versions v of 1 and man of 2 as 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.860
 we are going to check and this is 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.650
 classified because I get a connector 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.770
 of 16 pins inside a DVD version 2 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.110
 I see the computer options 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.470
 that I can check 1.8 for versions 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.260
 turbo of a 4 the engine 2 liters for the 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.720
 line of 4 and then we have the 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.370
 pointer version in the case of pointer 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.380
 once I have selected I will 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.480
 I can also modify the revolutions 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.810
 here we are going to have that is a 1.8 engine 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.870
 is scheduled to start at 951 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.790
 revolutions and I put him to accept or in 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.400
 a given moment if I want to modify 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:13.300
 those revolutions and I can put that 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.760
 I want it to start at 895 at that moment 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.070
 I will start and we will observe 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.140
 now like all the components in this 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.169
 case coils injectors and control of 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.480
 the valve as they start to work 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.870
 with that form we determine if 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.880
 that computer this function 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.650
 if at any given time I would like to do 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.470
 a test to determine that a 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.840
 I work a plug injector where 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.210
 I can connect it to take the 12 volts 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.600
 Power of the external platform 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.610
 and I check each one of the outputs of 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.560
 the injectors also the same can 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.720
 do for the coil or the controls of 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.940
 the jack valve here we can observe 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.150
 that the pump relay is parked 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.520
 permanently in the case of the 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.340
 feed towards the sensors we have 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.980
 5 balls and if there is an earth leakage 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.870
 towards sensors with that we verify the 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.640
 state of the same computer and 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.660
 determining that if it is working 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:12.780
 appropriate form or not this computer and 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.450
 we know that it is working in without 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.310
 any problem now this simulator me 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.670
 will serve with the initial platform 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:24.230
 to check 65 computers from the 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.230
 brands that we saw a moment ago
