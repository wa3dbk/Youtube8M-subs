00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
in the back of the map I believe it was

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.679 
in the back of the map I believe it was
interchange<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> sniper<00:01:40.920> rifle<00:01:41.630> for<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
interchange with a sniper rifle for the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.399 
interchange with a sniper rifle for the
entire<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.770> entire<00:01:44.780> gameplay<00:01:45.780> three<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
entire the entire gameplay three and a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.620 
entire the entire gameplay three and a
half<00:01:46.560> four<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.610> half<00:01:47.670> minutes<00:01:48.000> again<00:01:48.420> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
half four and a half minutes again that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.080 
half four and a half minutes again that
was<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.750> about<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> length<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.100> only<00:01:50.759> time

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
was the about the length the only time

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.609 
was the about the length the only time
the<00:01:51.689> only<00:01:51.720> time<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:53.869> this<00:01:54.869> person<00:01:55.350> was<00:01:55.500> not

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
the only time that this person was not

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.580 
the only time that this person was not
laying<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> back<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> map<00:01:57.380> was<00:01:58.380> when

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
laying in the back of the map was when

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.410 
laying in the back of the map was when
they<00:01:58.740> were<00:01:58.799> running<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.880> from<00:02:00.149> their

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
they were running to and from their

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.709 
they were running to and from their
spawn<00:02:00.750> or<00:02:01.530> from<00:02:02.130> their<00:02:02.369> spawn<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.540> think

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
spawn or from their spawn and I think

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.230 
spawn or from their spawn and I think
they<00:02:03.810> only<00:02:03.840> died<00:02:04.229> once<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> there<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.759> only<00:02:05.909> one

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
they only died once so there is only one

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
they only died once so there is only one
instance<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.740> obviously<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
instance and and obviously at the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.410 
instance and and obviously at the
beginning<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.879> gameplay<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.330> two

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
beginning of the gameplay so two

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.199 
beginning of the gameplay so two
instances<00:02:10.229> where<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.649> person<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.250> number

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
