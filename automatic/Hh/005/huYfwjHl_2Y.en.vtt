00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
probably my point of view a logical
standpoint<00:01:53.009> would<00:01:53.280> tell<00:01:53.520> me<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.210> does<00:01:54.450> not

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
standpoint would tell me it does not

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.090 
standpoint would tell me it does not
mean<00:01:54.899> they're<00:01:55.140> getting<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.530> friend<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.009> is

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
mean they're getting a friend that is

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.240 
mean they're getting a friend that is
just<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.430> refer<00:01:57.500> maybe<00:01:58.500> they<00:01:58.680> are<00:01:58.829> made<00:01:59.070> they

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
just a refer maybe they are made they

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.300 
just a refer maybe they are made they
are<00:01:59.430> will<00:01:59.670> find<00:01:59.969> out<00:02:00.149> as<00:02:00.390> time<00:02:00.750> goes<00:02:00.780> along<00:02:01.399> now

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
are will find out as time goes along now

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.370 
are will find out as time goes along now
it's<00:02:03.939> a<00:02:04.090> awesome<00:02:04.329> that<00:02:04.840> they<00:02:04.960> are<00:02:05.049> making

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
it's a awesome that they are making

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.020 
it's a awesome that they are making
these<00:02:05.470> tens<00:02:05.740> but<00:02:05.920> in<00:02:06.040> my<00:02:06.159> opinion<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.700> think<00:02:06.729> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
these tens but in my opinion I think the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.940 
these tens but in my opinion I think the
first<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.450> 10<00:02:07.659> should<00:02:07.930> have<00:02:08.020> been<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.380> big<00:02:08.739> guy

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
first to 10 should have been a big guy

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.300 
first to 10 should have been a big guy
and<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.759> mega<00:02:10.119> Lincoln<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:10.989> if<00:02:11.560> not<00:02:11.770> mega<00:02:12.099> lo

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
and a mega Lincoln and if not mega lo
