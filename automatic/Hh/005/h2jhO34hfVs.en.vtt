00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.240 
dangerous that kind of loop they gave to
me<00:03:59.300> and<00:04:00.610> later<00:04:01.610> I<00:04:01.790> was<00:04:02.090> back<00:04:02.150> here<00:04:02.570> I<00:04:03.010> was<00:04:04.010> was

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
me and later I was back here I was was

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.080 
me and later I was back here I was was
on<00:04:04.459> other<00:04:04.580> games<00:04:05.140> so<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.500> don't<00:04:06.800> know<00:04:06.860> if<00:04:07.160> the

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
on other games so I don't know if the

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.449 
on other games so I don't know if the
reality<00:04:08.660> is<00:04:09.200> that<00:04:10.190> wiring<00:04:10.880> kind<00:04:11.810> of<00:04:12.459> machine

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
reality is that wiring kind of machine

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.080 
reality is that wiring kind of machine
like<00:04:13.760> matrix<00:04:14.239> or<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:15.370> computer<00:04:16.370> simulation<00:04:16.579> I

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
like matrix or a computer simulation I

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.870 
like matrix or a computer simulation I
like<00:04:17.450> my<00:04:17.660> other<00:04:17.840> video<00:04:20.200> core<00:04:21.200> we<00:04:21.650> are<00:04:21.880> playing

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
like my other video core we are playing

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.040 
like my other video core we are playing
a<00:04:23.210> game<00:04:23.510> like<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:25.490> sims<00:04:27.160> immerse<00:04:28.160> down<00:04:28.640> this

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
a game like the sims immerse down this

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.510 
a game like the sims immerse down this

this game cookson world life for us to
play<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:38.060> maybe<00:04:38.780> 20<00:04:39.680> we<00:04:40.100> are<00:04:40.280> in<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.640> machine

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
play and maybe 20 we are in the machine

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.370

place was not on earth was in orbit I
kind<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.730> saw<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:56.360> too<00:04:58.240> thank<00:04:59.240> for<00:04:59.510> watching
