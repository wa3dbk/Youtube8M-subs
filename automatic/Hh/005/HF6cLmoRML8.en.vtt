this is this is an easy level that we
haven't<00:00:07.859> done<00:00:08.069> below<00:00:08.820> it's<00:00:09.000> incredibly

glitchy<00:00:09.870> as<00:00:10.170> well<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.950> let's<00:00:11.269> try<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.860> it's<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
really and she's repeating the pose

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.569 
really and she's repeating the pose
alright<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.290> basically<00:00:40.440> yeah<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.340> raced

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.900 
alright so basically yeah we raced
Angelica<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> kitchen<00:00:42.870> although<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
Angelica to the kitchen although it's a

00:00:43.910 --> 00:01:00.650 
Angelica to the kitchen although it's a
very<00:00:44.910> arbitrary<00:00:45.620> stop<00:00:55.760> what<00:00:59.539> we're<00:01:00.539> supposed

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
very arbitrary stop what we're supposed

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.060 
very arbitrary stop what we're supposed
to<00:01:00.930> start<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> room<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.590> were<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
to start in the room we were in and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.800 
to start in the room we were in and
apparently<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.700> computer<00:01:06.210> thinks<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.630> should

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
apparently the computer thinks we should

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.109 
apparently the computer thinks we should
still<00:01:07.140> be<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.650> room<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.159> she's<00:01:08.460> trying<00:01:08.820> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
still be in that room so she's trying to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.140 
still be in that room so she's trying to
run<00:01:09.360> towards<00:01:10.110> it

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
run towards it

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:37.580 
run towards it
instead<00:01:12.260> we<00:01:13.260> start<00:01:13.650> here

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.920 

okay<00:01:38.590> whatever<00:01:39.360> okay<00:01:40.360> this<00:01:40.510> is<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.780> much

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930

household yeah I'm very confused the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.090 
household yeah I'm very confused the
game<00:02:00.040> is<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.430> glittery<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:01.570> I<00:02:02.290> guess<00:02:02.650> whether

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
game is so glittery and I guess whether

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.660 
game is so glittery and I guess whether
we're<00:02:03.340> winners

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
we're winners

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:15.690
