putting in extra time and really just

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.780 
putting in extra time and really just
trying<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.290> learn<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:42.070> utmost<00:02:42.430> degree

that<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.180> can<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.570> think<00:02:43.750> that's<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.990> process<00:02:44.530> of

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
that I can I think that's the process of

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.040 
that I can I think that's the process of
where<00:02:44.709> I'm<00:02:44.800> still<00:02:44.980> add<00:02:45.100> I'm<00:02:45.220> still<00:02:45.400> learning

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
where I'm still add I'm still learning

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.449 
where I'm still add I'm still learning
it's<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.110> big<00:02:47.350> jump<00:02:47.620> for<00:02:47.800> me<00:02:47.920> coming<00:02:48.160> from<00:02:48.280> what

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
it's a big jump for me coming from what

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.880 
it's a big jump for me coming from what
I<00:02:48.490> did<00:02:48.700> into<00:02:48.880> college<00:02:49.180> until<00:02:49.330> map<00:02:49.630> there's<00:02:50.590> no

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
I did into college until map there's no

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.949 
I did into college until map there's no
there's<00:02:51.459> no<00:02:51.550> denying<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.510> for<00:02:52.840> me

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
there's no denying that and for me

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.020 
there's no denying that and for me
really<00:02:53.200> just<00:02:53.860> continuing<00:02:54.280> develop<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.820> what<00:02:55.000> I
