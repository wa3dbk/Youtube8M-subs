in a previous video I shared with you
some<00:00:07.529> tips<00:00:08.069> on<00:00:08.389> installing<00:00:09.389> new<00:00:10.170> seals<00:00:10.500> in

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
some tips on installing new seals in

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.850 
some tips on installing new seals in
your<00:00:10.830> engine<00:00:11.250> transmission<00:00:11.730> or<00:00:12.389> rear-end<00:00:12.860> but

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
your engine transmission or rear-end but

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.519 
your engine transmission or rear-end but
I<00:00:14.070> realized<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.179> fail<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.630> mention<00:00:15.660> how<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.230> get

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
I realized I fail to mention how you get

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.859 
I realized I fail to mention how you get
them<00:00:16.680> out<00:00:16.830> now<00:00:17.400> getting<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.940> seals<00:00:18.210> out<00:00:18.449> is

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
them out now getting the seals out is

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.650 
them out now getting the seals out is
not<00:00:19.080> as<00:00:19.350> perilous<00:00:19.859> as<00:00:19.920> putting<00:00:20.520> them<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.910> but

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
not as perilous as putting them in but

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.330 
not as perilous as putting them in but
still<00:00:21.930> there's<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.199> couple<00:00:22.500> tricks<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.160> few

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
still there's a couple tricks and a few

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.859 
still there's a couple tricks and a few
tools<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.760> might<00:00:23.939> need<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.420> get<00:00:24.600> them<00:00:24.779> out

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
tools you might need to get them out

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.950 
tools you might need to get them out
properly<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.670> use<00:00:26.670> two<00:00:26.970> tools<00:00:27.240> depending<00:00:27.630> upon

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
properly I use two tools depending upon

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.320 
properly I use two tools depending upon
the<00:00:28.230> situation<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.980> first<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.820> tool<00:00:30.150> like

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the situation the first is a tool like

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.749 
the situation the first is a tool like
this<00:00:30.390> which<00:00:30.960> will<00:00:31.140> allow<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.800> go<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
this which will allow you to go in and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.830 
this which will allow you to go in and
pry<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.809> tool<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.940> some<00:00:36.210> cases<00:00:36.540> you

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
pry the tool out and in some cases you

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.380 
pry the tool out and in some cases you
may<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.890> room<00:00:38.129> or<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.550> may<00:00:38.940> want<00:00:39.239> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
may not have the room or you may want to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.389 
may not have the room or you may want to
protect<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> housing<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:40.649> pry<00:00:40.980> against

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
protect the housing and not pry against

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.479 
protect the housing and not pry against
it<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.149> case<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.809> use<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.710> tool<00:00:44.040> here

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it in that case I use this tool here

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.600 
it in that case I use this tool here
which<00:00:44.850> uses<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> hammer<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.680> kind<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.039> slide

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
which uses a hammer to kind of slide

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.720 
which uses a hammer to kind of slide
pull<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.450> seal<00:00:48.750> out<00:00:49.079> let<00:00:50.010> me<00:00:50.100> use<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.489> rear

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
pull the seal out let me use this rear

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.189 
pull the seal out let me use this rear
end<00:00:50.760> now<00:00:51.120> I'm<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> take<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> rear<00:00:52.020> end

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
end now I'm going to take the rear end

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.420 
end now I'm going to take the rear end
I'm<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.500> going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> pull<00:00:52.890> these<00:00:53.039> seals<00:00:53.280> out

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
I'm not going to pull these seals out

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.740 
I'm not going to pull these seals out
because<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.730> need<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.969> leave<00:00:54.270> them<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.570> there

move it to a couple different locations

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.560 
move it to a couple different locations
and<00:01:34.530> finally<00:01:35.490> you'll<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.670> able<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.150> pop<00:01:36.540> it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and finally you'll be able to pop it

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.620 
and finally you'll be able to pop it
right<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.680> housing<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:39.119> other<00:01:39.270> type

a slide hammer with a seal attachment
you<00:01:48.750> could<00:01:48.960> use<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> simple

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
you could use that but this is a simple

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.700 
you could use that but this is a simple
replacement<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.079> put<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> hook<00:01:52.500> in

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
replacement for that you put the hook in
