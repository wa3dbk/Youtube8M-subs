00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
body has to metabolize it through your

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.200 
body has to metabolize it through your
liver<00:05:10.560> can<00:05:11.560> you<00:05:11.650> say<00:05:11.890> fat<00:05:12.490> burning<00:05:12.880> get<00:05:13.000> to<00:05:13.120> the

liver can you say fat burning get to the
back<00:05:13.360> of<00:05:13.390> the<00:05:13.630> line<00:05:13.810> just<00:05:14.710> like<00:05:14.890> your<00:05:15.070> car<00:05:15.400> your

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
back of the line just like your car your

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.810 
back of the line just like your car your
body<00:05:16.660> burns<00:05:17.020> whatever<00:05:17.650> fuel<00:05:18.100> you<00:05:18.280> put<00:05:18.310> into<00:05:18.640> it

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
some of the alcohol and the fat what it

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.790 
some of the alcohol and the fat what it
does<00:05:49.420> with<00:05:49.600> the<00:05:49.750> rest<00:05:49.960> is<00:05:50.140> it<00:05:50.290> converts<00:05:50.650> it

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
does with the rest is it converts it

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.550 
does with the rest is it converts it
into<00:05:50.860> acetate<00:05:51.610> and<00:05:51.900> acetate<00:05:52.900> gets<00:05:53.140> converted

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
into acetate and acetate gets converted

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.690 
bloodstream ends up using that acetate
as<00:05:58.390> fuel<00:05:58.860> and<00:05:59.860> that's<00:06:00.040> what<00:06:00.250> I<00:06:00.280> mean<00:06:00.490> when<00:06:00.670> I
