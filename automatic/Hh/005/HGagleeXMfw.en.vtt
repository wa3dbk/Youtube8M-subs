00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.710 
together we only got three of our old
players<00:01:28.370> now<00:01:28.640> making<00:01:29.030> being<00:01:29.180> one<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.360> them<00:01:29.570> and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
players now making being one of them and

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.830 
players now making being one of them and
they've<00:01:30.650> got<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:31.040> gel<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.640> also<00:01:32.180> learn<00:01:32.660> to

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
they've got to gel and also learn to

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.970 
they've got to gel and also learn to
play<00:01:32.990> at<00:01:33.110> this<00:01:33.200> standard<00:01:33.620> some<00:01:33.830> of<00:01:33.920> the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
players and play together and I think

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.120 
players and play together and I think
we're<00:01:35.960> doing<00:01:36.080> pretty<00:01:36.170> well<00:01:36.350> man<00:01:36.620> do<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.010> think

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.150 
that explains how do I put this

think the keeper she's got under the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.940 
think the keeper she's got under the
ball<00:02:31.400> there<00:02:31.640> but<00:02:31.850> said<00:02:32.750> earlier<00:02:33.140> lien<00:02:33.620> and

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
she's very brave and as for Sue's first

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.920 
she's very brave and as for Sue's first
or<00:05:44.940> when<00:05:45.060> it<00:05:45.150> was<00:05:45.240> going<00:05:45.360> straight<00:05:45.630> in<00:05:45.750> she

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
or when it was going straight in she

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.660 
or when it was going straight in she
showed<00:05:46.170> her<00:05:46.590> presence<00:05:47.040> in<00:05:47.190> the<00:05:47.310> air<00:05:47.430> how<00:05:47.610> she

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
showed her presence in the air how she

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.790 
showed her presence in the air how she
she's<00:05:48.180> very<00:05:48.510> well<00:05:48.750> she's<00:05:48.930> a<00:05:48.960> target<00:05:49.410> players

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
she's very well she's a target players

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.860 
she's very well she's a target players
and<00:05:50.130> she<00:05:50.400> gets<00:05:50.580> across<00:05:50.790> the<00:05:51.330> defender<00:05:51.720> there<00:05:51.840> i

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
and she gets across the defender there i

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.960 
and she gets across the defender there i
think<00:05:52.140> her<00:05:52.680> initial<00:05:53.190> run<00:05:53.430> you<00:05:53.550> can't<00:05:53.760> quite

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
think her initial run you can't quite

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.520 
think her initial run you can't quite
see<00:05:54.210> it<00:05:54.240> there<00:05:54.480> but<00:05:54.510> she<00:05:54.720> takes<00:05:54.960> the<00:05:55.170> defender

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
see it there but she takes the defender

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.290 
see it there but she takes the defender
away<00:05:55.770> to<00:05:55.830> go<00:05:56.130> in<00:05:56.250> front<00:05:56.430> of<00:05:56.580> him<00:05:56.700> that's

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
away to go in front of him that's

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.750 
away to go in front of him that's
typical<00:05:57.750> striker<00:05:58.080> play<00:05:58.350> and<00:05:58.560> as<00:05:58.770> a<00:05:59.010> center<00:05:59.640> up

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
typical striker play and as a center up

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.220 
typical striker play and as a center up
i<00:05:59.910> truly<00:06:00.330> think<00:06:00.420> she's<00:06:00.660> done<00:06:00.810> really<00:06:00.840> well

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
i truly think she's done really well

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.530 
i truly think she's done really well

the<00:06:45.599> moment<00:06:45.870> Arsenal's<00:06:46.229> got<00:06:46.409> a<00:06:46.590> game<00:06:47.009> in<00:06:47.129> hand

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:47.159 
the moment Arsenal's got a game in hand

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.339 
the moment Arsenal's got a game in hand
and<00:06:47.520> so<00:06:48.210> if<00:06:48.539> I<00:06:48.659> was<00:06:48.750> a<00:06:48.780> betting<00:06:48.900> man<00:06:49.080> I'd<00:06:49.319> say

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:49.349 
and so if I was a betting man I'd say

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:51.379 
and so if I was a betting man I'd say
Arsenal<00:06:49.979> the<00:06:50.159> done<00:06:50.550> it<00:06:50.669> so<00:06:50.789> many<00:06:50.819> times<00:06:51.030> before

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389 
Arsenal the done it so many times before

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:53.749 
Arsenal the done it so many times before
but<00:06:51.629> it's<00:06:51.960> a<00:06:52.050> tight<00:06:52.259> one<00:06:52.439> and<00:06:52.710> it's<00:06:53.550> what

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 
but it's a tight one and it's what

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.249 
but it's a tight one and it's what
everyone<00:06:54.120> wants<00:06:54.419> it<00:06:54.509> goes<00:06:54.810> the<00:06:54.930> last<00:06:55.050> game

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.290 
everyone wants it goes the last game
which<00:06:55.439> you<00:06:55.530> probably<00:06:55.740> will<00:06:55.949> do<00:06:56.099> so<00:06:56.400> it's<00:06:57.240> a

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
which you probably will do so it's a

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.760 
which you probably will do so it's a
tight<00:06:57.509> one<00:06:57.689> and<00:06:57.900> there<00:06:58.080> was<00:06:58.199> both<00:06:58.379> teams<00:06:58.620> with

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
tight one and there was both teams with

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.800 
tight one and there was both teams with
a<00:06:58.800> look<00:06:58.949> and<00:06:59.580> very<00:06:59.759> quickly<00:06:59.789> fade<00:07:00.330> the<00:07:00.479> future

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
a look and very quickly fade the future

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.320 
a look and very quickly fade the future
of<00:07:00.900> the<00:07:00.930> wsl<00:07:01.590> as<00:07:01.919> we<00:07:02.099> look<00:07:02.280> at<00:07:02.490> pretty<00:07:02.669> much<00:07:02.759> at

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
of the wsl as we look at pretty much at
