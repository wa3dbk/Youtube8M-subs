 There is a lot to see and some 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.580
 which she nice to understand 100 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.829
 where they honestly say even more 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.190
 must is the following namely I think that 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.949
 pretty cool from the features 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.340

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.989

 great features window on window 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.100
 First of all, it's important to me 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.710
 that she controls very well that the victory 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.619
 he is otherwise just another us 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.360
 and i need handbrake needs 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.220

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.939

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.229
 where since these errors have discovered the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.150
 fixed now is okay so the light 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.119
 turn off at least front back 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.110

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:49.710
