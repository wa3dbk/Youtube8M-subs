in<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.899> event<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.620> have<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:08.189> send<00:00:08.550> us<00:00:08.670> a

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
in the event that you have to send us a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.700 
in the event that you have to send us a
tracing<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.300> your<00:00:09.450> feet<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.320> we<00:00:10.559> can

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
tracing of your feet so that we can

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.129 
tracing of your feet so that we can
figure<00:00:10.950> out<00:00:11.099> what<00:00:11.460> size<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:12.120> are<00:00:12.150> I'm<00:00:12.929> gonna

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
figure out what size you are I'm gonna

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.980 
figure out what size you are I'm gonna
show<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.440> how<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.679> could<00:00:14.009> take<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.219> tracing<00:00:14.990> so

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
show you how we could take a tracing so

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.599 
show you how we could take a tracing so
you<00:00:16.049> can<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.500> somebody<00:00:16.740> trace<00:00:17.160> your<00:00:17.340> feet

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
you can have somebody trace your feet

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.090 
you can have somebody trace your feet
the<00:00:17.760> same<00:00:18.000> way<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.480> do<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:19.289> can't<00:00:19.590> trace<00:00:19.890> your

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
the same way we do you can't trace your

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.859 
the same way we do you can't trace your
own<00:00:20.250> feet<00:00:20.580> because<00:00:21.000> when<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.270> bend<00:00:21.539> over<00:00:21.779> to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
own feet because when you bend over to

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.390 
own feet because when you bend over to
trace<00:00:22.080> your<00:00:22.230> foot<00:00:22.439> you'll<00:00:22.619> distort<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> shape

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
trace your foot you'll distort the shape

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.620 
trace your foot you'll distort the shape
of<00:00:23.550> your<00:00:23.640> foot<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.150> have<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.510> have

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
of your foot so you have to have

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.259 
of your foot so you have to have
somebody<00:00:24.869> trace<00:00:25.230> your<00:00:25.410> foot<00:00:25.820> we<00:00:26.820> need<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.090> have

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
somebody trace your foot we need to have

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.269 
somebody trace your foot we need to have
you<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.900> tracing<00:00:28.380> made<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.830> something

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
you have the tracing made on something

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.130 
you have the tracing made on something
that<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.640> see<00:00:29.849> through<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.390> cardboard<00:00:30.990> or

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that we can see through not cardboard or

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.959 
that we can see through not cardboard or
brown<00:00:31.320> butcher<00:00:31.740> paper<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.219> I'll<00:00:32.279> explain<00:00:32.700> why

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
brown butcher paper and I'll explain why

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.770 
brown butcher paper and I'll explain why
later<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:35.100> need<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.430> use<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:36.030> ballpoint

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
later and you need to use a ballpoint

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.900 
later and you need to use a ballpoint
pen<00:00:36.960> or<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> number-two<00:00:38.160> pencil<00:00:38.670> something

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
pen or a number-two pencil something

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.240 
pen or a number-two pencil something
with<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> known<00:00:39.570> radius<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.440> use<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> big<00:00:40.950> fat

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
with a known radius if you use a big fat

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.100 
with a known radius if you use a big fat
felt<00:00:41.640> pen<00:00:41.969> or<00:00:42.149> something<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> strange

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
felt pen or something with a strange

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.580 
felt pen or something with a strange
radius<00:00:44.000> you<00:00:45.000> will<00:00:45.149> confuse<00:00:45.539> us<00:00:45.840> because<00:00:46.320> in

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
radius you will confuse us because in

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.130 
radius you will confuse us because in
the<00:00:47.190> end<00:00:47.370> result<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.149> we<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> subtract

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the end result here we have to subtract

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.080 
the end result here we have to subtract
the<00:00:49.320> radius<00:00:49.860> out<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> picture<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the radius out of the picture we have to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.119 
the radius out of the picture we have to
know<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.510> radius<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.949> first

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
know what that radius is so the first

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.459 
know what that radius is so the first
tracing<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.329> trace<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.899> pen<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.350> pencil

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
tracing you trace with the pen or pencil

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.590 
tracing you trace with the pen or pencil
exactly<00:00:56.250> vertical<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> way<00:00:57.149> around<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
exactly vertical all the way around the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.330 
exactly vertical all the way around the
foot<00:00:57.840> keeping<00:00:58.680> your<00:00:58.800> weight<00:00:58.980> distributed

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
foot keeping your weight distributed

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.729 
foot keeping your weight distributed
evenly<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.120> both<00:01:00.329> feet<00:01:00.600> after<00:01:01.440> you've<00:01:01.559> made

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
evenly on both feet after you've made

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.160 
evenly on both feet after you've made
the<00:01:01.949> initial<00:01:02.160> tracing<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.449> put<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> pen<00:01:03.989> at

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the initial tracing you put the pen at

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.630 
the initial tracing you put the pen at
the<00:01:04.260> knuckle<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> ankle<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.400> tilt

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the knuckle of the ankle and you tilt

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.179 
the knuckle of the ankle and you tilt
the<00:01:05.790> top<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> pen<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.720> away<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.010> you

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the top of the pen out away so that you

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.609 
the top of the pen out away so that you
can<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.330> point<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.930> does<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.320> writing

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
can get the point that does the writing

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.890 
can get the point that does the writing
touching<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> paper<00:01:11.820> tucked<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.479> under<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
touching the paper tucked in under the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.020 
touching the paper tucked in under the
radius<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> curve<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.220> your<00:01:14.280> heel<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
radius of the curve of your heel and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.999 
radius of the curve of your heel and
from<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.720> knuckle<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> way<00:01:16.590> around<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
from that knuckle all the way around the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.560 
from that knuckle all the way around the
back<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> knuckle<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> other<00:01:18.240> side

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
back to the knuckle on the other side

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.289 
back to the knuckle on the other side
you<00:01:19.080> trace<00:01:19.380> another<00:01:19.740> curve<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> little

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you trace another curve we have a little

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.630 
you trace another curve we have a little
u-shaped<00:01:21.930> horseshoe<00:01:22.500> inside<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> other

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
u-shaped horseshoe inside of the other

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.330 
u-shaped horseshoe inside of the other
tracing<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.259> tells<00:01:25.500> us<00:01:25.680> how<00:01:25.740> wide<00:01:26.100> your

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
tracing so this tells us how wide your

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.840 
tracing so this tells us how wide your
heel<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.780> out<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.250> tells<00:01:29.250> us<00:01:29.430> how<00:01:29.610> wide

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
heel is this out here tells us how wide

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.460 
heel is this out here tells us how wide
the<00:01:30.030> front<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.509> foot<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.900> which<00:01:31.079> may<00:01:31.320> or

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the front of your foot is which may or

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.109 
the front of your foot is which may or
may<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.619> agree<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.460> that's<00:01:32.729> why<00:01:32.909> we've

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
may not agree with this that's why we've

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.840 
may not agree with this that's why we've
come<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.630> part<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.930> these<00:01:34.310> 144<00:01:35.310> sizes

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
come up with part of these 144 sizes

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.420 
come up with part of these 144 sizes
that<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.119> use<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.509> combination<00:01:37.200> feet<00:01:37.470> when<00:01:38.250> we

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
that we use for combination feet when we

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.569 
that we use for combination feet when we
get<00:01:38.640> done<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.689> take<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.439> right<00:01:40.979> tracing<00:01:41.490> and

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
get done we take the right tracing and

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.069 
get done we take the right tracing and
the<00:01:41.640> left<00:01:41.820> tracing<00:01:42.299> we<00:01:42.420> turn<00:01:42.659> them<00:01:42.899> one

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
the left tracing we turn them one

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.990
