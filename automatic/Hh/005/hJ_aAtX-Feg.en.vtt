that he is stronger than he is now so I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.620 
that he is stronger than he is now so I

still to this day the only thing I can

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.570 
still to this day the only thing I can
see<00:02:33.640> happening<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.330> Kakashi<00:02:34.780> using<00:02:35.470> his<00:02:35.860> kumai

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580

on<00:02:36.730> him<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.060> send<00:02:37.270> him<00:02:37.420> away<00:02:38.100> but<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:40.180> seems

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
on him to send him away but it seems

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.130 
on him to send him away but it seems
that<00:02:40.750> he<00:02:40.930> still<00:02:41.200> has<00:02:41.440> his<00:02:41.470> Sharingan<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:43.140> he

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
that he still has his Sharingan so he

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.010 
that he still has his Sharingan so he
could<00:02:44.320> come<00:02:45.160> right<00:02:45.370> back<00:02:45.550> but<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.630> don't<00:02:46.930> know
