00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.880
 if I am ready for us in this 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:13.410
 which is the time of study to the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.109
 boys are pretty animated today 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.240
 let's prepare a recipe that daniel 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.800
 he likes it a lot and it's a rolled chicken 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.080
 we are going to roll it with two ingredients 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.119
 only and most interesting of all 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.060
 is that it is super economic because we are 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.310
 working under budget does not give or 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.199
 as we must save money 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.000
 save money then 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.680
 danny I had a very good friend who 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.059
 they told him he had the slowest wallet 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.059
 from the west there was no way 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.910
 pay attention to this wonderful chicken 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.980
 I'm going to give you a technique that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.410
 we normally use for what it would be in 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.449
 this case is a chicken failing of a 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.370
 very popular recipe worldwide and of 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.350
 expect practically one breast of 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.239
 crushed chicken which makes it a bit 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.579
 finest and the cooking process is 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.070
 much faster I put half breast of 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.470
 chicken in the half pike and what I do 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.580
 is to place it between two sheets of paper 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.230
 plastic 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.940
 what we are going to do is cut the 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.280
 paper that now look good very 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.960
 Let's take a simple hammer 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.980
 kitchen like this that I have here and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.690
 slightly 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.920
 Let's start to make some 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.750
 sweetie to the chicken breast this is 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.450
 This chicken breast is in honor of the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.630
 50 credit shadows then we're going to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.070
 go crushing and hitting her a little bit 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.800
 then as we go crushing it 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.560
 let's take it very lightly 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.770
 to a texture obviously much softer 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.360
 and much more look much more planet more 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.370
 big surface and that's when 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.260
 let's start filling in step number 1 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.940
 we grab a touch of olive oil and 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.710
 we put it on top I'm using 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.270
 the olive oil that aromatizes the other 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.300
 day that I told you how to do with a little 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.160
 of garlic and rosemary spectacular then we go 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.220
 to make them work with salt and pepper 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.500
 there it is and once seasoned we are going to 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.750
 take a little spinach and let's 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.940
 start covering the surface as well as 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.920
 the ones also do not have to be anything very 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.800
 organized nothing does not have to be anything 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.840
 perfect then once we start to 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.150
 fill I'm going to take some cheese 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.270
 very blue and I 'm going to start 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.209
 place on top like that one time 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.970
 we put it on top I tell them 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.680
 what for 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.240
 what they like blue cheese this is 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.680
 perfect if you do not like blue cheese and 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.720
 I want to use some other cheese you can use 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.580
 feta cheese and it goes perfectly to a 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.080
 fresh cheese there is no problem for 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.590
 roll up let's use the same paper 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.770
 look, let's take the tip 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.710
 we squeeze we carry again we squeeze 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.530
 like a taquito we're going to and once 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.770
 we already going full roll it up 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.690
 to form as a kind of cylinder 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.160
 true as well as you are seeing this 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.140
 cylinder what we are going to do is 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.970
 take it to the refrigerator so that 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.490
 keep that shape for approximately 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.660
 about 15 to 20 minutes after what 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.970
 we have here what I'm going to do is 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.250
 Take it to express yourself where you look 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.500
 I started to adore him lightly for the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.270
 sides and what we are looking for is that 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.590
 marvelous come closer here ma'am 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.150
 so you see that is what we are 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.820
 looking for those wonderful 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.310
 caramelization that will give you a taste 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.090
 and texture because this part unlike 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.129
 it's crispy now 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.750
 there's no way to cook and stay 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.670
 perfectly cooked if we cook it 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.220
 directly in the pan for that reason 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.450
 once golden on all sides what 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.330
 I'll bake for 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.340
 approximately 25 minutes so that 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.769
 the heat of the oven starts to penetrate 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.890
 the fibers and cook from the inside to 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.900
 outside and in that way melt 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.940
 that spectacular cheese and cook the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.069
 Spinach is a recipe extremely 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.560
 wonderful because we have the 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.920
 complexity of one's taste the spinach 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.340
 the cheese and of course it's extremely 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.890
 economic the corolla we serve the 375 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.340
 degrees 20 to 25 minutes I want them 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.959

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.720
 sliced and served with a salad 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.819
 very simple a little bit of it 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.470
 spinach a little tomato onion and 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.510
 now the most important gentlemen what 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.860
