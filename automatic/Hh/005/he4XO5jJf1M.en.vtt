00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.259
 colors that I ask are very small are of 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.160
 I'll show you that this is 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:35.860
 very small 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.400
 but this one serves you for 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.850

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.150
 way to make more designs and the one that 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:51.240

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.360

 free market they get it 85 pesos 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.240
 really for me it's economical where 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.800
 I live in the north and here it is 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.250
 they get things much more expensive 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.600
 I also ordered 12 of these style graphs 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.900
 for decoration by the 12 I got 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.530
 100 weights 12 such these colors 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.530

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.860
 I asked 12 for 100 pesos also the 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.860
 ironed nature 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.730
 I really like nothing more than here in 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.610
 The north is much more expensive 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:48.620
 and you can get each packet by 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:52.430
 internet 53 x 10 pesos and then for what 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:56.420
 I liked to say is well 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:00.710
 practice fingers 12 fingers by 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:05.450
 this for 40 pesos you can also 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.239
 get this decoration box 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.599
 it's very useful to me it came out like 15 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.670
 weights to put my stones with their 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.140
 individual compartments the stones 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.540

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.480
 distribute nails to a weight each stone 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.870
 imagine the sorry you can get 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.760
 online up to 23 pesos 600 of 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.950
 stones apart from that not yet here 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.209
 battle a lot to get the colors 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.359
 but this one for me is very well I asked 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.609
 this also I made brushes for hand 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:42.659
 raised that I'm going to practice it just not 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:45.230
 I know but I already asked that I have them measured 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.790
 because I had not already I'm using it 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.900
 I also asked for it online 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.710
 consider from 20 250 to 300 pesos 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.420
 depending 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.069
 and I also got and the bit is the 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.959
 load 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.680
 here the cheapest thing that I can 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:09.219
 get 160 on the internet mercadolibre 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.189
 I got 90 pesos and I bought this 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:15.219
 number of this brand I did not like the 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:17.379
 I really did not like it smells very strong 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.840
 I do not like how this works 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.379
 monomer the truth but then I follow 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.409
 using to make designs on the fingers 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.939
 of practices the practical hand of that 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.520
 brand also orders oil from 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:34.700
 cuticle this one I did not put here anymore 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.770
 and where they are from like that smells rich is 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.160
 all right 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:42.580
 and this acrylic that is of the same brand 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.750
 that the monomer also this one I liked 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.780
 I really liked this one did not combine this 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.270
 with the organic number and yes I liked it 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.360

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.650
 yes I liked this acrylic and that's the way it is 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.730
