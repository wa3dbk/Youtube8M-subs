to eight hours and I put it in my hair
in<00:00:45.660> stage<00:00:45.960> three<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:47.070> 11<00:00:47.520> a.m.<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.940> next

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
day so I have to wash it out but that's

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.700 
day so I have to wash it out but that's
what<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> cinnamon<00:00:51.930> looks<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
what the cinnamon looks like when the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.680 
what the cinnamon looks like when the
thing<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.100> here

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
thing in here

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.900 
thing in here
suppose<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:55.050> still<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:55.910> like

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
suppose that we still in have like

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.279 
suppose that we still in have like
natural<00:00:57.750> hydrogen<00:00:58.500> boosters<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.460> it<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:01.109> it's

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
natural hydrogen boosters in it so it's

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.319 
natural hydrogen boosters in it so it's
a<00:01:01.440> light<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.859> there<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.670> honey<00:01:02.910> smell

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
a light in there and so it's honey smell

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.690 
a light in there and so it's honey smell
supposedly<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.260> by<00:01:04.439> engineering<00:01:05.040> naturally

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
supposedly it by engineering naturally

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.399 
supposedly it by engineering naturally
but<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.060> not<00:01:06.240> post<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.900> light<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.350> light

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
but it's not post of light in that light

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.340 
but it's not post of light in that light
very<00:01:07.920> dramatically<00:01:08.790> there's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.780> gradual

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
very dramatically there's a gradual

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.080 
very dramatically there's a gradual
thing<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:11.790> quite

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
thing so you have to do a little quite

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.080 
thing so you have to do a little quite
on<00:01:12.210> time<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.760> looks<00:01:14.939> like

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
on time but this is what it looks like

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.810 
on time but this is what it looks like
in<00:01:15.299> hearing<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.830> isn't<00:01:17.159> covered<00:01:17.670> like

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820

didn't put conditioner in it that time I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.040 
didn't put conditioner in it that time I
just<00:02:45.990> put<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.410> :<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:51.120> then<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.390> third<00:02:51.660> time

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
just put like : and then the third time

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:06.380 
just put like : and then the third time
and<00:02:52.770> she's<00:02:53.190> water<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.300> just<00:02:54.660> water

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.270 

you<00:03:07.390> can<00:03:07.599> see<00:03:07.870> what<00:03:08.020> it<00:03:08.140> looks<00:03:08.349> like<00:03:08.470> when<00:03:08.800> you

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
you can see what it looks like when you

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:19.080 
you can see what it looks like when you
