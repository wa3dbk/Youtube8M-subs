but I was unsure of getting them because

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.330 
but I was unsure of getting them because
they<00:01:18.630> weren't<00:01:18.900> made<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.170> Italy<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.040> believe

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
they weren't made in Italy and I believe

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.940 
they weren't made in Italy and I believe
they<00:01:20.549> are<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:21.240> made<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.509> Mexico<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.619> found

they are actually made in Mexico I found

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.289 
they are actually made in Mexico I found
a<00:01:23.070> website<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.580> said<00:01:23.790> they<00:01:23.880> were<00:01:23.939> made<00:01:24.150> in

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
Mexico so I wasn't really wild about

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.700

getting<00:01:27.600> them<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:27.930> first<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.500> didn't

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
getting them at first because I didn't

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.920

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
pleasantly surprised and it can't hurt

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.660

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
wardrobe you can pair it with over the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.280
