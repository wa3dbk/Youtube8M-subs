to look at when you unbox your car the
mesh<00:01:44.450> was<00:01:44.659> set<00:01:44.869> properly<00:01:45.319> although<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.890> motor

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
mesh was set properly although the motor

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
Loctite on these screws right here so

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.139 
Loctite on these screws right here so
you<00:01:50.630> want<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.899> go<00:01:50.990> around<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.319> check<00:01:51.409> that<00:01:52.149> the

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
you want to go around and check that the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
other thing might not be an issue but I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.660 
other thing might not be an issue but I
had<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.179> get<00:01:56.300> some<00:01:57.069> connectors<00:01:58.069> to<00:01:58.340> make<00:01:58.369> my

had to get some connectors to make my

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.190 
had to get some connectors to make my
traxxas<00:01:59.119> batteries<00:01:59.569> work<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:01.780> let's<00:02:02.780> see<00:02:02.990> we

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
traxxas batteries work and let's see we

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.809 
traxxas batteries work and let's see we
got<00:02:03.289> a<00:02:03.350> couple<00:02:03.740> battery<00:02:04.190> packs<00:02:04.429> right<00:02:04.640> here

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
got a couple battery packs right here

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:05.830 
got a couple battery packs right here
we're<00:02:04.909> going<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.060> try<00:02:05.209> out<00:02:05.420> for<00:02:05.569> the<00:02:05.659> first

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
we're going to try out for the first

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.080 
we're going to try out for the first
time<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.140> just<00:02:06.319> picked<00:02:06.679> them<00:02:06.799> up

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
time I just picked them up

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.810 
time I just picked them up
we'll<00:02:08.479> get<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.720> radio<00:02:09.019> synched<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:09.820> we'll

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
we'll get the radio synched and we'll

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.430 
we'll get the radio synched and we'll
take<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.299> out<00:02:11.390> for<00:02:11.540> test<00:02:11.780> run<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.110> see<00:02:12.260> how<00:02:12.320> it

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
take it out for test run and see how it

00:02:12.440 --> 00:03:00.290 
take it out for test run and see how it
works

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.510 

well<00:03:01.300> as<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.780> can<00:03:01.930> see<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.470> run<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.280> for<00:03:03.490> about

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
well as you can see I run it for about

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.630 
well as you can see I run it for about
three<00:03:04.330> minutes<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.530> wheel<00:03:05.709> fell<00:03:05.950> off<00:03:06.010> but

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
three minutes and the wheel fell off but

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.300 
three minutes and the wheel fell off but
I<00:03:06.670> did<00:03:06.910> find<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.330> nut<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:08.500> will<00:03:09.040> go<00:03:09.130> get<00:03:09.280> a

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
I did find the nut and I will go get a

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.210 
I did find the nut and I will go get a
wrench<00:03:09.580> and<00:03:09.819> put<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.150> back<00:03:10.300> on<00:03:11.160> with<00:03:12.160> the

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
wrench and put it back on with the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.160 
wrench and put it back on with the
gearing<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:12.970> set<00:03:13.209> up<00:03:13.360> around<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.750> house

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
gearing and set up around the house

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.400 
gearing and set up around the house
right<00:03:14.350> now<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.650> would<00:03:15.069> say<00:03:15.810> it's<00:03:16.810> pretty<00:03:17.170> mild

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
right now I would say it's pretty mild

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.270 
right now I would say it's pretty mild
with<00:03:18.780> 27.4<00:03:19.780> light<00:03:19.989> clothes<00:03:20.200> it's<00:03:20.739> pretty<00:03:21.069> mild

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
with 27.4 light clothes it's pretty mild

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.090 
with 27.4 light clothes it's pretty mild
compared<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.060> my<00:03:22.180> ear<00:03:22.360> Evo<00:03:22.660> I'll<00:03:23.530> be<00:03:23.680> back<00:03:23.890> with

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
compared to my ear Evo I'll be back with

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:49.460 
compared to my ear Evo I'll be back with
a<00:03:24.130> nap

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.130 

pretty<00:03:50.340> much<00:03:50.490> wide<00:03:50.730> open<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.750> won't<00:03:51.960> see

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
pretty much wide open and you won't see

00:03:52.140 --> 00:05:14.529 
pretty much wide open and you won't see
it<00:03:52.170> really<00:03:52.620> operator<00:03:52.950> full<00:03:53.670> full<00:03:54.030> trigger

as<00:05:14.930> you<00:05:15.199> can<00:05:15.349> see<00:05:15.530> here<00:05:15.889> this<00:05:16.520> is<00:05:16.580> with<00:05:18.190> 6c<00:05:19.190> LIFO

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
as you can see here this is with 6c LIFO

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.550 
as you can see here this is with 6c LIFO
took<00:05:22.069> a<00:05:22.099> little<00:05:22.340> bit<00:05:22.490> of<00:05:22.550> a<00:05:22.669> hit<00:05:22.990> no<00:05:23.990> jumping

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560

took a little bit of a hit no jumping
just<00:05:24.889> racing<00:05:25.699> and<00:05:25.970> bashing<00:05:26.810> made<00:05:27.050> some

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
just racing and bashing made some

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.430 
just racing and bashing made some

didn't<00:05:30.680> really<00:05:30.770> work<00:05:31.069> out<00:05:31.310> found<00:05:32.240> the<00:05:32.419> axle

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
didn't really work out found the axle

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.110

overall satisfied the ties didn't come
unglued<00:05:41.259> you<00:05:42.259> definitely<00:05:42.740> want<00:05:43.039> to<00:05:43.130> run<00:05:43.310> the

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
unglued you definitely want to run the

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.309 
unglued you definitely want to run the
two<00:05:45.139> 11s<00:05:45.740> and<00:05:46.389> actually<00:05:47.389> I<00:05:47.419> do<00:05:47.599> notice<00:05:47.990> that

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 
two 11s and actually I do notice that

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:51.309 
two 11s and actually I do notice that
the<00:05:49.030> pinion<00:05:50.030> came<00:05:50.270> loose<00:05:50.509> so<00:05:50.960> it's<00:05:51.139> a<00:05:51.199> good

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 
the pinion came loose so it's a good

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.490 
the pinion came loose so it's a good
thing<00:05:51.500> I<00:05:51.560> stopped<00:05:52.539> and<00:05:53.539> that<00:05:53.690> concludes<00:05:54.139> my

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
thing I stopped and that concludes my
