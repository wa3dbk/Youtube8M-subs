00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello youtube and welcome to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.839
 next unboxing video a new one 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.679
 kickstarter project is finally with me 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.840
 arrived it is about the project 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.780
 which I believe in mid 20 12 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.449
 have supported there are now of today 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.990
 DHL delivered two funny boxes 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.520
 been 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.789
 I have two of these things 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.740
 ordered what can they be 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.900
 bluetooth receiver says one or the other 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 others now but they can 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.630
 a little bit more is bluetooth 4.0 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.610
 displayed 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.140
 then look back at us 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.460
 see so norris thing in such a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.739
 speaker dock 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.040
 and we also have the thing with us 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.420
 audio cable to the stereo on the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.570
 the back is still a lot of features 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.879
 Shown but we are looking at the whole 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:56.610
 Now call and call the packaging 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:59.520
 in some way fix on us 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.140
 ever comes an audio cable otherwise 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.080
 stink normal jack male 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.570
 Male part contrary and we get 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.090
 a funny hand little book in 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.659
 probably only one language though 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.930
 with a lot of skills that the thing 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.479
 has and we come to the receiver itself 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.670
 I am now easier that that 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.420
 ding so little is on the packaging 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.619
 it is already quite another house number 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.509
 because you can see how something like that only 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.950
 orange hue is not quite hit 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.530
 but no matter we look at the little thing 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.970
 a short piece closer to and indeed 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.970
 a on and off switch on the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.960
 we have one on the front below 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.250
 audio output and quite important that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.869
 That's what makes the thing special 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.259
 old 30 pin iphone adapter so plug 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.250
 connector say your iphone 4s 43 3gs 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.170
 and plus all the ipods there are 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.560
 of course there are dogs outside without end 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.259
 and most of the time they just work out 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.450
 iphone in which it puts in and then 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.459
 you have mucke some of them are also 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.370
 airplay capable but the least are 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.520
 also 

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:17.270
 and this is where the game comes from 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.050
 it is a bluetooth receiver which 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.480
 data bluetooth sent yes streaming 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:28.330
 audio things so from the android windows 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.550
 phone from even the iphone but 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.220
 receive and then output to the dock 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.220
 can and indeed an old 30 pin connections 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.250
 or just about normal about this 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.470
 audio cables and any speakers 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.210
 that you want the thing has even more 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.220
 has a built-in microphone louder and 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.360
 soft key forward the power button 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.410
 and below the issue things but still 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.390
 even more the developers have 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.950
 this thing is always fluffed up 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.380
 it also has a built-in one 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.320
 Battery thinks that lasts twelve hours 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.190
 by eight hours yes and in hours 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.090
 Silvis stands by for ten hours and speaks 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.300
 you can do that on the go too 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.400
 if you use it with whatever 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.530
 want to operate speakers for boxing 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.870
 where the power supply does not stop 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.160
 over the dock is working disadvantage 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.950
 Of course, always recharge 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.160
 but I'm curious times cost has 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.420
 me the thing in a double 54 us dollar 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.500
 early bird special 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.520
 So 54 plus 15 euro shipping are what 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.320
 already at 6 90 us dollars what in 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.720
 euro above are probably so pi times 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.300
 thumb 50 something more then I have now 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.160
 just seven euros to the dhl man for 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.430
 have to pay sales tax 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.710
 a so I am here I times under 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.100
 under 60 euros away for two of the 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.140
 and now can both my docs 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.310
 also make bluetooth capable 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.890
 I'll probably do a thing 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.300
 keep and the next one will either 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.420
 in the circle of friends or it comes in the 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.410
 next technique vt raffle 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.030
 that was it thank you for now 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.400
 watch test video there are 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.760
 Of course, first of all until the next one 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.760
 Video
