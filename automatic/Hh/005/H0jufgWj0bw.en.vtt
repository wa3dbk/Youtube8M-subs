00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
little tubular creation here get to the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.570 
little tubular creation here get to the
end<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.470> pull<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> needle<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
end I like to pull the needle all the

end I like to pull the needle all the
way<00:01:17.729> through<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.979> none<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.009> my<00:01:20.299> stitches

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
way through so that none of my stitches

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.710 
way through so that none of my stitches
are<00:01:21.509> going<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> slip<00:01:21.990> off<00:01:22.140> either<00:01:22.439> side<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
then you just turn it take the needle

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.789 
then you just turn it take the needle
turn<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.670> go<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.030> your<00:01:33.119> next<00:01:33.799> needle

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
turn it and go on to your next needle

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.520 
turn it and go on to your next needle
like<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:37.189> enter<00:01:38.189> your<00:01:38.340> working<00:01:38.759> needle<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
like so enter your working needle and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.719 
like so enter your working needle and
knit<00:01:40.530> make<00:01:40.890> sure<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.250> one's<00:01:41.490> tight<00:01:42.290> knit

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
knit make sure that one's tight knit

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.870 
knit make sure that one's tight knit
knit<00:01:44.960> now<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> yarn<00:01:46.380> i'm<00:01:46.590> using<00:01:47.100> especially

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
knit now the yarn i'm using especially

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.090 
knit now the yarn i'm using especially
made<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.590> sock<00:01:49.590> knitting<00:01:49.909> it<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:52.100> thinner

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
made for sock knitting it is a thinner

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.709 
made for sock knitting it is a thinner
strand<00:01:53.670> than<00:01:54.060> sport<00:01:54.840> weight<00:01:55.189> and<00:01:56.360> as<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.540> can

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
strand than sport weight and as you can

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.550 
strand than sport weight and as you can
see<00:01:58.369> it's<00:01:59.369> self<00:01:59.759> striping<00:02:00.140> meaning<00:02:01.140> i'm<00:02:01.350> not

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
see it's self striping meaning i'm not

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.310 
see it's self striping meaning i'm not
changing<00:02:02.250> yarn<00:02:02.729> every<00:02:03.060> time<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> new<00:02:03.719> stripe

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
changing yarn every time a new stripe

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.819 
changing yarn every time a new stripe
appears<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.219> just<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> yarn<00:02:07.259> changes

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
appears it's just that the yarn changes

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.820 
appears it's just that the yarn changes
color

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830

as<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:10.640> knit<00:02:12.010> once<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.220> make<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.460> actual<00:02:14.210> sock<00:02:14.540> with

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
as I knit once I make a actual sock with

as I knit once I make a actual sock with
this<00:02:15.170> my<00:02:15.770> stripes<00:02:16.190> are<00:02:16.430> going<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.610> be<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.820> lot

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
this my stripes are going to be a lot

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.620 
this my stripes are going to be a lot
thinner<00:02:17.570> because<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:19.490> size<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.510> I'm

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.490 
because your gauge is going to be
different<00:02:40.220> if<00:02:40.640> you're<00:02:41.360> just<00:02:41.630> knitting<00:02:42.290> and

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
different if you're just knitting and

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.350 
different if you're just knitting and
then<00:02:42.620> purling<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.340> knitting<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.730> purling<00:02:43.940> as

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
then purling and knitting and purling as

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.230 
then purling and knitting and purling as
you<00:02:44.900> would<00:02:45.140> on<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.380> flat<00:02:45.710> piece<00:02:45.950> since<00:02:46.940> this<00:02:47.120> is

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
you would on a flat piece since this is

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.390 
you would on a flat piece since this is
a<00:02:47.270> circular<00:02:47.780> piece<00:02:48.110> your<00:02:48.770> gauge<00:02:48.980> might<00:02:49.220> be

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
a circular piece your gauge might be

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.920 
a circular piece your gauge might be
different<00:02:49.610> so<00:02:49.940> I'm<00:02:50.000> going<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.209> use<00:02:50.390> this<00:02:50.690> to

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
different so I'm going to use this to

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.190 
different so I'm going to use this to
measure<00:02:51.740> my<00:02:51.980> gauge
