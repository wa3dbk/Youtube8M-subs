00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
first thing that I had to do was drill

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.520

the metal platelets onto the wall and
for<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.790> actually<00:01:06.210> had<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.659> use<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
for that I actually had to use a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.680 
for that I actually had to use a
mechanical<00:01:07.560> drill<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.820> you're<00:01:09.150> under<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.540> age

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
mechanical drill I would definitely

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.679

it could actually
suffocate<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.380> plant<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.250> would<00:03:46.430> also

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
suffocate the plant and that would also

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:55.300 
suffocate the plant and that would also
cause<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:47.300> to<00:03:47.450> die<00:03:48.310> say<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.819> beautiful<00:03:54.310> but
