 make every effort to 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.619
 to turn in this great card 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.180
 pass it to achieve great here 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.080
 results we work this by 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.460
 maximum but in principle for a number of reasons 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.160
 may even promise that streams on twitch 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.040
 and streams on u tube will not be because 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.290
 Well, this is the map we have been trying for a long time . 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.149

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.360

 how do we get her successful 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.020
 that's why they came up 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.910
 cool format and actually this 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.370
 we now advertise the format 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.399
 friends tonight from 10 pm to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.250
 Moscow time we twitch direct 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.250
 we will be preparing for the shooting 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.559
 filming a series of ladies for about 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.930
 two hours will be neatly closed 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.720
 quests 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.520
 craft means millionth to blu because 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.890
 what we have already let's see now 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.439
 of the balkan throw cobblestone 43 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.950
 just notice a million drops still lies 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.310
 it's us in the network there are some 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.229
 a million pairs from just that but another 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.360
 hand bees are made here by me 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.390
 a huge number of particles in part 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.299
 compressed by fifty nine thousand in 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.740
 64 full stacks each 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.350
 guys that is not like we have a lot 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.200
 just done a lot of things put 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.719
 look at least he 192 thousand land 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.450
 you can already turn off the land you can already 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.979
 almost a million quartz but quartz blocks 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.350
 then we need to turn off 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.250
 quark in general guys but in my opinion 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.229
 worthily advanced on the map 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.939
 here again, too, bees are all like 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.509
 it is necessary bees are now clogged they need 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.750
 unload 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.270
 although many bangs we have already brought here by 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.310
 about this is the time stremchik 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.140
 do and on this stream in good 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.500
 warm answer guys 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.349
 go over the map to work on 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.790
 do various funny ponytails 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.920
 twitch you can find if you don't suddenly 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.049
 You know the reference right in the description to 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.180
 this video so go read 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.400
 Here is a detailed description of it, expand 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.620
 all everything all written all information 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.569
 go to the channel on twitch and let's 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.030
 together take place in a good atmosphere i 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.850
 I think it will be cool very interesting all 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.680
 show tell you the questions will answer and I 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.660
 I think that in a couple of hours we are very 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.940
 significantly advance along the bushes 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.910
 because until you actually sticks 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.340
 we have already made a good start 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.959
 look but yes not so much 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.400
 left in the same naked for flow 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.510
 last guys last 77 percent 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.450
 prepare to surrender of course 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.750
 prepare for what's left next 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.000
 because of large quests without entries 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.340
 one last combo in my even 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.260
 I have already withdrawn faq on all blanks 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.030

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.459
 families to bring the last 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.829
 hives set up last pass and all 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.389

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.370
