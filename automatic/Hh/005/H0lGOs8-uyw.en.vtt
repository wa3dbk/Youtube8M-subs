00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
see inside there anyway so this water

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.300 
see inside there anyway so this water
stops<00:02:14.570> right<00:02:14.960> here<00:02:14.990> or<00:02:15.620> I've<00:02:15.890> another<00:02:16.040> layer

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
stops right here or I've another layer

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.180 
stops right here or I've another layer
of<00:02:16.370> glass<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.030> we<00:02:17.780> go<00:02:17.900> down<00:02:17.930> onto<00:02:18.530> my<00:02:18.680> floor<00:02:19.010> of

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
of glass and we go down onto my floor of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.690 
of glass and we go down onto my floor of
lava<00:02:20.530> okay<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:22.010> haven't<00:02:22.370> quite<00:02:22.580> decided

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
lava okay so I haven't quite decided

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.980 
lava okay so I haven't quite decided
what<00:02:23.000> I'm<00:02:23.060> going<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.209> do<00:02:23.330> with<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:23.600> is<00:02:23.870> going

what I'm going to do with this is going
to<00:02:24.050> be<00:02:24.140> probably<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.620> hole<00:02:25.220> for<00:02:25.580> glass

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
to be probably a hole for glass

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.960 
to be probably a hole for glass
different<00:02:27.380> rooms<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.709> what<00:02:27.860> not<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.610> appears

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
now i'll write in the cloud line so as

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.539 
now i'll write in the cloud line so as
soon<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.739> comes<00:03:07.980> you're<00:03:08.189> going<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.370> see

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
again glass here you have something in

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.270 
again glass here you have something in
the<00:03:14.670> middle<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:15.659> a<00:03:15.750> lot<00:03:16.019> flowing<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.680> then

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
the middle it's a lot flowing and then

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.960 
the middle it's a lot flowing and then
allow<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.239> going<00:03:18.629> down<00:03:19.079> all<00:03:19.349> for<00:03:19.829> slop<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.849> goes

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
allow of going down all for slop it goes

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.640 
allow of going down all for slop it goes
through<00:03:21.209> onto<00:03:21.629> here<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.079> then<00:03:22.169> all<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.349> way

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
through onto here and then all the way

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.429 
through onto here and then all the way
down<00:03:23.569> this<00:03:24.569> is<00:03:24.689> a<00:03:24.720> pretty<00:03:24.840> good<00:03:25.019> look<00:03:25.139> at<00:03:25.260> the

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
down this is a pretty good look at the

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.259 
down this is a pretty good look at the
soccer<00:03:26.040> field<00:03:26.159> in<00:03:26.430> here<00:03:26.579> I'll<00:03:26.790> get<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.060> little

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
soccer field in here I'll get a little

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.759 
soccer field in here I'll get a little
bit<00:03:27.359> closer<00:03:27.510> look<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.200> it's<00:03:28.349> just<00:03:28.439> full

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
bit closer look so it's just full

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.209 
bit closer look so it's just full
stadium<00:03:29.069> my<00:03:29.939> soccer<00:03:30.299> field<00:03:30.840> with<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.980> nets

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:32.219 
stadium my soccer field with the nets

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:33.860 
stadium my soccer field with the nets
and<00:03:32.400> everything<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.909> think<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.510> clouds<00:03:33.719> are

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870

there's a lot of diet it pumps give 10
times<00:04:43.040> building<00:04:43.370> this<00:04:43.610> but<00:04:44.450> anyways<00:04:45.370> what<00:04:46.370> we

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
times building this but anyways what we

have here is on my soccer field it's

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.920 
have here is on my soccer field it's
either<00:04:48.890> a<00:04:48.950> couple<00:04:49.130> pigs<00:04:49.430> plane<00:04:52.750> come<00:04:53.750> down

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:18.189 
have stairs and their seats kind of but

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:20.939 
have stairs and their seats kind of but
not<00:05:18.219> this<00:05:18.909> goes<00:05:19.150> all<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.330> way<00:05:19.479> around<00:05:19.949> that

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
not this goes all the way around that

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.670 
not this goes all the way around that
took<00:05:21.129> a<00:05:21.189> lot<00:05:21.370> of<00:05:21.430> call<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.789> stove<00:05:21.969> to<00:05:22.090> build

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.740 

and<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:25.190> last<00:05:25.340> sort<00:05:25.880> of<00:05:25.970> part<00:05:26.270> of<00:05:26.360> it<00:05:26.479> I<00:05:26.539> guess

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
and the last sort of part of it I guess

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.830 
and the last sort of part of it I guess
is<00:05:27.560> this<00:05:27.770> where<00:05:28.610> the<00:05:28.699> players<00:05:28.970> would<00:05:29.479> come<00:05:29.690> out

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
is this where the players would come out

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.559 
is this where the players would come out
of<00:05:29.870> I<00:05:30.139> know<00:05:30.199> this<00:05:30.410> is<00:05:30.560> a<00:05:30.590> real<00:05:31.220> senior<00:05:31.910> but

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.269 

yeah<00:05:34.800> see<00:05:35.800> my<00:05:35.979> lava<00:05:36.270> lava<00:05:37.349> top<00:05:38.349> dome<00:05:38.770> I<00:05:39.039> guess

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:39.279 
yeah see my lava lava top dome I guess

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:40.619 
yeah see my lava lava top dome I guess
you<00:05:39.550> would<00:05:39.669> call<00:05:39.699> it<00:05:39.849> kinda<00:05:40.449> like<00:05:40.539> a

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:40.629 
you would call it kinda like a

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:43.409 
you would call it kinda like a
greenhouse<00:05:40.869> and<00:05:41.759> we<00:05:42.759> have<00:05:42.879> some<00:05:43.059> animals

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
greenhouse and we have some animals

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.939 
greenhouse and we have some animals
playing<00:05:43.689> and<00:05:43.990> i'll<00:05:44.259> just<00:05:44.379> show<00:05:44.589> you<00:05:44.619> the<00:05:44.770> moat

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
playing and i'll just show you the moat

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.859 
playing and i'll just show you the moat
I'll<00:05:45.219> show<00:05:45.369> you<00:05:45.429> how<00:05:45.580> I<00:05:45.629> how<00:05:46.629> I<00:05:46.659> build<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.110> moat

00:05:48.859 --> 00:05:48.869 
I'll show you how I how I build the moat

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:51.899 
I'll show you how I how I build the moat
so<00:05:49.869> it's<00:05:50.229> a<00:05:50.289> pretty<00:05:50.409> deep<00:05:50.740> moat<00:05:51.009> you<00:05:51.669> know<00:05:51.789> if

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:51.909 
so it's a pretty deep moat you know if

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:54.089 
so it's a pretty deep moat you know if
you<00:05:51.999> go<00:05:52.119> in<00:05:52.300> take<00:05:52.689> a<00:05:52.749> fall<00:05:52.990> down<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.800> look<00:05:53.919> like

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
you go in take a fall down to look like

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.749 
you go in take a fall down to look like
that<00:05:54.300> just<00:05:55.300> like<00:05:55.449> that<00:05:55.539> and<00:05:56.399> if<00:05:57.399> you<00:05:57.490> go<00:05:57.639> out

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 
that just like that and if you go out

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.369 
that just like that and if you go out
here<00:05:57.939> you<00:05:58.059> can<00:05:58.209> see<00:05:58.389> I'm<00:05:58.569> I'm<00:05:58.959> in<00:05:59.139> the<00:05:59.199> process

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
here you can see I'm I'm in the process

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.889 
here you can see I'm I'm in the process
of<00:05:59.709> building<00:05:59.889> the<00:06:00.580> rest<00:06:00.759> of<00:06:00.879> it<00:06:00.999> what<00:06:01.539> I<00:06:01.569> do<00:06:01.689> is

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:01.899 
of building the rest of it what I do is

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:06.959 
of building the rest of it what I do is
I<00:06:01.990> put<00:06:02.020> water<00:06:03.599> against<00:06:04.599> these<00:06:05.249> now<00:06:06.249> break<00:06:06.520> this

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
I put water against these now break this

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:09.089 
I put water against these now break this
whole<00:06:07.300> wall<00:06:07.539> I<00:06:07.809> do<00:06:08.409> the<00:06:08.589> same<00:06:08.619> all<00:06:08.979> the<00:06:09.069> way

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
whole wall I do the same all the way

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.079 
whole wall I do the same all the way
down<00:06:09.369> so<00:06:09.879> that<00:06:09.909> the<00:06:10.509> water<00:06:10.689> will<00:06:10.990> fill<00:06:12.089> where

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:13.089 
down so that the water will fill where

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:14.760 
down so that the water will fill where
this<00:06:13.209> space<00:06:13.479> wasn't<00:06:13.749> or<00:06:13.990> the<00:06:14.110> space<00:06:14.319> was<00:06:14.499> so

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
this space wasn't or the space was so

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.649 
this space wasn't or the space was so
essentially<00:06:15.610> i<00:06:15.669> only<00:06:15.819> have<00:06:15.939> to<00:06:16.029> use<00:06:16.149> half<00:06:16.419> as

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
essentially i only have to use half as

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.189 
essentially i only have to use half as
many<00:06:16.809> water<00:06:18.240> buckets<00:06:19.240> as<00:06:19.360> I<00:06:19.569> as<00:06:19.930> I<00:06:20.080> normally

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
many water buckets as I as I normally

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.119 
many water buckets as I as I normally
would<00:06:21.089> and<00:06:22.089> yeah<00:06:22.839> I<00:06:23.229> know<00:06:23.499> that's<00:06:23.680> probably

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:24.129 
would and yeah I know that's probably

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.339 
would and yeah I know that's probably
kind<00:06:24.399> of<00:06:24.490> boring<00:06:24.729> but<00:06:25.029> that<00:06:25.749> is<00:06:25.899> going<00:06:26.139> all<00:06:26.259> the

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
kind of boring but that is going all the
