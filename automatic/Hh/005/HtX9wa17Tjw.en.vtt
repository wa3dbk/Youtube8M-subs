00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:07.910
 hello people in this video I show 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:10.599
 you as you can prepare for 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.950
 the first driving lesson for example so 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:17.110
 that 's important when you get in 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:24.500
 Of course sometimes it would be short 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:26.239
 ensures lived below admit it 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.669
 at the same time or maybe on the 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:32.570
 left side in any case here that 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.090
 one then draws studio for so long 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.760
 positioned where you sit as a driver 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:44.860
 that you have the leftmost clutch here 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:52.420
 that one pushes but still is knee 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:55.430
 I'm not completely pushed that way 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.160
 then another important thing is of course 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.710
 that one learns first of all 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.979
 gear shift so usually the first gear 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.700
 it's all the way to the left and that is 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.930
 recommended that of course you say 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.070
 So it makes the gear shift zb 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.750
 for him 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:24.560
 you go through the gear coupling and go 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:29.090
 because the times go through 1 left at 2 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.250
 and look behind it and that's it 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.290
 therefore recommended for when you 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.960
 to get used to looking around 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.220
 You have to have a bachelor right now 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.330
 Looking now is a thinking 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.119
 or on the aisle and this is important 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.189
 so far, it is still to learn with 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.830
 come here to handbrake the 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:55.360
 handbrake the confirmed one sees there 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:57.860
 you always when you park or 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.110
 in special situations such as 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.450
 For example, on the mountain or mountain 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.770
 you start that one then not the 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.349
 keep the brake pressed all the time 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:21.849
 must and come now again for a short time 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:21.849
 There are three pedals on the pedal here 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:31.790
 rightmost is gas here in the middle 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.569
 is the brake and on the left as already 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.219
 had mentioned 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:43.540
 the clutch that is the most important 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:46.549
 then we'll get the euro in switches 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.249
 here on the left, we can do it well 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.340
 recognize 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:53.659
 the blinker right and left and if 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.859
 you also still below 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:03:00.559
 the second examined showed paten 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:04.069
 timeout davos and back down or 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:06.889
 high then that turns my light on 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.689
 park light right side view 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.859
 after which one down or up 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:16.719
 expresses that is really disgusting 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:20.439
 used in places where to place 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:24.829
 No lamp available or where the lamp 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:27.769
 from 20 o'clock everything is done so that one 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.989
 The car also recognizes a 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.040
 insurance case it is important that 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:38.779
 one since the man had it on then 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.049
 the right side it wants to see here so 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:45.249
 can once if we pull otherwise 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:49.609
 with dating we use the sprinkler in front or 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:52.279
 can also continue to edge and finish 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.529
 that's also on the back 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:57.919
 dodgers have the latest emergency 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:04:02.150
 we also back and thus my free 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:03.300
 view then when you push up then 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.350
 he is like 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.700
 just that you just wiped 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.120
 So do what I forget 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.160
 I have to say here because you are here 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.780
 drives and picks you up then you do 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:23.190
 Now who troop to 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:27.240
 then here come to the topics light so 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:30.150
 new is this circle is called 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.870
 actually only the car so tigers no 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:37.320
 Light on automatically it is at newest 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.930
 order so that then automatically always 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.820
 not settled at dusk 1 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:47.670
 had light conditions or 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:50.790
 a tunnel then dipped and off 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:56.880
 not or this stand so used 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:05:00.720
 one here because one is from the place that 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:06.060
 if you do not park that where that 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.220
 car is well exposed is the disadvantages 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:14.040
 which is simply that the battery on as 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:15.480
 much faster energy thereby yes what 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.070
 there are actually still together 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.010
 I can tell he briefly when 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:26.480
 here on press also with pressure then 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:31.950
 press the horn down here on the left 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:35.120
 is the switch for the hood that 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.120
 you can open the 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.140
 Oh yes, forgetting what to say is 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:48.940
 that of course the inside mirror 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.610
 it will have to adjust that she is fine 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.330
 it is recognizable by the person so that one 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.730
 About the view has to the rear 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:01.180
 and the mirrors you have to 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:03.930
 adjust so that you from this side 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.490
 from both so backwards 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.980
 and if not the case should be 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.110
 is here 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:15.690
 this switch theme left so in 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:18.520
 your automatic headlight 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.190
 rearview mirror that you then adjust 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.100
 can 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.540
 the right position 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:29.430
 and here at the example too 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:33.700
 there are still some shifters down here 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:38.560
 which one when you push up first 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:43.960
 nothing but that has this 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.610
 advantage that if someone away now 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.200
 not at that one did not dazzle 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:55.200
 is yes here then new tacho 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:59.650
 Tachometer and how fast you drive 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:05.610
 then here short radio 1 stars 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:05.610
 air conditioning seat heating us beige newspaper 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.780
 There is not much more to say 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.780
 start to lead
