during this process

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.260 
during this process
first<00:02:35.150> off<00:02:35.360> ect<00:02:36.670> seems<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:37.910> very<00:02:38.060> nice

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
first off ect seems like a very nice

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.900 
first off ect seems like a very nice
product<00:02:38.600> it<00:02:38.959> is<00:02:39.170> easy<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.560> work<00:02:39.680> with<00:02:39.740> and<00:02:40.310> it

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
product it is easy to work with and it

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.020 
product it is easy to work with and it
does<00:02:41.120> seem<00:02:41.360> durable<00:02:41.840> but<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.620> is<00:02:42.890> also<00:02:43.670> rather

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
does seem durable but it is also rather

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.290 
does seem durable but it is also rather
expensive<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:45.490> that's<00:02:46.490> a<00:02:46.670> result<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.120> that

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
expensive and that's a result of that

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.120 
expensive and that's a result of that
I'm<00:02:47.450> not<00:02:47.630> absolutely<00:02:47.990> certain<00:02:48.530> if<00:02:48.950> it's

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
I'm not absolutely certain if it's

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.920 
I'm not absolutely certain if it's
something<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.520> want<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.760> use<00:02:49.880> for<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.270> rest<00:02:50.810> of

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
something I want to use for the rest of

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.550 
something I want to use for the rest of
the<00:02:51.050> cabin<00:02:51.350> so<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:52.870> I'm<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.050> no<00:02:54.110> hurry<00:02:54.140> and

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
the cabin so and I'm in no hurry and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.320 
the cabin so and I'm in no hurry and
I've<00:02:54.680> got<00:02:54.890> time<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.280> take<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:55.670> closer<00:02:55.940> look<00:02:56.090> at

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
I've got time to take a closer look at

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.910 
I've got time to take a closer look at
some<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> cheaper<00:02:57.200> alternatives<00:02:57.830> out

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
some of the cheaper alternatives out

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.040 
some of the cheaper alternatives out
there<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.340> see<00:02:58.519> if<00:02:58.640> maybe<00:02:59.360> that's<00:02:59.600> something<00:02:59.989> I

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
there to see if maybe that's something I

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.229 
there to see if maybe that's something I
want<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.290> use<00:03:00.440> instead<00:03:00.739> of<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.190> ECT<00:03:01.880> and

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
want to use instead of the ECT and

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.759 
want to use instead of the ECT and
secondly<00:03:05.680> Sikaflex<00:03:07.060> 291<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.300> ECT<00:03:09.080> might<00:03:09.530> not

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
secondly Sikaflex 291 and ECT might not

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.640 
secondly Sikaflex 291 and ECT might not
be<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.160> best<00:03:10.280> combination<00:03:11.320> now<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.380> first

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
be the best combination now the first

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.979

one the black cherry and their eye I did

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.590 
one the black cherry and their eye I did
do<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.170> small<00:03:15.470> sample<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.980> see<00:03:16.160> how<00:03:16.340> well<00:03:16.600> Sigma

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
do a small sample to see how well Sigma

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.250 
do a small sample to see how well Sigma
X<00:03:17.750> 291<00:03:18.230> wasn't<00:03:18.530> here<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.890> -<00:03:19.340> ECT<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.260> that

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
seemed to hold up rather well but I've

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.800 
seemed to hold up rather well but I've
just<00:03:24.950> noticed<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.400> small<00:03:25.610> area<00:03:25.970> by<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.570> hatch

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810
