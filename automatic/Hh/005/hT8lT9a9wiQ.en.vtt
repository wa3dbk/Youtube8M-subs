00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.249 

so<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.319> boat<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.620> got<00:00:01.800> for<00:00:02.040> my<00:00:02.100> brother

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:03.259 
so this is the boat I got for my brother

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.740 
so this is the boat I got for my brother
pretty<00:00:04.259> nice<00:00:04.440> dad<00:00:05.130> says<00:00:05.400> it's<00:00:05.549> Evinrude<00:00:06.420> type

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
pretty nice dad says it's Evinrude type

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.959 
pretty nice dad says it's Evinrude type
all<00:00:08.389> starboard<00:00:09.389> side<00:00:09.950> type<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.070> controls<00:00:11.429> not

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
all starboard side type of controls not

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.350 
all starboard side type of controls not
Center<00:00:13.639> and<00:00:14.639> there<00:00:14.759> seems<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.000> be<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.179> problem

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
Center and there seems to be a problem

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.070 
Center and there seems to be a problem
with<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.020> transom<00:00:16.820> I<00:00:17.820> think<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:18.900> supposed

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
with the transom I think it's supposed

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.910 
with the transom I think it's supposed
to<00:00:19.289> be<00:00:19.380> flat<00:00:19.680> like<00:00:19.970> is<00:00:21.470> right<00:00:22.470> along<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.800> this

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
to be flat like is right along in this

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.800 
to be flat like is right along in this
area<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.910> then<00:00:24.060> as<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.390> towards<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
area but then as you get towards the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.300 
area but then as you get towards the
middle<00:00:25.160> caves<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.400> right<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:27.830> sort<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.010> see

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
middle caves in right here sort of see

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.049 
middle caves in right here sort of see
it<00:00:30.380> flat<00:00:31.489> outside<00:00:32.489> here<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.809> then<00:00:34.910> so<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.940> think

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
it flat outside here and then so I think

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.440 
it flat outside here and then so I think
that's<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.570> from<00:00:37.129> Hughes<00:00:38.450> fiberglass

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
that's just from Hughes fiberglass

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.530 
that's just from Hughes fiberglass
that's<00:00:39.600> bowed<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.550> dad<00:00:41.550> says<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.149> could<00:00:42.390> be

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
that's bowed and dad says it could be

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.520 
that's bowed and dad says it could be
otherwise<00:00:44.300> this<00:00:45.300> fiberglass<00:00:45.809> will<00:00:46.079> tend<00:00:46.469> not

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
otherwise this fiberglass will tend not

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.590 
otherwise this fiberglass will tend not
to<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.430> metal<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.760> hold<00:00:48.000> its<00:00:48.149> shape<00:00:48.239> once

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
to be like metal and hold its shape once

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.729 
to be like metal and hold its shape once
it's<00:00:48.750> bent<00:00:50.329> but<00:00:51.329> had<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> river<00:00:52.260> on

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
it's bent but had it out on the river on

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.660 
it's bent but had it out on the river on
the<00:00:52.980> 4th<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.340> July

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the 4th of July

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.650 
the 4th of July
we<00:00:54.210> ran<00:00:54.329> beautifully<00:00:54.860> up<00:00:55.860> until<00:00:56.219> almost<00:00:57.210> full

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
we ran beautifully up until almost full

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.069 
we ran beautifully up until almost full
throttle<00:00:58.190> it'll<00:00:59.190> run<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.579> definitely

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
throttle it'll run it and definitely

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.540 
throttle it'll run it and definitely
below<00:01:01.079> full<00:01:01.590> throttle<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.010> then<00:01:02.129> once<00:01:02.340> you

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
below full throttle and then once you

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.160 
below full throttle and then once you
get<00:01:03.239> into<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.780> wrong<00:01:03.960> range<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:05.010> dies

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
get into the wrong range it just dies

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
get into the wrong range it just dies
and<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.830> thought<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> bit<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:10.619> was<00:01:11.250> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and I thought for a bit that it was a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.630 
and I thought for a bit that it was a
kink<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:15.030> gas<00:01:15.900> vent<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.100> put<00:01:17.280> an<00:01:17.369> elbow

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
kink and the gas vent so I put an elbow

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.649 
kink and the gas vent so I put an elbow
in<00:01:17.759> there<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.030> hopefully<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.509> fixes<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> and

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
in there and hopefully that fixes it and

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.320 
in there and hopefully that fixes it and
we'll<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.780> how<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.930> goes<00:01:21.960> from<00:01:22.140> there<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:27.090> I've

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
we'll see how it goes from there so I've

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.749 
we'll see how it goes from there so I've
got<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> boat<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.900> river<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.890> used<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.520> have

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
got the boat in the river I used to have

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.080 
got the boat in the river I used to have
a<00:01:29.790> problem<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:31.189> almost<00:01:32.189> full<00:01:32.430> throttle<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
a problem of almost full throttle it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.429 
a problem of almost full throttle it
would<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.360> die<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.009> put<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:36.020> elbow<00:01:37.020> in

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
would just die and so I put the elbow in

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.870 
would just die and so I put the elbow in
the<00:01:38.369> gas<00:01:39.060> vent<00:01:39.390> line<00:01:39.570> right<00:01:40.320> there<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.610> they

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the gas vent line right there and they

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.910 
the gas vent line right there and they
just<00:01:42.030> ran<00:01:42.240> for<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.509> oh<00:01:42.840> five<00:01:43.530> minutes

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
just ran for about oh five minutes

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.249 
just ran for about oh five minutes
that's<00:01:44.070> opposed<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> usual<00:01:44.810> five<00:01:45.810> over

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that's opposed to the usual five over

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.730 
that's opposed to the usual five over
three<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.710> five<00:01:46.860> seconds<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:48.680> there's<00:01:49.680> a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
three to five seconds and there's a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:02:08.949 
three to five seconds and there's a
demonstration

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:30.430 

okay<00:02:09.500> here's<00:02:09.709> full-throttle

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:45.210 

about<00:02:32.390> 27

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.130 

but<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.340> trip<00:02:46.580> up<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.850> little<00:02:47.030> bit

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.330 

so<00:02:52.140> there's<00:02:52.379> the<00:02:52.620> cut<00:02:53.129> out<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.900> know<00:02:55.280> why<00:02:56.280> it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
so there's the cut out you know why it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.630 
so there's the cut out you know why it
really<00:02:56.670> does<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:58.189> used<00:02:59.189> to<00:02:59.250> happen<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.519> lot

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
really does that used to happen a lot

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.720 
really does that used to happen a lot
faster<00:02:59.700> right<00:03:00.239> after<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> full<00:03:00.720> throttle<00:03:01.730> so

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
faster right after a full throttle so

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.910 
faster right after a full throttle so
anybody<00:03:03.480> has<00:03:03.689> any<00:03:03.840> ideas<00:03:03.900> about<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:04.620> would

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
anybody has any ideas about that I would

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.089 
anybody has any ideas about that I would
love<00:03:05.189> to<00:03:05.370> hear<00:03:05.489> them<00:03:06.439> such<00:03:07.439> a<00:03:07.470> not<00:03:07.709> all<00:03:07.920> they

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
love to hear them such a not all they

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.180 
love to hear them such a not all they
will<00:03:08.280> be<00:03:08.430> enjoying<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.819> river<00:03:08.939> here
