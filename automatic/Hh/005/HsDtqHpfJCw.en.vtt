00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.120
 how are my people who speak Arabic and 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.550
 here we are going to play a little quad this 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.490
 basically it's the most idiotic game ccoo 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.490
 of the world you are a this runner 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.849
 this and then nothing basically you have to 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.009
 run 100 meters sounds easy truth 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.789
 for this guy apparently has no bone 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.760
 nor that the condemned 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:40.980
 this is this is like that is the game 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.820
 harder than I have played in all my 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.829
 lifetime 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:52.730
 but do not run back 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:56.450
 a step IFAI head 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.550
 ok let me see how is this 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.780
 ok second the w 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.780
 and a dollar 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.580
 the p at the same time does something there is 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.580
 dance 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.550
 this 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.420
 and I'm serious 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.640
 ah 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:33.830
 Do not fall down, look at God 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.440
 this game is stupid 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.430
 in the most difficult game that I have played 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.620
 in my whole life 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.720
 look look wow 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.930
 let's shoot all in 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.840
 all buttons like this runs for the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.250
 front not back 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.250
 of the type this 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.750
 without a word, do not fall 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.870
 do not 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:13.690
 let's see that taking out the roof 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:17.880
 that 's what I had there traveling had and the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.980
 combination that more 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.980
 but if not not fall 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.390
 I had and like January 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.420
 I tell you when you can do 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.780
 a backflip like that just by walking 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.780
 call 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.870
 is that whoever showed up does that 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.549
 do not fear 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.920
 and if I do this 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.710
 i 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.640
 ah 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.500
 the saints of games and idiot this 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.050
 good 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.450
 let's run 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:35.530
 I think the goal passes 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.530
 Do not fall down, you idiot 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.010
 the goal of 2.5 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.530
 they like it very well and follow it I have it 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.530
 Because I do not want to 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.310
 and we are followed that comes out so inspire 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.230
 I'll tell you how you will achieve it if you 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.500
 you will achieve what you will achieve high one 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.500
 Bush 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.720
 but if the normal one did not fall, look at it there 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.720
 is standing now fell 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:23.710
 ok I'm here breaking the floor no no 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:27.750
 it's not worth against and so I'm going to 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.750
 get there dad cacho you know what 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.510
 the first time someone running and 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.280
 then to top this music you 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.670
 inspires before everything is going to fall to shit 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.670
 hehe 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.430
 do not 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.340
 ok if this is this 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.080
 and this is 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.240
 this 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.240
 means that this is equal to this 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:07.490
 those are my scientific calculations when 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.490
 do not have to fall 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.039
 your mother 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.970
 do not 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.229
 and I just passed a helmet for the front 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.229
 From home 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:38.059
 look look 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.910
 and will do the trick that 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.910
 I was doing to see if it stays 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.490
 but he 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.100
 who wants to pass the 10 meters 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:06:01.010
 walking as well as 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:02.670
 do not fall do not drop is not 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.590
 doing a split 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.590

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.970

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.930

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.680
