 a dramatic rise in its popularity 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.530
 many recognized authors began to 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.470
 contribute with works and art is 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.510
 quickly developed at that time the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.820
 number of puppeteers for each doll 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.880
 it went from 1 to 3 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.040
 it was in the 19th century that bunraku acquired 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.010
 his current name taken from a famous 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.010
 puppet theater called accused 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.789
 a central figure of the world 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:42.060
 is the singer called stem one 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.229
 singer gives voice to all the characters 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.899
 alternating his tone to portray 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.140
 any character is a young girl 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.789
 or an elderly man is also in charge 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.450
 of the narrative so that the story 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.450
 Advance 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.509
 the music of james in adds a great 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.170
 emotion to the words and actions in 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.170
 stage 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.890
 like ryan 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.250
 working in harmony with the singer the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.410
 Chamis interpreter to help the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.680
 audience feels alive the world of 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.680
 puppets 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.090
 the head and the right hand 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.010
 left and the legs are handled from 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.760
 separated form by three puppets 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.760
 different 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.639
 the master puppeteer puts his hand 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.129
 left inside the doll's body 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:44.290
 to support him and control the head the 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.010
 another hand manipulates the right arm and the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.010
 hand of the puppet 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.140
 the puppeteer who controls the hand 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.000
 left is also responsible for the 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.000
 necessary props in every scene 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.470
 and the third is responsible for moving the 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.470
 feet and legs of the single 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.180
 Many years of practice are required 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.340
 before three artists are able 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.079
 to control their actions with enough 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.340
 precision to give life to 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.340
 movements of the grandson 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.120
 master a single paper takes 20 or maybe 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.120
 30 years without long practice 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.270
 movements do not seem right 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.850
 we continue studying throughout life 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.340
 i 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.770
 the themes of bunga works that go 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.960
 from real historical stories to dramas 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.470
 romantics and fantastic stories and 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.470
 magical 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.120
 same 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.040
 in this scene a princess uses her 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.299
 magical powers to rescue his 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.299
 promised of danger 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.610
 It is wonderful to think about what old 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.530
 this amazing art has so much that 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.480
 enjoy singing the music and for 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.310
 course the actions and the emotions 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.410
 that we express through their grandchildren 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.560
 so there's magic on stage 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.930
 we have to act together for my album 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.850
 Draco is an art that is enjoyed without 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.850
 have to add explanations 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.870
 passed down from generation to generation 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.939
 Bunraku theater continues to delight the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.779
 audiences through the ability to 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.779
 all his artists
