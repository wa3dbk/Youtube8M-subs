team they were very disciplined tonight

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.850 
team they were very disciplined tonight
I<00:00:09.910> think<00:00:10.690> it<00:00:10.750> was<00:00:10.870> really<00:00:11.110> good<00:00:11.320> for<00:00:11.500> us<00:00:11.589> to<00:00:11.710> get

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
I think it was really good for us to get

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.950 
I think it was really good for us to get
the<00:00:11.980> early<00:00:12.250> goal<00:00:12.460> he<00:00:13.059> had<00:00:13.240> to<00:00:13.360> make<00:00:13.509> them<00:00:13.690> open

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
the early goal he had to make them open

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.390 
the early goal he had to make them open
up<00:00:14.049> a<00:00:14.169> little<00:00:14.290> bit<00:00:14.530> so<00:00:14.799> the<00:00:14.919> game<00:00:15.070> became<00:00:15.339> a

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
up a little bit so the game became a

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.100 
up a little bit so the game became a
little<00:00:15.580> different<00:00:16.059> which<00:00:16.510> was<00:00:16.660> good<00:00:16.840> for<00:00:16.870> us

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
little different which was good for us

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.600 
little different which was good for us
to<00:00:17.230> have<00:00:17.260> that<00:00:17.380> kind<00:00:17.740> of<00:00:17.800> put<00:00:18.250> you<00:00:18.340> know<00:00:18.430> that

from<00:00:23.620> that<00:00:23.650> perspective<00:00:23.890> was<00:00:24.280> great<00:00:24.490> and<00:00:24.670> for

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
from that perspective was great and for

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.060 
from that perspective was great and for
us<00:00:24.910> to<00:00:24.940> get<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.240> second<00:00:25.600> goal<00:00:25.630> was<00:00:25.780> was<00:00:26.440> you

us to get the second goal was was you

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.350 
us to get the second goal was was you
know<00:00:27.160> was<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.400> nail<00:00:27.550> in<00:00:27.580> the<00:00:27.730> coffin<00:00:27.760> but<00:00:28.150> more

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
know was the nail in the coffin but more

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.850 
know was the nail in the coffin but more
importantly<00:00:28.750> it<00:00:28.870> was<00:00:28.930> great<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.380> see<00:00:29.410> that<00:00:29.590> we

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
importantly it was great to see that we

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.380 
importantly it was great to see that we
were<00:00:29.920> still<00:00:30.160> discipline<00:00:30.610> defensively<00:00:31.060> and<00:00:31.270> we

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
were still discipline defensively and we

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.849 
were still discipline defensively and we
didn't<00:00:31.570> give<00:00:31.660> anything<00:00:31.840> away<00:00:32.050> and<00:00:32.469> we're

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:32.859 
didn't give anything away and we're

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:34.169 
didn't give anything away and we're
still<00:00:33.039> able<00:00:33.160> to<00:00:33.309> get<00:00:33.399> the<00:00:33.489> counter<00:00:33.820> and<00:00:33.910> scored

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:34.179 
still able to get the counter and scored

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.470 
still able to get the counter and scored
the<00:00:34.769> yeah<00:00:35.769> I<00:00:35.800> think<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.969> were<00:00:37.089> able<00:00:37.149> to<00:00:37.359> come

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
the yeah I think we were able to come

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.139 
the yeah I think we were able to come
out<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.620> get<00:00:39.399> an<00:00:39.519> early<00:00:39.730> goal<00:00:39.879> which<00:00:40.120> was

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
out and get an early goal which was

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.470 
out and get an early goal which was
which<00:00:40.809> is<00:00:40.960> big<00:00:41.140> for<00:00:41.320> us<00:00:41.379> and<00:00:41.679> our<00:00:42.239> pressure<00:00:43.239> up

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
which is big for us and our pressure up

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.750 
which is big for us and our pressure up
top<00:00:43.719> beginning<00:00:44.589> or<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:44.859> first<00:00:45.309> half<00:00:45.489> really

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
top beginning or the first half really

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.029 
top beginning or the first half really
though<00:00:45.909> in<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.210> entire<00:00:46.480> first<00:00:46.629> half<00:00:46.890> gave<00:00:47.890> him

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
though in the entire first half gave him

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.340 
though in the entire first half gave him
really<00:00:48.190> nothing<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.719> hard<00:00:49.899> from<00:00:50.050> the<00:00:50.079> play

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
really nothing it's hard from the play

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.130 
really nothing it's hard from the play
out<00:00:50.469> of<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.620> back

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
out of the back

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500 
out of the back
it<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.130> very<00:00:53.160> important<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.670> us<00:00:53.790> to<00:00:53.820> come<00:00:54.390> in

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
it was very important for us to come in

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.619 
it was very important for us to come in
at<00:00:54.600> halftime<00:00:54.829> up<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.980> goal<00:00:56.840> we<00:00:57.840> held<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:59.629> second

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
at halftime up a goal we held out second

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.750 
at halftime up a goal we held out second
half<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.770> allow<00:01:02.010> them<00:01:02.190> get<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> goal<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
half and then allow them get a goal and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.329 
half and then allow them get a goal and
then<00:01:02.910> finish<00:01:03.840> them<00:01:03.870> off<00:01:04.050> late<00:01:04.290> very<00:01:04.860> very<00:01:05.070> good

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
then finish them off late very very good

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.260 
then finish them off late very very good
performance<00:01:05.550> I<00:01:07.460> think<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.610> were<00:01:08.670> extremely

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
performance I think we were extremely

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.850 
performance I think we were extremely
solid<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:11.520> didn't<00:01:11.759> give<00:01:11.850> much<00:01:12.030> away<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.860> few

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
solid and we didn't give much away a few

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
solid and we didn't give much away a few
times<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.759> got<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.940> little<00:01:15.180> dangerous<00:01:15.690> because

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
times you got a little dangerous because

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.760 
times you got a little dangerous because
we're<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:17.030> well<00:01:18.030> enough<00:01:18.240> organized<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.590> we

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
we're not well enough organized but we

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.969 
we're not well enough organized but we
kept<00:01:19.979> them<00:01:20.100> away<00:01:20.340> from<00:01:20.400> from<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> big<00:01:21.180> chances

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
kept them away from from the big chances

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.999 
kept them away from from the big chances
I<00:01:23.060> think<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.149> proved<00:01:24.420> again<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.979> we're<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
I think we proved again that we're a

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.540 
I think we proved again that we're a
good<00:01:26.130> team<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:27.270> were<00:01:27.530> strong<00:01:28.530> team<00:01:28.800> we're<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
good team we were strong team we're a

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.320 
good team we were strong team we're a
hard<00:01:29.820> team<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.119> beat<00:01:31.640> we<00:01:32.640> had<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.789> lot<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> those

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
hard team to beat we had a lot of those

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.740 
hard team to beat we had a lot of those
games<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:34.200> home<00:01:34.440> like<00:01:34.860> tonight<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.570> big

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170
