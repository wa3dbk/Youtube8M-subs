00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.199 
easy way to do this I'm not going to put
any<00:02:01.289> lines<00:02:01.619> especially<00:02:02.190> because<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.970> flowy

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
any lines especially because the flowy

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.190 
any lines especially because the flowy

along<00:04:20.940> your<00:04:21.960> cell<00:04:22.960> line<00:04:23.340> about<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.670> half<00:04:25.000> inch

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
along your cell line about a half inch

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.990 
along your cell line about a half inch
on<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.800> outside<00:04:27.160> of<00:04:27.190> your<00:04:27.340> cell<00:04:27.550> line<00:04:27.760> and

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
on the outside of your cell line and

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.990 
on the outside of your cell line and
then<00:04:28.750> we're<00:04:28.870> going<00:04:28.960> to<00:04:29.050> do<00:04:29.170> a<00:04:29.200> zigzag<00:04:29.500> pattern

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
then we're going to do a zigzag pattern

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.670 
then we're going to do a zigzag pattern
just<00:04:31.000> so<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:31.240> doesn't<00:04:31.270> fray<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.440> we<00:04:32.530> don't

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
just so it doesn't fray and we don't

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.220 
just so it doesn't fray and we don't
have<00:04:32.770> all<00:04:32.890> this<00:04:32.980> extra<00:04:33.160> material<00:04:34.170> so<00:04:35.170> I'll

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
have all this extra material so I'll

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.940 
have all this extra material so I'll
