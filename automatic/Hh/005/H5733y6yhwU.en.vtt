00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.450
 Mainz 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.099
 the US Open 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:31.129
 This process will be supported by the state in March 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.990
 I really like that for the evolution at the end of the event 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.870
 but also to commit to leadership issues and in between, I even have 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.870
 small group competitions made that all very well 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.420
 and, of course, events on the movement again and again 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.590
 In the past, it was mostly the performance of a world that was more native and more fulfilling 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.930
 Scoring points so well a piece of paper or for posters seen 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.580
 Has 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.850
 and then poll points makes by the way is it to drive this modern order 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.370
 much faster and much more pleasant much faster and also makes the 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.370
 Students much more enjoyment 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.350
 Kiessling 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.570
 So who of course sees your own city that you still have the participants 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.710
 wait 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.280
 and if they then say it to me, for example, as an ambulance at the beginning 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.390
 want to know a course then we all point to it as well 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.330
 The others have nothing to do, of course, prepare a completely 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.110
 wrong impression if you make an evolution in the end 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.120
 then it is especially difficult for everyone to ask their opinion 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.020
 because of course, according to social desirability answers than 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.090
 extraordinary what you expect what to say 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.850
 and that's not just faster about their voting procedures 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.850
 but I also believe in a lot of statements 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.990
 So to a source in the way more productive than a better one 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.280
 Regression gets 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.109
 depending on how you use it 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.520
 They are also faster and therefore more efficient than other methods I use 

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.829
 That would also be Szostak's motivation for everyone involved in both 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.399
 Patients as well as for the students is not low rated and it is 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.090
 quite simply you finally something is going on
