00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
exactly except if you guys want to try

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.319 
exactly except if you guys want to try
and<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:01.370> assault<00:01:02.370> Moab<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> way

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
and get a assault Moab this is the way

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.679 
and get a assault Moab this is the way
to<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.280> easy

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
to do it it really is it's it's not easy

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.120 
to do it it really is it's it's not easy
but<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.350> somewhat<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.100> challenge

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
but it's it's somewhat of a challenge

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.679 
but it's it's somewhat of a challenge
because<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> stay<00:01:09.210> long<00:01:09.450> long

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
because you have to stay long long

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.990 
because you have to stay long long
enough<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.189> little<00:01:11.340> difficult<00:01:11.610> because

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
enough it's a little difficult because

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
enough it's a little difficult because
if<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> whole<00:01:12.630> enemy<00:01:12.810> team<00:01:12.990> sees<00:01:13.409> you're

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
if the whole enemy team sees you're

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.969 
if the whole enemy team sees you're
using<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.159> UAV<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.259> prepare<00:01:16.560> lee<00:01:16.770> call

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
using a UAV and you can prepare lee call

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.830 
using a UAV and you can prepare lee call
them<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.280> pretty<00:01:17.610> much<00:01:17.640> every<00:01:18.030> other<00:01:18.150> kill<00:01:18.479> um

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
them in pretty much every other kill um

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.320 
them in pretty much every other kill um
they're<00:01:19.799> gonna<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> little<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.640> huh<00:01:20.939> I

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
they're gonna get a little like huh I

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.450 
they're gonna get a little like huh I
wonder<00:01:21.869> if<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.170> guy's<00:01:22.350> running<00:01:22.500> UAV<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.189> all

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
wonder if this guy's running UAV and all

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.590 
wonder if this guy's running UAV and all
of<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.610> sudden<00:01:23.880> they're<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.210> gonna<00:01:24.299> start

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
of a sudden they're just gonna start

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.969 
of a sudden they're just gonna start
using<00:01:24.780> assassin<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.619> becomes<00:01:25.830> very

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
using assassin and it becomes very

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.300 
using assassin and it becomes very
difficult<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.900> got<00:01:27.900> lucky<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.220> know

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
difficult I got lucky here with you know

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.130 
difficult I got lucky here with you know
not<00:01:29.430> everybody<00:01:29.939> started<00:01:30.240> using<00:01:30.390> assassin<00:01:30.990> but

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
not everybody started using assassin but
