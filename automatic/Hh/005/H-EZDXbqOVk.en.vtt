this<00:04:44.720> I<00:04:44.870> hit<00:04:45.020> record<00:04:45.440> but<00:04:46.099> it's<00:04:46.220> so<00:04:46.430> cool

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
this I hit record but it's so cool

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.400 
this I hit record but it's so cool
because<00:04:46.910> when<00:04:47.180> you<00:04:47.270> you<00:04:47.539> could<00:04:47.720> run<00:04:48.050> over<00:04:48.080> the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
because when you you could run over the

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.749 
because when you you could run over the
camera<00:04:48.680> you<00:04:48.740> can<00:04:48.889> run<00:04:49.039> towards<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.430> camera

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
camera you can run towards the camera

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.309 
camera you can run towards the camera
well<00:04:49.880> don't<00:04:50.000> run<00:04:50.210> over<00:04:50.389> it<00:04:50.599> but<00:04:50.720> I<00:04:50.750> mean<00:04:51.199> like

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
well don't run over it but I mean like

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:52.870 
well don't run over it but I mean like
run<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:51.740> step<00:04:51.979> over<00:04:52.099> it<00:04:52.310> you<00:04:52.490> can<00:04:52.580> put<00:04:52.759> it<00:04:52.789> down

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
run and step over it you can put it down

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.330 
run and step over it you can put it down
here<00:04:53.060> you<00:04:53.120> can<00:04:53.240> run<00:04:53.509> by<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:54.919> get<00:04:55.039> really

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
here you can run by and you get really

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.950 
here you can run by and you get really
cool<00:04:55.490> angles<00:04:55.669> that<00:04:56.120> people<00:04:56.389> just<00:04:56.630> normally

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
cool angles that people just normally

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.499 
cool angles that people just normally
wouldn't<00:04:57.259> get<00:04:57.380> with<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:57.949> DSLR<00:04:58.699> you<00:04:59.210> can<00:04:59.360> put

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
wouldn't get with the DSLR you can put

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:00.790 
wouldn't get with the DSLR you can put
it<00:04:59.599> up<00:04:59.690> high<00:04:59.840> down<00:04:59.900> low<00:05:00.259> you<00:05:00.289> can<00:05:00.500> put<00:05:00.650> it<00:05:00.710> in

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
it up high down low you can put it in

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.290 
it up high down low you can put it in
bushes<00:05:01.130> you<00:05:01.220> can<00:05:01.250> get<00:05:01.520> different<00:05:01.699> angles<00:05:02.150> and

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
bushes you can get different angles and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.510 
bushes you can get different angles and
that<00:05:02.840> really<00:05:03.259> hooks<00:05:03.919> people<00:05:04.250> into<00:05:04.460> your

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
that really hooks people into your

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.770 
that really hooks people into your
videos<00:05:04.910> because<00:05:05.120> it's<00:05:05.360> something<00:05:05.660> they're

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
videos because it's something they're

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.060 
videos because it's something they're
not<00:05:05.900> used<00:05:06.139> to<00:05:06.229> it's<00:05:06.440> something<00:05:06.740> that<00:05:06.889> they

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
not used to it's something that they

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.800 
not used to it's something that they
don't<00:05:07.280> normally<00:05:07.550> see<00:05:08.120> and<00:05:08.360> so<00:05:08.539> I<00:05:08.570> would

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
don't normally see and so I would

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.629 
don't normally see and so I would
definitely<00:05:09.259> recommend<00:05:09.349> that<00:05:09.800> as<00:05:10.009> well<00:05:10.250> the

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
definitely recommend that as well the

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.610

lapses which you will see in a lot of
our<00:05:31.490> vlogs<00:05:31.759> you<00:05:32.389> can<00:05:32.630> do<00:05:32.750> slow-mo<00:05:33.320> footage<00:05:33.680> and

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
our vlogs you can do slow-mo footage and

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.749 
our vlogs you can do slow-mo footage and
with<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.500> galaxy<00:05:36.500> s5<00:05:36.740> we<00:05:37.070> can<00:05:37.220> do<00:05:37.280> 60<00:05:37.520> frames

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
with the galaxy s5 we can do 60 frames

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.370 
with the galaxy s5 we can do 60 frames
per<00:05:37.970> second<00:05:38.330> which<00:05:38.449> allows<00:05:38.750> us<00:05:38.990> in<00:05:39.199> our

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
per second which allows us in our

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.610 
per second which allows us in our
editing<00:05:39.800> to<00:05:40.340> do<00:05:40.490> a<00:05:40.520> lot<00:05:40.789> of<00:05:41.259> slow<00:05:42.259> modes<00:05:42.500> and

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
editing to do a lot of slow modes and

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.409 
editing to do a lot of slow modes and
stuff<00:05:42.770> like<00:05:42.860> that<00:05:43.070> now<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.729> biggest<00:05:44.000> reason

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
stuff like that now the biggest reason

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.110
