 lately have programmed yes 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.170
 it is a control 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.809

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.670

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:24.300
 can create and so on the whole 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:26.609
 is not currently working on that we do not care 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.560
 I just stop all the running with 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.800
 ajax technology that means he calls everything 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.800
 in the background namely who good 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.329
 the whole thing is going on with alexander's traveling 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.620
 experienced the pages in the background and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.890
 Check the doping and then stop 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.079
 just arrived here and experienced the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.199
 page not completely new but hold 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.149
 in the background and will be fast 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.309
 Now we see our control 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.320
 panel after us have logged one 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.059
 if we have the roots of super breathable 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.760
 then we see the left here too 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.640
 see administration otherwise 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.260
 we profile lockout explained before 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.479
 and you have no servers to declare 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.580
 well said that means we create 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:17.700
 us first server that one can only as 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:20.909

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.400
 on to a 50 and a maximum of npcs 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.780
 spelling errors found on 25 like

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.570

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.729

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.259
 just here new server under this ip 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.000
 126 82 41 130 runs in the local 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.149
 intranet that means you can not do it 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.899
 I do not connect to it because he does 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:56.149
 is offline and now live here 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.149
 server to server 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.720
 that was a bit to load now because 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:06.580
 there is offline and I have ascot 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.530
 open the maximum connection parts 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.460
 bit high set what we say 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.440
 we need it 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.840
 we are only going to see the overview offline 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.460
 running under the ip nobody is online 250 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.070
 vac found 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.230
 maximum player that 's the limit 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.990
 The Edwin has set that is the limit 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.980
 What we use is the limit 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.620
 the breathing law has for npcs and that 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.330
 is that we are with what we use with 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.260
 start-stop belongs to life and start 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.550
 it will not stop now 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.630
 work because it is still empty 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.160
 with attitude you can love 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.260
 Funnily enough 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.510
 with version we can download the new version 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.000
 from velvet on it install fdp 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.540
 We even have users like us 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 practical and reinstall 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.350
 I just forgot that 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.780
 I deleted that had again just 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.220
 completely new to him 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.720
 The database is taught but I have 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.120
 forget the fdp users between 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.850
 Sorry my fault no matter we 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.709
 just create again 9 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:14.709
 Take the password with the comment 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:21.120
 we will put time and tempo as comments to 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.120
 Let's say password is easy 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.380
 I have the commentary that way 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.770
 thought that you can do that 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.520
 so you just stop, for example 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.290
 can write 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.630
 this fdp account will be for the control 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.680
 panel used and then you see just 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.050
 just always hahaha user 1331 animal is 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.100
 since just for the control panel is the 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.550
 Let's try it now 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.140
 not on this ftp server 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:04:00.110
 that is the ip from this server 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:04:04.400
 password is was made connection 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.620
 get message now we are in it 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.410
 we see filters goodgame mut plugins 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.940
 and script palatine that is because 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.640
 we still have a server version up 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.500
 have installed but that is also only 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.040
 Let's not care, we'll invite you first 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.299
 point mx ingame courage what the tv 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.790
 everyone will probably have now 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.270
 can put together the 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.270
 first one 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.530
 take as host we take who I 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:44.720
 have no idea what he is for a script 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:46.340
 mega xd 0 800 is cool and the rest 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.280
 we just let our set 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.990
 order has been sent 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:56.680
 Now we set the version to 0.32 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.680
 and start in server 

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:07.129
 and now we are waiting for a moment 

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:10.550
 again and we are only online now 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:13.909
 none of 250 players are on it and 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:21.019
 fact is online and barry live with 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:24.489
 20 800 then we can now current 

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:24.489
 stop the server again 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.730
 he is offline again that's it 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:41.800
 now first with the preview of 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:43.750
 control panel and I still find one 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.100
 nice evening or a nice morning 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.580
 depending on how long that takes it up 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.240
 to build 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.240
 bye
