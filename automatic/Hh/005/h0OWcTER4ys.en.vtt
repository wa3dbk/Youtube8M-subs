00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.480
 hello here taboga le mans the planet 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:15.929
 today for you protein dessert a new one 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.590
 Product of us just snack without 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.350
 contrition 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.500
 that's important to you, too 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.199
 We all want to eat after the meal 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.460
 maybe even at night I eat where 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.820
 So a bit of musical cola 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.800
 Tastes at Storkow for example or 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.829
 vanilla or caramel here we have 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.620
 three flavors at about 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.710
 100 grams 80 grams of protein ten grams 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.760
 carbohydrates and 3 grams of fat 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.610
 if we water it all now 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.559
 then we really do not mix 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.329
 additional values if we do that 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.899
 then we have one 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.390
 bit of carbs and fat but with 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.289
 0 5 percent would have the field still 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.140
 to reckon with 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.489
 but that's not an issue and that 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.809
 No values ​​are a low carb diet 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.880
 standing in the way 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.330
 so I'll show you on how simple 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.460
 I can do that all the time 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.030
 with a milk we have 200 here 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.159
 ml 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.200
 I'll just do that in the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.780
 bowl and here we can 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.450
 as I said once with a whisk 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.380
 what I recommend is of course afterwards 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.299
 to rinse 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.950
 but it works with the spoon and me 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.750
 me today with spoon 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.729
 demonstrate that even with one 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.820
 spoon goes 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.280
 we'll just be 30 grams here 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.380
 weighed please make it exactly in case 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.880
 as not quite so accurate that could be 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.280
 also dilute again with a little milk 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.990
 because otherwise it tastes a bit floury 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.540
 and we do not want that yes , yes 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.579
 really delicious after pudding so taste 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.540
 Now I have the powder with me 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.590
 added 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.850
 I hear that here so possible 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.750
 Seeing yourself can be wonderful 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.270
 stir in here 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.659
 you are beginning to see the consistency 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.959
 it is getting creamier 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.610
 I really reach three minutes it 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.769
 always do it a bit faster with it 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:22.519
 we have no clumps here either 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:36.260
 We do not want it so nice 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:38.810
 is always creamy so now again 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.069
 one minute for two minutes and even five 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.379
 ask me the fridge 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.040
 then it will be cool again and will be too 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:48.319
 that you are here for a short time 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.269
 Here I have the whole the 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.349
 possibility with water I have completely 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.840
 cold water from the fridge 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:59.090
 and here he wants to be 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.640
 really 200 ml out please be so accurate 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.069
 as possible otherwise as I would have said 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.660
 just a little bit more powder 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:11.209
 mix or consensual liquid 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:15.079
 here it is vanilla I take here now 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.430
 Pure mixa is just as good if he is 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.980
 here, of course, too much pro takes over 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.889
 then everything stays in the shaker afterwards 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.480
 are really 5 seconds 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.940
 that's enough for me , it's all very well 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.450
 just go ahead as I said be careful 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.700
 that they are not so much here 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:36.889
 take it wonderful if he himself 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.109
 You are welcome to come too 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.769
 have a sample and you will soon notice 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.380
 how great the whole thing tastes 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.960
 problems is always fixed 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.990
 well that's a helping part for me 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.810
 so that was already for me to play 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.460
 then as always our shaker one yes 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.660
 can also be stuck in the dishwasher 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.530
 so that's easy here at putin 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.260
 You see, it's getting tighter and tighter 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:13.820
 already and really tastes completely 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:17.450
 bad as I said in the Chinese 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.890
 even creamier and longer in the 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.680
 fridge is the better 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.840
 tastes nice cold 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:31.910
 I like it cold but it is too 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:34.730
 a matter of taste is here too 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.880

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.780
 made of water 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.540
