00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
anything anything I could find just so I

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:33.930 
anything anything I could find just so I
could<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:32.980> think<00:03:33.040> just<00:03:33.400> so<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.550> could<00:03:33.700> go<00:03:33.849> and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
could I think just so I could go and

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.270 
could I think just so I could go and
talk<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.239> people<00:03:34.620> my<00:03:35.620> parents<00:03:35.830> didn't<00:03:36.250> believe

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
talk to people my parents didn't believe

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.740 
talk to people my parents didn't believe
in<00:03:36.700> giving<00:03:37.660> things<00:03:38.849> just<00:03:39.849> because<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.450> wanted

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
in giving things just because you wanted

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.839 
in giving things just because you wanted
it<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.110> so<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.739> had<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.040> find<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.400> way<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.549> earn

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
it and so you had to find a way to earn

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.330 
it and so you had to find a way to earn
it<00:03:43.030> or<00:03:43.269> deserve<00:03:43.299> it<00:03:43.959> or<00:03:44.110> something<00:03:44.530> specific

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
it or deserve it or something specific

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.100 
it or deserve it or something specific
and<00:03:45.519> I<00:03:45.610> guess<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:45.910> knew<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:46.780> would<00:03:46.959> go<00:03:47.080> into

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
and I guess I knew that I would go into

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.920 
and I guess I knew that I would go into
business<00:03:48.000> at<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.180> point<00:03:49.450> in<00:03:49.510> time<00:03:49.540> although

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
business at that point in time although

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.150 
business at that point in time although
I<00:03:49.959> went<00:03:50.200> through<00:03:50.349> plenty<00:03:50.709> of<00:03:50.799> years<00:03:50.950> where<00:03:51.130> I

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
I went through plenty of years where I

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.580 
I went through plenty of years where I
didn't<00:03:51.519> really<00:03:51.730> remember<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:52.390> but<00:03:53.110> when<00:03:53.440> it

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
didn't really remember that but when it

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.130 
didn't really remember that but when it
all<00:03:53.709> came<00:03:53.980> around<00:03:54.220> full<00:03:54.640> circle<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:55.299> realized

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
all came around full circle I realized

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.339 
all came around full circle I realized
that<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.739> had<00:03:57.099> started<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.519> path<00:03:58.049> very<00:03:59.049> early

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
that I had started that path very early

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.220 
that I had started that path very early
on<00:03:59.380> I<00:03:59.890> tell<00:04:00.670> everybody<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.420> Joanne<00:04:01.810> runs<00:04:02.049> the

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.699 

so<00:04:09.630> when<00:04:09.810> we<00:04:09.930> first<00:04:10.140> bought<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.440> restaurant
