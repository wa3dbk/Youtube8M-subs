00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.900
It’s so dark here

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.900
Shine some light on me

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I’m killing my breath in this dark silence

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Things that I could only see faintly don’t even have an after image anymore

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.500
They turn against me

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.500
But it’s alright, things’ll get better

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.000
I tell myself but the only thing that returns is silence and my weakness

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Time is running out and it keeps pushing me

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But the only thing I can do right now is wait for you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.500
I don’t even expect happiness

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.900
I just want you to be here

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That alone can make the clouds above my head go away

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Even if I get hurt and fall down so much that I can’t get up again

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.900
You’re the reason that I get better

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.900
That alone was enough for me

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I thought I became a pretty decent person when I was with you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.900
Even my dirtiness became clean when I was with you

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But you’re not here anymore and now I question the purpose of my life

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Because without you, I have nothing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It feels like we’re stopped in eternity

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Your hands can’t reach my spreading tears

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Please rain on my coldly frozen heart so I can breathe

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Please wake me from this nightmare

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Whether my scars all healed or disappeared from the start

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Whether my blackened memories met the light or was erased from the dazzling light

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Your warm arms that embraced me was heaven

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now I can’t find you anywhere, it’s hell

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You’re too big of a presence to bury it all under

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So even if everything gets taken away from me, I want to turn things back

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Even if the world’s sharpest thorns arise on my way to you

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I’ll imagine us smiling at the end as I run through with bare feet

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It feels like we’re stopped in eternity

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Your hands can’t reach my spreading tears

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Please rain on my coldly frozen heart so I can breathe

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Please wake me from this nightmare

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The scars nailed into my heart can’t be erased

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I can’t forget you, who crossed over the darkness and came to me

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
In our last memory, we were like different people

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Your hands can’t reach my spreading tears

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Please rain on my coldly frozen heart so I can breathe

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Please wake me from this nightmare
