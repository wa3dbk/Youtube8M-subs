00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.010 
things probably would have to be a
probably<00:06:03.849> sell<00:06:04.090> more<00:06:04.120> of<00:06:04.330> that<00:06:04.539> stuff<00:06:04.719> it

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
probably sell more of that stuff it

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.659 
probably sell more of that stuff it
would<00:06:05.199> have<00:06:05.289> probably<00:06:05.409> fell<00:06:06.039> off<00:06:06.219> the<00:06:06.310> shelves

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
would have probably fell off the shelves

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.700 
would have probably fell off the shelves
so<00:06:07.120> i<00:06:07.150> did<00:06:07.509> see<00:06:07.659> one<00:06:07.810> or<00:06:07.900> two<00:06:08.020> things<00:06:08.050> but

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
so i did see one or two things but

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.200 
so i did see one or two things but
didn't<00:06:09.280> bother<00:06:09.400> buying<00:06:09.610> it<00:06:09.880> because<00:06:09.940> it<00:06:10.150> was

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
didn't bother buying it because it was

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.360 
didn't bother buying it because it was
just<00:06:10.300> too<00:06:10.449> small<00:06:10.719> but<00:06:11.259> i<00:06:11.320> did<00:06:11.560> get<00:06:11.770> three<00:06:12.250> of

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
just too small but i did get three of

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.499 
just too small but i did get three of
her<00:06:12.460> bracelets<00:06:12.969> which<00:06:13.120> I<00:06:13.240> really<00:06:13.419> like

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:16.509 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.549 

you<00:06:17.509> have<00:06:17.629> to<00:06:17.749> buy<00:06:17.869> them<00:06:18.020> each<00:06:18.259> individually

00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:18.559 
you have to buy them each individually

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:20.879 
you have to buy them each individually
on<00:06:19.069> their<00:06:19.249> own<00:06:19.400> so<00:06:19.669> I<00:06:19.729> got<00:06:19.909> three<00:06:20.180> of<00:06:20.270> them<00:06:20.389> I

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
on their own so I got three of them I

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.820 
on their own so I got three of them I
like<00:06:21.889> them<00:06:22.809> that's<00:06:23.809> pretty<00:06:24.020> cool<00:06:24.259> they're

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
like them that's pretty cool they're

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:33.920
