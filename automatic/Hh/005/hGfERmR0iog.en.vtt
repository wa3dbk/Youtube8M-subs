00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
like that man stops in 30 I found some

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.250 
like that man stops in 30 I found some
server<00:02:47.980> results<00:02:48.550> this<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:49.000> got<00:02:49.540> better<00:02:49.900> frame

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
server results this I got better frame

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.580 
server results this I got better frame
rate<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:50.620> not<00:02:50.830> so<00:02:51.069> much<00:02:51.310> like<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:53.200> problem

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
rate but not so much like the problem

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.009 
rate but not so much like the problem
like<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:54.010> go<00:02:54.190> for<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.730> play<00:02:55.120> called<00:02:55.569> beauty<00:02:55.930> or

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
like a go for I play called beauty or

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.160 
like a go for I play called beauty or
guys<00:02:56.260> like<00:02:56.530> like<00:02:57.090> 1332<00:02:58.090> or<00:02:58.630> something<00:02:59.019> but

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
guys like like 1332 or something but

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.800 
guys like like 1332 or something but
this<00:02:59.230> one<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.440> got<00:02:59.620> like<00:02:59.739> 39<00:03:00.040> 40<00:03:00.640> so<00:03:01.450> he's

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
this one I got like 39 40 so he's

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.220 
this one I got like 39 40 so he's
depending<00:03:02.200> on<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.380> game<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:03.910> eventually<00:03:04.870> you

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
depending on the game but eventually you

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.140 
depending on the game but eventually you
would<00:03:05.350> get<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:06.010> graphic<00:03:06.370> card<00:03:06.580> with<00:03:06.790> Charis

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
would get the graphic card with Charis

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.710 
would get the graphic card with Charis
main<00:03:07.360> memory<00:03:08.069> ok<00:03:09.069> so<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:10.299> plane<00:03:10.569> is<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:12.720> more

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
main memory ok so the plane is the more

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.990 
main memory ok so the plane is the more
importantly<00:03:14.459> most<00:03:15.459> important

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
importantly most important

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.350 
importantly most important
considerations<00:03:16.810> should<00:03:16.900> not<00:03:17.170> be<00:03:17.350> price

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
considerations should not be price

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.580 
considerations should not be price
should<00:03:19.360> not<00:03:19.510> be<00:03:19.630> too<00:03:19.750> hard<00:03:19.959> drive<00:03:20.200> should<00:03:20.230> not

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
be the you know processor should not be

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.509 
be the you know processor should not be
the<00:03:23.200> ram<00:03:23.470> but<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:23.830> should<00:03:23.950> be<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.160> graphic

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
the ram but it should be the graphic

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.539 
the ram but it should be the graphic
card<00:03:24.819> and<00:03:25.200> then<00:03:26.200> obviously<00:03:26.500> if<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.100> compare

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
card and then obviously if you compare

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.180 
card and then obviously if you compare

are<00:03:35.920> almost<00:03:36.130> promote<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.730> same<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.329> what

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
are almost promote the same so what

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.970 
are almost promote the same so what
would<00:03:37.780> be<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.079> difference<00:03:38.260> between<00:03:38.530> the
