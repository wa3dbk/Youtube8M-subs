watching video the camera is also

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.359 
watching video the camera is also
improved<00:01:49.110> they<00:01:50.110> now<00:01:50.380> call<00:01:50.619> it<00:01:50.829> an<00:01:51.009> isight

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
improved they now call it an isight

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.469 
improved they now call it an isight
camera<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.720> one<00:01:52.899> on<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.290> iphone<00:01:53.590> 5<00:01:53.829> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
camera like the one on the iphone 5 and

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.990 
camera like the one on the iphone 5 and
the<00:01:55.479> iPad<00:01:55.509> 3<00:01:56.229> it's<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.619> 5<00:01:56.829> megapixel<00:01:57.009> camera<00:01:57.850> it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
the iPad 3 it's a 5 megapixel camera it

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.840 
the iPad 3 it's a 5 megapixel camera it
uses<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:58.540> exact<00:01:58.990> same<00:01:59.200> optics<00:01:59.740> as<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.490> iphone

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
uses the exact same optics as the iphone

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.410 
uses the exact same optics as the iphone
5<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.380> it's<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.710> exact<00:02:03.280> same<00:02:03.310> camera<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.210> only

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
5 so it's the exact same camera the only

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.109 
5 so it's the exact same camera the only
difference<00:02:04.750> is<00:02:04.899> that<00:02:04.960> this<00:02:05.290> is<00:02:05.500> only<00:02:06.119> 5

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
difference is that this is only 5

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.359 
difference is that this is only 5
megapixel<00:02:07.960> sensor<00:02:08.380> compared<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.190> one<00:02:09.340> on

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
megapixel sensor compared to the one on

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.030 
megapixel sensor compared to the one on
the<00:02:09.610> iphone<00:02:09.970> which<00:02:10.329> is<00:02:10.600> 8<00:02:10.869> megapixel<00:02:11.470> now<00:02:11.980> we

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
the iphone which is 8 megapixel now we

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.089 
the iphone which is 8 megapixel now we
also<00:02:12.340> get<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.880> this<00:02:13.000> ipod<00:02:13.510> touch<00:02:13.750> loop<00:02:14.140> which

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
also get to this ipod touch loop which

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.640 
also get to this ipod touch loop which
lets<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.790> connect<00:02:16.120> accessories

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650
