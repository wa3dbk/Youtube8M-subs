00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.810
 hello welcome to your mars channel 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.479
 blogs 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.129
 this time in the area of 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.610
 arithmetic let's develop a 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:16.410
 exercise that allows us to decompose a 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:20.700
 whole number in its prime factors 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.680
 as an example we will put the number 198 and 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.360
 we decompose it into its prime factors 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.020
 dividing by the smallest number 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.230
 where it can be divided into the number that 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.360
 we are originally being 198 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.290
 we can divide it by two its number 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.690
 par 198 between 2 gives us 99 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.590
 99 we can not divide it between two 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.030
 but 103 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.090
 99 between 3 would give us 33 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:56.260
 33 can not be divided between 2 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:58.390
 but if between 3 33 and 3 would give us 11 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.460
 and the 11th we can not divide it between 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.000
 no other number that is not the same 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.310
 11 itself is a prime number 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 then we divide between 11 and that we 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.850
 it is 1 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.310
 the prime factors 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:18.800
 corresponding to number 298 would be two 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.800
 three times three times eleven 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:29.260
 we can say that 198 is equal to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.180
 2 by 3 by 3 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.070
 by 11 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.070
 with 2 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.170
 by 3 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.170
 and squared 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.820
 by 11 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.950
 this would give us the number 198 the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.100
 prime factors of 198 are 23 on 3 and 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.100
 the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.430
 I wish this exercise was of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.580
 utility and see you in a next 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.580
 chance
