00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
to the blender without the skin this is

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.929 
to the blender without the skin this is
my<00:01:57.439> favorite<00:01:57.830> way<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:57.950> do<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.549> chop<00:01:58.790> off

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
my favorite way to do so you chop off

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.300 
my favorite way to do so you chop off
the<00:01:59.180> end<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.659> then<00:01:59.990> just<00:02:00.290> push<00:02:00.560> from<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.040> top

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
the end and then just push from the top

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.490 
the end and then just push from the top
and<00:02:01.549> it<00:02:02.000> doesn't<00:02:02.299> feel<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.600> nice<00:02:02.780> but<00:02:03.320> just

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
and it doesn't feel that nice but just

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.649 
and it doesn't feel that nice but just

now 50 milliliters of water in there and

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.860 
now 50 milliliters of water in there and
a<00:02:39.280> little<00:02:40.280> bit<00:02:40.460> went<00:02:40.610> over<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.850> side<00:02:41.030> it's

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
a little bit went over the side it's

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.290 
a little bit went over the side it's
perfect<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.680> then<00:02:43.070> put<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.580> lid<00:02:43.730> back<00:02:43.760> on<00:02:43.940> and

perfect and then put the lid back on and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.410 
perfect and then put the lid back on and
you<00:02:44.480> want<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.660> blend<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:44.930> all<00:02:44.990> up<00:02:46.180> okay<00:02:47.180> and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
you want to blend that all up okay and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.740 
you want to blend that all up okay and
what<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:48.320> here<00:02:48.740> is<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:50.330> tesco<00:02:51.200> ready<00:02:52.130> road

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
what I have here is the tesco ready road

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.420 
what I have here is the tesco ready road
light<00:02:53.750> puff<00:02:54.290> pastry<00:02:54.710> so<00:02:54.830> it<00:02:54.890> comes<00:02:55.040> in<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.250> box

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
light puff pastry so it comes in a box

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.570 
light puff pastry so it comes in a box
that<00:02:55.550> looks<00:02:55.940> like<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.080> macros<00:02:57.560> are<00:02:57.890> a

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
that looks like this the macros are a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.470 
that looks like this the macros are a
lot<00:02:58.940> better<00:02:59.210> than<00:02:59.810> normal<00:03:00.320> puff<00:03:00.800> pastry<00:03:01.480> so

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
lot better than normal puff pastry so

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.300 
lot better than normal puff pastry so
yeah<00:03:02.780> definitely<00:03:03.080> recommend<00:03:03.950> getting<00:03:04.130> this

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
yeah definitely recommend getting this

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.570 
yeah definitely recommend getting this
unless<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.700> wanna<00:03:04.850> macros<00:03:05.210> to<00:03:05.360> be<00:03:05.720> higher<00:03:06.580> and

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
unless you wanna macros to be higher and

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.650 
unless you wanna macros to be higher and
then<00:03:07.760> what<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:07.970> want<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.120> do<00:03:08.240> you<00:03:08.450> want<00:03:08.600> to

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
then what you want to do you want to

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.800 
then what you want to do you want to
take<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.230> longest<00:03:09.740> way<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.450> then<00:03:11.450> split

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
take it the longest way and then split

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.460 
take it the longest way and then split
it<00:03:11.990> in<00:03:12.170> two<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:13.010> cut<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:13.580> down<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.820> middle<00:03:14.470> now

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
it in two so cut it down the middle now

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.880 
it in two so cut it down the middle now
you<00:03:15.530> have<00:03:15.830> two<00:03:16.430> long<00:03:17.210> bits<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.750> pastry<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:18.800> you

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
you have two long bits of pastry so you

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.130 
you have two long bits of pastry so you
can<00:03:19.040> put<00:03:19.160> one<00:03:19.760> bit<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.030> top<00:03:20.240> and<00:03:20.420> now<00:03:20.930> you're

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
can put one bit the top and now you're

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.590 
can put one bit the top and now you're
going<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.320> do<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.620> take<00:03:21.950> half<00:03:22.460> of<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:23.300> mixture

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
going to do is take half of the mixture

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.990 
going to do is take half of the mixture
and<00:03:24.250> we're<00:03:25.250> going<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.400> spread<00:03:25.580> it<00:03:25.700> along<00:03:25.820> here

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
and we're going to spread it along here

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.570 
and we're going to spread it along here
okay<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:26.690> want<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.960> make<00:03:27.080> one<00:03:27.260> really<00:03:28.130> long

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
okay you want to make one really long

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.150 
okay you want to make one really long
tube<00:03:29.150> or<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:29.600> can<00:03:29.750> start<00:03:30.020> from<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.770> bone<00:03:30.950> and

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
tube or you can start from the bone and

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.550 
tube or you can start from the bone and
then<00:03:31.370> just<00:03:31.550> spread<00:03:31.850> it<00:03:31.910> along<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.750> first<00:03:33.290> bit

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
then just spread it along the first bit

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.350 
then just spread it along the first bit
and<00:03:33.770> then<00:03:34.340> do<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.640> same<00:03:34.670> on<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.120> other<00:03:35.150> one

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
and then do the same on the other one

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.840 
and then do the same on the other one
okay<00:03:36.140> so<00:03:36.200> this<00:03:36.380> is<00:03:36.560> just<00:03:36.740> one<00:03:37.100> egg<00:03:37.430> we're<00:03:37.760> not

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
okay so this is just one egg we're not

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.760 
okay so this is just one egg we're not
going<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.030> use<00:03:38.240> most<00:03:39.140> of<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.440> will<00:03:39.590> probably

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
going to use most of it will probably

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.770 
going to use most of it will probably
end<00:03:39.950> up<00:03:40.040> using<00:03:40.190> just<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.520> quarter<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:41.060> just

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
end up using just a quarter of it just

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.210 
end up using just a quarter of it just
whisked<00:03:42.080> up<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:42.680> want<00:03:42.830> to<00:03:42.890> get<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.010> brush
