00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
2 turn strategy calm and this is round

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.000 
2 turn strategy calm and this is round
27<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.060> StarCraft<00:00:06.629> Master<00:00:07.109> mod<00:00:07.290> moving

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
27 of the StarCraft Master mod moving

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.490 
27 of the StarCraft Master mod moving
shot<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.639> as<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.570> can<00:00:09.630> see<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.840> Banshee<00:00:10.349> has

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
shot and as you can see a Banshee has

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.700 
shot and as you can see a Banshee has
six<00:00:10.889> range<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:12.360> Marine<00:00:12.690> has<00:00:12.870> five<00:00:13.170> range<00:00:13.500> so

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
six range and a Marine has five range so

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.289 
six range and a Marine has five range so
you<00:00:13.769> actually<00:00:14.160> out<00:00:14.340> range<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.849> Marines<00:00:15.120> by

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
you actually out range the Marines by

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.730 
you actually out range the Marines by
one<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:17.390> these<00:00:18.390> marines<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:19.080> not<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.380> combat

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
one and these marines do not have combat

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.250 
one and these marines do not have combat
shields<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.369> two<00:00:20.850> shots<00:00:20.880> from<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.570> banshee<00:00:21.779> will

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
shields so two shots from a banshee will

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.650 
shields so two shots from a banshee will
kill<00:00:22.529> marine<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.460> there<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.730> ten<00:00:23.970> Marines<00:00:24.300> so

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
kill marine but there is ten Marines so

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.230 
kill marine but there is ten Marines so
we've<00:00:25.320> got<00:00:25.500> some<00:00:25.680> work<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.980> do<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:27.000> trick

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
we've got some work to do and the trick

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.900 
we've got some work to do and the trick
is<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.480> use<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.650> hold<00:00:28.920> position<00:00:29.460> micro

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
is to use the hold position micro

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.749 
is to use the hold position micro
because<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.260> move<00:00:31.590> back<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.859> hit<00:00:32.189> H<00:00:32.489> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
because you can move back and hit H and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.850 
because you can move back and hit H and
then<00:00:32.850> move<00:00:33.000> again<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.140> Banshee<00:00:34.739> will

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
then move again and the Banshee will

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.450 
then move again and the Banshee will
actually<00:00:35.510> attack<00:00:36.510> while<00:00:36.989> floating<00:00:37.649> backwards

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
actually attack while floating backwards

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.690 
actually attack while floating backwards
if<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.210> hit<00:00:39.360> s<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:39.960> hit<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> TAC<00:00:40.530> move<00:00:40.829> sometimes

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
if you hit s or hit a TAC move sometimes

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.340 
if you hit s or hit a TAC move sometimes
the<00:00:41.879> Banshee<00:00:42.180> will<00:00:42.300> turn<00:00:42.510> around<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.079> kind<00:00:43.320> of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the Banshee will turn around and kind of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.799 
the Banshee will turn around and kind of
suicide<00:00:43.920> into<00:00:44.430> these<00:00:44.579> Marines<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.420> that's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
suicide into these Marines and that's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.500 
suicide into these Marines and that's
not<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.350> we're<00:00:46.469> looking<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.360> what<00:00:48.360> you

have to do is just use the right click
move<00:00:50.489> command<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.140> then<00:00:52.379> hit<00:00:52.559> H<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.070> just

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
move command and then hit H and just

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.029 
move command and then hit H and just
right-click<00:00:53.910> H<00:00:54.120> right<00:00:54.480> click<00:00:54.719> H<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.320> you'll

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
right-click H right click H and you'll

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.290 
right-click H right click H and you'll
get<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.219> feel<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.760> after<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> little<00:00:57.180> while

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
get a feel for it after a little while

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.299 
get a feel for it after a little while
but<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.780> want<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.050> stay<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> outside

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
but you want to stay just on the outside

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.220 
but you want to stay just on the outside
of<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.520> range<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> Marines<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.960> take

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
of the range of the Marines so you take

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.990 
of the range of the Marines so you take
it<00:01:01.260> minimal<00:01:01.800> damage<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.250> possible<00:01:02.699> while

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
it minimal damage as possible while

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.050 
it minimal damage as possible while
doing<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.510> much<00:01:03.809> damage<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.350> possible<00:01:05.060> so

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
doing as much damage as possible so

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:36.230 
doing as much damage as possible so
let's<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.660 

there's<00:01:37.240> no<00:01:37.450> need<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:37.750> hurry<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:39.310> long<00:01:39.520> as

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
there's no need to hurry as long as

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.280 
there's no need to hurry as long as
you're<00:01:39.820> staying<00:01:40.000> outside<00:01:40.240> that<00:01:40.660> range<00:01:40.870> and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
you're staying outside that range and

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.590 
you're staying outside that range and
taking<00:01:41.650> minimal<00:01:42.010> damage<00:01:42.240> you're<00:01:43.240> gonna<00:01:43.360> be<00:01:43.510> in

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
taking minimal damage you're gonna be in

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.130 
taking minimal damage you're gonna be in
good<00:01:43.750> shape<00:01:48.300> as<00:01:49.300> you<00:01:49.420> can<00:01:49.540> see<00:01:49.690> if<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:49.930> move

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
good shape as you can see if you move

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.500 
good shape as you can see if you move
too<00:01:50.530> fast<00:01:50.800> after<00:01:51.310> hitting<00:01:51.490> that<00:01:51.580> hold

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
too fast after hitting that hold

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.230 
too fast after hitting that hold
position<00:01:52.960> button<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:54.040> will<00:01:54.160> actually<00:01:54.430> just

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
position button you will actually just

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.100 
position button you will actually just
turn<00:01:55.479> around<00:01:56.310> without<00:01:57.310> doing<00:01:57.760> any<00:01:57.940> damage<00:02:01.110> so

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
turn around without doing any damage so

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.640 
turn around without doing any damage so
it's<00:02:02.229> definitely<00:02:02.620> a<00:02:02.650> thing<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:03.040> do<00:02:04.410> but<00:02:05.410> it's

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
it's definitely a thing to do but it's

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.520 
it's definitely a thing to do but it's
definitely<00:02:06.190> possible<00:02:07.110> all<00:02:08.110> right<00:02:08.170> there<00:02:08.440> it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
definitely possible all right there it

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.420 
definitely possible all right there it
is<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:09.130> that's<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.429> for<00:02:09.580> round<00:02:09.760> 27
