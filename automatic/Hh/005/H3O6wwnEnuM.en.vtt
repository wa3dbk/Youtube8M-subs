00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.330 
server for download on my iphone or my
iPad<00:02:08.509> so<00:02:09.509> once<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:09.840> get<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.110> mobile<00:02:10.530> example

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
iPad so once we get this mobile example

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.850 
iPad so once we get this mobile example
spelled<00:02:11.910> properly<00:02:12.510> I'll<00:02:13.019> go<00:02:13.260> ahead<00:02:13.349> and<00:02:13.530> just

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
spelled properly I'll go ahead and just

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.110 
spelled properly I'll go ahead and just
again<00:02:14.099> put<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.400> little<00:02:14.550> description<00:02:14.879> about

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
again put in a little description about

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.660 
again put in a little description about
the<00:02:15.390> shaver<00:02:15.629> file<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.370> guess<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.489> true

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the shaver file and I guess the true

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.880 
the shaver file and I guess the true
irony<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.629> as<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.989> haven't<00:02:19.470> yet<00:02:19.590> shaved

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
irony of this as I haven't yet shaved

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.460 
irony of this as I haven't yet shaved
today<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.300> maybe<00:02:21.510> it's<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.840> good<00:02:22.019> file<00:02:22.230> to

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
today and so maybe it's a good file to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.160 
today and so maybe it's a good file to
remind<00:02:23.160> me<00:02:23.310> by<00:02:24.090> publishing<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.629> shaver<00:02:24.810> file

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.449 

once<00:02:28.170> we<00:02:28.260> get<00:02:28.319> all<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> information<00:02:28.769> laid<00:02:29.250> out

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
once we get all the information laid out

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.820 
once we get all the information laid out
I'll<00:02:29.700> go<00:02:29.940> ahead<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.209> save<00:02:30.599> this<00:02:30.629> file<00:02:31.170> online

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.789 

once<00:02:37.830> i<00:02:38.069> go<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.060> publish<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.599> online<00:02:40.019> i<00:02:40.260> can

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
once i go to publish this online i can

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
so the next thing we'll do is take a

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.039 
so the next thing we'll do is take a
look<00:04:14.790> at<00:04:15.000> turning<00:04:15.269> those<00:04:15.329> annotations<00:04:15.630> off

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
look at turning those annotations off

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.580

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
completely being able to rotate zoom in

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.159 
completely being able to rotate zoom in
and<00:04:20.159> I<00:04:20.219> can<00:04:20.400> actually<00:04:20.430> select<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.630> file<00:04:21.870> and

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
and I can actually select the file and

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.899 
and I can actually select the file and
pull<00:04:22.289> up<00:04:22.380> all<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.680> its<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:22.890> properties<00:04:23.430> so<00:04:23.880> I

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
pull up all of its I properties so I

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.070 
pull up all of its I properties so I
have<00:04:24.120> vendor<00:04:24.479> information

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
let's take a look at the same file on my

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.850 
let's take a look at the same file on my
iPhone<00:04:41.189> so<00:04:41.460> I'll<00:04:42.300> just<00:04:42.389> go<00:04:42.659> over<00:04:42.780> same<00:04:43.379> thing<00:04:43.650> I

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
iPhone so I'll just go over same thing I

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.950 
iPhone so I'll just go over same thing I
can<00:04:44.009> log<00:04:44.219> in<00:04:44.460> with<00:04:44.669> my<00:04:44.699> auto<00:04:44.909> cid<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.479> that<00:04:45.629> same

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
can log in with my auto cid to that same

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.230 
can log in with my auto cid to that same
server<00:04:46.259> download<00:04:47.129> the<00:04:47.460> file<00:04:47.639> locally<00:04:47.909> and

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
server download the file locally and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.939 
server download the file locally and
you'll<00:04:48.389> see<00:04:48.539> the<00:04:48.659> exact<00:04:48.990> same<00:04:49.169> functionality

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
you'll see the exact same functionality

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.580 
you'll see the exact same functionality
just<00:04:50.340> on<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.490> smaller<00:04:50.669> scale<00:04:51.210> on<00:04:51.629> my<00:04:52.020> iPhone<00:04:52.439> and

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
just on a smaller scale on my iPhone and

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.520 
just on a smaller scale on my iPhone and
again<00:04:53.090> didn't<00:04:54.090> quite<00:04:54.240> have<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.449> focus<00:04:54.900> as<00:04:55.379> I'm

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
again didn't quite have the focus as I'm

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.350 
again didn't quite have the focus as I'm
trying<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.830> hold<00:04:55.949> the<00:04:56.099> camera<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.669> perform

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
trying to hold the camera and perform

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.149 
trying to hold the camera and perform
this<00:04:57.479> all<00:04:57.629> at<00:04:57.750> once<00:04:57.930> but<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.650> think<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:58.979> get<00:04:59.099> the

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
this all at once but I think you get the

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.339 
this all at once but I think you get the
idea<00:04:59.300> so<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.419> only<00:05:00.539> real<00:05:00.750> difference<00:05:00.900> is<00:05:01.229> you

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
idea so the only real difference is you

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:02.899 
idea so the only real difference is you
have<00:05:01.440> full<00:05:01.620> screen<00:05:02.009> annotations<00:05:02.759> on<00:05:02.879> the

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
have full screen annotations on the

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:04.760 
have full screen annotations on the
double<00:05:03.240> click<00:05:03.419> versus<00:05:04.199> just<00:05:04.289> a<00:05:04.440> pop-up

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
double click versus just a pop-up

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.589 
double click versus just a pop-up
balloon<00:05:05.159> again<00:05:05.610> that's<00:05:05.789> all<00:05:05.879> based<00:05:06.090> on<00:05:06.240> screen

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
balloon again that's all based on screen

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.379 
balloon again that's all based on screen
size<00:05:07.099> so<00:05:08.099> that<00:05:08.129> was<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:08.520> oddest<00:05:08.669> published<00:05:09.240> a
