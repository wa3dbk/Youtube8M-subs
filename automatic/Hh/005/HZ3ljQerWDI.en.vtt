surprised about so I'm I'm gonna get
right<00:00:27.750> down<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.140> okay<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:29.670> first<00:00:29.849> thing<00:00:30.029> I

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
right down to it okay the first thing I

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.389 
right down to it okay the first thing I
found<00:00:30.449> out<00:00:30.859> was<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.820> main<00:00:33.000> story<00:00:33.329> was

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
found out was that the main story was

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.260 
found out was that the main story was
made<00:00:35.399> by<00:00:36.239> Alec<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.960> Joel<00:00:37.469> who<00:00:38.250> were<00:00:38.579> working

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
made by Alec and Joel who were working

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.010 
made by Alec and Joel who were working
on<00:00:39.420> exercise<00:00:39.870> originals<00:00:40.350> Toy<00:00:40.860> Story<00:00:41.219> film<00:00:41.520> and

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
on exercise originals Toy Story film and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.209 
on exercise originals Toy Story film and
I<00:00:43.020> guess<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> reason<00:00:43.710> why<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:44.040> did

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
I guess it's the reason why they did

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.170 
I guess it's the reason why they did
this<00:00:44.309> thing<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> video<00:00:46.379> games<00:00:47.180> possibly

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
this thing with the video games possibly

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.920 
this thing with the video games possibly
and<00:00:49.730> makes<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.820> lot<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.940> sense<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.570> was

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
and makes a lot of sense in that was

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.049 
and makes a lot of sense in that was
particular<00:00:52.530> area<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:53.969> the
