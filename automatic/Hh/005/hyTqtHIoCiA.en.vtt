00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
here and basically I only put one track

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.369 
here and basically I only put one track
here<00:00:53.300> there's<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> youtube<00:00:54.840> thing<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.230> don't

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
here there's this youtube thing I don't

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.680 
here there's this youtube thing I don't
even<00:00:55.440> know<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:57.059> what's<00:00:57.539> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
even know what that is but what's so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.450 
even know what that is but what's so
cool<00:00:57.870> about<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.350> software<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.219> let's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
cool about this software is that let's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.700 
cool about this software is that let's
say<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> whole<00:01:00.059> list<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.390> tracks<00:01:00.710> it's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
say you have a whole list of tracks it's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.439 
say you have a whole list of tracks it's
going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.010> go<00:01:02.129> ahead<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.550> split<00:01:02.879> them<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
going to go ahead and split them and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.710 
going to go ahead and split them and
keep<00:01:04.290> them<00:01:04.470> all<00:01:04.650> separated<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.939> so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
keep them all separated for you and so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.060 
keep them all separated for you and so
when<00:01:06.960> you're<00:01:07.080> done<00:01:07.290> you'll<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.830> an<00:01:07.950> entire

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
when you're done you'll have an entire

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.609 
when you're done you'll have an entire
library<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.030> music<00:01:09.920> in<00:01:10.920> mp3<00:01:11.520> format

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
library of music in mp3 format

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
library of music in mp3 format
completely<00:01:13.619> convertible<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.750> if<00:01:15.750> you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
completely convertible and if you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.350 
completely convertible and if you
remember<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.409> pop-up<00:01:16.979> window<00:01:17.400> you'll

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
remember that pop-up window you'll

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.880 
remember that pop-up window you'll
recall<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.930> there<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.259> an<00:01:19.409> automatic

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
recall that there was an automatic

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.550 
recall that there was an automatic
import<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.670> iTunes<00:01:21.119> library<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.439> you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
import to iTunes library so if you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.609 
import to iTunes library so if you
wanted<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.420> check<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.810> box<00:01:25.140> at<00:01:25.350> BAM

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
wanted to you just check that box at BAM

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.679 
wanted to you just check that box at BAM
everything<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
everything you have here it's going to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.130 
everything you have here it's going to
be<00:01:27.840> inside<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.740> iTunes<00:01:29.340> library<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.990> does

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
be inside your iTunes library so it does

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.859 
be inside your iTunes library so it does
a<00:01:31.170> lot<00:01:31.380> more<00:01:31.439> than<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.670> basically<00:01:32.939> if

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
a lot more than that but basically if

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.660
