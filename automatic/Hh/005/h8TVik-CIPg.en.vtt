00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello everyone i hope you 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.020
 okay today I make you a 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.359
 rather exceptional video not enough 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.390
 spectacular simply how 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.800
 able to get on the crane and do the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.359
 parachute jump so it's gone so 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.740
 I warn you the crane is a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.449
 little bit on the construction site area 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.680
 level of all the tricks so I 'm going 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.359
 Do not make a drawing of yours 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.349
 find it is too easy for every 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.059
 times I give you all the clues 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.920
 no it's close to be honest I 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.390
 do not know that far 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.829
 know that there is a good welded group that 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.809
 you will reach a grade a little 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.270
 low by you have to confront to 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.379
 to be threatened with a gang that is found 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.840
 just by asking to sew at all 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.920
 eliminated or just run away 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.579
 very quickly that what can you 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.629
 go up the street 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.559
 and yes it's really not really funny 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.969
 the grid what it serves all 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.770
 simply to be able to climb all the way up 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.270
 of a building where everything will be said of the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.340
 crane you can also access on 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.280
 the building india and second largest 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.229
 of the game and do a parachute jump that 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.489
 will be really nice to do if you 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.810
 do not necessarily have to parachute there are 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.229
 one that is in you will see in 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.909
 not long 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.770
 you have to know that to get on the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.990
 grate good appetite the time you 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.070
 put it takes a lot a lot of 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.840
 time that's why I will not cut the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.470
 video to show you the time it takes 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.700
 takes a whole lot tell me 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.259
 yeah but it's still a trick 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.610
 still solid your low video is this 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.100
 that you want so I serve you 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.540
 now all this on the board the goal 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.740
 anyway it is to make a maximum of 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.150
 videos so I have a lot of small 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.140
 montages and a lot of small trunk 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.060
 islands to sion that will arrive very 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.500
 soon so the crane frankly 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.549
 I had discovered it like that but I 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.409
 am now saying how are you doing 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.549
 also to go up early I ride I 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.890
 I'm already okay it's right next 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.210
 it's not that high and not at the end 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.860
 of a moment it's like a sensation 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.070
 odd is that you're going to ride everything 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.220
 I will tone after three quarters 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.630
 there you will feel a sensation enough 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.360
 weird though it's a game you to 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.560
 get dizzy your guy actually 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.840
 you have the impression that he will fall 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.399
 so you are going to make yourself 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.750
 will you move a little differently 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.930
 than usual since you are very 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.189
 it is by the environment epa risk to 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.360
 your risk of falling 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.079
 what's that for that I'm telling you do 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.670
 still be careful 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.060
 you see we're starting to take already 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.060
 their authors 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.739
 what is boring is the area while 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.879
 does where there are enemies to shoot down but 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.989
 they did well though huh so 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.489
 for those who ask me why 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.140
 landings like that it'll really serve 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.549
 in case you are going to fall 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.959
 why the insciptions that it happens 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.450
 very frequently on this kind of crane 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.799
 good I already had to ride five ten times I 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.569
 fell only once by chance 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.739
 in this video I'm going to drop that you 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.319
 will you laugh that would say my words 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.720
 said it's really crazy we'll take a 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.799
 little altitude 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.970
 no but it's really not bad at all 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.470
 I find a padlock mandant guisan 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.109
 really innovate on two the game you can 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.060
 really do a lot of little things 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.739
 nice enough to be entertained 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.190
 to be able to jump to see 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.150
 the dictator's beige etc etc 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.909
 I really like it changes a 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.079
 little bit of everything bar the month where you 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.099
 all the time bridle and there you can 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.480
 do what you want nothing to start 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.459
 as impressive as mine 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.170
 of anything do not hesitate to tell me in the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.730
 comments if you have already done 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.299
 1 how a comment and say like 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.859
 where a parachute jump from 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.049
 these cranes do you know her 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.489
 or not necessarily are or what you have 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.700
 already tested or you know not exactly 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:20.480
 so find it so do not hesitate to yours 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:21.530
 let go in the comments so that 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.030
 sting one the same time as they go 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.769
 ride one I did not cut 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.449
 like that it's really worth the trouble 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.940
 of the game made you think of something 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.919
 sick and where do you feel that you 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.359
 has 5 minutes to go up for the 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:36.590
 crane what to leave not finished yet 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.790
 friends but good after you will see 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.199
 also that it's worth a visit 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.669
 able to get on stage grella if you 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.069
 do not necessarily have a helicopter to 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.930
 handy you do not want to 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.030
 take a parachute jump to land 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.129
 all right in a building that the to 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.979
 from that moment on where even go up and 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.840
 it's up to you to choose your jump from 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:55.250
 when do you want to deploy it? 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.750
 can jump right away from 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.549
 now we can jump after there 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.799
 a lot of little things you and I 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.239
 just dropped there fortunately they 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.799
 were going to barrier she's acting fixed such 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.750
 amarin and I do not want to lie to you I 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:10.099
 thought I was going to die I thought 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.199
 certainly make a fall but a 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.849
 final fall what I told myself how 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.050
 it's possible to fall in but there 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.980
 I was stressed because 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.060
 I said to myself but what is 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.040
 I sometimes I was tired actually 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.269
 monte monte monte monte this is what I 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.610
 see if I had the sensation of having the 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.080
 vertigo from bulls is enough 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.490
 strange as sensation but I did not get 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.480
 that I told myself yeah how I 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.100
 done to see her so here we go 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.560
 simply start to be able to 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.910
 climb again still that's fine 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.400
 closer to the goal see the agglo and 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.910
 the not so far so far now 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.130
 we remain the last level to learn to 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.350
 to cross the obstacle of the crane and 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.890
 perform the jump are expected in 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.890
 parachute 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.780
 Besides, it's a little stupid like those 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.949
 like style of videos but hey there is 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.180
 it's going to please them other than that 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.470
 will not please them but the goal 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.389
 main thing is to do all the videos 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.979
 of gt1 discover a lot of possibilities 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.590
 so that's the parachute in question 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.000
 close to 100 - I saw it later 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.300
 due in december sorry for my 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.360
 outfit 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.409
 skip bath so that's the little 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.389
 parachute for those who will ask me 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.129
 where are they so here is 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.080
 it looks like a parachute since 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.610
 there are still some I know that a lot of you 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.539
 you know it better still some who 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.129
 wonder what it looks like a 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.360
 parachute it's stupid to say but there are 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.919
 who do not know they just have 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.000
 bought the game yesterday or the day before yesterday so 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.130
 they do not necessarily know 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.430
 chorus and very low there is something 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.620
 to lose 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.750
 so that's where the great height of 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.030
 the citrus - look at its frankness 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.409
 really tried every trick to 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.150
 part one is the biggest it is 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.889
 where I had done but my top 3 good I 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.520
 jumped with the trash truck the truck 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.949
 golf etc. 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.300
 the truck the golf caddy no but 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.800
 this is from that moment 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.030
 you have the second tier and you 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.849
 can jump make you happy so 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.409
 it's gone we jump so you deploy 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.550
 you parachute must know that in 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.110
 multiplayer you have a possibility 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.449
 which is really not bad that I'm coming 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.940
 not necessarily deploy deployed a 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.979
 smoke of all colors it is at 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.180
 to say you have the blue the green is 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.280
 like for tuning cars actually 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.539
 one you have these possibilities there of 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.099
 to be able to put a trail of smoke 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.330
 behind you but except that manages the 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.800
 assets but it does not work so I 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.210
 do not know what are the bankruptcies 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.289
 buy it every time etc etc 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.029
 so I do not know I'll maybe 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.069
 doubt to show you this smoke the 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:16.069
 here are the friends I hope anyway 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:17.750
 little jump where this little video has you 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.099
 a little bit of fun and for those 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.389
 who would like to test do not hesitate 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.860
 could see the location right in the middle 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.990
 middle of the city so take a 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.130
 car rides the crane you saw the 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.169
 time it takes I have not cut 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.159
 to really make you show
