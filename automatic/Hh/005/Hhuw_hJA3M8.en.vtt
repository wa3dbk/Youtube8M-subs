 really look a little at the keys 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.980
 they are too much to work always 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.090
 kept faith seeing them a little bit more 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.680
 often that more and more I am 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.780
 tried to drop the zqsd keys 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.920

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.980
 go close then on the side we have the 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:31.980
 headphone and microphone jack did both 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.350
 more than two USB ports 3 0 plus the 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.350
 optical drive 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.540

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.970
 usb 3.0 plugs 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.970

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.939
 live is to bring sir 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.659
 all this 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:26.710
 but it's worth it for me but here we are 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.710
 some pc 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:34.920
 if you look here you see them well 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.170
 touch there keys zqsd the notebook is 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.690
 really nice when I put 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.410
 another memo because for the house 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.520
 did I take a laptop 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.890
 normally I will take a tower 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.910
 but as I move a lot against my 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.290
 father and mother what she my parents 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.650

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.690
 next 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.940
 good I do not prefer a laptop all 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.760
 a tower would be a lot of paloma goals 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.640
 I did not see his range would stink red 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.700
 they are how gorgeous he is 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.790
 swaying ps in the hygiene of outfits 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:06.060
 unique in fact a little long the first 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:09.090
 times so good I'm doing all the adjustments 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.850

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.700

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:18.680

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.830

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.010

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.840

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.330
 the bigleux but hey we 're actually going to 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.010
 keys and I was able to test them in fact 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.750
 they are really viable 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.900
 they are frankly comfortable the 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.260
 Dean well you do not move for can any 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.830

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.860
 independently 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:08.370
 should I change the working environment there 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.080
 I can mackerel here I 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.320
 can reveal macro here the keys of 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.300
 to play here the rest of the keys 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.780
 the same here and there the numeric keypad 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.630
 alas the your body so the mouse 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:24.440
 rebels look at the color I liked it to 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.490

 on the rates I put on the screen 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:37.710
 main because here we go for 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:40.530
 to say little small were we going to say that 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.060

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.340
 that this video may be you will have liked 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.110
 is sorry for the year a little brutal 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.510
 but the problem is who makes it the 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.890
 camera and randy cameron cut and I 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.980

 others no to another that will follow 

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:07.580
 just barely fries so at the tracks 

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.220
