00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
so I did a sea foaming video about a

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.320 
so I did a sea foaming video about a
week<00:00:06.810> ago<00:00:07.519> and<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.670> was<00:00:08.760> gonna<00:00:08.910> put<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.240> on

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
week ago and I was gonna put it on

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.720 
week ago and I was gonna put it on
YouTube<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:09.900> show<00:00:10.260> like<00:00:11.130> what<00:00:11.309> actually

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
YouTube and show like what actually

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.910 
YouTube and show like what actually
happens<00:00:12.120> during<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:13.320> sea<00:00:13.889> foam<00:00:14.040> video<00:00:14.780> but

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
happens during a sea foam video but

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.160 
happens during a sea foam video but
nothing<00:00:16.920> really<00:00:17.070> happened<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.660> didn't

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
nothing really happened so I didn't

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.470 
nothing really happened so I didn't
bother<00:00:19.260> putting<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:19.939> it<00:00:20.939> basically<00:00:21.240> looked

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
bother putting it up it basically looked

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.900 
bother putting it up it basically looked
like<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.289> wash<00:00:22.560> your<00:00:22.800> car<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.279> then<00:00:23.670> go

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
like if you wash your car and then go

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.490 
like if you wash your car and then go
turn<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.869> then<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.019> look<00:00:25.230> out<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
turn it on and then you look out the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.109 
turn it on and then you look out the
exhaust<00:00:25.800> pipe<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.550> there's<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> little<00:00:26.849> bit<00:00:27.029> of

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
exhaust pipe and there's a little bit of

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.210 
exhaust pipe and there's a little bit of
steam<00:00:27.349> that's<00:00:28.349> roughly<00:00:28.650> what<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.920> looked<00:00:29.099> like

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
steam that's roughly what it looked like

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.209 
steam that's roughly what it looked like
so<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:30.380> didn't<00:00:31.380> even<00:00:31.500> bother<00:00:31.710> putting<00:00:32.009> it

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
so it just didn't even bother putting it

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.790 
so it just didn't even bother putting it
up<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:33.079> I'm<00:00:34.079> gonna<00:00:34.200> give<00:00:34.410> him<00:00:34.500> an<00:00:34.620> explanation

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
up so I'm gonna give him an explanation

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.910 
up so I'm gonna give him an explanation
of<00:00:35.370> why<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.670> think<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.750> didn't<00:00:37.380> give<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.590> same

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
of why I think it didn't give the same

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.530 
of why I think it didn't give the same
results<00:00:38.809> as<00:00:39.809> say<00:00:40.200> other<00:00:40.649> videos<00:00:41.329> that<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.360> on

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
results as say other videos that are on

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.400 
results as say other videos that are on
YouTube<00:00:42.660> that's<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:43.879> show<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> giant<00:00:45.450> column

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
YouTube that's like show a giant column

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.840 
YouTube that's like show a giant column
of<00:00:46.620> white<00:00:46.980> smoke<00:00:47.370> coming<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> tailpipe<00:00:49.170> I

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
of white smoke coming out the tailpipe I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.260 
of white smoke coming out the tailpipe I
did<00:00:50.850> everything<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:52.550> Eddie<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.969> did

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
did everything that Eddie I did

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.970 
did everything that Eddie I did
everything<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.750> everyone<00:00:54.989> else<00:00:55.140> was<00:00:55.800> doing

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
everything that everyone else was doing

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.290 
everything that everyone else was doing
so<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.390> put<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.199> third<00:00:58.980> through<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> vacuum<00:01:00.090> line

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
so I put a third through the vacuum line

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.520 
so I put a third through the vacuum line
I<00:01:00.770> put<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> third<00:01:02.489> into<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> gas<00:01:03.539> tank<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.229> I

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
I put a third into the gas tank and I

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.230 
I put a third into the gas tank and I
put<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.010> rest<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.519> bottle<00:01:05.850> into<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
put the rest of the bottle into the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.590 
put the rest of the bottle into the
crankcase<00:01:09.260> now<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.290> put<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> sea<00:01:10.950> foam<00:01:11.600> through

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
crankcase now I put the sea foam through

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.910 
crankcase now I put the sea foam through
the<00:01:12.720> vacuum<00:01:13.020> line<00:01:13.170> while<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> engine<00:01:13.799> was

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the vacuum line while the engine was

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.050 
the vacuum line while the engine was
running<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.369> let<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.580> sit<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:14.820> 15

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
running and then I let it sit for 15

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.149 
running and then I let it sit for 15
minutes<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.840> turned<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.530> went

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
minutes and then I turned it on and went

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.469 
minutes and then I turned it on and went
for<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> spirited<00:01:18.180> Drive<00:01:18.979> yeah<00:01:20.150> nothing<00:01:21.150> really

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
for a spirited Drive yeah nothing really

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.160 
for a spirited Drive yeah nothing really
happened<00:01:22.909> didn't<00:01:23.909> piss<00:01:24.119> off<00:01:24.330> any<00:01:24.689> neighbors

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
happened didn't piss off any neighbors

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.330 
happened didn't piss off any neighbors
and<00:01:28.820> yeah<00:01:30.049> nothing<00:01:31.049> else<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.470> really<00:01:31.710> say<00:01:31.950> so

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
and yeah nothing else to really say so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.880 
and yeah nothing else to really say so
here's<00:01:32.820> maybe<00:01:33.090> some<00:01:33.420> explanations<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.350> why<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
here's maybe some explanations of why it

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.310 
here's maybe some explanations of why it
didn't<00:01:35.520> work<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.939> well<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.920> me<00:01:38.659> I<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:39.960> my

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
didn't work as well for me I think my

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.700 
didn't work as well for me I think my
engine<00:01:40.680> was<00:01:40.829> already<00:01:41.100> clean<00:01:41.630> now<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> only<00:01:43.140> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
engine was already clean now I only and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.030 
engine was already clean now I only and
have<00:01:44.310> been<00:01:44.579> only<00:01:44.790> using<00:01:45.329> Chevron<00:01:46.020> gas<00:01:46.590> not

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
have been only using Chevron gas not

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.260 
have been only using Chevron gas not
whether<00:01:47.250> or<00:01:47.369> not<00:01:49.700> different<00:01:50.700> gas<00:01:50.820> companies

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
whether or not different gas companies

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.149 
whether or not different gas companies
have<00:01:51.540> additives<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.200> their<00:01:52.350> gas<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.799> just

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
have additives in their gas I just

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.420 
have additives in their gas I just
always<00:01:53.340> use<00:01:53.610> Chevron<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:57.710> don't<00:01:58.710> really<00:01:58.860> notice

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
always use Chevron I don't really notice

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.569 
always use Chevron I don't really notice
any<00:01:59.759> like<00:02:00.030> difference<00:02:00.450> between<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> octane

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
any like difference between the octane

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.100 
any like difference between the octane
in<00:02:02.579> my<00:02:02.790> vehicle<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.659> don't<00:02:03.810> bother

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
in my vehicle so I just I don't bother

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.499 
in my vehicle so I just I don't bother
using<00:02:04.469> 89<00:02:05.130> or<00:02:05.490> sorry<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.939> don't<00:02:06.030> bother<00:02:06.270> using

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
using 89 or sorry I don't bother using

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.339 
using 89 or sorry I don't bother using
91<00:02:07.079> or<00:02:07.290> 94<00:02:07.860> octane<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.459> anything<00:02:09.270> higher<00:02:09.450> my

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
91 or 94 octane or anything higher my

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.070 
91 or 94 octane or anything higher my
engine<00:02:10.590> wasn't<00:02:10.879> built<00:02:11.879> for<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.239> nor<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.959> need

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
engine wasn't built for it nor do I need

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.929 
engine wasn't built for it nor do I need
it

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
it

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:21.569 
it
secondly<00:02:16.379> I<00:02:19.650> just<00:02:20.650> don't<00:02:21.129> think<00:02:21.310> there<00:02:21.430> was

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
secondly I just don't think there was

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.149 
secondly I just don't think there was
just<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.970> lot<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.150> carbon<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.439> built<00:02:23.680> up<00:02:23.920> like

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
just a lot of carbon that built up like

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.789 
just a lot of carbon that built up like
I<00:02:24.310> just<00:02:24.689> just<00:02:25.689> going<00:02:25.900> back<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.319> think<00:02:26.379> it<00:02:26.680> was

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
I just just going back I think it was

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.280 
I just just going back I think it was

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
just already clean like if it's seafoam

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.770 
just already clean like if it's seafoam
is<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.620> whole<00:02:29.799> reason<00:02:30.359> why<00:02:31.359> I<00:02:31.390> wanted<00:02:31.720> to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780

is the whole reason why I wanted to

stick with it was already clean in my

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.599 
stick with it was already clean in my
engines<00:02:44.439> perfect<00:02:44.859> and<00:02:45.010> my<00:02:45.099> life<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.430> perfect

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609

and<00:02:46.000> everything<00:02:46.389> is<00:02:46.510> perfect<00:02:47.129> but<00:02:48.129> I<00:02:48.159> may<00:02:48.940> be

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
and everything is perfect but I may be

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.729 
and everything is perfect but I may be
thinking<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:49.659> I<00:02:49.690> did<00:02:49.930> something<00:02:50.139> wrong<00:02:50.290> now

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
thinking that I did something wrong now

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:51.990 
thinking that I did something wrong now
here's<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.069> reason<00:02:51.340> why<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.730> had<00:02:51.849> my

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
here's the reason why I had my

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.750 
here's the reason why I had my
brother-in-law<00:02:53.370> breathing<00:02:54.370> down<00:02:54.549> my<00:02:54.609> neck

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
brother-in-law breathing down my neck

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.259 
brother-in-law breathing down my neck
and<00:02:55.239> he's<00:02:55.840> like<00:02:56.549> kind<00:02:57.549> of<00:02:57.609> he<00:02:57.819> was<00:02:57.940> taking<00:02:58.180> a

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
and he's like kind of he was taking a

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.849 
and he's like kind of he was taking a
video<00:02:58.389> while<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:58.840> was<00:02:59.109> doing<00:02:59.290> this<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.739> he's

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
video while I was doing this and he's

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.190 
video while I was doing this and he's
like<00:02:59.920> oh<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.430> should<00:03:00.459> name<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:01.060> how<00:03:01.689> to<00:03:01.750> blow

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
like oh you should name this how to blow

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.979 
like oh you should name this how to blow
your<00:03:02.409> engine<00:03:02.829> up<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.250> 30<00:03:03.790> seconds<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.920> did

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
your engine up in 30 seconds so I did

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.839 
your engine up in 30 seconds so I did
chintz<00:03:07.989> out<00:03:08.139> a<00:03:08.319> little<00:03:08.560> bit<00:03:08.769> on<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.430> vacuum

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
chintz out a little bit on the vacuum

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.289 
chintz out a little bit on the vacuum
line<00:03:10.409> because<00:03:11.409> when<00:03:12.069> you<00:03:12.189> undo<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.879> vacuum

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
line because when you undo the vacuum

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.190 
line because when you undo the vacuum
line<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:14.200> Rev<00:03:14.439> bounces<00:03:15.159> from<00:03:15.400> 1,000<00:03:16.389> rpm<00:03:16.989> to

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
line the Rev bounces from 1,000 rpm to

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.960 
line the Rev bounces from 1,000 rpm to
1,500<00:03:17.799> rpm<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.060> bounces<00:03:19.209> so<00:03:19.660> it's<00:03:19.810> like

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
1,500 rpm so it bounces so it's like

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.490 
1,500 rpm so it bounces so it's like
he's<00:03:21.970> just<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:23.470> know<00:03:24.780> making<00:03:25.780> me<00:03:25.900> antsy<00:03:26.290> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
he's just you know making me antsy and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.819 
he's just you know making me antsy and
so<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.280> didn't<00:03:28.000> put<00:03:28.269> as<00:03:28.449> say<00:03:28.930> much<00:03:29.290> as<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.620> thought

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
so I didn't put as say much as I thought

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.640 
so I didn't put as say much as I thought
I<00:03:29.889> did<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:31.239> did<00:03:31.419> put<00:03:31.659> a<00:03:31.690> lot<00:03:31.900> more<00:03:31.930> into<00:03:32.530> the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
I did so it did put a lot more into the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.129 
I did so it did put a lot more into the
gas<00:03:32.829> tank<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.459> then<00:03:33.699> just<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.599> rest<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.989> what

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
gas tank and then just the rest of what

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:43.159 
gas tank and then just the rest of what
the<00:03:35.379> bottle<00:03:35.940> had<00:03:36.940> left<00:03:37.299> into<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.019> crankcase

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.420 

you<00:03:44.169> know<00:03:44.260> some<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.530> your<00:03:44.709> questions<00:03:45.069> might<00:03:45.280> be

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
well did it work in a sense it did I

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.110 
well did it work in a sense it did I
don't<00:03:56.260> want<00:03:56.409> to<00:03:56.530> say<00:03:56.680> it's<00:03:56.919> a<00:03:57.190> mechanic<00:03:57.879> and<00:03:58.000> it

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
don't want to say it's a mechanic and it

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.430 
don't want to say it's a mechanic and it
can<00:03:58.329> I<00:03:59.099> think<00:04:00.099> see<00:04:00.370> phones<00:04:00.609> purpose<00:04:01.269> in<00:04:01.720> the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
you know sticky lifters carbon deposits

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.860 
you know sticky lifters carbon deposits
inside<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.989> engine<00:04:13.199> but<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:15.359> maybe<00:04:16.359> notice<00:04:16.780> a

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
inside the engine but I maybe notice a

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.509 
inside the engine but I maybe notice a
little<00:04:17.049> bit<00:04:17.169> more<00:04:17.380> of<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.560> spirited<00:04:18.130> throttle

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
little bit more of a spirited throttle

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.819 
little bit more of a spirited throttle
response<00:04:18.639> in<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.120> lower<00:04:19.299> rpm<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:20.019> then

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
response in the lower rpm and then

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.690 
response in the lower rpm and then
consistent<00:04:21.639> throughout<00:04:21.849> the<00:04:22.210> higher<00:04:22.450> rpms

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
consistent throughout the higher rpms

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.210 
consistent throughout the higher rpms
but

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
but

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.559
