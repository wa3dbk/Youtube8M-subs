00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.930
 hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.420
 Alina Balaban and we are with you today 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.410
 continue our lessons on our favorite 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.810
 kanzashi 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.640
 as you see, I have not gone anywhere just 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.090
 a little rest and ready again 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.119
 work today we will do with you 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:38.300
 Here is such a pretty rezinochku for 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:41.870
 hair here if you are ready go means 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.610
 what we need we need here such 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.390
 thin ribbon for leaves 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:53.060
 one centimeter yes and the length of 10 centimeters 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:56.420
 here it is the tape up to 171 centimeter length 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:00.980
 10 so we still need to tape this here 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.890
 squares 5 by 5 centimeters to that's it 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.409
 let's go do petals petals 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.810
 we make the triangular turned out here 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:16.840
 such here I show how we take the leaf 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.840
 we fold it up again together 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:28.610
 more time together to look so good 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.610
 there is and further pruned minions there 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.510
 to prune 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.890
 So 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.080
 then we cut only not as we 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.260
 we cut the triangular yes here and so we 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:52.200
 we cut and we cut at an angle so that 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:55.540
 It turned out like a triangle here 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.900
 Now you can take pintsetik and well 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:07.270
 correct it so that it would come together 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.920
 so here on the iron so there is more 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.160
 what we do we do of course 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.900
 turn it over here principle it 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.250
 just a deal yes here's a triangular 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.900
 petal wriggle his gifts 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.580
 It happens like this copy stock such 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.280
 we need only five petals 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.680
 pieces so on 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.960
 for leaflets we use this here 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.230
 Our tape Yes, I have already prepared 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.950
 It turns out here are such petals 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.520
 sharp little yes how are we doing we fold 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:46.870
 beautiful side inward here's the tip 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:51.820
 tip further we cut it off need 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.110
 take pintsetik and burn well if u 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.080
 you have a soldering iron 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.110
 this work is even simpler in principle 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:06.489
 faster so little man like this 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.540
 we turn out here with us 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.030
 here is a leaf 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.430
 so further we will do the assembly with you 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.129
 our flower means she needs it 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.560
 I took rezinochku and this yes in color 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.420
 how could I have found such a person 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.370
 so I took just orange but 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.340
 principle and it looks very even 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.840
 nicely made the base attached 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.829
 tape and everything as always do our 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.250
 assembly of sv . 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.709
 do not start as usual but with petals 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:42.109
 we start first with a leaflet to us 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:48.139
 you need to attach five leaves so 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:51.909
 We attach our leaves like this 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.909
 here it is the parties neatly 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:07.010
 in this way in this way 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.010
 here are neatly attached 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.820
 so circle 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.170
 attach 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.340
 so I already attached all the leaves 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.590
 It turned out so interesting 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.020
 look funny such an asterisk yes 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.590
 next we will attach our petals 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.900
 we fasten the petals this time not like 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.730
 past that is we first we cannot 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.110
 here is glue, yes, and we smear ourselves 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:50.840
 petal u showing where 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:55.870
 smear the tip and here these are the side 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.050
 the sides are a bit quite up to the tip and 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.060
 lateral 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:11.710
 so here we try it now 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:11.710
 attach so look like so there is 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.009
 here is such a leaf 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.449
 like this 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:24.710
 shout smart so in the same way 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:32.059
 we attach all our petals yes 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:32.059
 just the tip of the smear glue and the same, and 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.550
 we can side a little second 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:48.110
 it turns out like this and glue 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.110
 neatly unhurried 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.260
 so it means sticking on all 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.260
 rest 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.750

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.139
 our petals now that last us 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.289
 left it just beads where you want 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.690

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.460
 so interesting straziki yes what I 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.699
 I took this base for beads and 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:25.300
 pasted a bead into it just now 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:27.960
