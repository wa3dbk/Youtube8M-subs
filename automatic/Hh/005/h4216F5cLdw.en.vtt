00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.090
 hello everybody welcome to the gourmet 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.410
 work I 'm more yellow light and today we 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.380
 Let's make one of the most 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.269
 Basic Brazilian cuisine and rice 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.580
 We're going to make two types of rice. 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.619
 white rice to rice traditionalism 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.330
 that is increasingly present 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.210
 on the table of Brazilians for their 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.930
 nutritious qualities and delicious uses c 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.510
 and 7 c to make the rice is very simple 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.270
 you will always need to remember the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.340
 ratio 1 to 2 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.020
 the white rice you always do in 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.600
 ratio 1 to 2 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.940
 a glass of rice for two glasses of water 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.510
 that's the exact proportion you're going to leave 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 your tasty yummy rice cooked and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.050
 single and already the brown rice he uses 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.170
 a proportion of silver 3 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.120
 or a glass of rice for three glasses 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.859
 water because brown rice does not 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.899
 undergoes a series of processes with rice 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.090
 white suffers so he needs more 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.979
 cooking and more water to reach 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.990
 that we need to start 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.560
 make either rice rice 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.790
 I would like you to leave us 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.090
 comments 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.560
 which is the plural of rice is a rose 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.750
 the first thing you get 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.900
 pan with lid as you throw a 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.630
 oil and then you put your onion to 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.909
 sautÃ© for about two minutes until it 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.860
 start getting transparent to start 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.810
 to sweat a little at that moment you 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.210
 You can already put a little salt 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.049
 will even help onion to braise 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.450
 equally 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.790
 after that you throw your eye leaves 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.070
 he also for a maximum of one minute is 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.200
 braiding does not let him burn no 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.549
 gets a bitter taste puts his 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.729
 brown rice or rice 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.990
 White 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.149
 You'll let it fry a little. 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.850
 that's what you put no more 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.149
 than 12 minutes 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.219
 and it is precisely for the friends within 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.110
