beam's<00:02:13.270> out<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.510> our<00:02:13.599> eyes<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.720> mean<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.080> guess

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
beam's out of our eyes I mean I guess

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.380 
beam's out of our eyes I mean I guess
that's<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.470> whole<00:02:14.650> story<00:02:14.770> right<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:15.940> we<00:02:16.150> are

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
necessarily get the highest score the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.320 
necessarily get the highest score the
real<00:02:24.280> thing<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.760> every<00:02:25.060> time<00:02:25.270> you

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
real thing is that every time you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.199 
real thing is that every time you
destroy<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.440> building<00:02:27.340> block<00:02:27.670> or<00:02:27.940> something

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
destroy a building block or something

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.180 
destroy a building block or something
with<00:02:28.330> your<00:02:28.420> eye<00:02:28.599> lasers<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:29.560> increase<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
with your eye lasers you increase the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.559 
with your eye lasers you increase the
combo<00:02:30.819> multiplier<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:32.280> your<00:02:33.280> session<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:33.940> so

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
combo multiplier of your session and so

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.690 
combo multiplier of your session and so
what<00:02:34.840> you're<00:02:34.989> really<00:02:35.019> looking<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.800> do<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.160> to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
what you're really looking to do is to

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.240 
what you're really looking to do is to
optimize<00:02:36.880> your<00:02:37.180> score<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.319> come<00:02:38.920> up<00:02:39.069> with<00:02:39.099> a

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
optimize your score is to come up with a

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.210 
optimize your score is to come up with a
really<00:02:39.580> great<00:02:39.880> line<00:02:40.120> for<00:02:40.450> clearing<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.870> city

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
really great line for clearing the city

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.710 
really great line for clearing the city
without<00:02:42.220> losing<00:02:42.790> your<00:02:42.819> combo<00:02:43.269> which<00:02:43.390> happens

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
without losing your combo which happens

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.449 
without losing your combo which happens
after<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> couple<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.319> seconds<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:44.709> activity

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.280 
felt like the sound density in the game
was<00:03:04.330> pretty<00:03:04.630> high<00:03:05.220> um<00:03:06.220> yeah<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.870> just

and<00:03:15.390> virtually<00:03:16.390> all<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:17.290> was<00:03:17.530> done<00:03:17.709> using

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
and virtually all of it was done using

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.470 
and virtually all of it was done using
my<00:03:18.160> voice<00:03:18.370> except<00:03:18.790> for<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> few<00:03:19.000> things<00:03:19.150> that

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
my voice except for a few things that

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.060 
my voice except for a few things that
were<00:03:19.570> basically<00:03:19.900> some<00:03:20.170> tin<00:03:20.350> cans<00:03:20.620> or<00:03:20.829> being

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
were basically some tin cans or being

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.569 
were basically some tin cans or being
knocked<00:03:21.250> together<00:03:21.459> oh<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:24.220> hard<00:03:24.489> to

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
knocked together oh it's so hard to

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.400 
knocked together oh it's so hard to
shoot<00:03:24.790> down<00:03:24.940> those<00:03:25.150> missiles<00:03:25.600> let<00:03:26.109> me<00:03:26.230> tell

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
shoot down those missiles let me tell

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.630 
shoot down those missiles let me tell
you<00:03:26.530> but<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:26.739> can<00:03:26.920> be<00:03:27.070> done<00:03:27.190> usually<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.609> just

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
you but it can be done usually I just

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.099 
you but it can be done usually I just
dodge<00:03:27.970> them<00:03:28.209> they<00:03:28.480> have<00:03:28.569> a<00:03:28.630> limited<00:03:28.930> lifespan

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
dodge them they have a limited lifespan

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.030 
dodge them they have a limited lifespan
anyway<00:03:29.650> but<00:03:29.920> they<00:03:30.040> are<00:03:30.190> homing<00:03:30.730> missiles<00:03:31.030> um

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
anyway but they are homing missiles um

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.110 
anyway but they are homing missiles um
so<00:03:33.040> yeah<00:03:35.190> hmm<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:38.579> tank<00:03:39.579> terps<00:03:39.790> anything

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
so yeah hmm the tank terps anything

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.020 
so yeah hmm the tank terps anything
that's<00:03:40.269> that's<00:03:40.540> labeled<00:03:40.780> as<00:03:41.079> debris<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:42.030> meant

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
that's that's labeled as debris is meant

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.789 
that's that's labeled as debris is meant
to<00:03:43.120> not<00:03:43.299> intersect<00:03:43.870> intersect<00:03:44.530> with<00:03:44.650> no

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
to not intersect intersect with no

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.690 
to not intersect intersect with no
buildings<00:03:45.220> oh<00:03:46.440> but<00:03:47.440> otherwise<00:03:47.650> work<00:03:48.340> pretty

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
buildings oh but otherwise work pretty

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.849 
buildings oh but otherwise work pretty
good<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:49.810> turned<00:03:50.049> out<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.290> risk<00:03:50.470> all<00:03:50.620> kinds

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
good just turned out the risk all kinds

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.910 
good just turned out the risk all kinds
of<00:03:50.920> game<00:03:51.069> balance<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:52.350> performance<00:03:53.350> issues<00:03:53.590> I

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
of game balance and performance issues I

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.259 
of game balance and performance issues I
know<00:03:54.160> with<00:03:54.340> colliding<00:03:54.760> with<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:54.880> buildings

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
know with colliding with the buildings

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.360 
know with colliding with the buildings
so<00:03:56.609> anyway<00:03:57.609> that's<00:03:57.790> this<00:03:58.150> is<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:58.420> game<00:03:58.630> I

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
so anyway that's this is the game I

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.590 
so anyway that's this is the game I
think<00:04:00.370> it's<00:04:00.459> pretty<00:04:00.579> cool<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:01.000> missiles<00:04:01.359> do

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
think it's pretty cool the missiles do

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.559 
think it's pretty cool the missiles do
destroy<00:04:02.049> buildings<00:04:02.440> which<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:02.829> kind<00:04:03.069> of<00:04:03.160> fun

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
destroy buildings which is kind of fun

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.840 
destroy buildings which is kind of fun
and<00:04:04.569> I<00:04:05.079> love<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.560> sort<00:04:05.799> of<00:04:05.859> poetic<00:04:06.069> justice<00:04:06.459> of

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
and I love the sort of poetic justice of

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.490 
and I love the sort of poetic justice of
letting<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.590> missiles<00:04:08.590> hit<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.549> buildings

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
letting the missiles hit the buildings

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.680 
letting the missiles hit the buildings
so<00:04:11.500> that's<00:04:11.680> a<00:04:11.769> game<00:04:11.950> um<00:04:12.209> really<00:04:13.209> happy<00:04:13.480> with<00:04:13.600> it

so that's a game um really happy with it

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.210 
so that's a game um really happy with it

the third time i've used unity3d one
time<00:04:20.350> I<00:04:20.380> made<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.620> web-based<00:04:20.919> game<00:04:21.159> using<00:04:21.459> Ruby

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
time I made a web-based game using Ruby

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.149 
time I made a web-based game using Ruby
on<00:04:21.789> Rails<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.870> while<00:04:23.260> a<00:04:23.500> lot<00:04:23.530> of<00:04:23.830> those<00:04:23.950> games

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:24.159 
on Rails and while a lot of those games

on Rails and while a lot of those games
I<00:04:24.370> felt<00:04:24.610> had<00:04:24.789> a<00:04:24.940> lot<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.210> potential

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.990 
um I feel that this is by far the most
complete<00:04:29.740> game<00:04:30.159> it's<00:04:30.340> like<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:30.789> game

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
complete game it's like this game

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.379 
complete game it's like this game
doesn't<00:04:31.270> have<00:04:31.509> potential<00:04:32.289> it's<00:04:33.039> done<00:04:33.789> is<00:04:34.120> what

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389
