30 minutes and i would say emphatically

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.120 
30 minutes and i would say emphatically
no<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.779> know<00:00:18.900> let's<00:00:19.109> break<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.560> down<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.949> same

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
no you know let's break it down the same

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.370 
no you know let's break it down the same
as<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:20.369> do<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.609> running<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.180> cycling<00:00:21.779> let's

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
as we do on running on on cycling let's

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.779 
as we do on running on on cycling let's
break<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.769> down<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.070> interval<00:00:23.400> training

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
break it down to interval training

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.810 
break it down to interval training
repetition<00:00:24.330> training<00:00:24.980> use<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.189> drills<00:00:26.490> so

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
repetition training use the drills so

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.390 
repetition training use the drills so
essential<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.779> know<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> technique<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.710> so

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
essential you know the technique is so

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.980 
essential you know the technique is so
so<00:00:29.640> important<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.150> swimming<00:00:30.420> probably<00:00:30.750> more

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
so important in swimming probably more

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.709 
so important in swimming probably more
so<00:00:31.199> than<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.410> other<00:00:31.500> two<00:00:31.650> disciplines<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.940> get

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
so than the other two disciplines so get

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.900 
so than the other two disciplines so get

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
arm or the right arm out in front so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.249 
arm or the right arm out in front so
we're<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.500> our<00:01:34.590> side<00:01:34.920> six<00:01:35.759> leg<00:01:35.970> beads<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.540> then

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
we're on our side six leg beads and then

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.020 
we're on our side six leg beads and then
repeat<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> cycle<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.640> what<00:01:38.850> we're<00:01:39.000> doing

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
repeat the cycle so what we're doing

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.760 
repeat the cycle so what we're doing
with<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.450> we're<00:01:40.110> getting<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.439> good<00:01:40.590> rotation

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
with that we're getting a good rotation

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.210 
with that we're getting a good rotation
we're<00:01:41.310> getting<00:01:41.490> rotation<00:01:42.000> both<00:01:42.180> sides<00:01:43.220> we're

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
we're getting rotation both sides we're

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
we're getting rotation both sides we're
emphasizing<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.030> leg<00:01:45.149> kick<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.540> balance

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
emphasizing the leg kick for balance

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.420 
emphasizing the leg kick for balance
when<00:01:46.110> we're<00:01:46.290> not<00:01:46.380> actually<00:01:46.590> working<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
when we're not actually working on the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.280 
when we're not actually working on the
arms<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> good<00:01:49.110> rotation

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
arms and because of the good rotation
