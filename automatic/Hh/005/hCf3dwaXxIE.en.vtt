in<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.810> words<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.580> as<00:02:01.580> kids<00:02:02.210> they<00:02:02.600> are<00:02:03.200> both

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
in the words and as kids they are both

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.100 
in the words and as kids they are both
in<00:02:04.520> their<00:02:04.700> own<00:02:04.850> way<00:02:05.120> a<00:02:05.150> little<00:02:05.479> bit<00:02:05.600> out<00:02:05.840> cause

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
in their own way a little bit out cause
