for<00:02:42.079> mold<00:02:43.079> purposes<00:02:43.680> but<00:02:44.459> it's<00:02:45.030> really<00:02:45.180> up<00:02:45.329> to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
for mold purposes but it's really up to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.809 
for mold purposes but it's really up to
you<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.930> your<00:02:46.560> bed<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.069> what<00:02:47.220> kind<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:49.819> what

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
you and your bed and what kind of what

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.490 
you and your bed and what kind of what

kind of what makes you comfortable and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.930 
kind of what makes you comfortable and
it<00:02:55.500> was<00:02:55.620> down<00:02:55.829> on<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.069> ground<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.519> she<00:02:56.730> was<00:02:56.819> an

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
it was down on the ground and she was an

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.509 
it was down on the ground and she was an
infant<00:02:57.060> ours<00:02:57.510> our<00:02:57.930> mattress<00:02:58.410> was<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
infant ours our mattress was on the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.059 
infant ours our mattress was on the
ground<00:02:59.760> when<00:03:00.060> she<00:03:00.299> could<00:03:00.480> crawl<00:03:00.720> off<00:03:01.069> after

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
ground when she could crawl off after

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.309 
ground when she could crawl off after
she<00:03:02.220> learned<00:03:02.459> how<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.610> crawl<00:03:02.940> when<00:03:03.180> she<00:03:03.420> was

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
she learned how to crawl when she was

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.309 
she learned how to crawl when she was
about<00:03:04.560> eight<00:03:05.489> nine<00:03:05.760> months<00:03:06.060> old<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.810> we<00:03:07.140> moved

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
about eight nine months old so we moved

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.970 
about eight nine months old so we moved
it<00:03:07.530> down<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.579> ground<00:03:09.859> actually<00:03:10.859> it's

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
it down to the ground actually it's

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.199 
it down to the ground actually it's
probably<00:03:11.069> more<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.489> ten<00:03:11.730> because<00:03:12.090> she

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
probably more like ten because she

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.240 
probably more like ten because she
crawled<00:03:12.450> late<00:03:12.630> but<00:03:12.959> usually<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.470> guess<00:03:13.680> most

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
crawled late but usually I guess most

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.180 
crawled late but usually I guess most
people<00:03:14.340> would<00:03:14.639> be<00:03:14.730> like<00:03:14.910> eight<00:03:15.060> months<00:03:15.450> old

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
people would be like eight months old

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.800 
people would be like eight months old
