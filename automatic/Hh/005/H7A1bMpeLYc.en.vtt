you want to call it just came out and
I'm<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> middle<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.920> filming<00:00:11.910> my<00:00:12.210> unboxing

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
I'm in the middle of filming my unboxing

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.849 
I'm in the middle of filming my unboxing
or<00:00:13.290> editing<00:00:14.009> my<00:00:14.130> unboxing<00:00:14.400> now<00:00:14.990> but<00:00:15.990> um<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
or editing my unboxing now but um the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.660 
or editing my unboxing now but um the
one<00:00:17.039> concern<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.490> had<00:00:17.910> as<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.359> was<00:00:18.510> doing<00:00:18.779> that

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
one concern I had as I was doing that

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.730 
one concern I had as I was doing that
after<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.850> take<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.240> battery<00:00:21.600> back<00:00:21.900> off<00:00:22.170> and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
after you take the battery back off and

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.609 
after you take the battery back off and
put<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.550> back<00:00:23.699> together<00:00:24.109> you<00:00:25.109> know<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.260> click

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
put it back together you know you click

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.650 
put it back together you know you click
it<00:00:25.800> all<00:00:25.980> around<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> outside<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.300> device

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
it all around the outside of the device

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.410 
it all around the outside of the device
and<00:00:28.109> then<00:00:28.650> also<00:00:29.570> by<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.650> camera<00:00:31.650> as<00:00:32.000> well<00:00:34.219> it's

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
and then also by the camera as well it's

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.250 
and then also by the camera as well it's
still<00:00:36.420> doesn't<00:00:37.020> hold<00:00:37.710> out<00:00:38.190> water<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.989> guess

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
still doesn't hold out water and I guess

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.680 
still doesn't hold out water and I guess
it's<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.969> way<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> back<00:00:42.450> is

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
it's not going to the way the back is

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.220 
it's not going to the way the back is
designed<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:44.360> plastic<00:00:45.360> with<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
designed it's just plastic with the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.150 
designed it's just plastic with the
little<00:00:47.690> clicky<00:00:48.690> bits<00:00:48.930> that's<00:00:49.590> how<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> only

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
little clicky bits that's how the only

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.700 
little clicky bits that's how the only
way<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.399> describe<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.530> there's<00:00:52.530> no

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
way I can describe it so there's no

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.119 
way I can describe it so there's no
there's<00:00:53.070> nothing<00:00:53.460> preventing<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.510> from

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
there's nothing preventing it from

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.000 
there's nothing preventing it from
keeping<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.340> water<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:58.640> or<00:00:59.640> out<00:00:59.940> I<00:00:59.969> should<00:01:00.239> say

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
keeping the water in or out I should say

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.260 
keeping the water in or out I should say
so<00:01:02.010> let<00:01:02.100> me<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.399> show<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.579> what<00:01:02.789> I'm<00:01:02.879> talking

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
so let me just show you what I'm talking

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.010 
so let me just show you what I'm talking
about<00:01:03.799> we're<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.549> dip<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.659> water

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
about we're going to dip it in the water

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.859 
about we're going to dip it in the water
and<00:01:10.670> just<00:01:11.670> make<00:01:11.820> sure<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.270> gets<00:01:12.390> all<00:01:12.600> nice<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and just make sure it gets all nice and

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:27.840 
and just make sure it gets all nice and
wet

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.370 

I'm<00:01:28.850> just<00:01:29.150> drying<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.570> off<00:01:29.660> right<00:01:29.930> now<00:01:30.080> I<00:01:30.110> want

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
I'm just drying it off right now I want

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.530 
I'm just drying it off right now I want
to<00:01:30.410> make<00:01:30.530> sure<00:01:30.740> all<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.220> water<00:01:31.430> is<00:01:31.820> off<00:01:32.000> the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
to make sure all the water is off the

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.870 
to make sure all the water is off the
outside<00:01:33.040> just<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:34.430> make<00:01:34.610> sure<00:01:34.640> I'm<00:01:34.850> not

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
outside just to make sure I'm not

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.570 
outside just to make sure I'm not
missing<00:01:35.330> construing<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.230> results<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.460> we're

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
missing construing the results so we're

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.190 
missing construing the results so we're
gonna<00:01:37.670> take<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.030> back<00:01:38.180> off<00:01:38.480> and<00:01:38.750> see<00:01:38.960> what<00:01:39.110> it

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
gonna take the back off and see what it

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.760 
gonna take the back off and see what it
looks<00:01:39.230> like<00:01:39.500> inside<00:01:42.370> now<00:01:43.370> I<00:01:43.900> mean<00:01:44.900> I<00:01:45.110> imagine

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
looks like inside now I mean I imagine

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
looks like inside now I mean I imagine
the<00:01:46.640> device<00:01:46.970> is<00:01:47.300> designed<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.290> way<00:01:48.350> but<00:01:48.920> this

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
the device is designed this way but this

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.510 
the device is designed this way but this
just<00:01:50.120> makes<00:01:50.510> me<00:01:50.690> feel<00:01:50.930> kind<00:01:51.260> of<00:01:51.500> uneasy<00:01:51.680> seeing

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
just makes me feel kind of uneasy seeing

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.630 
just makes me feel kind of uneasy seeing
the<00:01:53.450> water<00:01:54.080> on<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.620> back<00:01:54.800> like<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.490> feels

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
the water on the back like that it feels

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.880 
the water on the back like that it feels
like<00:01:55.850> it's<00:01:56.000> right<00:01:56.780> by<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.080> internals<00:01:57.770> and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
like it's right by the internals and

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.130 
like it's right by the internals and
just<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.040> I<00:02:01.070> can<00:02:01.340> focus<00:02:01.550> better<00:02:01.900> so<00:02:02.900> you<00:02:02.990> can

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
just so I can focus better so you can

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.980 
just so I can focus better so you can
see<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.710> water<00:02:04.460> like<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.360> can<00:02:05.479> see<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.720> drops

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
see the water like you can see the drops

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.130 
see the water like you can see the drops
everywhere<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:06.850> if<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:08.060> see<00:02:08.360> where<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.929> SIM

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
everywhere and if you see where the SIM

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.640 
everywhere and if you see where the SIM
card<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.740> micro<00:02:10.959> SD<00:02:11.959> card<00:02:12.230> goes<00:02:12.410> that's

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
card and the micro SD card goes that's

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.130 
card and the micro SD card goes that's
actually<00:02:13.070> dry<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.850> then<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.600> spot<00:02:14.900> on<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
actually dry and then the spot on the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.650 
actually dry and then the spot on the
right<00:02:15.320> hand<00:02:15.590> side<00:02:15.709> is<00:02:15.950> dry<00:02:16.190> as<00:02:16.340> well<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.940> think

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
right hand side is dry as well I think

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.190 
right hand side is dry as well I think
that's<00:02:17.840> where<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.350> more<00:02:19.420> delicate<00:02:20.420> internals

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
that's where the more delicate internals

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.130 
that's where the more delicate internals
go<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:23.660> reason<00:02:24.140> behind<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.860> if<00:02:25.850> we<00:02:26.840> look

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
go and the reason behind that if we look

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.890 
go and the reason behind that if we look
at<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.860> back<00:02:28.070> cover<00:02:28.100> in<00:02:28.910> just<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.269> second<00:02:29.720> it

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
at the back cover in just a second it

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:38.229 
at the back cover in just a second it
kind<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.200> seals<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.920> off<00:02:36.400> so<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.430> can<00:02:37.640> see<00:02:37.910> this

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
kind of seals it off so you can see this

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.750 
kind of seals it off so you can see this
little<00:02:39.010> piece<00:02:40.010> right<00:02:40.130> here<00:02:40.250> it's<00:02:40.640> actually

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
little piece right here it's actually

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.270 
little piece right here it's actually
rubber<00:02:41.269> so<00:02:41.690> I'm<00:02:41.989> sure<00:02:42.470> that's<00:02:42.739> what<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.070> does

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
rubber so I'm sure that's what that does

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.039

that<00:02:43.549> seals<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:45.730> but<00:02:46.730> as<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.209> can<00:02:47.510> imagine<00:02:47.630> the

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
that seals it but as you can imagine the

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.590 
that seals it but as you can imagine the
little<00:02:48.230> clips<00:02:48.530> on<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.250> outside<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:50.090> the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
the back aren't going to prevent the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.660 
the back aren't going to prevent the
water<00:02:53.540> from<00:02:53.660> going<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.980> like<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.280> said<00:02:55.519> I'm

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
water from going in so like I said I'm
