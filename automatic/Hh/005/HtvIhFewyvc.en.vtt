00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.040
 have four coins signed by four 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.190
 the left open so you can see all 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.190
 moment the four coins one two three 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.530
 we cover like this we do with care in 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.770
 d 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.170
 curious thing 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.220
 to me also alex has also 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.400
 Surprised 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:09.580
 let's try to repeat it clearly 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.580
 simply cover them in an innocuous way 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.040
 the mind 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.260
 the little coins hidden in your hand, look 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.510
 I'm going to press the pellet could 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.430
 leave it in there but not the old one 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.430
 out for it to turn against time 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.989
 the moment it comes out 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.989
 yes 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.569
 I'm going to leave the two coins in the 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:34.450
 palm of your hand you can see this one 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.150
 I'm clearly not going to take one out of the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.280
 silver I'm going to ask you to put your finger 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.420
 over so that the other does not escape 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.420
 Look, it was easy 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.390
 that has been changed and has foundations that 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.390
 we have already done so slow is possible 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.440
 ah
