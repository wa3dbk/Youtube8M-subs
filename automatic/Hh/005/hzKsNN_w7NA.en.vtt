smart lock has makes a lot of sense

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.570 
smart lock has makes a lot of sense
personally<00:00:10.139> I'm<00:00:10.260> not<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.469> big<00:00:10.530> lock<00:00:10.920> guy

personally I'm not a big lock guy

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.879 
personally I'm not a big lock guy
my<00:00:12.030> son<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.780> he<00:00:12.929> likes<00:00:13.110> putting<00:00:13.410> his<00:00:13.500> coding

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
my son is is he likes putting his coding

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.589 
my son is is he likes putting his coding
when<00:00:14.009> he<00:00:14.070> turns<00:00:14.250> his<00:00:14.370> phone<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:15.240> keep<00:00:15.420> tell

when he turns his phone on you keep tell
me<00:00:15.690> how<00:00:15.750> much<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.990> need<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.470> I

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
me how much I need to do that so I

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.230 
me how much I need to do that so I
decided<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.220> play<00:00:17.369> around<00:00:17.550> with<00:00:17.670> lock<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
decided to play around with lock the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.670 
decided to play around with lock the
smart<00:00:18.510> lock<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.900> get<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.170> going

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
smart lock and get that going

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.179 
smart lock and get that going
the<00:00:20.220> idea<00:00:20.460> being<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.590> lock<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.769> up<00:00:22.920> as

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the idea being is that lock it up as

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.400 
the idea being is that lock it up as
long<00:00:23.609> as<00:00:23.640> there's<00:00:23.910> something<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:25.289> I

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
long as there's something that that I

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.859 
long as there's something that that I
can<00:00:25.590> around<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.949> I'm<00:00:26.039> not<00:00:26.789> trusting<00:00:27.269> or

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
can around that I'm not trusting or

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.480 
can around that I'm not trusting or
something<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.199> am<00:00:28.349> trusting<00:00:28.859> don't<00:00:29.220> put<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
something I am trusting don't put the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.580 
something I am trusting don't put the
lock<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.359> how<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.289> go<00:00:31.439> into

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
lock on and how we do that if we go into

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.840 
lock on and how we do that if we go into
the<00:00:31.740> setting<00:00:32.420> we<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> add<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> security

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
the setting we have to add on a security

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.000 
the setting we have to add on a security
and<00:00:36.020> security<00:00:37.020> we're<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.440> put<00:00:37.829> in

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
and security we're going to put in

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.290 
and security we're going to put in
something<00:00:38.160> called<00:00:38.309> trusted<00:00:38.790> agents<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
something called trusted agents the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.389 
something called trusted agents the
trusted<00:00:39.629> agents<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.020> called<00:00:40.230> smart<00:00:40.530> lock<00:00:40.680> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
trusted agents is called smart lock and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.950 
trusted agents is called smart lock and
make<00:00:41.520> sure<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.850> once<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.570> you'll

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
make sure it's on once it's on you'll

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.760 
make sure it's on once it's on you'll
never<00:00:43.140> let<00:00:43.350> see<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> smart<00:00:43.890> lock<00:00:44.040> features<00:00:44.460> in

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
never let see the smart lock features in

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.279 
never let see the smart lock features in
the<00:00:46.770> lock<00:00:47.010> screen<00:00:47.340> setting<00:00:47.989> so<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.050> go<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the lock screen setting so we go to a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.830 
the lock screen setting so we go to a
lock<00:00:49.440> screen<00:00:49.590> setting<00:00:50.070> now<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.210> set<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.750> up

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
lock screen setting now if we set it up

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.040 
lock screen setting now if we set it up
-<00:00:53.059> we're<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.300> turn<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.539> off<00:00:54.719> right<00:00:54.870> now

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
- we're going to turn it off right now

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.700 
- we're going to turn it off right now
so<00:00:55.520> there's<00:00:56.520> no<00:00:56.640> security<00:00:57.000> lock<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.600> even<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:58.649> I

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
so there's no security lock or even if I

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950 
so there's no security lock or even if I
put<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.039> swipe<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.609> unlock<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.270> you'll

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
put it on just swipe to unlock it you'll

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.240 
put it on just swipe to unlock it you'll
see<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> smart<00:01:01.620> lock<00:01:01.770> feature<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
see that the smart lock feature is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.889 
see that the smart lock feature is
turned<00:01:02.579> off

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
turned off

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.080 
turned off
right<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.220> order<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> smart<00:01:05.909> lock

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
right so in order to get a smart lock

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.870 
right so in order to get a smart lock
feature<00:01:06.299> turned<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.500> pick

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
feature turned on I have to pick

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.980 
feature turned on I have to pick
something<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.000> security<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.869> I've

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
something with a security so like I've

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.280 
something with a security so like I've
knocked<00:01:10.170> code<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.710> pattern<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.189> pain<00:01:11.369> code

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
knocked code a pattern of pain code

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.550 
knocked code a pattern of pain code
right<00:01:14.270> just<00:01:15.270> make<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.080> don't<00:01:16.380> want

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
right just make it one up I don't want

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.240 
right just make it one up I don't want
to<00:01:16.650> change<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.009> back<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.960> okay<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.979> idea

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
to change it back up in okay so the idea

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.140 
to change it back up in okay so the idea
being<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.799> smart<00:01:22.799> lock<00:01:25.939> will<00:01:26.939> ask

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
being here is that smart lock will ask

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.620 
being here is that smart lock will ask
me<00:01:27.450> what<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> want<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.040> trust<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:30.329> trust

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
me what do you want to trust I can trust

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.140 
me what do you want to trust I can trust
a<00:01:30.810> face<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.470> face<00:01:31.710> unlock<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.700> could<00:01:32.909> trust

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
a face like face unlock we could trust

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.539 
a face like face unlock we could trust
place<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:34.380> at<00:01:34.470> work<00:01:34.500> or<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.159> I'm<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
place so if I'm at work or if I'm at the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.390 
place so if I'm at work or if I'm at the
office<00:01:35.930> don't<00:01:36.930> lock<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.470> or<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:38.310> I'm

the<00:01:47.009> NSC<00:01:47.340> take<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.610> still<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.000> turn<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the NSC take you still have to turn the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.240 
the NSC take you still have to turn the
screen<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:49.110> tap<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:50.070> it

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
screen on and then tap it and then it

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.490 
screen on and then tap it and then it
would<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.579> sort<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.790> read<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:52.350> it's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
would have to sort of read it so it's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.840 
would have to sort of read it so it's
just<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.070> fast<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.430> put<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> pin

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
just on it just as fast to put a pin

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.120 
just on it just as fast to put a pin
code<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:55.320> idea<00:01:55.560> being<00:01:55.740> here<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.009> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
code in so the idea being here is that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.200 
code in so the idea being here is that
you<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.579> add<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.000> I've<00:01:57.719> added<00:01:57.960> my<00:01:58.110> G<00:01:58.320> watch

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
you can add it in I've added my G watch

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.490 
you can add it in I've added my G watch
so<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> idea<00:02:00.509> being<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.930> now<00:02:01.110> when<00:02:01.469> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
so the idea being is that now when I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.160 
so the idea being is that now when I
turn<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> screen<00:02:02.130> off<00:02:02.719> give<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.869> second

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
turn on the screen off give it a second

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.429 
turn on the screen off give it a second
sort<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.469> lock<00:02:05.000> turn<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.090> back<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.409> just

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
sort of lock turn it back on I can just

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.240 
sort of lock turn it back on I can just
swipe<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.250> turns<00:02:09.149> on

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
swipe and turns on

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.980 
swipe and turns on
so<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.880> weird<00:02:11.060> part<00:02:11.210> of<00:02:11.330> me<00:02:11.540> was<00:02:11.780> the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
so that the weird part of me was the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.530 
so that the weird part of me was the
fact<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.320> if<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.650> turn<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.010> screen<00:02:13.250> on

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
fact that if you turn the screen on

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.270 
fact that if you turn the screen on
still<00:02:14.540> shows<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.960> lock<00:02:15.200> if<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.740> tap<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.070> lock<00:02:16.250> I

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
still shows the lock if I tap the lock I

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.310 
still shows the lock if I tap the lock I
can<00:02:16.550> still<00:02:19.240> punch<00:02:20.240> my<00:02:20.420> code<00:02:20.630> which<00:02:20.900> I've<00:02:21.050> got

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
can still punch my code which I've got

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.850 
can still punch my code which I've got
there<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:23.690> thing<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:24.080> if<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.410> turn<00:02:24.680> off

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
there so the thing is if I turn off

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.140 
there so the thing is if I turn off
Bluetooth<00:02:25.070> so<00:02:25.490> I'm<00:02:25.550> not<00:02:25.700> connected<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.030> my

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
Bluetooth so I'm not connected to my

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.810 
Bluetooth so I'm not connected to my
Bluetooth<00:02:27.050> watch<00:02:27.320> anymore<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.460> turn<00:02:28.700> the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
Bluetooth watch anymore and I turn the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.890 
Bluetooth watch anymore and I turn the
screen<00:02:29.060> off<00:02:30.550> turn<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:31.580> back<00:02:31.850> on<00:02:32.150> sort<00:02:32.780> of<00:02:32.840> see

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
screen off turn it back on sort of see

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.980 
screen off turn it back on sort of see
like<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:33.260> can't<00:02:34.100> swipe<00:02:34.370> into<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:35.030> have<00:02:35.210> to<00:02:35.540> put

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
like I can't swipe into it I have to put

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.190 
like I can't swipe into it I have to put
my<00:02:36.590> code<00:02:37.990> kind<00:02:38.990> of<00:02:39.110> cool<00:02:39.260> um<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.930> know<00:02:41.990> as

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
my code kind of cool um that you know as

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.080 
my code kind of cool um that you know as
long<00:02:42.350> as<00:02:42.470> my<00:02:42.560> watch<00:02:42.800> is<00:02:42.980> within<00:02:43.160> range<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.910> this

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
long as my watch is within range of this

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.570 
long as my watch is within range of this
phone<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:45.350> can<00:02:45.980> don't<00:02:46.160> have<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.310> worry<00:02:46.430> about<00:02:46.490> a

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
phone I can don't have to worry about a

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.720 
phone I can don't have to worry about a
security<00:02:46.970> codes<00:02:47.300> but<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:47.570> left<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:47.990> at<00:02:48.490> at<00:02:49.490> the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
security codes but I left it at at the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.940 
security codes but I left it at at the
office<00:02:50.180> or<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.420> left<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.780> somewhere<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.380> I've

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950

office or I left it somewhere and I've
walked<00:02:52.160> away<00:02:52.340> with<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.700> somebody<00:02:53.360> can<00:02:53.510> pick<00:02:53.750> it

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
walked away with it somebody can pick it

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.750 
walked away with it somebody can pick it
up<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.800> know<00:02:54.860> start<00:02:55.160> using<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.610> because

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
up and you know start using it because

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.130 
up and you know start using it because
they<00:02:56.060> don't<00:02:56.150> have<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.450> watch<00:02:56.600> nearby<00:02:56.990> they

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
they don't have the watch nearby they

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.020 
they don't have the watch nearby they
get<00:02:57.260> them<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.440> wipe<00:02:57.560> in<00:02:57.709> then<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.700> very<00:02:58.880> cool

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
get them to wipe in then so very cool

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.680 
get them to wipe in then so very cool
anyways<00:02:59.840> hope<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.350> guys<00:03:00.470> enjoy<00:03:00.650> that
