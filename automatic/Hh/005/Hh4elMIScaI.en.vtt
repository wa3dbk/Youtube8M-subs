00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
how easy it is to move most handlebars

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.660 
how easy it is to move most handlebars

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
inside of there it's a really expensive

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.940 
inside of there it's a really expensive
prop<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.630> grade<00:02:09.740> say<00:02:10.740> here<00:02:11.630> on<00:02:12.630> this<00:02:13.020> usually

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
prop up grade say here on this usually

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.760 
prop up grade say here on this usually
you<00:02:14.070> can<00:02:14.220> go<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.580> off<00:02:14.820> reserve<00:02:15.270> right<00:02:15.570> here<00:02:15.810> but

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
you can go on off reserve right here but

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.860 
you can go on off reserve right here but
since<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.220> motor<00:02:17.460> is<00:02:17.790> such<00:02:18.150> high<00:02:18.330> performance

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
since the motor is such high performance

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.140 
since the motor is such high performance
it<00:02:18.990> needs<00:02:19.230> more<00:02:19.470> gas<00:02:19.820> so<00:02:20.820> it's<00:02:20.940> actually

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
it needs more gas so it's actually

off<00:02:44.240> there's<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.450> battery<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:46.170> doesn't<00:02:46.470> look

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
off there's the battery it doesn't look

off there's the battery it doesn't look
like<00:02:46.620> much<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.040> it's<00:02:47.400> actually<00:02:47.700> about<00:02:47.730> $120

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
like much but it's actually about $120

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.949 
like much but it's actually about $120
it's<00:02:49.410> one<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.709> those<00:02:50.480> magma<00:02:51.480> power<00:02:51.690> or

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
it's one of those magma power or

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.640 
it's one of those magma power or
something<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.070> gel<00:02:53.310> cell<00:02:53.550> battery<00:02:54.650> AGM

excuse<00:02:56.610> me<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.880> battery<00:02:57.830> here<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:58.950> can<00:02:59.130> see

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
excuse me the battery here you can see

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.729 
excuse me the battery here you can see
usually<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.690> would<00:03:00.870> be<00:03:01.050> where<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.530> you

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
usually this would be where like you

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.190 
usually this would be where like you
could<00:03:01.920> see<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.130> huge<00:03:02.459> difference<00:03:03.080> but<00:03:04.080> the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
could see a huge difference but the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.770 
could see a huge difference but the
color<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.530> pretty<00:03:04.770> much<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.520> same<00:03:05.780> which

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
color is pretty much the same which

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.270 
color is pretty much the same which
shows<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.050> this<00:03:07.350> thing's<00:03:07.590> been<00:03:07.800> very<00:03:08.010> well

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
shows that this thing's been very well

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:19.869 
shows that this thing's been very well
cared<00:03:08.580> for<00:03:08.989> off<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.230> guy<00:03:10.440> open

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.059 

here's<00:03:21.260> where<00:03:22.260> all<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.500> horse<00:03:22.680> powers

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
here's where all the horse powers

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.420 
here's where all the horse powers
generated<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:24.000> did<00:03:24.930> wash<00:03:25.200> off<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.709> exterior

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.220 
generated I did wash off the exterior
but<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.849> didn't<00:03:27.120> try<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.390> clean<00:03:27.689> this<00:03:27.900> engine

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
but I didn't try to clean this engine

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.020 
but I didn't try to clean this engine
bay<00:03:28.349> up<00:03:28.560> at<00:03:28.769> all

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
bay up at all

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.580 
bay up at all
there's<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.510> pipe<00:03:30.720> those<00:03:31.049> pipes<00:03:31.349> are

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
there's the pipe those pipes are

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.789 
there's the pipe those pipes are
ridiculous<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.610> try<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.849> find<00:03:33.290> if<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.560> can

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
ridiculous to try to find if you can

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.170 
ridiculous to try to find if you can
you're<00:03:35.040> going<00:03:35.129> to<00:03:35.220> pay<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.400> fortune<00:03:35.670> for<00:03:35.940> it

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
you're going to pay a fortune for it

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.970 
you're going to pay a fortune for it
because<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.540> adds<00:03:36.810> about<00:03:37.110> thirty<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.680> fifty

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
because that adds about thirty to fifty

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.180 
because that adds about thirty to fifty
horsepower<00:03:38.340> depending<00:03:38.879> on<00:03:39.239> how<00:03:39.390> it's<00:03:39.569> tuned

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
horsepower depending on how it's tuned

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.589 
horsepower depending on how it's tuned
and<00:03:41.190> it's<00:03:41.340> tuned<00:03:41.610> right<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.090> could<00:03:42.269> see<00:03:42.420> all

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
and it's tuned right you could see all

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.530 
and it's tuned right you could see all
these<00:03:42.720> extra<00:03:43.140> hoses<00:03:43.500> they're<00:03:43.650> extra<00:03:44.040> cooling

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
these extra hoses they're extra cooling

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.970 
these extra hoses they're extra cooling
so<00:03:45.540> if<00:03:45.689> you<00:03:45.780> do<00:03:45.930> get<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.319> thing<00:03:46.590> if<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:46.859> do

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
so if you do get this thing if we do

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.089 
so if you do get this thing if we do
make<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.250> tree<00:03:47.609> there's<00:03:48.329> these<00:03:49.099> there's

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
make the tree there's these there's

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.430 
make the tree there's these there's
these<00:03:50.310> little<00:03:50.459> pieces<00:03:50.760> here<00:03:51.379> there's<00:03:52.379> a

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
these little pieces here there's a

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.410 
these little pieces here there's a
couple<00:03:52.650> more<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.220> them<00:03:53.370> don't<00:03:53.760> ever<00:03:54.060> try<00:03:54.389> to

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
couple more of them don't ever try to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.910 
couple more of them don't ever try to
adjust<00:03:54.659> those<00:03:55.109> things<00:03:55.440> because<00:03:55.799> that's

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
adjust those things because that's

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.619 
adjust those things because that's
adjusting<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.670> water<00:03:56.879> flow<00:03:57.150> through<00:03:57.389> the

it's it's done up just right there's a

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.970 
it's it's done up just right there's a
song<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.510> know<00:04:03.870> it's<00:04:04.019> not<00:04:04.139> very<00:04:04.200> pretty<00:04:04.739> I

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
didn't try to get down there and scrub

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.300 
didn't try to get down there and scrub

look good
here's<00:04:11.129> more<00:04:12.060> cooling<00:04:12.599> hoses<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.879> here's<00:04:14.879> the

here's more cooling hoses and here's the
bigger<00:04:15.780> aftermarket<00:04:16.620> car<00:04:16.859> but<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:17.100> forget

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
bigger aftermarket car but I forget

bigger aftermarket car but I forget
exactly<00:04:17.579> what<00:04:18.030> size<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.479> is<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.840> think<00:04:18.900> it's<00:04:19.229> a

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.670 

47<00:04:23.539> but<00:04:24.539> I<00:04:24.660> don't<00:04:24.840> feel<00:04:24.960> like<00:04:25.110> taking<00:04:25.289> it<00:04:25.530> off

and looking at it and all but you could

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.110 
and looking at it and all but you could
see<00:04:28.760> underneath<00:04:29.760> here<00:04:30.060> it's<00:04:30.180> got<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.570> red

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
it's got a protec intake and like I said

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:45.710 
it's got a protec intake and like I said
the<00:04:38.370> motor<00:04:38.690> and<00:04:39.690> all<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.349> a<00:04:40.380> 760<00:04:41.310> motor<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:44.720> you

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
the motor and all is a 760 motor and you

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.290 
the motor and all is a 760 motor and you
know<00:04:45.840> it's<00:04:46.550> it's<00:04:47.550> got<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.849> wide<00:04:48.240> scope<00:04:48.570> piston

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
know it's it's got a wide scope piston

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.879 
know it's it's got a wide scope piston
it's<00:04:51.300> got<00:04:51.539> a<00:04:51.570> ton<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:51.990> compression<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.740> don't

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
it's got a ton of compression I don't

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.379 
it's got a ton of compression I don't
know<00:04:53.010> exactly<00:04:53.130> how<00:04:53.490> much<00:04:53.699> compression<00:04:54.090> I'll

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
know exactly how much compression I'll

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:55.879 
know exactly how much compression I'll
feel<00:04:54.750> like<00:04:54.870> doing<00:04:55.139> a<00:04:55.229> compression<00:04:55.710> check

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
feel like doing a compression check

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.790 
feel like doing a compression check
right<00:04:56.099> now<00:04:56.130> but<00:04:56.520> if<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:56.639> want<00:04:56.880> me<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.150> will

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
right now but if you want me to I will

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.020 
right now but if you want me to I will
I'm<00:04:58.800> fixing<00:04:59.190> this<00:04:59.250> started<00:04:59.580> up<00:04:59.669> here<00:04:59.880> in<00:04:59.970> a

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
I'm fixing this started up here in a

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.100 
I'm fixing this started up here in a
minute

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
minute

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.040 
minute
and<00:05:02.379> you<00:05:02.889> can<00:05:03.039> see<00:05:03.250> back<00:05:03.490> there<00:05:03.819> that's<00:05:04.569> where

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
and you can see back there that's where

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.219 
and you can see back there that's where
the<00:05:05.610> primer<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:06.909> instead<00:05:07.569> of<00:05:07.629> having<00:05:07.720> to<00:05:07.990> choke

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
the primer is instead of having to choke

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.899 
the primer is instead of having to choke
on<00:05:08.409> this<00:05:08.620> thing<00:05:08.860> we<00:05:09.039> got<00:05:09.189> a<00:05:09.220> primer<00:05:09.550> so<00:05:09.699> you

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
on this thing we got a primer so you

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.399 
on this thing we got a primer so you
just<00:05:10.060> prime<00:05:10.300> it<00:05:10.479> up<00:05:10.599> so<00:05:10.750> it'll<00:05:10.840> start<00:05:11.139> a<00:05:11.199> little

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
just prime it up so it'll start a little

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.879 
just prime it up so it'll start a little
bit<00:05:11.530> easier<00:05:11.830> because<00:05:12.219> since<00:05:12.639> it<00:05:12.789> since<00:05:13.120> it<00:05:13.300> is

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
bit easier because since it since it is

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.550 
bit easier because since it since it is
such<00:05:14.889> a<00:05:14.919> race<00:05:15.479> ski<00:05:16.479> as<00:05:16.840> you<00:05:17.050> can<00:05:17.199> see<00:05:17.349> right

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
such a race ski as you can see right

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.920 
such a race ski as you can see right
here<00:05:17.620> got<00:05:18.490> both<00:05:18.729> of<00:05:18.759> the<00:05:19.030> filters<00:05:19.419> right<00:05:19.689> there

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
here got both of the filters right there

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.119 
here got both of the filters right there
they're<00:05:20.110> going<00:05:20.379> down<00:05:20.590> and<00:05:20.889> they're<00:05:20.979> both

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
they're going down and they're both

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.820 
they're going down and they're both
feeding<00:05:21.580> at<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.789> same<00:05:22.000> time<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:22.830> that's

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
feeding at the same time and that's

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.279 
feeding at the same time and that's
where<00:05:24.039> your<00:05:24.159> primer<00:05:24.430> is<00:05:24.840> but<00:05:25.840> since<00:05:26.050> it's<00:05:26.199> a

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
where your primer is but since it's a

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.879 
where your primer is but since it's a
race<00:05:26.500> ski<00:05:27.180> if<00:05:28.180> it's<00:05:28.930> a<00:05:29.110> little<00:05:29.409> finicky<00:05:29.710> to

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
race ski if it's a little finicky to

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.520 
race ski if it's a little finicky to
start<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.699> first<00:05:30.969> time<00:05:31.210> of<00:05:31.389> the<00:05:31.419> day<00:05:31.629> you'll

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
start the first time of the day you'll

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.779 
start the first time of the day you'll
see<00:05:32.740> in<00:05:32.830> a<00:05:32.889> minute<00:05:33.009> because<00:05:33.250> I<00:05:33.400> hadn't<00:05:33.669> been

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
see in a minute because I hadn't been

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.580 
see in a minute because I hadn't been
trying<00:05:34.060> to<00:05:34.180> start<00:05:34.449> or<00:05:34.659> anything<00:05:34.840> out<00:05:35.169> here<00:05:35.409> I

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
trying to start or anything out here I

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.540 
trying to start or anything out here I
just<00:05:35.979> watch<00:05:36.400> this<00:05:36.669> thing<00:05:36.879> down<00:05:37.060> so<00:05:38.159> again<00:05:39.159> the

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
just watch this thing down so again the

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.640 
just watch this thing down so again the
outside<00:05:40.000> of<00:05:40.210> it<00:05:42.840> let<00:05:43.840> me<00:05:43.960> see<00:05:44.110> if<00:05:44.199> I<00:05:44.289> can<00:05:44.440> reach

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
outside of it let me see if I can reach

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.260 
outside of it let me see if I can reach
up<00:05:44.860> here<00:05:45.039> and<00:05:45.099> hit<00:05:45.340> this<00:05:45.460> button<00:05:45.729> and<00:05:46.030> kind<00:05:46.210> of

up here and hit this button and kind of

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.670 
up here and hit this button and kind of
give<00:05:46.419> it<00:05:46.539> a<00:05:46.599> little<00:05:46.629> bit<00:05:46.930> of<00:05:47.050> gas<00:05:47.199> while<00:05:47.560> it's

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
give it a little bit of gas while it's

00:05:47.680 --> 00:06:04.280 
give it a little bit of gas while it's
sitting<00:05:47.889> that's<00:05:48.879> up<00:05:49.120> pretty<00:05:49.330> high

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.140
