00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
here it's not that easy in the beginning

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.809 
here it's not that easy in the beginning
because<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:06.780> really<00:03:07.170> fast<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:08.069> lot<00:03:08.790> of

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
because it's really fast and a lot of

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.599 
because it's really fast and a lot of
stuff<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.329> do<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.859> later<00:03:10.859> on<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.519> think

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
stuff to do and later on and to think

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.000 
stuff to do and later on and to think

screen<00:03:49.330> or<00:03:49.450> something<00:03:49.900> came<00:03:50.260> out<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.590> I

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
screen or something came out and I

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.190 
screen or something came out and I
haven't<00:03:50.950> played<00:03:51.099> yet<00:03:51.129> so<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.180> has<00:03:55.209> a<00:03:55.840> lot<00:03:56.170> of

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
haven't played yet so so it has a lot of

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.509 
haven't played yet so so it has a lot of
potential<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.950> replay<00:03:57.519> value<00:03:59.160> but<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.340> also

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
potential and replay value but it also

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.770 
potential and replay value but it also
costs<00:04:01.209> about<00:04:01.530> think<00:04:02.530> 12<00:04:02.920> or<00:04:03.069> 13<00:04:03.700> yrs<00:04:03.849> would<00:04:04.299> and

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
costs about think 12 or 13 yrs would and

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.569 
costs about think 12 or 13 yrs would and
I<00:04:04.959> think<00:04:05.200> on<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.560> US<00:04:05.890> place<00:04:06.129> you're<00:04:06.310> sore

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
I think on the US place you're sore

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.059 
I think on the US place you're sore
about<00:04:06.780> fifteen<00:04:07.780> dollars<00:04:08.079> or<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.440> so<00:04:08.890> it's<00:04:09.010> not

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
about fifteen dollars or so so it's not

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.710 
about fifteen dollars or so so it's not
the<00:04:09.220> cheapest<00:04:09.670> game<00:04:09.819> but<00:04:10.090> with<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.599> online

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
the cheapest game but with the online

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.089 
the cheapest game but with the online
editor<00:04:11.110> editor<00:04:12.099> ends<00:04:12.879> that<00:04:13.090> we<00:04:13.180> gathered<00:04:14.099> it

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
editor editor ends that we gathered it

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.099 
editor editor ends that we gathered it
will<00:04:15.280> be<00:04:15.430> fun<00:04:15.670> for<00:04:15.849> a<00:04:15.940> long<00:04:16.090> time<00:04:16.329> I<00:04:16.359> think<00:04:16.930> and

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
will be fun for a long time I think and

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.319 
will be fun for a long time I think and
maybe<00:04:18.100> I<00:04:18.190> will<00:04:18.280> do<00:04:18.430> or<00:04:18.579> another<00:04:18.789> video<00:04:19.060> with

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
maybe I will do or another video with

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.200 
maybe I will do or another video with

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
happening in this game and i played a

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.390 
happening in this game and i played a
few<00:04:48.820> levels<00:04:49.419> later<00:04:49.780> so<00:04:50.169> this<00:04:50.770> is<00:04:50.889> all<00:04:51.039> from<00:04:51.340> a

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
few levels later so this is all from a

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.450 
few levels later so this is all from a
tutorial<00:04:51.700> so<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.240> real<00:04:52.479> levels<00:04:52.840> are<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.530> little

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
tutorial so the real levels are a little

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.640 
tutorial so the real levels are a little
bit<00:04:54.610> crazier<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.150> longer<00:04:56.139> and<00:04:56.169> stuff<00:04:56.530> like

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
that so here and you see the i slew

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.330 
that so here and you see the i slew
things<00:04:59.830> and<00:05:00.250> whatnot<00:05:01.860> they<00:05:02.860> always<00:05:03.099> try<00:05:03.280> to

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
things and whatnot they always try to

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.180 
things and whatnot they always try to
