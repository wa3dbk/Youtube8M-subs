00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.539 

okay<00:00:07.420> the<00:00:07.569> first<00:00:07.720> category<00:00:08.200> is<00:00:08.410> size<00:00:08.650> as<00:00:09.340> you

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:09.549 
okay the first category is size as you

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.070 
okay the first category is size as you
can<00:00:09.700> see<00:00:10.030> and<00:00:10.270> you<00:00:10.330> may<00:00:10.450> probably<00:00:10.690> know<00:00:10.900> the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
can see and you may probably know the

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.840 
can see and you may probably know the
SDS<00:00:11.469> proto<00:00:11.710> X<00:00:11.920> was<00:00:12.219> the<00:00:12.430> world's<00:00:12.670> smallest

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
SDS proto X was the world's smallest

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.570 
SDS proto X was the world's smallest
until<00:00:13.750> the<00:00:13.840> cheerson<00:00:14.110> cx-10<00:00:14.650> beat<00:00:14.920> it<00:00:15.039> out<00:00:15.129> but

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
until the cheerson cx-10 beat it out but

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.060 
until the cheerson cx-10 beat it out but
as<00:00:15.670> you<00:00:15.760> can<00:00:15.850> see<00:00:15.910> they're<00:00:16.150> both<00:00:16.180> very<00:00:16.690> small

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
as you can see they're both very small

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.400 
as you can see they're both very small
I'll<00:00:18.070> line<00:00:18.310> up<00:00:18.340> the<00:00:18.490> motor<00:00:19.449> pods<00:00:19.720> so<00:00:20.050> you<00:00:20.109> can

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
I'll line up the motor pods so you can

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.030 
I'll line up the motor pods so you can
see<00:00:21.120> the<00:00:22.120> cx-10<00:00:22.840> is<00:00:23.050> just<00:00:23.350> a<00:00:23.470> little<00:00:23.890> bit

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
see the cx-10 is just a little bit

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.160 
see the cx-10 is just a little bit
smaller<00:00:24.550> so<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:26.080> can<00:00:26.230> see<00:00:26.380> there<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:28.170> because

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
smaller so you can see there and because

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.200 
smaller so you can see there and because
of<00:00:29.200> that<00:00:29.320> I'm<00:00:29.650> giving<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.160> cheerson<00:00:30.490> cx-10<00:00:31.030> a

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
of that I'm giving the cheerson cx-10 a

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.609 
of that I'm giving the cheerson cx-10 a
5<00:00:31.539> since<00:00:31.930> it's<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.200> world's<00:00:32.439> smallest

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
5 since it's the world's smallest

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.670 
5 since it's the world's smallest
quadcopter<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:34.180> I'm<00:00:34.660> giving<00:00:34.899> the<00:00:34.960> SDS<00:00:35.440> proto

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
quadcopter and I'm giving the SDS proto

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.430 
quadcopter and I'm giving the SDS proto
EXA<00:00:36.070> 4

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.229 

the<00:00:42.440> cheerson<00:00:42.770> cx-10<00:00:43.280> is<00:00:43.520> really<00:00:43.760> stable<00:00:44.030> when

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
the cheerson cx-10 is really stable when

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.610 
the cheerson cx-10 is really stable when
it<00:00:44.329> hovers<00:00:44.660> really<00:00:44.960> nice<00:00:45.140> right<00:00:45.379> out<00:00:45.469> of<00:00:45.500> the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
it hovers really nice right out of the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.060 
it hovers really nice right out of the
box

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
box

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.639 
box
very<00:00:46.370> little<00:00:46.520> trimming<00:00:46.820> required<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:47.719> for

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
very little trimming required and for

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.869 
very little trimming required and for
that<00:00:48.769> I'm<00:00:48.980> gonna<00:00:49.100> give<00:00:49.340> this<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.550> for

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
that I'm gonna give this a for

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.729 
that I'm gonna give this a for
instability<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:52.180> SDS<00:00:53.180> proto<00:00:53.390> X<00:00:53.660> it<00:00:54.379> flies

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
instability and the SDS proto X it flies

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.979 
instability and the SDS proto X it flies
pretty<00:00:55.040> nice<00:00:55.219> but<00:00:55.460> I<00:00:55.519> figure<00:00:55.879> I<00:00:56.090> find<00:00:56.690> out<00:00:56.809> that

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
pretty nice but I figure I find out that

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.380 
pretty nice but I figure I find out that
sometimes<00:00:57.500> it<00:00:57.739> will<00:00:58.010> be<00:00:58.070> drifting<00:00:58.400> forward<00:00:59.210> a

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
sometimes it will be drifting forward a

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.360 
sometimes it will be drifting forward a
lot<00:00:59.570> even<00:00:59.809> if<00:01:00.170> I<00:01:00.320> give<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.530> lot<00:01:00.769> of<00:01:00.920> back<00:01:01.070> trim

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
lot even if I give a lot of back trim

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.130 
lot even if I give a lot of back trim
and<00:01:01.579> then<00:01:01.820> it'll<00:01:02.000> start<00:01:02.180> going<00:01:02.390> back<00:01:02.600> even<00:01:03.079> if

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
and then it'll start going back even if

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.020 
and then it'll start going back even if
I<00:01:03.229> get<00:01:03.320> forward<00:01:03.680> trim<00:01:03.860> it<00:01:04.339> just<00:01:04.399> keeps<00:01:04.729> swept

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
I get forward trim it just keeps swept

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.180 
I get forward trim it just keeps swept
shifting<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.600> trims<00:01:05.869> around<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.920> for<00:01:07.100> that

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
shifting the trims around so for that

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.670 
shifting the trims around so for that
I'm<00:01:07.340> going<00:01:07.460> to<00:01:07.520> give<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.820> 3.5<00:01:08.090> out<00:01:08.810> of<00:01:08.840> 5<00:01:09.020> for

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
I'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 for

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.740 
I'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 for
the<00:01:10.000> stability

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.930 

that's<00:01:15.710> for<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:15.980> LEDs<00:01:16.400> on<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.700> cheerson

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
that's for the LEDs on the cheerson

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.510 
that's for the LEDs on the cheerson
cx-10<00:01:17.450> they're<00:01:18.110> fairly<00:01:18.440> nice<00:01:18.740> two<00:01:19.040> blues<00:01:19.340> in

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
cx-10 they're fairly nice two blues in

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.190 
cx-10 they're fairly nice two blues in
the<00:01:19.610> front<00:01:19.820> two<00:01:19.970> Reds<00:01:20.120> in<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.270> back<00:01:20.480> but<00:01:21.170> I

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
the front two Reds in the back but I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.140 
the front two Reds in the back but I
find<00:01:21.500> that<00:01:21.590> they're<00:01:22.040> sometimes<00:01:22.580> hard<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:22.880> see

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
find that they're sometimes hard to see

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.390 
find that they're sometimes hard to see
from<00:01:23.480> all<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.840> angles<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:24.830> for<00:01:25.010> that<00:01:25.130> I'm

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
from all the angles so for that I'm

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.990 
from all the angles so for that I'm
gonna<00:01:25.580> give<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:25.970> cheerson<00:01:26.180> cx-10<00:01:26.690> a<00:01:26.840> three

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
gonna give the cheerson cx-10 a three

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.390 
gonna give the cheerson cx-10 a three
the<00:01:29.000> STS<00:01:29.450> proto<00:01:29.690> X<00:01:29.930> has<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.620> little<00:01:30.920> bit<00:01:31.010> nicer

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
the STS proto X has a little bit nicer

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.490 
the STS proto X has a little bit nicer
and<00:01:31.550> brighter<00:01:31.730> LEDs<00:01:32.240> as<00:01:32.510> you<00:01:33.020> can<00:01:33.140> see<00:01:33.260> it<00:01:33.380> also

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
and brighter LEDs as you can see it also

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.430 
and brighter LEDs as you can see it also
has<00:01:33.680> two<00:01:34.070> in<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:34.490> eyes<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.150> since<00:01:36.080> it's<00:01:36.260> more

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
has two in the eyes and since it's more

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.230 
has two in the eyes and since it's more
open<00:01:36.680> on<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.250> frame<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.550> can<00:01:37.850> see<00:01:37.910> them

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
open on the frame you can see them

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.090 
open on the frame you can see them
easier<00:01:38.570> from<00:01:38.720> all<00:01:38.900> angles<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:39.530> I'm<00:01:39.680> gonna<00:01:39.830> give

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
easier from all angles so I'm gonna give

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.240 
easier from all angles so I'm gonna give
the<00:01:40.490> proto<00:01:40.760> X<00:01:40.940> of<00:01:41.150> four<00:01:41.390> LEDs

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.910 

the<00:01:47.090> cheerson<00:01:47.390> cx-10<00:01:47.930> does<00:01:48.320> come<00:01:48.560> able<00:01:48.830> to

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
the cheerson cx-10 does come able to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.590 
the cheerson cx-10 does come able to
flip<00:01:49.160> and<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.460> flips<00:01:49.700> very<00:01:49.820> nice<00:01:50.240> off<00:01:50.510> the

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
flip and it flips very nice off the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.090 
flip and it flips very nice off the
control<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.110> just<00:01:51.290> click<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.650> button<00:01:51.920> and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
control you just click the button and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.890 
control you just click the button and
then<00:01:52.220> I'll<00:01:52.310> do<00:01:52.430> its<00:01:52.580> flip<00:01:52.820> there<00:01:53.450> very<00:01:53.690> nice

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
then I'll do its flip there very nice

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.420 
then I'll do its flip there very nice
and<00:01:54.290> for<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.560> I'll<00:01:54.770> be<00:01:54.890> giving<00:01:54.980> the<00:01:55.220> cheerson

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
and for that I'll be giving the cheerson

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.100 
and for that I'll be giving the cheerson
cx-10<00:01:55.990> 4.5<00:01:56.990> out<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.260> 5<00:01:57.320> for<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.830> flips<00:01:59.110> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
cx-10 4.5 out of 5 for the flips the

SC's pro 2x however does not flip with
the<00:02:02.480> stock<00:02:02.720> transmitter<00:02:03.260> and<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:03.650> have<00:02:03.800> to

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
the stock transmitter and you have to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.310 
the stock transmitter and you have to
have<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.280> hubsan<00:02:04.550> x4<00:02:04.730> transmitter<00:02:05.720> if<00:02:05.930> you

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
have the hubsan x4 transmitter if you

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.260 
have the hubsan x4 transmitter if you
want<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.560> flip<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.280> for<00:02:07.400> that<00:02:07.550> since<00:02:08.149> you

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
want to flip this so for that since you

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.190 
want to flip this so for that since you
can't<00:02:08.450> do<00:02:08.540> any<00:02:08.690> flip<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:09.020> I'll<00:02:09.110> give<00:02:09.290> it<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.440> 0

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200

the<00:02:15.160> speed<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.670> cheerson<00:02:15.910> cx-10<00:02:16.420> is

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
the speed on the cheerson cx-10 is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.740 
the speed on the cheerson cx-10 is
pretty<00:02:16.930> good<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.260> has<00:02:17.350> three<00:02:17.680> rates<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.750> on

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
pretty good it has three rates and on

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.720 
pretty good it has three rates and on
beginner<00:02:20.050> it's<00:02:20.260> real<00:02:20.440> slow<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.100> then<00:02:21.610> on

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
beginner it's real slow and then on

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.880 
beginner it's real slow and then on
advanced<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.300> gets<00:02:22.480> pitched<00:02:22.810> about<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.680> much

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
advanced it gets pitched about that much

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.140 
advanced it gets pitched about that much
so<00:02:24.160> it's<00:02:24.190> pretty<00:02:24.490> fast<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.990> give<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.709> a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
so it's pretty fast so I give that a

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.290 
so it's pretty fast so I give that a
four<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.920> SC's<00:02:30.280> Pro<00:02:30.490> X<00:02:30.700> only<00:02:30.970> has<00:02:31.090> one

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
four and the SC's Pro X only has one

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.380 
four and the SC's Pro X only has one
rate<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.780> it's<00:02:32.250> relatively<00:02:33.250> slow<00:02:33.700> soggy

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
rate and it's relatively slow soggy

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.520 
rate and it's relatively slow soggy
about<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.780> three

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
the packaging on the cxn is pretty nice

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.590 
the packaging on the cxn is pretty nice
it's<00:02:43.160> got<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:43.460> nice<00:02:43.670> little<00:02:43.700> viewing<00:02:44.270> spot

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
it's got this nice little viewing spot

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.720 
it's got this nice little viewing spot
up<00:02:44.780> here<00:02:44.810> but<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.650> feel<00:02:45.920> like<00:02:46.100> it's<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.580> little

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
up here but I feel like it's a little

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.030 
up here but I feel like it's a little
flimsy<00:02:47.090> from<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.840> plastic<00:02:48.320> isn't<00:02:48.620> too<00:02:48.770> great

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
flimsy from the plastic isn't too great

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.670 
flimsy from the plastic isn't too great
so<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:49.610> give<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:49.970> three

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
so I give that a three

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.470 
so I give that a three

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
the SDS proto X packaging is more

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.070 
the SDS proto X packaging is more
cardboard<00:02:53.840> it's<00:02:54.680> nice<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.130> compact<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:56.080> a

little<00:02:57.290> more<00:02:57.440> durable<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:58.010> think<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:59.240> I<00:02:59.270> give

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
little more durable I think so I give

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.430 
little more durable I think so I give
this<00:02:59.750> packaging<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.470> 5

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440

the<00:03:06.310> controller<00:03:06.790> is<00:03:06.910> fairly<00:03:07.300> nice<00:03:07.540> it's

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
the controller is fairly nice it's

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.050 
the controller is fairly nice it's
pretty<00:03:08.530> small<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.100> got<00:03:09.250> your<00:03:09.520> rates<00:03:09.850> on

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
pretty small and you got your rates on

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.850 
pretty small and you got your rates on
the<00:03:10.120> left<00:03:10.330> stick<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.990> your<00:03:11.260> flip<00:03:11.470> button<00:03:11.770> on

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860

the left stick and your flip button on
the<00:03:11.950> right<00:03:12.070> stick<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.940> got<00:03:13.120> your<00:03:13.240> trims<00:03:13.480> here

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
the right stick you got your trims here

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.310 
the right stick you got your trims here
pretty<00:03:16.120> nice<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:16.540> got<00:03:16.660> removable<00:03:17.080> stick

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
pretty nice and you got removable stick

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.050 
pretty nice and you got removable stick
pads<00:03:17.560> if<00:03:17.890> you're<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.250> pincher<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:18.820> want<00:03:18.970> to

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
pads if you're a pincher and you want to

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.690 
pads if you're a pincher and you want to
put<00:03:19.240> stick<00:03:19.690> extensions<00:03:20.230> on<00:03:20.380> but<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.280> find<00:03:21.580> that

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
put stick extensions on but I find that

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.630 
put stick extensions on but I find that
the<00:03:21.910> range<00:03:22.150> on<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.660> CX<00:03:23.260> 10<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:23.800> a<00:03:24.010> lot<00:03:24.310> worse

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
the range on this CX 10 is a lot worse

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.940 
the range on this CX 10 is a lot worse
than<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:24.940> proto<00:03:25.180> X<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:26.440> I'll<00:03:26.620> give<00:03:26.830> this

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
than the proto X so I'll give this

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.840 
than the proto X so I'll give this
transmitter<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.490> 3<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.920> proto<00:03:30.160> X<00:03:30.340> transmitter

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
transmitter a 3 the proto X transmitter

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.640 
transmitter a 3 the proto X transmitter
it's<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.090> same<00:03:31.270> thing<00:03:31.540> except<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.140> clicks<00:03:32.410> but

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
it's the same thing except it clicks but

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.630 
it's the same thing except it clicks but
there's<00:03:32.860> no<00:03:33.160> changing<00:03:33.640> of<00:03:33.700> read<00:03:33.880> surah

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
there's no changing of read surah

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.280 
there's no changing of read surah
but<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.910> range<00:03:37.120> on<00:03:37.330> this<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.630> find<00:03:37.870> is<00:03:38.020> a<00:03:38.050> lot

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
but the range on this I find is a lot

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.500 
but the range on this I find is a lot
better<00:03:38.560> than<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.950> cheerson<00:03:39.220> cx-10<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.180> it

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
better than the cheerson cx-10 and it

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.690 
better than the cheerson cx-10 and it
doesn't<00:03:40.840> drop<00:03:40.990> out<00:03:41.230> so<00:03:41.860> I'm<00:03:41.950> giving<00:03:42.250> this<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.400> 3

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
doesn't drop out so I'm giving this a 3

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.059 
doesn't drop out so I'm giving this a 3
also

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.179 

the<00:03:48.000> battery<00:03:48.330> on<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.599> cheerson<00:03:48.840> cx-10<00:03:49.349> takes

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
the battery on the cheerson cx-10 takes

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.860 
the battery on the cheerson cx-10 takes
about<00:03:50.310> 20<00:03:50.939> minutes<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.209> charge<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.599> get<00:03:51.689> about

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
about 20 minutes to charge you get about

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.020 
about 20 minutes to charge you get about
five<00:03:52.140> minutes<00:03:52.349> lights<00:03:52.670> that's<00:03:53.670> pretty<00:03:53.879> good

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
five minutes lights that's pretty good

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.960 
five minutes lights that's pretty good
so<00:03:54.239> I'm<00:03:54.299> gonna<00:03:54.450> give<00:03:54.599> it<00:03:54.629> a<00:03:54.750> Ford<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:56.489> STS

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
so I'm gonna give it a Ford and the STS

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
I'm going to give this a four and the

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.460 
I'm going to give this a four and the
proto<00:04:22.160> X<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.940> comes<00:04:23.210> with<00:04:23.419> the<00:04:23.660> white<00:04:23.990> which<00:04:24.290> I

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
proto X it comes with the white which I

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.860 
proto X it comes with the white which I
have<00:04:24.590> here<00:04:24.889> or<00:04:25.100> you<00:04:25.610> can<00:04:25.760> also<00:04:25.940> choose<00:04:26.120> the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
have here or you can also choose the

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.780 
have here or you can also choose the
black<00:04:27.290> so<00:04:27.560> there's<00:04:27.740> only<00:04:27.800> two<00:04:27.949> options<00:04:28.070> so<00:04:28.699> I'm

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
black so there's only two options so I'm

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.980 
black so there's only two options so I'm
going<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.000> give<00:04:29.120> that<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.300> three

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.560 

in<00:04:34.770> terms<00:04:35.070> of<00:04:35.250> overall<00:04:35.370> parents<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.240> think<00:04:36.449> that

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
in terms of overall parents I think that

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.480 
in terms of overall parents I think that
your<00:04:36.750> since<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.139> x10<00:04:37.470> looks<00:04:37.710> pretty<00:04:37.979> good<00:04:38.220> so

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
your since the x10 looks pretty good so

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.400 
your since the x10 looks pretty good so
I'm<00:04:39.360> gonna<00:04:39.479> give<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.840> three<00:04:40.169> on<00:04:40.289> the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
I'm gonna give that a three on the

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.730 
I'm gonna give that a three on the
appearance<00:04:41.030> but<00:04:42.030> I<00:04:42.060> think<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.570> proto<00:04:43.080> X<00:04:43.289> looks

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
appearance but I think the proto X looks

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.529 
appearance but I think the proto X looks
a<00:04:43.860> little<00:04:43.949> bit<00:04:44.160> better<00:04:44.340> with<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.639> design<00:04:45.240> I

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
a little bit better with the design I

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:46.820 
a little bit better with the design I
just<00:04:45.780> like<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:45.960> little<00:04:46.139> bit<00:04:46.320> more<00:04:46.350> so<00:04:46.680> I'm<00:04:46.740> gonna
