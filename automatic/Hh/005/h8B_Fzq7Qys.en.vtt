00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.760 
can't I don't think I think flak jacket
can<00:01:48.210> survive<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.600> direct<00:01:48.930> hit<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.590> mean

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
can survive a direct hit but I mean

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.230 
can survive a direct hit but I mean
honestly<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.220> don't<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.610> black<00:01:50.640> jacket

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
honestly they don't have black jacket

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.359 
honestly they don't have black jacket
they're<00:01:51.720> pretty<00:01:51.899> much<00:01:51.960> dead<00:01:52.320> no<00:01:52.590> matter<00:01:52.740> if

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
they're pretty much dead no matter if

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.859 
they're pretty much dead no matter if
they're<00:01:53.520> 10<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.299> five<00:01:54.570> feet<00:01:54.750> away

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
they're 10 it's not like five feet away

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.539 
they're 10 it's not like five feet away
from<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.320> think<00:01:55.380> that's<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.829> arrangement<00:01:56.009> I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
from it I think that's the arrangement I

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.060 
from it I think that's the arrangement I
don't<00:01:56.729> know<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:57.479> too<00:01:57.719> sure<00:01:57.960> I'm<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.320> an

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
don't know not too sure I'm not an

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.520 
don't know not too sure I'm not an

grip or what it's a quick-draw

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.850 
grip or what it's a quick-draw
quick-draw<00:02:22.079> does<00:02:22.260> add<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> little<00:02:22.680> bit<00:02:22.799> of

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
quick-draw does add a little bit of

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.860 
quick-draw does add a little bit of
accuracy<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:23.730> most<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.269> time<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.480> really

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
accuracy but most the time I really

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.559

the<00:02:44.459> only<00:02:44.609> class<00:02:45.030> setup<00:02:45.329> I<00:02:45.420> actually<00:02:45.569> find

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
the only class setup I actually find

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.869 
the only class setup I actually find
that<00:02:46.200> works<00:02:46.530> for<00:02:46.799> me<00:02:46.950> but<00:02:47.159> like<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.790> said

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
that works for me but like I said

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.369 
that works for me but like I said
everybody<00:02:48.359> has<00:02:48.629> their<00:02:48.810> own<00:02:48.840> opinions<00:02:49.290> and

want to put suppressor on this and you

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.690 
want to put suppressor on this and you
find<00:02:52.440> suppressor<00:02:52.859> works<00:02:53.040> better<00:02:53.250> than<00:02:53.430> a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
find suppressor works better than a

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.089 
find suppressor works better than a
quick<00:02:54.000> draw<00:02:54.209> by<00:02:55.079> all<00:02:55.230> means<00:02:55.319> use<00:02:55.799> use<00:02:56.069> use

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
quick draw by all means use use use

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.879 
quick draw by all means use use use
suppressor<00:02:57.060> but<00:02:57.239> if<00:02:57.329> I<00:02:57.569> find<00:02:57.900> fast<00:02:58.409> mags<00:02:58.680> to

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
suppressor but if I find fast mags to

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.679 
suppressor but if I find fast mags to
work<00:02:59.010> better<00:02:59.159> than<00:02:59.400> suppressor<00:03:00.269> use<00:03:00.450> fast

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
work better than suppressor use fast

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.449 
work better than suppressor use fast
mags<00:03:00.900> or<00:03:01.079> if<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.319> if<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.739> find<00:03:01.950> extended<00:03:02.340> mags

to<00:03:02.609> work<00:03:02.730> better<00:03:02.909> and<00:03:03.060> fast<00:03:03.299> mags<00:03:03.540> use

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
to work better and fast mags use

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.429 
to work better and fast mags use
extended<00:03:04.709> mags<00:03:04.859> or<00:03:05.040> if<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.639> need<00:03:05.909> a<00:03:05.939> red<00:03:06.150> dot

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
he's a red dot that's why there's so

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.640 
he's a red dot that's why there's so
many<00:03:08.819> attachments<00:03:09.150> for<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.139> know<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.409> college

as<00:03:13.079> I<00:03:13.200> die<00:03:13.260> from<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.590> bomb<00:03:13.799> host<00:03:14.099> guy<00:03:14.370> I

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
as I die from the bomb host guy I

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.860 
as I die from the bomb host guy I
thought<00:03:14.639> that<00:03:14.819> guy<00:03:14.939> had<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.450> really<00:03:15.720> did

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
thought that guy had it I really did

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.599 
thought that guy had it I really did
maybe<00:03:16.470> wasn't<00:03:16.769> even<00:03:16.919> defusing<00:03:17.310> but<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.489> thought

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
maybe wasn't even defusing but I thought

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.729 
maybe wasn't even defusing but I thought
he<00:03:17.730> had<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.910> but<00:03:18.269> but<00:03:18.930> yeah<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.319> mean<00:03:19.349> like<00:03:19.620> I
