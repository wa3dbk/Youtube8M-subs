00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.400
 otherwise 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:35.530
 she's going to mess up part of that 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.680
 dog leash weekend and three on 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.680
 four 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.450
 a gti is really in good condition with a 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.530
 engine really we will say nine that 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.300
 turns between 12 and 13 bars so come 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.980
 with a little bit of experience we'll say that 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.030
 must turn between 10 and 11 bar per 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.339
 against if we ever go below 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.920
 10 bacon and 9 9,5 that wants 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:23.270
 say that already segmentation and is 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:24.800
 tired during a series strong us 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.300
 had five bars so it's excellent 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.300
 it's very very good right now 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.590
 so this is the stage of the operation of 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.720
 compression taking on the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.490
 cylinders of his 205 elite gti 9 you 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.410
 can see only two if not four 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.820
 presents compressions that are all 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.940
 in fact satisfactory since they are 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.590
 higher than 12 by for the first one 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.569
 was a little over twelve soft bars 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.310
 by 2 or 3 jean that's it 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.289
 sees nothing more to do and to 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.220
 second one is practically at all this 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.220
 which is really excellent 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.500
 yeah 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.140
 so 12.3 on the first 12.5 on 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.640
 second here is 13 on the third and 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.670
 then even a little more than 13 to 13 13 25 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.750
 calling the elected what is perfect 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.750
 frankly there is a hold 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.990
 try with jacques 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.610
 Yes Yes 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.390
 but we saw against them 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.100
 yes answered a name 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.100
 the car is nice for that
