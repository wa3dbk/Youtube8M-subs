and<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:53.270> allows<00:02:53.600> her<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.920> make<00:02:54.920> sure<00:02:55.130> that

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
and this allows her to make sure that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.190 
and this allows her to make sure that
the<00:02:55.520> edge<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.940> bead<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.330> exactly<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.080> way

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
the edge of the bead is exactly the way

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:12.970 
the edge of the bead is exactly the way
she<00:02:57.230> wants<00:02:57.770> it

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.580 

now<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.670> torch<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.239> she's<00:03:14.480> using<00:03:14.750> today<00:03:15.349> is

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
now the torch that she's using today is

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.280 
now the torch that she's using today is
a<00:03:15.650> mini<00:03:16.220> CC<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:19.250> mini<00:03:19.489> CC<00:03:20.030> combines<00:03:20.540> oxygen

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
a mini CC that mini CC combines oxygen

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.619 
a mini CC that mini CC combines oxygen
and<00:03:21.440> natural<00:03:21.980> gas<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.640> order<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.269> create<00:03:23.480> a

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
and natural gas in order to create a

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:34.170 
and natural gas in order to create a
flame<00:03:24.790> now<00:03:25.790> she's<00:03:26.060> taking<00:03:26.269> her<00:03:32.799> stringer<00:03:33.799> and

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
flame now she's taking her stringer and

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.940 
flame now she's taking her stringer and
that<00:03:35.180> stringer<00:03:35.599> is<00:03:35.810> going<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.319> be<00:03:36.440> placing<00:03:36.830> the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
that stringer is going to be placing the

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.100 
that stringer is going to be placing the
little<00:03:37.220> dots<00:03:37.459> on<00:03:37.730> there<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.690> notice<00:03:39.079> that

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
little dots on there you notice that

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.550 
little dots on there you notice that
she's<00:03:39.470> using<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.950> flame<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:41.840> break<00:03:42.079> off<00:03:42.290> the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
she's using the flame to break off the

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.699 
she's using the flame to break off the
end<00:03:42.709> of<00:03:42.829> that<00:03:42.980> stringer<00:03:44.230> creates<00:03:45.230> less<00:03:45.470> work

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
end of that stringer creates less work

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.220 
end of that stringer creates less work
for<00:03:45.739> her<00:03:46.160> and<00:03:46.400> less<00:03:47.120> little<00:03:47.390> bits<00:03:47.629> and<00:03:47.840> pieces

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
for her and less little bits and pieces

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:57.150 
for her and less little bits and pieces
to<00:03:48.470> fall<00:03:48.680> back<00:03:48.890> onto<00:03:49.129> the<00:03:49.340> bead

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.630 

constantly<00:03:58.120> keeping<00:03:58.510> that<00:03:58.660> bead<00:03:58.900> in<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.380> heat

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
constantly keeping that bead in the heat

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.890 
constantly keeping that bead in the heat
as<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:01.540> notice<00:04:01.870> right<00:04:02.080> now<00:04:03.660> those<00:04:04.660> little

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
as you notice right now those little

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.100 
as you notice right now those little
dots<00:04:05.200> are<00:04:05.620> raised<00:04:06.040> up<00:04:06.340> as<00:04:06.790> she<00:04:07.540> continues<00:04:08.080> to

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
dots are raised up as she continues to

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.530 
dots are raised up as she continues to
keep<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.620> in<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:08.800> flame<00:04:09.070> those<00:04:09.820> dots<00:04:10.180> sink

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
keep it in the flame those dots sink

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.840 
keep it in the flame those dots sink
down<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.080> become<00:04:11.440> part<00:04:11.740> of<00:04:11.800> a<00:04:11.920> smooth<00:04:12.280> texture

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
down and become part of a smooth texture

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:28.510 
down and become part of a smooth texture
of<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.120> B

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.939 

you<00:04:29.090> can<00:04:29.240> see<00:04:29.419> behind<00:04:29.629> her<00:04:29.990> she's<00:04:30.289> got<00:04:30.560> the

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
you can see behind her she's got the

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.890 
you can see behind her she's got the
fiber<00:04:31.580> blanket<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.360> that's<00:04:32.479> what<00:04:32.720> she<00:04:32.750> used

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
fiber blanket and that's what she used

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.149 
fiber blanket and that's what she used
to<00:04:33.319> anneal<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.889> bead<00:04:34.099> in<00:04:35.680> she's<00:04:36.680> cut<00:04:36.860> off<00:04:37.009> her

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
to anneal the bead in she's cut off her

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.390 
to anneal the bead in she's cut off her
flame<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.699> now<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.000> can<00:04:38.240> see<00:04:38.270> that<00:04:38.629> that<00:04:38.659> bead

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
flame and now you can see that that bead

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.129 
flame and now you can see that that bead
very<00:04:40.400> closely<00:04:40.789> matches<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.449> beads<00:04:41.780> on<00:04:41.960> her

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
very closely matches the beads on her

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.860 
very closely matches the beads on her
wrist<00:04:42.470> and<00:04:43.030> becomes<00:04:44.030> this<00:04:44.270> very<00:04:44.599> beautiful

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870
