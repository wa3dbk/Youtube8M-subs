00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.060
 if and now to find access to these Hiatt designs 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.890
 I would be with the notes chain 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.279
 which he relatively often plays in pop music namely eighths 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:12.859
 and I am always on the high end now 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:15.119
 the rebels and their love game 3 4 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.119
 1 and 2 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.519
 pre-election conditions are offered 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:23.700
 and this 30th 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.489
 He helps us here too 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:26.699
 this movement 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.499
 to define exactly 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.989
 because what we want to do now is open it on the one and the sharks 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.930
 and at the 2 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.480
 she will be closed again 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.090
 "I just want that 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
 1 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
 1 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.220
 and Alfter on it 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.620
 that at the 2 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.290
 or she goes down 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.520
 and the euro is just a present 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.820
 that really 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.989
 is together 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.250
 we need a new movement here 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.460
 and let's take a closer look at the movement in the left leg 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.790
 or in the left foot 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.840
 I'm counting that now so I'm counting the eighth bankruptcy 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.300
 and just do the movement 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.380
 which makes the left foot 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.540
 1 and prices and 3 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
 and 1 and 2 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.979
 So at 1 2 and 1 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.630
 and it goes up 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.100
 and at the 2 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.750
 I'm back under 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.750
 but now everything together 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.820
 and the REP 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.240
 and 1 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.620
 3 and you 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.030
 I can stop here with my right hand 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.840
 the Czar and who are the influence 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.740
 if this contradiction is playing spike 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.740
 it sounds relatively discreet 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.630
 or still in December 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.280
 or I play here with the Â«stop flank or in the relatively strong 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.549
 attack 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.329
 Stay 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:14.429
 sda 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:15.919
 relatively loud 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.729
 So here I have the possibility of different sounds 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.279
 and that affects both my left leg and a pith both 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.429
 right hand 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:25.589
 so these people get more exercise 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:28.759
 Let's put that together with our basic rhythm 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.979
 2 and 3 and 4 and 2 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.789
 and that works at all 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:48.829
 do we have 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.149
 First of all, like our basic rhythm, you even know 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:55.149
 still from our first video 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.260
 Of course it's close now 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.450
 the sharks theme on the two and open because we always want to stay here 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.340
 find specific exercise for the topic you can also remember illogical who 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.010
 now to take the second of the time so 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.010
 the 2 under 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.609
 that it was alone here again 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.519
 1 and second 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.519
 edition 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.449
 and 2 4 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.459
 and 2 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.249
 3 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:27.190
 the movement in life was 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.510
 it's the same again 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.510
 and he plays the video with our basic rhythm 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:38.629
 1 4 and 2 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.409
 that's what Hundt writes 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:41.879
 Tim's ads 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.879
 it shows dreams 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.099
 as the next goal 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.469
 How should it be different 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:51.659
 the 3 under 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.799
 I'll do it alone again 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.009
 1 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.489
 2 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.489
 under 1 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.789
 Here again I have the opportunity to influence the women 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:12.139
 we play this together with our basic rhythm 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.249
 1 and 2 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:16.759
 3 1 and 2 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.650
 impulsive 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.699
 and finally 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.599
 let's do that was under EPT 4 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.309
 first alone 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:29.309
 1 and 2 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:32.960
 case 1 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.960
 constantly 2 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.620
 OSS unite and shut the door with this when calculating the way again 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.710
 to our 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.430
 move in 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.719
 must have along with our account 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.749
 1 and 2 Hon drives and 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:50.210
 radiant and 2 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.309
 Trier from Finn 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:55.170
 and I just had that was relatively heavy 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.020
 played here 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.020
 now a word about this hi-hat opening in general 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:05.929
 it just gives a new sound but I can also put some in 

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:09.279
 emphasize the musician discreet so emphasize 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:13.159
 I can tell Jan Cash Warren that had already met 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:18.839
 This is quite intrusive and we emphasize loudness 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:21.839
 in music, but I can also play something like that, for example 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.029
 Prada Erfurt dapd 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:27.659
 kind 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.259
 because there has there 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.300
 Arbon 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.150
 so certain notes 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.689
 highlight here 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:38.949
 subtle or biting louder but not as loud as for example a crash 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.069
 when he hires this opening first now all individually practiced 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.029
 Books, however, may give some suggestions 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.330
 as it might, for example, practice 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.180
 and now we do the following 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.910
 we play
