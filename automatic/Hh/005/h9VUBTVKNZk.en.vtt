00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
an hour braked hard the bike stopped

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.950 
an hour braked hard the bike stopped
beautifully<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.460> ABS<00:01:00.090> kit<00:01:00.390> then<00:01:00.629> at<00:01:00.840> the

beautifully the the ABS kit then at the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.770 
beautifully the the ABS kit then at the
very<00:01:00.989> end<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> rear<00:01:01.949> wheel<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:03.270> braking

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
very end on the rear wheel the braking

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.670 
very end on the rear wheel the braking
was<00:01:03.960> strong<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.640> brakes<00:01:06.000> were<00:01:06.680> progressive

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
was strong the brakes were progressive

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.429 
was strong the brakes were progressive
so<00:01:08.689> big<00:01:09.689> tech<00:01:09.900> there<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.340> other<00:01:12.200> bug<00:01:13.200> beer

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
so big tech there the other bug beer

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.380 
so big tech there the other bug beer
that<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> lot<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.010> owners<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> previous

model of headers with the suspension and
this<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.970> roadies<00:01:18.420> got<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.380> standard

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
this this roadies got the standard

suspension<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.869> tiger<00:01:24.869> 800xc<00:01:25.770> ex<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:28.020> I

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
suspension like the tiger 800xc ex and I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.530 
suspension like the tiger 800xc ex and I
can<00:01:28.320> tell<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.799> suspension<00:01:29.400> was<00:01:29.640> nice<00:01:30.329> and

firm but plush enough to be comfortable

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.399 
firm but plush enough to be comfortable
and<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:36.240> was<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.540> responsive<00:01:37.200> felt

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and it was really responsive felt

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.670 
and it was really responsive felt
planner<00:01:37.650> than<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> corners<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
planner than the corners the the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.310 
planner than the corners the the
steering<00:01:41.369> geometry<00:01:41.549> geometry<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:43.020> really

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
steering geometry geometry was really

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.340 
steering geometry geometry was really
easy<00:01:43.549> really<00:01:44.549> easy<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.060> turn<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.689> take<00:01:46.049> him

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
easy really easy to turn and take him

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.340 
easy really easy to turn and take him
into<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.619> corners<00:01:47.540> another<00:01:48.540> thing<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.899> noticed

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
into the corners another thing I noticed

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.660 
into the corners another thing I noticed
was<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.579> seats<00:01:50.939> slightly<00:01:51.509> narrower<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.670> then

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
was the seats slightly narrower and then

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.260 
was the seats slightly narrower and then
certainly<00:01:54.060> my<00:01:54.299> exe<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.610> that's<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.119> good

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
certainly my exe and it that's a good

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.270 
certainly my exe and it that's a good
thing<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.799> really<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> fire

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
thing I really like the fire

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.130 
thing I really like the fire
and<00:02:01.880> by<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.780> way<00:02:02.900> that<00:02:03.400> fly-by-wire<00:02:04.400> throttle

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
and by the way that fly-by-wire throttle

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.940 
and by the way that fly-by-wire throttle
has<00:02:06.140> eliminated<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:08.410> stepper<00:02:09.410> motor<00:02:09.679> so

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
has eliminated the stepper motor so

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.910 
has eliminated the stepper motor so
there's<00:02:10.160> no<00:02:10.450> issues<00:02:11.450> at<00:02:11.780> all<00:02:11.900> with<00:02:12.230> stupid

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
there's no issues at all with stupid

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.710 
there's no issues at all with stupid
letters<00:02:13.250> like<00:02:13.580> some<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.180> will<00:02:14.450> be<00:02:14.630> aware

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
letters like some of you will be aware

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.440 
letters like some of you will be aware
of<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:17.510> electronics<00:02:18.140> didn't<00:02:18.940> manage<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:19.970> get

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
of the electronics didn't manage to get

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.090

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
the traction control to kick in but it's

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.740

the talk on this new Tiger kicks in at
about<00:02:42.650> 2,000<00:02:43.459> rpm<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.620> only<00:02:45.620> ran<00:02:45.800> it<00:02:46.010> up<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.420> 7000

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
about 2,000 rpm I only ran it up to 7000

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.509 
about 2,000 rpm I only ran it up to 7000
rpm<00:02:47.900> because<00:02:48.200> it's<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.440> brand<00:02:48.650> new<00:02:48.739> bike<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.130> I

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
rpm because it's a brand new bike and I

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.020 
rpm because it's a brand new bike and I
don't<00:02:49.550> want<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:49.940> be<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.030> decade<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:52.030> that

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
don't want to be a decade and that

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.750 
don't want to be a decade and that
torque<00:02:53.480> curve<00:02:53.989> was<00:02:54.350> still<00:02:54.590> on<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:54.980> way<00:02:55.280> up<00:02:55.519> and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
torque curve was still on the way up and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.840 
torque curve was still on the way up and
hadn't<00:02:56.120> plateaued<00:02:56.630> out<00:02:57.280> this<00:02:58.280> thing<00:02:58.459> pulls<00:02:58.700> on

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.229 
it modulates going up and down hills
sweet<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:09.170> was<00:03:09.489> top-notch<00:03:10.489> now

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
sweet is it was top-notch now

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
electronics correctly so I wasn't able

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.620 
electronics correctly so I wasn't able
to<00:03:22.790> chuck<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.360> in<00:03:23.480> sport<00:03:23.870> mode<00:03:24.220> or<00:03:25.450> muck<00:03:26.450> around

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
to chuck it in sport mode or muck around

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.750 
to chuck it in sport mode or muck around
with<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.320> with<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.250> traction<00:03:28.610> control

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
with the with the traction control

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.000 
with the with the traction control
settings<00:03:29.390> but<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.600> on<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:30.200> don't<00:03:30.620> lose<00:03:30.709> traction

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
settings but I on I don't lose traction

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.759

today new tires good with us so there

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.259 
today new tires good with us so there
wasn't<00:03:33.920> going<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.220> happen<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:34.670> couldn't

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
wasn't going to happen so couldn't

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.110 
wasn't going to happen so couldn't
really<00:03:35.420> talk<00:03:35.750> about<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:36.140> traction<00:03:36.500> control

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
really talk about the traction control

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.120
