grain tortilla you can use any brand you
want<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.399> I<00:00:29.460> look<00:00:29.639> for<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:29.999> that's<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.300> little

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
want but I look for one that's a little

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.689 
want but I look for one that's a little
bit<00:00:30.689> lower<00:00:30.929> calorie<00:00:31.470> then<00:00:32.429> we're<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.640> to

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
bit lower calorie then we're going to

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.590 
bit lower calorie then we're going to
add<00:00:32.789> two<00:00:33.300> slices<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.230> turkey<00:00:34.829> bacon<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
add two slices of turkey bacon and the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.779 
add two slices of turkey bacon and the
reason<00:00:36.929> I<00:00:37.019> use<00:00:37.230> turkey<00:00:37.620> bacon<00:00:37.949> is<00:00:38.339> because

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
reason I use turkey bacon is because

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.790 
reason I use turkey bacon is because
it's<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.089> much<00:00:39.179> lower<00:00:39.510> calorie<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.260> lower<00:00:40.469> fat

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
it's so much lower calorie and lower fat

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.099 
it's so much lower calorie and lower fat
than<00:00:41.039> regular<00:00:41.070> bacon<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.719> one's<00:00:42.960> even

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
than regular bacon and this one's even

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.410 
than regular bacon and this one's even
precooked<00:00:43.859> so<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.699> heats<00:00:44.879> up<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
precooked so it just heats up and it

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.810 
precooked so it just heats up and it
makes<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.749> easy<00:00:45.899> last<00:00:46.800> we're<00:00:47.339> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.670> use

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
makes it easy last we're going to use

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.200 
makes it easy last we're going to use
one<00:00:47.850> slice<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:49.249> string<00:00:50.249> cheese<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.670> use<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
one slice of string cheese I use the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.540 
one slice of string cheese I use the
low-fat<00:00:51.600> string<00:00:51.870> cheese<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.280> don't

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
low-fat string cheese because I don't

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.040 
low-fat string cheese because I don't
see<00:00:53.699> any<00:00:53.850> difference<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> taste<00:00:54.690> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
see any difference in the taste and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.319 
see any difference in the taste and
there's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.949> fairly<00:00:56.309> good<00:00:56.699> difference<00:00:57.089> in<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
there's a fairly good difference in the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.180 
there's a fairly good difference in the
calories<00:00:57.749> this<00:00:58.079> piece<00:00:58.319> is<00:00:58.350> only<00:00:58.679> 60<00:00:59.159> calories

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
calories this piece is only 60 calories

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.750 
calories this piece is only 60 calories
so<00:01:00.179> you<00:01:00.239> wrap<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.760> then

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so you wrap it up like that and then

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.340 
so you wrap it up like that and then
we're<00:01:02.969> just<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> wrap<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.170> paper

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
we're just going to wrap it in a paper

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.700 
we're just going to wrap it in a paper
towel<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.930> place<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.259> in<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> microwave

my cottage cheese Sunday this is

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.569 
my cottage cheese Sunday this is
decadent<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.469> of<00:01:43.590> my<00:01:43.649> favorite<00:01:44.070> recipes

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
decadent it's one of my favorite recipes

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.779 
decadent it's one of my favorite recipes
I<00:01:44.820> use<00:01:45.329> about<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> cup<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:46.140> 2%<00:01:46.799> cottage<00:01:47.430> cheese

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
I use about a cup of 2% cottage cheese

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.730 
I use about a cup of 2% cottage cheese
because<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.329> keeps<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.750> calories<00:01:49.259> down<00:01:49.469> but

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
because that keeps the calories down but

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.190 
because that keeps the calories down but
the<00:01:49.829> protein<00:01:50.219> is<00:01:50.340> still<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:50.850> high<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:52.020> use

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the protein is still really high you use

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.429 
the protein is still really high you use
about<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.500> quarter<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> cup<00:01:53.219> of<00:01:53.399> raisins<00:01:53.729> I

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
about a quarter a cup of raisins I

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.539 
about a quarter a cup of raisins I
sprinkle<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.469> little<00:01:55.649> cinnamon<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.369> top

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
sprinkle a little cinnamon on the top

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.819 
sprinkle a little cinnamon on the top
and<00:01:56.759> then<00:01:57.090> about<00:01:57.359> a<00:01:57.420> tablespoon<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.289> honey<00:01:58.469> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
and then about a tablespoon of honey it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.469 
and then about a tablespoon of honey it
really<00:01:59.399> tastes<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.000> something<00:02:00.179> you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
really tastes like something you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.760 
really tastes like something you
shouldn't<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:00.960> eating<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.590> delicious<00:02:03.770> so
