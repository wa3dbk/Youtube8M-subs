00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:20.349
 world premiere in new york s 63 amg coupe 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.730
 here is the good piece in geneva 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.619
 we the normal first class coupe 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.970
 seen the reactions to it were from 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:30.939
 6 on wheels horny cart dream car yes 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:35.860
 and that is even now again a 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:38.710
 shoved on the s 63 amg coupe 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.410
 I have the chance with tobias moers dem 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.840
 boss of amg and he has me 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.050
 Why does this car say so 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.770
 Highlight is for driving 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.540
 performance 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.420
 that 's the amg and that stands for three 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.370
 Of course it has part of the dance 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.670
 new coupes I think so much 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.010
 very unique is that has the great 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.130
 Interior in there but we have a new one 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.180
 front axle in the car we have ours 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.610
 four-wheel drive in the car we have 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.180
 of course our motor in with 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.939
 Germany 585 ps 900 newton meters 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.710
 It's about eight minutes on the 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.060
 nordschleife for a first one so that 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.380
 I would have believed here five years ago 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.270
 that it ever works but it does 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.560
 works that listens superclass 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.690
 of course , no customer was on the 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.060
 running track 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.180
 but it's up to rehakles auto 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.460
 how much driving pleasure is there with the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.100
 Car can also experience with the comfort 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.420
 then it still has what it is 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.060
 I am very excited about the car 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.490
 jobs markets individualization means 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.410
 a keyword at amg so there is hardly any 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.600
 Wish the boys a wish 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.540
 Affalterbach does not go into fulfillment 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.620
 can let if you have the necessary 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.510
 has change 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.670
 however, all cars have one 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.570
 share this coat of arms here on the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.220
 center console affalterbach amg amg is 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.710
 by the way, very much in america too 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.590
 successful and why that is so 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.590
 me the america boss of mercedes benz 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.590
 tells 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.010
 you are hot and politics in peru 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.180
 more on the s 63 amg coupe 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.099
 especially of course is the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.590
 Exhaust system not only that here 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.930
 everywhere amg says no 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.030
 special sound flaps installed fell that 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.659
 car if you closed this one 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.190
 small flaps quite suzuki anno therefore 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.439
 Brothers but if you can do that 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.379
 then open or shut up 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.379
 Does this car really sound really nasty 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.000
 so and now again for a short time 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:10.570
 enjoy 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:14.950
 5.5 liter v8 biturbo whopping 585 ps 900 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:19.540
 Newtonmeter torque in 3 9 seconds 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.700
 it goes with all-wheel drive on 100 km h 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.600
 but it is also a real one 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.600
 dream car
