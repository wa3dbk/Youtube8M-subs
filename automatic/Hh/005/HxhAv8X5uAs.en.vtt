00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
in control the angle of it as it goes

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.910 
in control the angle of it as it goes
through<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.909> cycle<00:01:13.150> of<00:01:13.330> its<00:01:13.450> suspension

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
through the cycle of its suspension

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.410 
through the cycle of its suspension
we've<00:01:14.920> taken<00:01:15.190> that<00:01:15.460> same<00:01:15.700> design<00:01:16.060> that's<00:01:16.300> been

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
we've taken that same design that's been

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.480 
we've taken that same design that's been
so<00:01:16.600> successful<00:01:16.840> over<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.470> past<00:01:17.740> years<00:01:18.130> in<00:01:18.400> our

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
so successful over the past years in our

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.630 
so successful over the past years in our
TJ's<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.360> our<00:01:19.480> XJ<00:01:20.200> vehicles<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:21.280> we've<00:01:21.400> taken

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
TJ's and our XJ vehicles and we've taken

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.110 
TJ's and our XJ vehicles and we've taken
and<00:01:21.880> put<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.090> on<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.300> jk's<00:01:22.720> in<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:22.990> rear<00:01:23.170> now

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
and put it on the jk's in the rear now

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.090 
and put it on the jk's in the rear now
so<00:01:24.750> not<00:01:24.930> only<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.230> you<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.410> the<00:01:25.470> radius<00:01:25.950> arm

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
so not only do you have the radius arm

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.860 
so not only do you have the radius arm
in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.280> front<00:01:26.580> we've<00:01:27.150> taken<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.510> four-link

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
in the front we've taken the four-link

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.690 
in the front we've taken the four-link
off<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.290> back<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.740> put<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> radius<00:01:29.250> arm<00:01:29.430> also

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
off the back and put a radius arm also

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030 
off the back and put a radius arm also
in<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.120> rear<00:01:30.330> do<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.230> entire<00:01:31.470> cycle<00:01:31.800> of<00:01:32.010> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
in the rear do the entire cycle of the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.560 
in the rear do the entire cycle of the
suspension<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.700> allows<00:01:33.000> us<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.330> keep<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
suspension that allows us to keep the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 
suspension that allows us to keep the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
pinion angle exactly in phase keeping

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.910 
pinion angle exactly in phase keeping
you<00:01:36.150> joints<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.690> other<00:01:36.900> essential<00:01:37.620> items

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.290 
you joints and other essential items
under<00:01:38.100> your<00:01:38.220> vehicle<00:01:38.340> from<00:01:38.730> getting<00:01:39.060> over

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
under your vehicle from getting over

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.660 
under your vehicle from getting over

stress and broken radius arms will bind

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.760 
stress and broken radius arms will bind
at<00:01:41.850> some<00:01:42.030> point<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.720> people<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.380> also

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
at some point but people have also

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.080 
at some point but people have also
noticed<00:01:44.010> over<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> years<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.640> vehicles<00:01:45.000> are

noticed over the years the vehicles are

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.270 
noticed over the years the vehicles are
actually<00:01:45.330> getting<00:01:45.480> a<00:01:45.540> little<00:01:45.690> bit<00:01:45.870> lower<00:01:46.110> now

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
actually getting a little bit lower now

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.860 
actually getting a little bit lower now
it's<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.550> RTI<00:01:48.060> ramp<00:01:48.330> scores<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.750> we're
