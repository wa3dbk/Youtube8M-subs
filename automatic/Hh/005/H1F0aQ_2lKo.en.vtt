Dominic<00:00:31.529> would<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.949> say<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> few

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
Dominic would you like to say a few

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.470 
Dominic would you like to say a few
words<00:00:32.279> about<00:00:32.550> how<00:00:32.880> you're<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.239> do<00:00:33.329> that

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
words about how you're going to do that

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.330 
words about how you're going to do that
um<00:00:34.579> I've<00:00:35.579> got<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> block<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.390> clay<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.340> I've

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
um I've got a block of clay and I've

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.389 
um I've got a block of clay and I've
decided<00:00:38.790> not<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> use<00:00:39.300> any<00:00:39.629> tools<00:00:40.469> I'll<00:00:41.190> just

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
decided not to use any tools I'll just

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.670 
decided not to use any tools I'll just
use<00:00:41.579> my<00:00:41.730> hands<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.390> that's<00:00:43.230> our

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
use my hands because that's our

00:00:43.680 --> 00:01:15.840 
use my hands because that's our
difference<00:00:44.040> between<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.969> machines<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.020> us

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:26.470 

five<00:01:16.960> four<00:01:17.960> three<00:01:19.000> two<00:01:20.000> one<00:01:24.880> burn<00:01:25.880> perfections

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
five four three two one burn perfections

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.480 
five four three two one burn perfections
in<00:01:26.600> both<00:01:26.830> there's<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:27.920> considerable

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
in both there's a considerable

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.980 
in both there's a considerable
difference<00:01:28.880> in<00:01:29.030> scale<00:01:29.330> there<00:01:29.660> are<00:01:29.720> some

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
difference in scale there are some

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.230 
difference in scale there are some
advantages<00:01:30.860> of<00:01:30.890> detail<00:01:31.340> for<00:01:31.580> sure<00:01:31.820> on<00:01:32.060> the

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
advantages of detail for sure on the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.810 
advantages of detail for sure on the
side<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.660> deep<00:01:33.230> pink<00:01:33.470> however<00:01:34.190> if<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:34.550> look<00:01:34.670> at

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
side of deep pink however if you look at

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.130 
side of deep pink however if you look at
the<00:01:34.910> West<00:01:35.060> elevation<00:01:36.700> there<00:01:37.700> is<00:01:37.880> a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
the West elevation there is a

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.660 
the West elevation there is a
considerable<00:01:39.140> inaccuracy<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.310> think<00:01:40.580> we

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
considerable inaccuracy I think we

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.370 
considerable inaccuracy I think we
should<00:01:40.850> also<00:01:40.970> do<00:01:41.210> a<00:01:41.240> small<00:01:41.570> structural<00:01:42.140> test

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
should also do a small structural test

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.900 
should also do a small structural test
just<00:01:42.620> to<00:01:42.710> see<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.010> kind<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.220> integrity<00:01:43.730> of<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
just to see the kind of integrity of the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:53.440 
just to see the kind of integrity of the
models

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:02.910 

it's<00:01:54.450> definitely<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:55.080> piece

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.450 

I<00:02:04.200> think<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.320> think<00:02:05.619> at<00:02:05.740> this<00:02:05.860> point<00:02:05.920> it's<00:02:06.310> safe

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
I think I think at this point it's safe

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.949 
I think I think at this point it's safe
to<00:02:06.670> declare<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.150> man<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.570> winner

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.970 

the<00:02:16.959> future<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.489> humans
