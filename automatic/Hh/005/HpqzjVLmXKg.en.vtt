skiing also showed up and for skiing in
the<00:00:50.129> files<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.610> says<00:00:50.760> start<00:00:51.210> skiing<00:00:51.600> skiing

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the files it says start skiing skiing

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080 
the files it says start skiing skiing
and<00:00:52.739> finished<00:00:53.160> skiing<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.820> probably

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and finished skiing so it's probably

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.389 
and finished skiing so it's probably
some<00:00:54.360> sort<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.660> activity<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.379> race<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
some sort of activity or race the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.220 
some sort of activity or race the
question<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.300> did<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> skiing

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
question is if we did have the skiing

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.319 
question is if we did have the skiing
activity<00:00:58.859> where<00:00:59.160> would<00:00:59.309> we<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.640> able<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.910> ski

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
activity where would we be able to ski

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.299 
activity where would we be able to ski

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
because as we know Los Santos is

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.359 
because as we know Los Santos is
basically<00:01:03.090> Los<00:01:03.390> Angeles<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.229> Los<00:01:04.589> Angeles<00:01:05.189> it

Yankton<00:01:44.759> DLC<00:01:45.479> there<00:01:45.990> would<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.140> probably<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
Yankton DLC there would be probably a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.679 
Yankton DLC there would be probably a
possibility<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.490> some<00:01:47.700> sort<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.090> snowmobiles

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
possibility of some sort of snowmobiles

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.690 
possibility of some sort of snowmobiles
or<00:01:48.960> being<00:01:49.200> able<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.649> buy<00:01:49.770> houses<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.340> North

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
or being able to buy houses in North

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.370 
or being able to buy houses in North
Yankton<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.600> pretty<00:01:51.750> weird<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
Yankton and it's pretty weird that the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.800 
Yankton and it's pretty weird that the
skiing<00:01:52.799> dlc<00:01:53.399> was<00:01:53.610> leaked<00:01:53.970> because<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.720> know

I'm not sure if this is true it wasn't
leak

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
leak

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.190 
leak
yeah<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.330> know<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.630> sort<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.930> information

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
yeah you know that sort of information

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.620 
yeah you know that sort of information
but<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.099> pretty<00:02:14.280> weird<00:02:14.430> how<00:02:14.640> skiing<00:02:15.060> was<00:02:15.390> you

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
but it's pretty weird how skiing was you

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.360 
but it's pretty weird how skiing was you
know<00:02:15.720> leaked<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.380> does<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.860> know<00:02:16.980> connect

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
know leaked and it does you know connect

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.070 
know leaked and it does you know connect
with<00:02:17.520> North<00:02:17.730> Yankton<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.810> one<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:19.050> my

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
with North Yankton and that one of my

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.960 
with North Yankton and that one of my
subscribers<00:02:19.319> did<00:02:19.950> tell<00:02:20.160> me<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.310> before<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.940> I

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
subscribers did tell me that before so I

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.880 
subscribers did tell me that before so I
was<00:02:21.060> pretty<00:02:21.209> cool<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.989> if<00:02:22.110> they<00:02:22.290> were<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.709> add<00:02:22.860> a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
was pretty cool so if they were to add a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.890 
was pretty cool so if they were to add a
North<00:02:23.190> Yankton<00:02:23.430> DLC<00:02:24.180> with<00:02:24.360> skiing<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.870> know

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
North Yankton DLC with skiing you know

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.960 
North Yankton DLC with skiing you know
they<00:02:25.140> would<00:02:25.290> texturize<00:02:25.950> north<00:02:26.280> yankton<00:02:26.489> more

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
they would texturize north yankton more

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.640 
they would texturize north yankton more
you<00:02:27.270> know<00:02:27.390> because<00:02:27.660> when<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:27.989> did<00:02:28.200> have<00:02:28.410> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
you know because when we did have the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.830 
you know because when we did have the
North<00:02:29.280> Yankton<00:02:29.459> online<00:02:30.150> glitch<00:02:30.540> when<00:02:30.750> you

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
North Yankton online glitch when you

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.600 
North Yankton online glitch when you
went<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.110> North<00:02:31.380> Yankton<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:32.250> was<00:02:32.400> pretty

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
went to North Yankton it was pretty

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.640 
went to North Yankton it was pretty
realistic<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.390> get<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.720> ride<00:02:33.930> around<00:02:34.080> walk

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
realistic you get to ride around walk

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.890 
realistic you get to ride around walk
around<00:02:34.980> on<00:02:35.130> North<00:02:35.340> Yankton<00:02:35.610> but<00:02:36.270> some<00:02:36.540> parts

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
around on North Yankton but some parts

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.540 
around on North Yankton but some parts
it<00:02:37.050> was<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.410> see-through<00:02:37.980> basically<00:02:38.370> where

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
it was like see-through basically where

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.670 
it was like see-through basically where
you<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.819> it's<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.390> invisible<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:40.440> fly<00:02:40.650> a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
you just it's like invisible you fly a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.890 
you just it's like invisible you fly a
helicopter<00:02:40.950> through<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.910> but<00:02:42.360> I'm<00:02:42.480> pretty<00:02:42.630> we

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
helicopter through it but I'm pretty we

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.270 
helicopter through it but I'm pretty we
it's<00:02:43.050> pretty<00:02:43.290> weird<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.769> when<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:43.980> did<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
it's pretty weird that when you did the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.590 
it's pretty weird that when you did the
glitch<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.640> actually<00:02:44.940> get<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.090> drive<00:02:45.420> around

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
glitch you actually get to drive around

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.540 
glitch you actually get to drive around
and<00:02:45.870> walk<00:02:46.050> around<00:02:46.200> there<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.040> maybe<00:02:47.250> they<00:02:47.489> were

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
and walk around there so maybe they were

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.640 
and walk around there so maybe they were
actually<00:02:48.000> working<00:02:48.180> on<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.630> before<00:02:48.989> so<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
actually working on it before so the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.590 
actually working on it before so the
part<00:02:49.860> about<00:02:50.040> skiing<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.640> not<00:02:50.670> confirmed<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.569> is

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
part about skiing is not confirmed it is

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.270 
part about skiing is not confirmed it is
just<00:02:51.959> leaked<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.500> rest<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.860> video<00:02:53.130> is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
just speculation talking about some cool

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.080 
just speculation talking about some cool
things<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.769> might<00:02:55.920> come<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.250> GTA<00:02:56.580> 5<00:02:56.880> online

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
things that might come to GTA 5 online

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.090 
things that might come to GTA 5 online
because<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:58.019> trusted<00:02:58.440> source<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.799> does

because this trusted source that does

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.250 
because this trusted source that does
leak<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.400> information<00:02:59.610> he<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.569> very<00:03:00.810> trusted

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
and he does leak correct information so

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.180 
and he does leak correct information so
hopefully<00:03:03.870> Rockstar<00:03:04.500> does<00:03:04.709> take<00:03:04.950> into

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
hopefully Rockstar does take into

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.009 
hopefully Rockstar does take into
consideration<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:05.910> giving<00:03:06.330> us<00:03:06.480> some<00:03:06.690> sort<00:03:06.959> of

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
consideration to giving us some sort of

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.259 
consideration to giving us some sort of
North<00:03:07.410> Yankton<00:03:07.620> DLC<00:03:08.340> with<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.580> lot<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:08.910> addons

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.539 
North Yankton DLC with a lot of addons
it<00:03:09.870> would<00:03:09.989> make<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.260> game<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> lot<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.890> fun<00:03:11.130> so

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
it would make the game a lot of fun so

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.250 
it would make the game a lot of fun so
