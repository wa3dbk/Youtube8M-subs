00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.130
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.039
 modern flat tvs as the name implies 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.990
 says if in fact always flatter and 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.670
 For one thing it is certainly flat 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.930
 technically impressive to the other 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.670
 certainly nice too 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.590
 at least as long as the television is on 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.060
 his stand really stands for mine 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.640
 However, it gets stuck on the wall like here 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.320
 Often a problem arises for many 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.850
 wall mount are rather clunky 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.230
 and what brings me an extremely flat 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.489
 fancy tv when he's ten 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.469
 centimeters or more from the wall 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.820
 away 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.020
 but as it is here now 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.250
 they may say so 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.539
 it is impressive again 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.969
 there are not many simple ones 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.020
 Wandhalterung I my device so tight 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.969
 can hang on the wall 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.449
 that's true but most can then 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.449
 not that 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.250
 not bad or we have the here 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.290
 wall mount full motion xl from hama 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.870
 a super-flat and fully portable 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.950
 Wall mount for devices from 23 to 50 inches 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.640
 So about up to 127 cm screen diagonal 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.740
 suitable for a weight of 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.170
 up to 35 kilograms 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.900
 that means for the usual sizes of 37 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.370
 50 inches she is just perfect us 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.500
 have here now, for example, a 46 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.390
 inch device there is also one 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.300
 variant that is suitable for television 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.800
 to 65 inches and both versions are there 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.840
 both in white and a black one 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.369
 paintwork 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.630
 which at first glance is positive 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.950
 not just neat 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.170
 dimensioned quality seal of 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.580
 fischer in the pack but lie 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.250
 even a pencil and a practical one 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.750
 BÃ¼rstadt Lohn inclusive spirit level with 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.160
 this model montage material and 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.240
 It is then a good drill 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.890
 really no problem 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.170
 the full motion excel on the wall too 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.430
 should only pay attention 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.900
 that you drill clean holes and 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.940
 of course a viable wall and that 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.170
 fitting material will be like 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.580
 said the enclosed fischer dowels 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.250
 are in normal masonry and concrete 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.929
 Walls very good for other needs 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.820
 If necessary , then something else 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.470
 to take 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.390
 When choosing the mounting location you should 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.000
 Also pay attention that around the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.040
 TV remains enough space and that 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.569
 the image bottom edge in about 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.420
 Eye level of the seated observer 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.280
 hangs far away so sits two and a half 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.960
 meter or more you can watch the tv 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.430
 also a bit higher but just hang 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.680
 not so high that you feel uncomfortable afterwards 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.569
 Must look up for the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.190
 attachment of televisions 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.440
 Wall mounts there are the so-called 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.180
 weser standards in which different 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.740
 measures for the distribution of the profit 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.870
 recordings on television are defined 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.450
 the full motion XL is compatible 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.260
 with all weser standards up to 400 x 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.660
 400 mm 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.400
 according to our experience , that should be 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.840
 practically all TVs in the same 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.050
 mentioned biggest to this bracket 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.700
 fit the thought of motion 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.160
 Excel is noticeable in many places 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.230
 for example, when hanging the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.880
 TV to the attitude through the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.440
 so-called isofix system is aimed 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.120
 the tv practically by itself 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.830
 but you also have the possibility that 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.470
 still gets about 6 degrees in both directions 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.250
 to turn and then fix 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.600
 you can do that too, for example 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.069
 compensate if the bracket is not 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.739
 should just hang straight on a wall 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.239
 without having to build a new one 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.930
 holder means full motion and she is 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.260
 also in fact will 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.849
 very mobile completely retracted 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.530
 I only about three inches 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.480
 between the back of the tv at the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.409
 I can wall the bracket, however, too 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.969
 up to 38 centimeters extend 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.980
 theoretically it has a swivel range 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.750
 from 180 degrees so in practice 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.569
 Of course, by the size of the TV 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.099
 and the wall behind it is bounded by the 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.689
 area where i move the tv 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.819
 however, it can be considerable in any case 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.920
 In addition, I can watch the TV around 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.209
 tilt to twelve degrees forward and so on 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.099
 optimally align 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.599
 with such a big movement 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.099
 Of course, areas are important to you 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.019
 sufficiently long connection cable 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.780
 use the thoughtful 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.319
 cable management of the full motion xl ensures 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.639
 doing well behind the tv 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.900
 a nice flat tvs on the wall that 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.730
 looks really great and it 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.319
 especially helps a lot of space in the 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.909
 to save living room and with such a 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.889
 flexible wall mount like the full 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.090
 I can do the motion xl of hama 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.750
 tvs still optimally 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.669
 to adjust 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.900
 It's important to always be up 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.030
 the picture looks especially more 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.470
 Idea movies but synonymous otherwise only then 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.829
 turns the perfect image impression 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.750
 one and with the full motion xl succeed 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.599
 regardless of where I'm sitting 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.740
 always perfect thank you very much 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.740
 watch and see you next time
