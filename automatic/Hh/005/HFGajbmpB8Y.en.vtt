00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
design and this one we're going to be

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.310 
design and this one we're going to be
covering<00:00:13.280> our<00:00:13.580> very<00:00:13.730> first<00:00:14.000> castle<00:00:14.240> this<00:00:15.199> is<00:00:15.289> a

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
covering our very first castle this is a

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.470 
covering our very first castle this is a
very<00:00:15.410> simple<00:00:15.770> design<00:00:16.100> it's<00:00:16.699> called<00:00:17.180> at<00:00:17.300> our

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
very simple design it's called at our

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.689 
very simple design it's called at our
house<00:00:17.750> and<00:00:18.050> it's<00:00:19.039> not<00:00:19.250> really<00:00:19.460> what<00:00:19.550> you're

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
house and it's not really what you're

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.759 
house and it's not really what you're
thinking<00:00:20.000> in<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.840> line<00:00:20.990> of<00:00:21.140> a<00:00:21.230> as<00:00:21.470> well<00:00:21.679> as

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
thinking in the the line of a as well as

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.640 
thinking in the the line of a as well as
medieval<00:00:22.099> fantasy<00:00:22.429> castles<00:00:23.349> what<00:00:24.349> at<00:00:24.439> our

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
medieval fantasy castles what at our

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.159 
medieval fantasy castles what at our
house<00:00:24.830> is<00:00:24.859> it<00:00:25.310> was<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.699> form<00:00:26.480> of<00:00:26.630> fortified

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
house is it was a form of fortified

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.380 
house is it was a form of fortified
house<00:00:27.460> essentially<00:00:28.460> that<00:00:29.089> was<00:00:29.210> used

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
house essentially that was used

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.329 
house essentially that was used
extensively<00:00:29.599> by<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:30.199> Normans<00:00:30.650> in<00:00:30.919> their

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:31.339 
extensively by the Normans in their

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.030 
extensively by the Normans in their
conquests<00:00:31.880> of<00:00:31.970> Ireland<00:00:32.450> and<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:33.500> British

conquests of Ireland and the British

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.140 
conquests of Ireland and the British
Isles<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:35.050> basically<00:00:36.070> it's<00:00:37.070> it's<00:00:37.430> not<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:37.700> it's

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
Isles and basically it's it's not a it's

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.910 
Isles and basically it's it's not a it's
not<00:00:38.600> a<00:00:38.750> very<00:00:38.960> comfortable<00:00:39.110> place<00:00:39.560> to<00:00:39.590> live

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
not a very comfortable place to live

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.740 
not a very comfortable place to live
it's<00:00:40.700> not<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:40.940> it's<00:00:41.540> not<00:00:42.140> an<00:00:42.350> expensively

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
it's not a it's not an expensively

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.140 
it's not a it's not an expensively
expensive<00:00:44.750> place<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:44.990> build<00:00:45.230> but<00:00:45.650> it's<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:46.150> it's

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
expensive place to build but it's a it's

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.950 
expensive place to build but it's a it's
fortified<00:00:47.630> it's<00:00:48.230> quite<00:00:48.470> easily<00:00:48.680> defended<00:00:49.280> and

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
fortified it's quite easily defended and

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.590 
fortified it's quite easily defended and
it's<00:00:50.960> cheap<00:00:51.320> I<00:00:51.530> suppose<00:00:51.820> this<00:00:52.820> has<00:00:53.000> to<00:00:53.090> be<00:00:53.180> the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
it's cheap I suppose this has to be the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.590 
it's cheap I suppose this has to be the
main<00:00:53.900> kind<00:00:54.200> of<00:00:54.290> a<00:00:54.940> tactic<00:00:55.940> behind<00:00:56.240> building

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
main kind of a tactic behind building

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.260 
main kind of a tactic behind building
them<00:00:57.220> they<00:00:58.220> don't<00:00:58.400> look<00:00:58.490> a<00:00:58.580> lot<00:00:58.670> like<00:00:58.820> castles

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
them they don't look a lot like castles

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.060 
them they don't look a lot like castles
they<00:00:59.660> look<00:01:00.050> like<00:01:00.080> towers<00:01:00.590> but<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:00.890> thing<00:01:01.040> is

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
they look like towers but the thing is

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.040 
they look like towers but the thing is
there's<00:01:01.580> shitloads<00:01:01.970> of<00:01:02.180> them<00:01:02.420> they're<00:01:02.870> all

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
there's shitloads of them they're all

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.140 
there's shitloads of them they're all
over<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.380> place<00:01:03.549> especially<00:01:04.549> northwest

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
over the place especially northwest

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.200 
over the place especially northwest
Europe<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:06.610> yeah<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:07.640> suppose<00:01:08.000> we'll<00:01:08.180> just

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
Europe so I yeah I suppose we'll just

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.639 
Europe so I yeah I suppose we'll just
get<00:01:08.509> started<00:01:08.720> on<00:01:08.960> a<00:01:08.990> tutorial<00:01:09.350> on<00:01:09.499> how<00:01:09.590> to

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
get started on a tutorial on how to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.550 
get started on a tutorial on how to
build<00:01:09.859> them<00:01:10.780> now<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.869> entire<00:01:12.140> castle<00:01:12.469> was

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
build them now the entire castle was

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.709 
build them now the entire castle was
going<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:12.799> take<00:01:12.890> up<00:01:12.979> attend<00:01:13.189> bite<00:01:13.369> ad<00:01:13.549> space<00:01:13.820> so

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
going to take up attend bite ad space so

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.459 
going to take up attend bite ad space so
what<00:01:15.200> I've<00:01:15.320> done<00:01:15.350> is<00:01:15.770> I've<00:01:16.670> made<00:01:17.179> the<00:01:17.390> plan<00:01:17.630> to

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
what I've done is I've made the plan to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.209 
what I've done is I've made the plan to
fit<00:01:18.710> within<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:19.189> 16<00:01:19.609> by<00:01:19.759> 16<00:01:19.969> chunk<00:01:20.569> and<00:01:21.130> but<00:01:22.130> at

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
fit within a 16 by 16 chunk and but at

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.340 
fit within a 16 by 16 chunk and but at
the<00:01:22.310> same<00:01:22.460> time<00:01:22.700> it's<00:01:23.030> slightly<00:01:23.299> raised<00:01:23.659> so

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
the same time it's slightly raised so

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.319 
the same time it's slightly raised so
you<00:01:25.100> get<00:01:25.280> this<00:01:25.369> nice<00:01:25.520> kind<00:01:25.759> of<00:01:25.819> Hill<00:01:25.999> effect

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
you get this nice kind of Hill effect

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.109 
you get this nice kind of Hill effect
that<00:01:26.569> you<00:01:26.630> saw<00:01:26.780> earlier<00:01:27.789> basically<00:01:28.789> the

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
that you saw earlier basically the

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.130 
that you saw earlier basically the
entire<00:01:29.210> construction<00:01:29.630> is<00:01:29.899> going<00:01:29.929> to<00:01:30.079> be

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
entire construction is going to be

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.959 
entire construction is going to be
pretty<00:01:30.229> simple<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:31.399> walls<00:01:31.579> are<00:01:31.670> going<00:01:31.819> to<00:01:31.880> be

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
pretty simple the walls are going to be

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.639 
pretty simple the walls are going to be
cobbled<00:01:32.359> on<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:33.079> corners<00:01:33.350> are<00:01:33.380> going<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.590> be

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
cobbled on the corners are going to be

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.370 
cobbled on the corners are going to be
stone<00:01:33.859> brick<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:35.479> inside<00:01:35.840> area<00:01:36.109> is<00:01:36.229> going<00:01:36.289> to

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
stone brick the inside area is going to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.889 
stone brick the inside area is going to
be<00:01:36.439> six<00:01:36.740> by<00:01:36.889> six<00:01:36.999> so<00:01:37.999> the<00:01:38.030> wall<00:01:38.270> itself<00:01:38.659> is

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
be six by six so the wall itself is

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.099 
be six by six so the wall itself is
going<00:01:39.139> to<00:01:39.200> be<00:01:39.289> a<00:01:39.319> long<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:39.950> 8<00:01:40.219> wide<00:01:40.399> and<00:01:41.109> it's

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
going to be a long and 8 wide and it's

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:43.029 
going to be a long and 8 wide and it's
going<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.289> be<00:01:42.350> stepped<00:01:42.619> in<00:01:42.740> at<00:01:42.859> the<00:01:42.950> bottom

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
going to be stepped in at the bottom

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.800 
going to be stepped in at the bottom
which<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.340> why<00:01:43.549> this<00:01:43.609> is<00:01:43.969> a<00:01:43.999> slightly<00:01:44.509> wider

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
which is why this is a slightly wider

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.020 
which is why this is a slightly wider
but<00:01:45.590> that's<00:01:46.159> kind<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.369> hard<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.549> explain<00:01:46.639> so<00:01:46.969> I

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
but that's kind of hard to explain so I

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.730 
but that's kind of hard to explain so I
think<00:01:47.090> it's<00:01:47.240> best<00:01:47.299> if<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.569> just<00:01:47.600> show<00:01:47.899> you<00:01:47.959> yeah

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
think it's best if I just show you yeah

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.779 
think it's best if I just show you yeah
you<00:01:48.799> can<00:01:48.979> see<00:01:49.100> here<00:01:49.219> I've<00:01:49.310> stepped<00:01:49.549> in<00:01:49.700> the

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
you can see here I've stepped in the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.149 
you can see here I've stepped in the
wall<00:01:49.939> which<00:01:50.569> is<00:01:50.689> just<00:01:50.929> putting<00:01:51.139> a<00:01:51.289> stair<00:01:51.560> in

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
wall which is just putting a stair in

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.449 
wall which is just putting a stair in
either<00:01:52.429> Kabul<00:01:52.819> or<00:01:52.909> stone<00:01:53.179> brick<00:01:53.389> and<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:55.130> then

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
either Kabul or stone brick and and then

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.059 
either Kabul or stone brick and and then
that<00:01:55.639> makes<00:01:55.999> the<00:01:56.209> wall<00:01:56.420> itself<00:01:56.950> appear<00:01:57.950> as<00:01:58.039> if

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
that makes the wall itself appear as if

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.029 
that makes the wall itself appear as if
it's<00:01:58.310> kind<00:01:58.459> of<00:01:58.490> curving<00:01:58.789> out<00:01:58.880> at<00:01:58.969> the<00:01:59.060> bottom

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
it's kind of curving out at the bottom

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.679 
it's kind of curving out at the bottom
we've<00:02:01.039> also<00:02:01.399> i've<00:02:01.819> just<00:02:01.999> added<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.270> little<00:02:02.450> kind

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
we've also i've just added a little kind

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.440 
we've also i've just added a little kind
of<00:02:02.719> threshold<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:04.159> inside<00:02:04.490> space<00:02:04.759> floor<00:02:05.359> is

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
of threshold the inside space floor is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.629 
of threshold the inside space floor is
laid<00:02:05.569> out<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:05.779> gravel<00:02:06.049> but<00:02:06.889> it's<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.249> six<00:02:07.490> by

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:07.639 
laid out and gravel but it's a six by

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:10.749 
laid out and gravel but it's a six by
six<00:02:07.700> space<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:10.160> quite<00:02:10.369> simple<00:02:10.729> really

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
six space and so quite simple really

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.780 
six space and so quite simple really
I've<00:02:11.510> just<00:02:11.660> made<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.140> first<00:02:12.380> few<00:02:12.590> layers<00:02:13.370> of

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
I've just made the first few layers of

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.260 
I've just made the first few layers of
the<00:02:13.849> wall

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
the wall

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.630 
the wall
and<00:02:16.020> that's<00:02:16.170> pretty<00:02:16.290> much<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:16.620> now<00:02:16.800> coming

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and that's pretty much it for now coming

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.070 
and that's pretty much it for now coming
over<00:02:17.730> here<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.270> see<00:02:18.420> I've<00:02:18.600> started<00:02:18.840> off

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
over here you can see I've started off

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.710 
over here you can see I've started off
the<00:02:19.260> arch<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.970> ground<00:02:21.210> floor<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.510> these

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the arch the ground floor of these

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.370 
the arch the ground floor of these
buildings<00:02:21.930> normally<00:02:22.500> had<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.710> stone<00:02:23.640> or

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
buildings normally had a stone or

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.420 
buildings normally had a stone or
actually<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.410> was<00:02:25.620> pretty<00:02:25.800> much<00:02:25.860> always<00:02:26.100> stone

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
actually I was pretty much always stone

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.540 
actually I was pretty much always stone
arch<00:02:26.760> I'm<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:28.110> over<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.470> top<00:02:28.650> there's<00:02:29.490> a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
arch I'm going over the top there's a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.550 
arch I'm going over the top there's a
couple<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.820> reasons<00:02:29.910> for<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.270> actually<00:02:31.020> it

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
couple of reasons for this actually it

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.560 
couple of reasons for this actually it
was<00:02:31.620> construction<00:02:32.610> or<00:02:33.150> sorry<00:02:33.420> was

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
was construction or sorry was

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.570 
was construction or sorry was
structurally<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.350> was<00:02:34.470> an<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:35.460> know<00:02:35.550> it

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
structurally so it was an you know it

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.370 
structurally so it was an you know it
would<00:02:36.240> help<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.600> rest<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.110> building

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
would help the rest of the building

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.100 
would help the rest of the building
above<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.770> support<00:02:38.100> its<00:02:38.250> weight<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:39.080> but<00:02:40.080> a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
above it support its weight and but a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.330 
above it support its weight and but a
lot<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.590> was<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.770> do<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:40.980> fire<00:02:41.130> prevention

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
lot of it was to do with fire prevention

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.490 
lot of it was to do with fire prevention
because<00:02:42.240> if<00:02:42.510> you've<00:02:42.630> got<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.780> stone<00:02:43.050> arch<00:02:43.230> going

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
because if you've got a stone arch going

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.070 
because if you've got a stone arch going
over<00:02:43.860> your<00:02:44.640> bottom<00:02:44.910> floor<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.420> someone<00:02:45.720> is

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
over your bottom floor and someone is

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.750 
over your bottom floor and someone is
trying<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.410> invade<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:47.010> they<00:02:47.100> set<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.580> place

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
trying to invade and they set the place

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.190 
trying to invade and they set the place
on<00:02:47.880> fire<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.450> whole<00:02:48.570> thing<00:02:48.750> isn't<00:02:48.960> going<00:02:49.110> to

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
on fire the whole thing isn't going to

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.360 
on fire the whole thing isn't going to
go<00:02:49.320> because<00:02:49.650> these<00:02:49.830> things<00:02:50.010> are<00:02:50.160> kind<00:02:50.340> of

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
go because these things are kind of

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.180 
go because these things are kind of
built<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:50.700> chimneys<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:52.530> know<00:02:52.560> they

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
built like chimneys so I you know they

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.160 
built like chimneys so I you know they
could<00:02:53.730> catch<00:02:53.940> fire<00:02:53.970> very<00:02:54.420> easily<00:02:54.600> if<00:02:54.840> not<00:02:55.020> for

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
could catch fire very easily if not for

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.710 
could catch fire very easily if not for
this<00:02:55.260> starch<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:57.390> yeah<00:02:57.510> that's<00:02:57.600> pretty

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
this starch and so yeah that's pretty

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.960 
this starch and so yeah that's pretty
much<00:02:57.960> it<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.290> can<00:02:58.410> see<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:58.710> three<00:02:59.310> up<00:02:59.700> from

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
much it you can see it's three up from

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.570 
much it you can see it's three up from
the<00:03:00.030> ground<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:01.680> can<00:03:01.800> see<00:03:01.980> here<00:03:02.160> how<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.430> was

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
the ground you can see here how it was

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.670 
the ground you can see here how it was
laid<00:03:02.820> out<00:03:03.020> continuing<00:03:04.020> on<00:03:04.140> up<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.380> can<00:03:04.500> see

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
laid out continuing on up you can see

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.590 
laid out continuing on up you can see
I've<00:03:04.800> laid<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> floor<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.430> top<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.390> stone

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
I've laid a floor on top of the stone

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.940 
I've laid a floor on top of the stone
arch<00:03:06.800> and<00:03:08.360> basically<00:03:09.440> this<00:03:10.440> just<00:03:10.740> gives<00:03:10.860> a

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
arch and basically this just gives a

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.710 
arch and basically this just gives a
nice<00:03:11.070> flat<00:03:11.340> floor<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:12.150> what's<00:03:12.390> nice<00:03:12.660> about

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
nice flat floor but what's nice about

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.110 
nice flat floor but what's nice about
this<00:03:13.140> kind<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.380> design<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.010> if<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.970> do

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
this kind of design is that if you do

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.510 
this kind of design is that if you do
want<00:03:15.360> like<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> secret<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.800> your<00:03:16.890> trap<00:03:17.160> door<00:03:17.370> or

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
want like a secret to your trap door or

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.610 
want like a secret to your trap door or
something<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.910> can<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:18.170> stick<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.230> ladder

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
something you can just stick a ladder

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.710 
something you can just stick a ladder
down<00:03:19.800> here<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.700> know<00:03:20.730> maybe<00:03:21.030> some<00:03:21.420> secret

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
down here and you know maybe some secret

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.270 
down here and you know maybe some secret
chests<00:03:22.020> for<00:03:22.110> your<00:03:22.290> your<00:03:22.800> iron<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.160> your

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
chests for your your iron of your

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.680 
chests for your your iron of your
diamonds<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:24.740> we've<00:03:25.740> also<00:03:25.920> laid<00:03:26.280> out<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:27.300> am

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
diamonds and we've also laid out the am

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.810 
diamonds and we've also laid out the am
I<00:03:28.560> supposed<00:03:28.800> to<00:03:28.860> supporting<00:03:29.340> beams<00:03:29.550> for<00:03:29.790> the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
I supposed to supporting beams for the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.430 
I supposed to supporting beams for the
upper<00:03:30.060> floor<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.930> thing<00:03:31.080> is<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.290> can

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
upper floor the thing is you can

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.870 
upper floor the thing is you can
actually<00:03:31.470> make<00:03:31.800> this<00:03:31.890> terror<00:03:32.190> as<00:03:32.370> tall<00:03:32.610> as<00:03:32.790> you

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
actually make this terror as tall as you

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.270 
actually make this terror as tall as you
want<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:34.470> design<00:03:34.740> i'm<00:03:34.860> going<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.130> show

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
want and the design i'm going to show

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.760 
want and the design i'm going to show
any<00:03:35.520> has<00:03:35.730> for<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.420> ground<00:03:36.660> plus<00:03:37.050> two<00:03:37.380> stories

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
any has for the ground plus two stories

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.240 
any has for the ground plus two stories
so<00:03:38.250> three<00:03:38.670> stories<00:03:38.940> total<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.920> but<00:03:40.920> basically

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
so three stories total and but basically

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.650 
so three stories total and but basically
if<00:03:41.520> you<00:03:41.730> wanted<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.180> do<00:03:42.300> it<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.540> could

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
if you wanted to do it you could

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.080 
if you wanted to do it you could
basically<00:03:42.840> just<00:03:43.110> take<00:03:43.400> this<00:03:44.400> design<00:03:44.820> and

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
basically just take this design and

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.600 
basically just take this design and
repeat<00:03:45.570> it<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.840> continue<00:03:46.200> upwards<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:47.400> I'm

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
repeat it and continue upwards so I'm

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.949 
repeat it and continue upwards so I'm
yeah<00:03:48.030> let's<00:03:48.060> move<00:03:48.330> on<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.690> next<00:03:48.750> floor

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
yeah let's move on to the next floor

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.540 
yeah let's move on to the next floor
pretty<00:03:49.740> simple<00:03:49.860> phase<00:03:50.160> that's<00:03:50.370> dynamite

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
pretty simple phase that's dynamite

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.550 
pretty simple phase that's dynamite
basically<00:03:51.090> just<00:03:52.340> I've<00:03:53.340> popped<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:54.450> floor<00:03:55.350> on

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
basically just I've popped the floor on

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.690 
basically just I've popped the floor on
top<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:55.920> sporting<00:03:56.220> means<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.520> you<00:03:56.580> can

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
top of the sporting means and you can

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.070 
top of the sporting means and you can
see<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:56.910> gives<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.150> nice<00:03:57.270> effect<00:03:57.630> from<00:03:57.810> below

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
see this gives a nice effect from below

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.210 
see this gives a nice effect from below
but<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.620> know<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.830> looks<00:03:58.860> kind<00:03:59.100> of

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
but you know it looks kind of

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.400 
but you know it looks kind of
structurally<00:03:59.670> sound<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.180> that's<00:04:01.140> always<00:04:01.290> a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
structurally sound so that's always a

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.860 
structurally sound so that's always a
plus<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:02.520> so<00:04:03.300> yeah<00:04:03.390> that's<00:04:03.510> pretty<00:04:03.600> much<00:04:03.810> it

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
plus and so yeah that's pretty much it

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.210 
plus and so yeah that's pretty much it
for<00:04:03.990> this<00:04:04.170> phase<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.560> can<00:04:04.590> still<00:04:04.860> see<00:04:05.010> on<00:04:05.130> the

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
for this phase you can still see on the

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.710 
for this phase you can still see on the
outside<00:04:05.250> we're<00:04:05.760> still<00:04:05.970> using<00:04:06.120> stone<00:04:06.450> bricks

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
outside we're still using stone bricks

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.090 
outside we're still using stone bricks
for<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.959> corner<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.380> kabul<00:04:07.680> for<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.830> center

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
for the corner and kabul for the center

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.240 
for the corner and kabul for the center
in<00:04:09.060> this<00:04:09.209> next<00:04:09.450> phase<00:04:09.600> either<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.709> added<00:04:11.070> the

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
in this next phase either it added the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.400 
in this next phase either it added the
gabled<00:04:11.610> which<00:04:12.480> is<00:04:12.600> just<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:13.050> know<00:04:13.140> pretty

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
gabled which is just you know pretty

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.050 
gabled which is just you know pretty
simple<00:04:13.709> design<00:04:13.980> these<00:04:14.160> are<00:04:14.310> half<00:04:14.459> stone<00:04:14.730> slabs

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
simple design these are half stone slabs

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.270 
simple design these are half stone slabs
coming<00:04:15.959> across<00:04:16.109> with<00:04:16.620> some<00:04:16.799> logs<00:04:17.040> in<00:04:17.220> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
coming across with some logs in the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.849 
coming across with some logs in the
middle<00:04:17.489> just<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:17.760> kind<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:17.940> break<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.299> up<00:04:18.390> and

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
middle just to kind of break it up and

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.969 
middle just to kind of break it up and
and<00:04:19.979> that's<00:04:20.519> about<00:04:20.639> ish<00:04:21.439> the<00:04:22.439> gable<00:04:22.710> itself

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
and that's about ish the gable itself

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.879 
and that's about ish the gable itself
starts<00:04:23.310> three<00:04:23.610> blocks<00:04:23.849> up<00:04:24.060> from<00:04:24.349> the<00:04:25.349> top

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
starts three blocks up from the top

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.540 
starts three blocks up from the top
floor<00:04:26.870> so<00:04:27.870> yeah<00:04:27.990> that's<00:04:28.919> pretty<00:04:29.069> much<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.400> for

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
floor so yeah that's pretty much it for

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.779 
floor so yeah that's pretty much it for
this<00:04:29.699> face<00:04:30.860> next<00:04:31.860> we've<00:04:31.979> added<00:04:32.129> in<00:04:32.340> another

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
this face next we've added in another

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.820 
this face next we've added in another
brick<00:04:33.090> roof<00:04:33.389> nether<00:04:34.080> brick<00:04:34.259> looks<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.680> little

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
brick roof nether brick looks a little

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.649 
brick roof nether brick looks a little
odd<00:04:35.039> with<00:04:35.280> this<00:04:35.430> texture<00:04:35.849> pack<00:04:36.030> but<00:04:36.509> the<00:04:36.629> thing

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
odd with this texture pack but the thing

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.809 
odd with this texture pack but the thing
is<00:04:36.810> even<00:04:37.110> in<00:04:37.319> default<00:04:37.620> which<00:04:38.280> if<00:04:38.430> i<00:04:38.520> switch<00:04:38.789> to

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
is even in default which if i switch to

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.629 
is even in default which if i switch to
it<00:04:39.060> now<00:04:39.259> you<00:04:40.259> can<00:04:40.409> see<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.889> looks<00:04:41.219> kind<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.580> like

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
it now you can see it looks kind of like

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.020 
it now you can see it looks kind of like
slate<00:04:42.030> which<00:04:42.509> is<00:04:42.659> quite<00:04:42.840> nice<00:04:43.639> so<00:04:44.639> if<00:04:44.789> i<00:04:44.909> just

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
slate which is quite nice so if i just

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.029 
slate which is quite nice so if i just
go<00:04:45.150> back<00:04:45.330> into<00:04:45.569> terror<00:04:45.870> house<00:04:47.509> you<00:04:48.509> can<00:04:48.629> see

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
go back into terror house you can see

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.469 
go back into terror house you can see
yeah<00:04:50.039> obviously<00:04:50.310> not<00:04:50.550> as<00:04:50.699> nice<00:04:50.909> looking<00:04:51.300> as

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
yeah obviously not as nice looking as

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.679 
yeah obviously not as nice looking as
her<00:04:51.889> as<00:04:52.889> it<00:04:53.129> was<00:04:53.310> before<00:04:53.520> but<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.330> can<00:04:54.479> get<00:04:54.569> the

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:54.689 
her as it was before but you can get the

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.920 
her as it was before but you can get the
idea<00:04:54.930> of<00:04:55.169> it<00:04:55.349> being<00:04:55.560> a<00:04:56.090> kind<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.270> slate<00:04:57.719> like

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
idea of it being a kind of a slate like

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.070 
idea of it being a kind of a slate like
material<00:04:58.469> so<00:04:59.389> actually<00:05:00.389> yeah<00:05:00.449> i'll<00:05:00.659> just<00:05:00.960> i'll

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
material so actually yeah i'll just i'll

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.230 
material so actually yeah i'll just i'll
switch<00:05:01.319> back<00:05:01.500> before<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:01.919> next<00:05:02.129> phase<00:05:02.310> so

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
switch back before the next phase so

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.790 
switch back before the next phase so
yeah<00:05:03.389> that's<00:05:03.539> pretty<00:05:03.659> much<00:05:03.870> it<00:05:03.990> i<00:05:04.169> mean<00:05:04.379> the

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
yeah that's pretty much it i mean the

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.439 
yeah that's pretty much it i mean the
interior<00:05:05.279> detailing<00:05:05.699> is<00:05:05.849> pretty<00:05:06.090> much<00:05:06.180> up<00:05:06.419> to

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
interior detailing is pretty much up to

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.290 
interior detailing is pretty much up to
you<00:05:06.800> you<00:05:07.800> can<00:05:08.009> put<00:05:08.279> staircases<00:05:08.849> i<00:05:09.060> like<00:05:09.240> to

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
you you can put staircases i like to

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.969 
you you can put staircases i like to
build<00:05:09.419> ladders<00:05:09.629> as<00:05:09.960> that's<00:05:10.500> kind<00:05:10.830> of<00:05:10.860> more

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
build ladders as that's kind of more

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.320 
build ladders as that's kind of more
historically<00:05:11.490> accurate<00:05:11.669> for<00:05:12.060> this<00:05:12.150> type<00:05:12.300> of

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
historically accurate for this type of

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.140 
historically accurate for this type of
structure<00:05:12.750> and<00:05:13.310> you<00:05:14.310> can<00:05:14.520> see<00:05:14.639> on<00:05:14.789> the<00:05:14.879> bottom

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
structure and you can see on the bottom

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.760 
structure and you can see on the bottom
floor<00:05:15.180> as<00:05:16.050> we're<00:05:16.259> doing<00:05:16.439> it<00:05:16.529> kind<00:05:16.710> of

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
floor as we're doing it kind of

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.800 
floor as we're doing it kind of
traditionally<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:18.180> bottom<00:05:18.449> floor<00:05:18.539> is<00:05:18.689> going

traditionally the bottom floor is going

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.019 
traditionally the bottom floor is going

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
structures on the outside which i'll go

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.589 
structures on the outside which i'll go
into<00:05:34.229> more<00:05:34.289> detail<00:05:34.710> about<00:05:34.740> in<00:05:35.009> a<00:05:35.039> sec<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:35.430> then

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
for them apart from the stuff that's

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.999 
for them apart from the stuff that's
missing<00:05:53.189> so<00:05:53.729> say<00:05:53.969> when<00:05:54.750> you<00:05:54.900> are<00:05:55.080> here<00:05:55.650> you

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
missing so say when you are here you

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.829 
missing so say when you are here you
might<00:05:56.129> be<00:05:56.250> having<00:05:56.939> a<00:05:57.120> look<00:05:57.240> at<00:05:57.360> at<00:05:57.479> our<00:05:57.629> house

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:57.839 
might be having a look at at our house

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.300 
might be having a look at at our house
and<00:05:58.020> you<00:05:58.110> just<00:05:58.259> use<00:05:58.409> this<00:05:58.469> big<00:05:58.529> gaping<00:05:58.949> hole<00:05:59.279> in

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
and you just use this big gaping hole in

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.700 
and you just use this big gaping hole in
a<00:05:59.520> wall<00:05:59.550> somewhere<00:05:59.879> you<00:06:00.689> can<00:06:00.810> go<00:06:00.839> well<00:06:01.199> why<00:06:01.650> is

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
a wall somewhere you can go well why is

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.140 
a wall somewhere you can go well why is
that<00:06:01.770> there<00:06:02.069> it's<00:06:02.279> obviously<00:06:02.580> not<00:06:02.639> you<00:06:03.089> know

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
that there it's obviously not you know

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.149 
that there it's obviously not you know
from<00:06:03.360> collapse<00:06:03.659> or<00:06:03.810> anything<00:06:04.050> it's<00:06:04.169> basically

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
from collapse or anything it's basically

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.559 
from collapse or anything it's basically
the<00:06:05.279> current<00:06:05.550> Todd<00:06:05.729> is<00:06:05.939> that<00:06:06.150> they<00:06:06.300> would<00:06:06.419> have

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
the current Todd is that they would have

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.519 
the current Todd is that they would have
these<00:06:06.689> kind<00:06:06.930> of<00:06:06.960> structures<00:06:07.560> built<00:06:08.069> onto<00:06:08.250> them

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:09.529 
these kind of structures built onto them

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.869 
these kind of structures built onto them
so<00:06:10.529> yeah<00:06:10.680> this<00:06:10.830> is<00:06:11.009> quite<00:06:11.219> simple<00:06:11.580> to<00:06:11.639> do<00:06:11.849> I

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:11.879 
so yeah this is quite simple to do I

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:15.860 
so yeah this is quite simple to do I
just<00:06:12.210> put<00:06:12.389> in<00:06:12.509> logs<00:06:13.409> wood<00:06:14.129> and<00:06:14.400> wool<00:06:14.870> wood

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
just put in logs wood and wool wood

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.379 
just put in logs wood and wool wood
fences<00:06:16.289> for<00:06:16.439> the<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:17.610> parts<00:06:17.909> in<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.029> windows

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
fences for the the parts in the windows

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.269 
fences for the the parts in the windows
it's<00:06:18.689> got<00:06:18.839> stairs<00:06:19.139> on<00:06:19.319> top<00:06:19.529> maybe<00:06:19.889> a<00:06:19.979> full

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:20.279 
it's got stairs on top maybe a full

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.980 
it's got stairs on top maybe a full
block<00:06:20.520> or<00:06:20.669> half<00:06:20.789> stones<00:06:21.089> or<00:06:21.300> half<00:06:21.539> wooden<00:06:21.779> slab

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
block or half stones or half wooden slab

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.189 
block or half stones or half wooden slab
here<00:06:22.169> on<00:06:22.620> top<00:06:23.189> it's<00:06:23.370> your<00:06:23.550> choice<00:06:23.789> and<00:06:24.089> so<00:06:25.050> yeah

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
here on top it's your choice and so yeah

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.159 
here on top it's your choice and so yeah
that's<00:06:25.379> pretty<00:06:25.500> much<00:06:25.740> it<00:06:26.810> it's<00:06:27.810> quite<00:06:27.990> a<00:06:28.020> nifty

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
that's pretty much it it's quite a nifty

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:29.380 
that's pretty much it it's quite a nifty
design

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
design

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.820 
design
quite<00:06:29.780> historically<00:06:30.230> accurate<00:06:30.410> which

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
quite historically accurate which

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.240 
quite historically accurate which
unfortunately<00:06:31.160> means<00:06:31.490> it<00:06:31.820> is<00:06:31.910> kind<00:06:32.270> of<00:06:32.420> crappy

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
unfortunately means it is kind of crappy

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.620 
unfortunately means it is kind of crappy
but<00:06:34.250> as<00:06:34.430> I<00:06:34.490> said<00:06:34.820> these<00:06:35.000> aren't<00:06:35.270> fantasy

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
but as I said these aren't fantasy

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.900 
but as I said these aren't fantasy
castles<00:06:36.050> these<00:06:36.230> are<00:06:36.380> ones<00:06:37.370> that<00:06:37.520> were<00:06:37.730> built

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
castles these are ones that were built

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.660 
castles these are ones that were built
for<00:06:38.180> good<00:06:39.110> for<00:06:39.350> their<00:06:39.470> cheapness<00:06:39.800> on<00:06:40.160> defense

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
for good for their cheapness on defense

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.790 
for good for their cheapness on defense
makes<00:06:40.940> the<00:06:41.420> defensive<00:06:41.930> mess<00:06:42.320> i<00:06:42.440> should<00:06:42.620> say

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
makes the defensive mess i should say

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.880 
makes the defensive mess i should say
and<00:06:43.660> anyway<00:06:44.660> yeah<00:06:44.780> that's<00:06:45.110> been<00:06:45.440> tutorial

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:45.890 
and anyway yeah that's been tutorial

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.470 
and anyway yeah that's been tutorial
number<00:06:45.980> seven<00:06:46.520> and<00:06:47.200> our<00:06:48.200> series<00:06:48.620> and<00:06:49.090> up<00:06:50.090> next

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
number seven and our series and up next

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.240 
number seven and our series and up next
I<00:06:50.780> think<00:06:51.050> we're<00:06:51.200> covering<00:06:51.470> churches<00:06:52.070> and

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
I think we're covering churches and

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.760 
I think we're covering churches and
monasteries<00:06:52.820> so<00:06:53.510> that<00:06:53.660> should<00:06:53.810> be<00:06:53.930> a<00:06:53.960> bit<00:06:54.650> more

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
monasteries so that should be a bit more

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.830 
monasteries so that should be a bit more
aesthetically<00:06:55.310> pleasing<00:06:55.430> than<00:06:56.000> this<00:06:56.150> in<00:06:56.690> this

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
aesthetically pleasing than this in this

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.860 
aesthetically pleasing than this in this
tutorial<00:06:57.050> but<00:06:57.820> yeah<00:06:58.820> hopefully<00:06:59.390> you<00:06:59.720> guys
