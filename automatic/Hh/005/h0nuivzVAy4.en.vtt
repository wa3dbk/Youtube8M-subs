00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
started to make this quick video i'm

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.520 
started to make this quick video i'm
using<00:02:59.620> um<00:03:00.419> virtualdub<00:03:01.419> to<00:03:01.840> record<00:03:02.200> this<00:03:02.349> video

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
using um virtualdub to record this video

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.300 
using um virtualdub to record this video
because<00:03:03.569> this<00:03:04.569> webcam<00:03:04.900> i<00:03:05.019> got<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:06.010> think<00:03:06.219> it'd

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
because this webcam i got you think it'd

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.649 
because this webcam i got you think it'd
be<00:03:06.340> great<00:03:06.549> quality<00:03:06.939> but<00:03:07.120> for<00:03:07.269> some<00:03:07.359> reason<00:03:07.599> it

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
be great quality but for some reason it

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.599 
be great quality but for some reason it
forces<00:03:08.019> 15<00:03:08.439> frames<00:03:08.680> per<00:03:08.829> second<00:03:09.250> if<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.430> lose

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
forces 15 frames per second if you lose

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.229 
forces 15 frames per second if you lose
if<00:03:09.909> you<00:03:10.090> use<00:03:10.329> logitech<00:03:10.810> software<00:03:11.010> which<00:03:12.010> is

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
if you use logitech software which is

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.030 
if you use logitech software which is
mind-blowingly<00:03:13.239> stupid<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.689> me<00:03:13.810> um<00:03:14.040> and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
mind-blowingly stupid to me um and

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.890 
mind-blowingly stupid to me um and
they're<00:03:15.849> like<00:03:16.000> if<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.239> like<00:03:16.389> to<00:03:16.510> record<00:03:16.719> more

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
they're like if you like to record more

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.420 
they're like if you like to record more
than<00:03:17.049> 15<00:03:17.319> frames<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.590> second<00:03:17.889> you<00:03:18.190> have<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.400> use

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
than 15 frames a second you have to use

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.589 
than 15 frames a second you have to use
an<00:03:18.609> external<00:03:18.940> webcam<00:03:19.810> capture<00:03:20.799> program<00:03:21.040> and

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
an external webcam capture program and

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.319 
an external webcam capture program and
somehow<00:03:22.949> every<00:03:23.949> capture<00:03:24.669> program<00:03:24.879> that<00:03:25.150> i<00:03:25.209> can

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
somehow every capture program that i can

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.710 
somehow every capture program that i can
find<00:03:25.569> only<00:03:25.959> records<00:03:26.379> in<00:03:26.530> like<00:03:27.250> 43<00:03:27.609> format<00:03:28.510> and

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
find only records in like 43 format and

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.420 
find only records in like 43 format and
virtual<00:03:29.680> devils<00:03:30.010> don't<00:03:30.129> know<00:03:30.189> why<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.280> could

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
virtual devils don't know why I could

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.969 
virtual devils don't know why I could
find<00:03:30.609> that<00:03:30.729> lets<00:03:31.299> me<00:03:31.359> force<00:03:31.659> a<00:03:31.810> frame<00:03:32.620> rate<00:03:32.799> and

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:32.979 
find that lets me force a frame rate and

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.069 
find that lets me force a frame rate and
do<00:03:33.340> widescreen<00:03:33.879> so<00:03:34.120> hopefully<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:34.930> video

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
do widescreen so hopefully this video

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.719 
do widescreen so hopefully this video
will<00:03:35.260> come<00:03:35.620> out<00:03:35.709> right<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.040> not<00:03:36.099> look<00:03:36.310> super

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:36.729 
will come out right and not look super

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:41.909 
will come out right and not look super
weird<00:03:36.909> um<00:03:38.609> so<00:03:39.609> yeah<00:03:39.729> quick<00:03:40.150> vlog<00:03:40.269> um<00:03:40.780> I<00:03:41.439> don't
