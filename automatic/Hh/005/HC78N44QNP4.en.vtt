00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
first thing the morning they do is they

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.510 
first thing the morning they do is they
reach<00:01:17.230> for<00:01:17.440> their<00:01:17.560> smartphone<00:01:18.040> rather<00:01:18.280> than

reach for their smartphone rather than

and<00:01:20.290> these<00:01:20.680> things<00:01:20.950> all<00:01:21.250> matter<00:01:21.640> I<00:01:22.000> think

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
and these things all matter I think

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.880 
and these things all matter I think
we're<00:01:22.450> at<00:01:22.540> a<00:01:22.570> critical<00:01:22.840> moment<00:01:23.260> I<00:01:23.530> wrote<00:01:23.710> the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
we're at a critical moment I wrote the

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.620 
we're at a critical moment I wrote the
book<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:24.100> we<00:01:24.430> could<00:01:24.550> sort<00:01:24.790> of<00:01:24.850> reboot<00:01:25.420> or

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
book so we could sort of reboot or

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.870 
book so we could sort of reboot or
refresh<00:01:26.230> and<00:01:26.500> certainly<00:01:26.800> rethink<00:01:27.310> how<00:01:27.700> we're

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
refresh and certainly rethink how we're

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.510 
refresh and certainly rethink how we're
using<00:01:27.910> technology<00:01:28.840> in<00:01:29.050> our<00:01:29.140> lives<00:01:29.470> at<00:01:30.070> schools

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
using technology in our lives at schools

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.940 
using technology in our lives at schools
we<00:01:30.790> see<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.060> very<00:01:31.420> big<00:01:32.020> difference<00:01:32.080> in<00:01:32.590> schools

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
we see a very big difference in schools

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.470 
we see a very big difference in schools
for<00:01:33.250> instance<00:01:33.610> where<00:01:33.760> children<00:01:34.150> can<00:01:34.330> use

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
for instance where children can use

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.020 
for instance where children can use
their<00:01:34.690> smartphones<00:01:35.230> on<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.530> path<00:01:35.890> or<00:01:36.520> in<00:01:36.910> the

their smartphones on the path or in the
cafeteria<00:01:37.210> or<00:01:38.200> schools<00:01:38.590> where<00:01:38.770> they<00:01:38.920> can't<00:01:39.280> we

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
cafeteria or schools where they can't we

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.790 
cafeteria or schools where they can't we
see<00:01:39.730> a<00:01:39.760> decrease<00:01:40.240> in<00:01:40.270> eye<00:01:40.600> contact<00:01:41.140> in<00:01:41.380> goofing

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
see a decrease in eye contact in goofing

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.240 
see a decrease in eye contact in goofing
around<00:01:41.920> in<00:01:42.460> kids<00:01:43.150> talking<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.780> one<00:01:43.960> another<00:01:44.250> so

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
around in kids talking to one another so

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.340 
around in kids talking to one another so
I<00:01:45.280> think<00:01:45.580> our<00:01:45.940> challenge<00:01:46.030> in<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.810> digital<00:01:47.170> age

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
I think our challenge in the digital age

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.340 
I think our challenge in the digital age
is<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:48.070> understand<00:01:48.940> technologies<00:01:49.690> here<00:01:50.170> and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
is to understand technologies here and

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.130 
is to understand technologies here and
it's<00:01:50.500> so<00:01:50.830> wonderful<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.490> so<00:01:51.730> many<00:01:51.790> ways<00:01:52.140> but

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
it's so wonderful in so many ways but

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.570 
it's so wonderful in so many ways but
there<00:01:53.320> are<00:01:53.440> ways<00:01:53.590> in<00:01:53.620> which<00:01:53.890> we<00:01:54.250> have<00:01:54.460> to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
there are ways in which we have to

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.630 
there are ways in which we have to
outsmart<00:01:54.970> our<00:01:55.270> smartphones<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.950> we<00:01:57.190> don't<00:01:57.460> get

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
outsmart our smartphones so we don't get

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.550
