yeah it was really okay so where there's
two<00:00:20.470> in<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:20.859> 15th<00:00:21.310> yeah<00:00:21.670> yeah<00:00:21.970> well<00:00:22.210> in

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
two in the 15th yeah yeah well in

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.589 
two in the 15th yeah yeah well in
chicken<00:00:23.169> brown<00:00:23.320> full<00:00:23.710> can<00:00:23.949> of<00:00:23.980> chicken<00:00:24.279> broth

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
chicken brown full can of chicken broth

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.650 
chicken brown full can of chicken broth
which<00:00:25.599> is<00:00:25.779> our<00:00:26.669> accelerant<00:00:27.669> basically<00:00:28.119> when

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
which is our accelerant basically when

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.900 
which is our accelerant basically when
that<00:00:28.810> goes<00:00:29.020> under<00:00:29.320> under<00:00:29.649> the<00:00:29.770> oil<00:00:29.980> and<00:00:30.279> boils

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
that goes under under the oil and boils

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.090 
that goes under under the oil and boils
that<00:00:31.060> explodes<00:00:31.570> and<00:00:31.960> then<00:00:32.349> immediately<00:00:32.590> turns

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
that explodes and then immediately turns

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.009 
that explodes and then immediately turns
into<00:00:33.250> steam<00:00:33.370> and<00:00:33.579> throws<00:00:34.000> on<00:00:34.180> oil<00:00:34.600> up<00:00:34.750> in<00:00:34.900> the

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
into steam and throws on oil up in the

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.880 
into steam and throws on oil up in the
air<00:00:36.150> all<00:00:37.150> right<00:00:37.420> it's<00:00:37.900> good<00:00:38.320> enough<00:00:38.350> it<00:00:38.769> goes

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
air all right it's good enough it goes

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.160 
air all right it's good enough it goes
off<00:00:39.160> it<00:00:39.879> melted<00:00:40.269> a<00:00:40.360> little<00:00:40.390> bit<00:00:40.690> of<00:00:40.780> arcing<00:00:41.079> L

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
off it melted a little bit of arcing L
