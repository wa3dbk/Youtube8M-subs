00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.339
 good to all the kids and here I am 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:08.860
 in devil 3 with my friend Pablo hello and 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.620
 let's find the elements to go to 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.110
 secret level of the devil 3 his stack cndh 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.240
 already 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.240
 and we have to go where they are going 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.610
 what 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.590
 brands that we create the cities of 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.240
 East 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.240
 this connection and now we are left 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.540
 well let's go there 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.660
 we jump in search of 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.110
 As you can see Pablo is a hunter of 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.760
 got damn 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.760
 and I am a barbarian 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.580
 mainly because that's fine 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.700
 advanced and then I want to upload the 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.700
 level 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.440
 and for those who do not know this is the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.440
 second mission of the game 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.870
 it's pretty easy so 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.480
 getting things to your face 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.210
 indeed 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.070
 two 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.040
 And for what 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.040
 good 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.369
 do not run 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.990
 until we have 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:12.690
 the maps are random several create 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.700
 own game specifically for 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.210
 a lot like that the main maps and 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.210
 so, no, 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.450
 the pieces these are in very places 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.900
 concrete 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.180
 or are retailers 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.000
 random so in this case 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.980
 we'll have to find where they are so 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.959
 if you want to know where they are then 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.579
 extrusion you just have to 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.579
 look for it with these sites 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.739
 good i looking 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.069
 I guess you will have to highlight the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.950
 Thank you 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.340
 good 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.190

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.190
 yes yes 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.070
 Yes Yes 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.620
 yes 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.620
 let's look here 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.980
 it is advisable to break all the 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:58.200
 shelves and move the corpses and 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.200
 such usually give things 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.260
 and for the world 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.430
 where is in the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.430
 the objects 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.360
 for many 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.120
 good 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.570
 and how is the piece called pablo mushrooms 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.570
 black 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.289
 a fat man 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.790
 good 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.790
 for who is not 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.140
 if you find it you know you are not worthy 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.140
 here as a normal 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.950
 surely 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:12.269
 well this is a pretty part 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:16.889
 boring so I'm going to cut it and 

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:16.889
 when we find it then I go back 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:24.060
 well we are here we have found 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.060
 we take the black mushrooms 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:29.689
 we are going to teleport 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:31.480
 You will see that we have not finished much 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.200
 more than 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.740
 way 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.030
 now let's go a few minutes good two 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.260
 minutes 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.810
 well here we already have one vale is the 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.480
 tibia of lorica 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.620
 and now we are going to put the mushrooms 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:53.270
 black we have 2 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.270
 I do not know how many 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.169
 How many 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:03.360
 I do not think I do much 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.360
 add the source you what good 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.580
 but good now 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.840
 I think they are two beings 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.990
 well, this has been all I hope that 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.670
 you liked it and the favorite aif if you 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.670
