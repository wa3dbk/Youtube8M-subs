00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
it's one of the special things I think

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.710 
it's one of the special things I think
in<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.340> game<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.640> cricket<00:03:32.760> because<00:03:33.480> it

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
in the game of cricket because it

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.290 
in the game of cricket because it
happened<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.050> rarely<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.940> was<00:03:35.940> doing<00:03:36.209> the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
happened so rarely I was doing the

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.840 
happened so rarely I was doing the
commentary<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.840> Malton<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.010> save<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.610> was

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
commentary in Malton and and save I was

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.640 
commentary in Malton and and save I was
absolutely<00:03:39.630> going<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.200> reckon<00:03:40.530> if

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
absolutely going and I reckon if

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.520 
absolutely going and I reckon if
Tendulkar<00:03:41.280> hadn't<00:03:41.580> come<00:03:41.790> in<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.530> steadied

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
Tendulkar hadn't come in and steadied

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.030 
Tendulkar hadn't come in and steadied
the<00:03:44.520> save<00:03:44.910> are<00:03:45.090> down<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.450> reckon<00:03:45.930> he<00:03:46.019> he<00:03:46.739> might

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
the save are down I reckon he he might

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.740 
the save are down I reckon he he might
not<00:03:47.190> have<00:03:47.250> quite<00:03:47.459> got<00:03:47.760> 300<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.330> day<00:03:48.480> but<00:03:48.660> it

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
not have quite got 300 that day but it

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.570 
not have quite got 300 that day but it
got<00:03:48.959> damn<00:03:49.200> close<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:50.250> she<00:03:50.340> gave<00:03:50.489> the

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
got damn close and she gave the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.449 
got damn close and she gave the
particular<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.030> brevin<00:03:51.330> Stadium<00:03:51.660> he<00:03:51.810> got<00:03:52.459> 224

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459
