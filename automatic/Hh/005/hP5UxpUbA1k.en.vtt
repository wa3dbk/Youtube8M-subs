course the iPhone 5 is just a bit
thinner<00:00:25.199> I'd<00:00:25.800> say<00:00:26.070> about<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.310> millimeter

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
thinner I'd say about a millimeter

thinner<00:00:27.210> than<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> galaxy<00:00:28.019> s3<00:00:28.500> both<00:00:28.800> are

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
thinner than the galaxy s3 both are

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.290

let's try that again in camera once
again<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:23.980> iPhone<00:03:24.340> camera<00:03:24.700> is<00:03:24.820> open<00:03:25.180> faster

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
again the iPhone camera is open faster

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.450 
again the iPhone camera is open faster

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
a few seconds is fast let's go ahead and

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.710 
a few seconds is fast let's go ahead and
load<00:03:45.070> another<00:03:45.490> page<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:45.850> this<00:03:46.300> time<00:03:46.510> let's

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
load another page and this time let's

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.720 
load another page and this time let's
try<00:03:46.780> Samsung's<00:03:47.500> official<00:03:47.920> website<00:03:48.280> both<00:03:48.580> at

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730

the same time and the iPhone loads

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.870 
the same time and the iPhone loads
pictures<00:03:53.680> already<00:03:53.920> faster<00:03:54.490> before<00:03:54.670> the

pictures already faster before the
Samsung<00:03:55.360> as<00:03:55.600> you<00:03:55.990> can<00:03:56.110> see<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.350> loaded<00:03:56.620> much

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
Samsung as you can see it loaded much

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.590 
Samsung as you can see it loaded much
faster<00:03:57.400> there's<00:03:57.610> a<00:03:57.640> huge<00:03:58.030> difference<00:03:58.420> in<00:03:58.540> the

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
faster there's a huge difference in the

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.390 
faster there's a huge difference in the
internet<00:03:58.900> browser<00:03:59.050> between<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.590> iPhone<00:03:59.980> and

the Samsung Galaxy s3 and that just

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.540 
the Samsung Galaxy s3 and that just

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
shows you guys hardware specs aren't

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.370 
shows you guys hardware specs aren't

phones<00:05:38.680> are<00:05:39.040> grey<00:05:39.370> I<00:05:39.580> do<00:05:39.640> have<00:05:39.850> to<00:05:39.940> say<00:05:40.120> I<00:05:40.150> like

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
phones are grey I do have to say I like

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.570 
phones are grey I do have to say I like
them<00:05:40.660> both<00:05:40.840> however<00:05:41.380> for<00:05:41.710> me<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:42.010> iPhone<00:05:42.370> 5

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
them both however for me the iPhone 5

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.520 
them both however for me the iPhone 5
camera<00:05:43.000> performs<00:05:43.420> better<00:05:43.630> in<00:05:43.930> low<00:05:44.110> light<00:05:44.140> in

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
camera performs better in low light in

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.560 
camera performs better in low light in
the<00:05:44.800> image<00:05:45.070> stabilization<00:05:45.430> is<00:05:45.880> by<00:05:46.180> far<00:05:46.540> better

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
the image stabilization is by far better

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.720 
the image stabilization is by far better
than<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.080> galaxy<00:05:47.470> s3<00:05:47.620> I<00:05:48.070> mean<00:05:48.220> you<00:05:48.310> can<00:05:48.460> really

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
than the galaxy s3 I mean you can really

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.100 
than the galaxy s3 I mean you can really
be<00:05:48.910> shaking<00:05:49.330> and<00:05:49.510> the<00:05:49.570> image<00:05:49.780> stabilization

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
be shaking and the image stabilization

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.410 
be shaking and the image stabilization
is<00:05:50.620> so<00:05:50.830> good<00:05:51.070> that<00:05:51.220> you<00:05:51.460> won't<00:05:51.730> detect<00:05:52.000> any<00:05:52.270> of

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
is so good that you won't detect any of

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.880 
is so good that you won't detect any of
that<00:05:52.570> in<00:05:52.690> your<00:05:52.810> video<00:05:53.140> and<00:05:53.410> I<00:05:53.500> will<00:05:53.650> be<00:05:53.770> putting

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
that in your video and I will be putting

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.980 
that in your video and I will be putting
up<00:05:54.100> comparisons<00:05:54.670> very<00:05:54.910> soon<00:05:55.240> in<00:05:55.510> a<00:05:55.630> separate

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
say that the low-light and image

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.610 
say that the low-light and image
stabilization<00:06:01.060> on<00:06:01.450> the<00:06:01.570> iPhone<00:06:01.930> 5<00:06:02.110> is<00:06:02.380> better

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
than the s3 and I have noticed that the

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.300 
than the s3 and I have noticed that the
galaxy<00:06:04.720> has<00:06:04.840> three<00:06:05.050> colors<00:06:05.350> in<00:06:05.620> its<00:06:05.770> video<00:06:06.100> are

a<00:06:06.370> little<00:06:06.670> bit<00:06:06.880> more<00:06:06.910> realistic<00:06:07.570> than<00:06:07.690> the

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
a little bit more realistic than the

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.170 
a little bit more realistic than the
