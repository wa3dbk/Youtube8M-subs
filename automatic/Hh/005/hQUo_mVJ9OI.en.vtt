00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.569
 dear gmk joy my name silos and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.840
 today there is another unboxing and 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.010
 review video for the sennheiser momentum and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.630
 because that is not so pure now 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.179
 gaming headset is what I thought 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.699
 I dare to get out of it 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.119
 free game around the whole for you too 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.119
 test 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.180
 yes the same bed around stylish to the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.200
 Waving is I think you can do with it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.870
 really good in public 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.820
 I would like to have a look at the boxes 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.540
 but say come back to another 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.540
 table 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.829
 ok and there we have the good piece already 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.120
 lie back on the unboxing table 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.089
 I now have a variant of the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.920
 momentum with fabric upholstery and in brown 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.329
 In addition, there is still the vision 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.690
 that's too creamy and there are 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.430
 of course, a black edition 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.159
 basically all editions of 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.019
 shape and the same design tor resting 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.920
 headphones and if you want you can 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.340
 now also at the first 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.300
 Specifications already on break press 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.009
 I am always attentive 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.540
 become on this earphone after 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.300
 Foundation Warentest actually 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.320
 different headphones for such 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.759
 Things like the iphone ipod or other 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.640
 mp3 player has tested and the momentum 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.770
 because it was easy with the victors 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.590
 and for example headphones like the beats 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.880
 has beaten yes and not that you 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.920
 I think I have one here 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.690
 Dirty cardboard presents 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.310
 The whole thing has such a light vintage look 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.380
 similar to the headphones 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.179
 also very nice with the leather strap with 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.039
 sew on it and so it amazes 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.450
 actually not that at first 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.179
 Here, too, such a high quality 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.099
 tote bag comes to light and 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.140
 not just the headset in that 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.789
 Carton is yes we have one more here 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.280
 small user guide as it seems 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.170
 but I think the point I can 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.229
 also easy for you 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.789
 skip 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.429
 So let's have a look at them 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.170
 transportbox and dedicate ourselves to the headset 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.369
 itself and how the whole thing looks like 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.560
 Of course, I know you do that now 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.030
 already saw the first outdoor 10 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.520
 but I have such recordings 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.220
 are nevertheless somehow indispensable 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.180
 when it comes to an unboxing video and 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.060
 Here you can see pretty well 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.940
 there are just two cables with it 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.890
 one a pure audio cable to the other 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.540
 a cable something with an apple 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.970
 Remote therefore, so comes the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.060
 really on iphone and ipod or from 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.560
 I also designed ipad for 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.450
 Of course, one is from the beginning 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.310
 already two cables to have the one 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.330
 can swap and so optional microphone 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.160
 used or not 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.989
 on the other side is of course like that 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.819
 should also be easily made sure 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.769
 you can break a cable times 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.050
 you just exchange the whole thing 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.670
 with the fancy remote control itself 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.609
 here simply with its light pressure 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.140
 and can engage rotary motion 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.990
 in any case, for example, yours 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.060
 pick up calls 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.210
 the music playback control volume 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.860
 regulate and so on and so forth 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.450
 maybe that's how the detail shows 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.130
 Remote actually works best 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.380
 What this earphone is meant for 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.570
 is simply meant for mobile 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.610
 to be on the road and still not on 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.110
 Highest sound claims waive 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.270
 So it is now basically 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.590
 and headphones similar to the pc 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.240
 used or maybe not straight 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.130
 a home stereo system used 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.980
 but he is also so on the sound and of 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.620
 the playback actually really up 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.670
 mobile mp3 data is designed and 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.470
 maybe I'll say it, too 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.320
 easy on contemporary music so if 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.750
 Here you are with such bass-heavy stuff as 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.790
 hip hop house or even rock and stuff 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.860
 everything at the moment so through the charts 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.100
 where you hear then the headphones 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.050
 really cool with it over I 've got myself 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.880
 just in advance so very little bit 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.990
 times other test and critiques by 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.220
 read or is me again and again 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.530
 noticed that people have posted 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.910
 well for classical is not precise enough 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.980
 but let's be honest so my 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.510
 audience will hardly be classic now 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.330
 but maybe the new one will hear that 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.100
 slice of Kollegah and so is 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.170
 The thing just really cool 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.060
 that has such a fat deep bass and 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.590
 The thing is so mega around 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.660
 that you do not really anymore 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.460
 I want to take from the ears so have 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.230
 It really hard for me afterwards 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.390
 training for example while running again 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.560
 to switch to the ears because of the 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.710
 Sennheiser just such a nice 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.970
 Sound has processed so superhot 

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.920
 and the thing is just totally 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.910
 high quality and has faithful over 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.640
 Of course, a little bit too 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.770
 its price the basic variation like us 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.450
 you see here starts 250 euro 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.920
 and there are other variations 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.810
 with leather upholstery and so on and so on 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.370
 fort they can also like 100 times 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.680
 euro to be more expensive but for that you get 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.390
 really perfect materials and 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.700
 perfect workmanship and not 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.410
 some plastic headphones or something from 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.990
 a brand may just be 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.810
 trying to establish and yes maybe 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.460
 with an image scores but not 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.930
 just with quality and there is 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.200
 Sennheiser somehow quite another 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.670
 Ding this is a company there you can 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.230
 almost always be sure that 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.970
 you get that horny and me 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.680
 just have to confirm that the 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.780
 Foundation Warentest right here 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.880
 the part has decided on 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.919
 in any case, the absolute test winner 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.590
 when it comes to his iphone 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.600
 neatly back 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.160
 yes I hope the video has you a whole 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.510
 little bit entertain very small 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.050
 bit informed and of course 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.210
 like 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.220
 and if you are still in the near future 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.320
 another sennheiser video 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.480
 I'm interested in you then 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.020
 the sennheiser game one imagine that 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.270
 is not an open pc gaming headset what 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.490
 in the near future on my unboxing 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.020
 already unpacked until then 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.840
 I say only times thank you very for 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.200
 watch skin until the next video 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.200
 rips 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.310
 times
