00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.929
 today I'm going to talk to you about a 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.680
 new product to make loops 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.960
 easily so it's called corsica 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.059
 babyliss raid he looks a little 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.280
 weird like that but you'll see 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.440
 all is well all what does it 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.810
 will do this little secret corner 'see that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:25.289
 that in this ball you go to catch 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:27.029
 your hair and that like that so he 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.890
 take things and it sucks on its own 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.689
 the wick 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.030
 so you wait 7 months 10 seconds 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.829
 since I said 10 seconds and you 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.960
 are you going to see how is it 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.809
 do v of the loop and when you have 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.090
 the lively bibi 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.350
 you already have a lot of loops it's 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.899
 wrong or it's not always good 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.270
 you will tell me yes but that's it 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.649
 it blocks and where it is super well done 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.969
 I was on purpose to block myself 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.160
 hair I know I'm ready for 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.300
 crazy and well it stops all alone we go 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.899
 take this kind a lot too much 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.430
 hair here voila live and said no 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.470
 no but you feel you offer 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.260
 think ok if you block my share a little 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.700
 that's okay no yves bloch see so there 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.590
 there is no danger of losing after 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.540
 hair or to have a fire wick that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.080
 burn or anything as soon as there is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.420
 a problem 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.460
 the guy know it you see he says to himself 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.020
 how there is a blemish pro I stop I 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.650
 do not do anything I do not work in 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.380
 These conditions 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.780
 ok ah yes so I saw on others 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.299
 websites he test it and 10.1 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.470
 it sucks it does not work then you 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.119
 explains guys what you did 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.070
 that he does not actually advocate 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.820
 he was relied and when that was 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.409
 bugs 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.840
 instead of opening and releasing the wick 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.790
 they try to shut down and he continued the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.740
 name of the wick like that can necessarily 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.189
 lily is not just after but I 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.189
 see not be buckled 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.420
 and here I have done all my hair 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.610
 you see the curls are still 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.049
 simple enough to do if you see it 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.079
 are places that have not taken well 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.539
 we can just retouched on some 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.039
 areas like hyper practice what I like 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.360
 well that's when there is a problem a 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.440
 little show that is taken and where he 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.899
 stop right now 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.910
 kind where it's dangerous I do not want 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.069
 not kill the hair here he speaks to you in 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.160
 same time is what I like it is 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.480
 that there are several waves and curly 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.450
 possible ripples looping facts 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.040
 the averages you see these ways 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.959
 oppose even tighter or more 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.739
 loose to do a little bit between that yes 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.709
 heavy surfer and so it's babyliss 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.329
 six beautiful strings frankly so 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.579
 you like to make you goats and you 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.989
 have always struggled to make them 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:42.069
 and although it's a bit blurred as has 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.920
 broke the loop on the farm in play but 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.640
 upside down I disappear for nothing 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:52.630
 and flat and there you have a real thing 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.790
 a bit wild and all that thanks a 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.780
 little device and you're going to put a 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.540
 little bit of lacquer to make it fit 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.600
 all day and you will be manifest to 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.930
 and that's the loop and now ben to 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.930
 move
