00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.660
 on the subject of quadratic equations 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.120
 it will be a little overview again 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.719
 and a tip for smart guys why 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.760
 in the stx square equals - 1 is for 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.680
 then someday bills and 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.170
 opportunities to give solutions 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.600
 Of course everyone will say that now 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.230
 must be from a negative number i can 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.760
 but no roots pull because it 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 no number gives those with themselves 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.960
 square - 1 is but one first 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.600
 short overview again square 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.210
 Equations do not mean free 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.430
 quadratic equations because something with 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.989
 an equation there and it will be something 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.140
 two are not high three 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.260
 high four high 5 that will come too 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.190
 a simple story would be easy x2 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.170
 equal to 9 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.079
 I could just say that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.640
 I could also guess the 3 one 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.370
 solution is x1 and minus 362 because three 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.600
 three times is nine and minus three times - 3 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.990
 is also 9 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.970
 if I have something to tinker with now 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.890
 this page now here from me - 5 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.729
 then I can say that as a calculation step 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.020
 I take the -5 over plus 5 that counts 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.540
 not anymore then the ex square 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.350
 equal to 14 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.400
 I get the number in my head 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.170
 perhaps not as out why 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.240
 comes a step plus and minus 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.570
 the root of dots dot that 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.200
 what is here I am on this page 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.820
 Here is a lot to tinker then 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.650
 it does not want to be that easy there many 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.619
 still still pulling the root 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.530
 but that would be the case - just over 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.329
 everything on one side and then 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.829
 accordingly at this point there is yes 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.430
 several possibilities I also in 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.840
 the playlist paragraph of meta meta like 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.899
 also always spoken straight 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.899
 pq formula square addition and 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.869
 then just the story where you 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.299
 what must you be aware of 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.009
 specify 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.229
 what did you talk about because these 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.819
 story for example now 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.840
 have an equation like ex square +1 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.390
 equals zero 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.840
 then you would say okay that 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.690
 rake step who - 1 then I do 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.550
 only - the root 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.890
 here is a negative number is not 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.349
 because you probably only up to the 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.769
 Real numbers have come that is 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.769
 you have the pay ray here is 0 1 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.110
 2 3 and so on - 1 - 2 - 3 and so on 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:41.269
 continue talking about all things like 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.640
 natural numbers pay first whole numbers 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.209
 then the rational numbers of your final 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.470
 Pay the whole world of real numbers 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.880
 there are then the so-called 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.410
 I also have complex numbers for that 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.390
 a own playlist who is in favor 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.400
 interested then that was the good spirit 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.049
 he has certainly heard before 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.920
 carl friedrich gauss a big one 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.970
 then mathematician this real axis 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.569
 has extended to a so-called 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.879
 imaginary axis 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.459
 that is then the imaginary unit and 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:14.940
 because you just said there is only one 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.760
 something that does not satisfy this equation 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:23.880
 real number but an imaginary number that 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.430
 with himself square - 1 is only 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.440
 whoever thinks further that would be then 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.880
 the world of complex numbers 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.530
 playlist can daily times since 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.120
 otherwise you should be here with good 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.510
 get through with the other things 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.069
 which I sorted into the playlist 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.549
 though in which questions are simple 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.549
 send by
