now<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.729> take<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.240> rom<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:22.049> or

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
now if you just take the rom as is or

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.770 
now if you just take the rom as is or

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the iso as is the game as is and play

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.170 
the iso as is the game as is and play
and<00:01:25.110> put<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.670> game<00:01:26.909> will

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and put it on that the game will

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.609 
and put it on that the game will
automatically<00:01:27.869> override<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.369> setting<00:01:30.619> now

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
automatically override that setting now

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.700 
automatically override that setting now
obviously<00:01:32.430> that's<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:33.270> something<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.680> want

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
obviously that's not something we want

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.460 
obviously that's not something we want
because<00:01:35.540> it'll<00:01:36.540> automatically<00:01:37.020> revive

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
because it'll automatically revive

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.190 
because it'll automatically revive
override<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.490> DSP<00:01:39.119> ll<00:01:39.689> e<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.460> ll<00:01:42.210> e<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.720> what

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
override it to DSP ll e and ll e is what

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.179 
override it to DSP ll e and ll e is what
causes<00:01:43.500> these<00:01:44.220> issues<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.920> there<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.159> a

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
causes these issues so there is a

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.580 
causes these issues so there is a
workaround<00:01:47.670> however<00:01:49.250> here<00:01:50.540> if<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:52.020> navigate

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
workaround however here if you navigate

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.249 
workaround however here if you navigate
