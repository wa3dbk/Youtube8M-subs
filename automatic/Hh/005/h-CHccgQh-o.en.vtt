the bait you use and a few reasons why

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.750 
the bait you use and a few reasons why
yeah<00:00:16.279> well<00:00:16.760> I<00:00:17.300> use<00:00:18.020> I<00:00:18.440> don't<00:00:19.279> to<00:00:19.460> be<00:00:19.490> fair<00:00:19.730> I

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
yeah well I use I don't to be fair I

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.920 
yeah well I use I don't to be fair I
don't<00:00:19.910> really<00:00:20.390> you<00:00:20.539> I<00:00:20.570> know<00:00:20.810> obviously

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
don't really you I know obviously

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.019 
don't really you I know obviously
there's<00:00:21.320> a<00:00:21.410> massive<00:00:22.279> amount<00:00:22.490> of<00:00:22.580> cart<00:00:22.789> baits

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
there's a massive amount of cart baits

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.240 
there's a massive amount of cart baits
on<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:23.240> market<00:00:23.570> these<00:00:23.660> days<00:00:23.859> but<00:00:24.859> I<00:00:24.920> kind<00:00:25.189> of

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
on the market these days but I kind of

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.359 
on the market these days but I kind of
think<00:00:25.430> of<00:00:25.850> my<00:00:26.720> bait<00:00:26.980> almost<00:00:27.980> as<00:00:28.070> a<00:00:28.099> tool

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
think of my bait almost as a tool

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.330 
think of my bait almost as a tool
basically<00:00:28.730> just<00:00:29.390> to<00:00:29.480> do<00:00:29.599> a<00:00:29.630> certain<00:00:29.900> job<00:00:30.340> you

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
basically just to do a certain job you

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.760 
basically just to do a certain job you
know<00:00:31.460> I<00:00:31.490> think<00:00:31.670> it's<00:00:32.449> important<00:00:32.989> that<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.380> it's

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
know I think it's important that a it's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.110 
know I think it's important that a it's
a<00:00:33.950> really<00:00:34.190> good<00:00:34.280> quality<00:00:34.489> it's<00:00:34.969> higher

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
a really good quality it's higher

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.229 
a really good quality it's higher
quality<00:00:35.210> as<00:00:35.570> possible<00:00:35.630> yeah<00:00:36.260> and<00:00:36.860> be<00:00:37.370> as<00:00:38.000> fresh

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
quality as possible yeah and be as fresh

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.580 
quality as possible yeah and be as fresh
as<00:00:38.570> possible<00:00:38.750> as<00:00:39.320> well<00:00:39.700> so<00:00:40.700> I<00:00:41.120> use<00:00:41.559> basically<00:00:42.559> I

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
as possible as well so I use basically I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.190 
as possible as well so I use basically I
use<00:00:42.829> boilie<00:00:43.219> yep<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:43.940> use<00:00:44.750> a<00:00:44.809> couple<00:00:44.989> of<00:00:45.079> little

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
use boilie yep I use a couple of little

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.160 
use boilie yep I use a couple of little
bits<00:00:45.289> of<00:00:45.469> particle<00:00:45.920> but<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:47.300> majority<00:00:47.660> of<00:00:47.960> my

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
bits of particle but the majority of my

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.900 
bits of particle but the majority of my
approach<00:00:48.680> kind<00:00:48.920> of<00:00:49.070> centers<00:00:49.460> around<00:00:49.579> some

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
approach kind of centers around some

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.279 
approach kind of centers around some
fishing<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.180> same<00:00:50.239> waters<00:00:50.840> all<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.110> time

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
fishing the same waters all the time

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.950 
fishing the same waters all the time
yeah<00:00:51.680> I<00:00:51.829> kind<00:00:52.160> of<00:00:52.250> think<00:00:52.430> like<00:00:52.910> if<00:00:53.660> you're<00:00:53.809> just

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
yeah I kind of think like if you're just

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.990 
yeah I kind of think like if you're just
turning<00:00:54.140> up<00:00:54.379> with<00:00:54.770> you<00:00:55.070> know<00:00:55.190> some<00:00:55.699> pellets

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
turning up with you know some pellets

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.330 
turning up with you know some pellets
and<00:00:56.210> some<00:00:56.390> bright<00:00:56.570> pop-ups<00:00:57.020> I<00:00:57.230> was<00:00:58.100> kind<00:00:58.309> of

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
and some bright pop-ups I was kind of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.799 
and some bright pop-ups I was kind of
think<00:00:58.520> you're<00:00:58.609> at<00:00:58.730> square<00:00:59.000> one<00:00:59.030> every<00:00:59.660> time

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
think you're at square one every time

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.240 
think you're at square one every time
you<00:00:59.989> turn<00:01:00.170> up<00:01:00.350> yeah<00:01:00.649> you're<00:01:00.859> never<00:01:01.010> ever

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
you turn up yeah you're never ever

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.979 
you turn up yeah you're never ever
building<00:01:01.760> just<00:01:02.059> anything<00:01:02.300> something<00:01:02.780> yeah

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
building just anything something yeah

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.170 
building just anything something yeah
you<00:01:03.050> were<00:01:03.170> just<00:01:03.410> getting<00:01:03.649> a<00:01:03.710> bite<00:01:03.920> whereas<00:01:04.610> you

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
you were just getting a bite whereas you

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.640 
you were just getting a bite whereas you
know<00:01:05.210> I'm<00:01:05.479> kind<00:01:05.780> of<00:01:05.869> that<00:01:06.110> went<00:01:06.260> in<00:01:06.320> my<00:01:06.409> tea

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
know I'm kind of that went in my tea

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.450 
know I'm kind of that went in my tea
um<00:01:08.350> yeah<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:09.380> think<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:09.950> over<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.220> course<00:01:10.400> of

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
um yeah I think that over the course of

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.640 
um yeah I think that over the course of
a<00:01:10.549> season<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:11.210> know<00:01:11.420> put<00:01:11.630> in<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:11.810> food<00:01:12.350> source

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
a season you know put in a food source

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.039 
a season you know put in a food source
in<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.220> know<00:01:13.310> really<00:01:13.939> good<00:01:14.270> you<00:01:14.600> know<00:01:14.630> quality

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
in you know really good you know quality

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.289 
in you know really good you know quality
high<00:01:15.560> nutritional<00:01:16.040> value<00:01:16.100> boilie<00:01:16.700> your<00:01:17.119> kind

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
high nutritional value boilie your kind

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.429 
high nutritional value boilie your kind
of<00:01:17.330> each<00:01:17.450> session<00:01:17.720> you're<00:01:17.990> always<00:01:18.140> building

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
of each session you're always building

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.800 
of each session you're always building
on<00:01:18.950> your<00:01:19.100> approach<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:19.729> in<00:01:20.150> theory<00:01:20.390> things<00:01:20.689> are

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
on your approach so in theory things are

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.660 
on your approach so in theory things are
always<00:01:20.900> going<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.200> get<00:01:21.290> better<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:21.920> I'm<00:01:22.130> yeah

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
always going to get better so I'm yeah

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.060 
always going to get better so I'm yeah
bit<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:23.540> bait<00:01:23.720> guru<00:01:24.049> I<00:01:24.259> don't<00:01:24.770> think<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:24.979> that

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
bit of bait guru I don't think of that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.160 
bit of bait guru I don't think of that
that's<00:01:25.490> my<00:01:25.700> boy<00:01:25.850> Lee<00:01:26.030> yeah<00:01:26.509> we're<00:01:26.780> looking<00:01:26.869> it

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
that's my boy Lee yeah we're looking it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.410 
that's my boy Lee yeah we're looking it
looks<00:01:27.229> like<00:01:27.560> a<00:01:28.930> smells<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:31.210> tastes<00:01:32.210> like<00:01:32.299> a
