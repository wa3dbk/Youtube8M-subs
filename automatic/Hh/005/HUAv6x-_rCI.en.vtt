I<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.530> think<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> good

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I really think this is a good

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.740 
I really think this is a good
alternative<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.790> especially<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.390> mix<00:01:24.600> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
alternative is especially if you mix it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.230 
alternative is especially if you mix it
with<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.080> whoa<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.650> tinted<00:01:26.280> moisturizer<00:01:26.850> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
with like whoa like tinted moisturizer I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.780 
with like whoa like tinted moisturizer I
think<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.229> tends<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.770> lot<00:01:29.100> more<00:01:29.369> better

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
think this tends to be a lot more better

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.350 
think this tends to be a lot more better

definitely is buildable it's not full

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
definitely is buildable it's not full
coverage<00:03:07.260> like<00:03:07.800> if<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.070> really<00:03:08.400> have<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> lot

wouldn't<00:03:14.640> really<00:03:14.790> recommend<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.450> because

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
wouldn't really recommend this because

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.949 
wouldn't really recommend this because
you<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.770> really<00:03:16.950> still<00:03:17.459> see<00:03:17.820> like<00:03:18.510> your<00:03:18.660> scars

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
you can really still see like your scars

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.330 
you can really still see like your scars
or<00:03:19.230> anything<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.709> have<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.890> cover<00:03:20.130> up

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
or anything that you have to cover up

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.759 
or anything that you have to cover up
but<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.820> is<00:03:21.060> buildable<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.140> more<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.410> pack

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
but it is buildable so the more you pack

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.520 
but it is buildable so the more you pack
on<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.040> more<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.820> know<00:03:23.910> it'll<00:03:24.150> cover<00:03:24.330> so<00:03:25.260> but

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
on the more you know it'll cover so but

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.229 
on the more you know it'll cover so but
I<00:03:25.560> really<00:03:25.860> really<00:03:25.950> like<00:03:26.250> this<00:03:26.459> because<00:03:26.910> it

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
I really really like this because it

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.630 
I really really like this because it
really<00:03:27.269> looks<00:03:28.260> like<00:03:28.500> I'm<00:03:28.709> not<00:03:28.980> really<00:03:29.220> wearing
